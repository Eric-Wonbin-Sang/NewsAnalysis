Long way to go, lots of hard work to do, all those sorts of clich\u00e9s \u2013 but it\u2019s absolutely true.\u201d",

The public body also highlighted how five years of research into how best to market sport and activity specifically to women had improved participation levels. It found, for instance, that using photographs of women in the context of the activity rather than actually doing it was more effective in promoting it. So having women standing by their bikes or putting on their helmets in marketing material \u2013 as opposed to actually cycling \u2013 performed better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>A particular success story was a This Girl Can partnership with British Cycling for its \u201cBreeze\u201d events \u2013 offering free women-only rides across the country involving a cafe stop, allowing riders an opportunity to get active but also socialise.</p> <p>The partnership, which was started in June 2019, resulted in a 54% rise in registrations and a 20% growth in attendance compared with the same period in 2018. \u201cWe partnered with This Girl Can to encourage women of all ages and abilities to get on their bikes and rediscover the fun and freedom of cycling,\u201d said British Cycling\u2019s head of marketing, Laura Thomas.</p> <p>\u201cWorking together to create and deliver an engaging social media campaign, we were able to make use of the distinctive This Girl Can style while also learning from previous campaigns and tests, such as the best type of photography to use and motivations to focus on for less confident women.

The public body also highlighted how five years of research into how best to market sport and activity specifically to women had improved participation levels. It found, for instance, that using photographs of women in the context of the activity rather than actually doing it was more effective in promoting it. So having women standing by their bikes or putting on their helmets in marketing material \u2013 as opposed to actually cycling \u2013 performed better. A particular success story was a This Girl Can partnership with British Cycling for its \u201cBreeze\u201d events \u2013 offering free women-only rides across the country involving a cafe stop, allowing riders an opportunity to get active but also socialise. The partnership, which was started in June 2019, resulted in a 54% rise in registrations and a 20% growth in attendance compared with the same period in 2018. \u201cWe partnered with This Girl Can to encourage women of all ages and abilities to get on their bikes and rediscover the fun and freedom of cycling,\u201d said British Cycling\u2019s head of marketing, Laura Thomas. \u201cWorking together to create and deliver an engaging social media campaign, we were able to make use of the distinctive This Girl Can style while also learning from previous campaigns and tests, such as the best type of photography to use and motivations to focus on for less confident women. Their insights combined with ours helped us drive a higher proportion of less active women to our rides than our usual demographic.\u201d",

So this is not a plea for a return to 1997 or 2007. The times, the circumstances, the type of change needed are completely different. But Labour must get back the culture of winning. Because that doesn\u2019t change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/09/labour-leadership-clive-lewis-backs-federalism-and-says-scottish-labour-should-be-fully-independent-live-news\">Labour leadership: Thornberry gives Corbyn '0 out of 10' for election, but '10 out of 10' for principle - as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The proximate cause of defeat was not complicated or hard to see, but simple and in plain sight. We put forward a leader and a manifesto that voters thought unacceptable to such a degree that many were repelled. Too extreme economically. Anti-western. Lacking in patriotism. And therefore dangerous.</p> <p>No serious political party does such a thing. No serious political party, once it has done it, fails to rectify it. Even as the public settle into five years of Tory government, they are half listening to what is happening with the Labour party. The minimum they must hear is: we get that it was the rejection of a political position and not just a leader. If we can\u2019t go that far, we will have lost the next election within weeks of losing the last.</p> <p>The culture of winning has the following characteristics:</p> <p>Start with a ruthless, hard-headed analysis of political reality. Progressives win from the centre. We can decide that now or waste another four elections before we decide it later. But the centre does not mean the status quo. The confusion is the left\u2019s insistence that \u201cradical\u201d means traditional left policy, but just more of it; the alternative being a \u201cmoderate\u201d version, meaning less of it. The first is radical without being realistic; the second is realistic without being radical.</p> <p>Look around the western world. Take the major countries, with populations of more than 20 million. There\u2019s not one majority social democratic or socialist government. The nearest are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/justin-trudeau-cabinet-chrystia-freeland-national-unity-climate-crisis\" title=\"\">Trudeau</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/05/macron-was-great-hope-for-centrists-despite-his-struggles-all-is-not-lost\" title=\"\">Macron</a> and they\u2019re both centre-ground liberals as much as social democrats.</p> <p>The financial crisis did not move people to the traditional left. On cultural issues they moved right; and even on economics, in the USA, for example, the Democrats\u2019 biggest risk is advocating a programme that causes Middle America to re-elect Trump, despite Trump.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For many, our manifesto did not ignite hope, but fear. It was a vast wishlist. Free this, free that.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The challenge is to redefine \u201cradical\u201d, rise above populism of old left or right and fashion a new policy agenda, particularly mastery of a 21st-century technological revolution every bit as significant as the 19th-century Industrial Revolution; and building out from that to programmes of social justice and transformation, including on climate change and inequality. Radical only works if allied to understanding the future; and if driven from the centre, where practical solutions replace slogans.</p> <p>Second, progressive politics works best when in the name of changing the world, we don\u2019t promise the world. No one doubts Labour will spend money. The Tories can say they will spend billions and not an eyelid is batted. Because people will think they\u2019re reluctant to spend. But for us, they think our hearts are so soft that we will be chucking their money at everything. If, as the Tories \u201cend austerity\u201d, all Labour says is \u201cfaster and further\u201d, people will trust them to do it, not us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20952e6b625f400ac0a5c6cb2598fcbc1e002206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20952e6b625f400ac0a5c6cb2598fcbc1e002206/0_212_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Extinction Rebellion protest at Australia House in London on 10 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Extinction Rebellion protest at Australia House in London on 10 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many \u2013 though I agree not all \u2013 our manifesto did not ignite hope. It ignited fear. It was a vast wishlist. Free this, free that. Free tuition fees is not a policy. It is a giveaway. Working out how we ensure British universities \u2013 today a powerful engine of our economy, not just our education \u2013 retain their pre-eminent position, when other areas like early years education also demand funding, that is policy making.</p> <p>Third, parties that govern are not the same as protest movements. The latter put pressure on governments to govern differently. They have a place but the Labour party was not formed to be a pressure group, but to win and govern. That is why trade unions should be consulted over policy for public services; but they can\u2019t write the policy. Why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/07/save-the-planet-guide-fighting-climate-crisis-veganism-flying-earth-emergency-action\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> raises the profile of an important cause, but it doesn\u2019t have a realistic programme for a government. We should be passionate about the plight of those dependent on food banks and the homeless sleeping rough. But we should measure the sincerity of purpose by whether we\u2019re prepared to do what it takes to win, because only then can we do something about it; that means appealing to people not living on the breadline, as well as those who are.</p> <p>Fourth, make it easy for people to come over to you. One of the huge problems we had with Brexit was that at the crucial moment we needed to reach out across the party divide, our leadership was so sectarian that Lib Dems and soft Tories couldn\u2019t come to us. If someone voted Tory or Lib Dem at the election, they\u2019re not likely to want a socialist revolution at the next.</p> <p>Fifth, patriotism matters, but I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t get to define its basics.

      "bodyText": "The good news is that there are a range of talented candidates seeking the Labour leadership. But any new leader must recognise the depth of Labour\u2019s plight. And too much of the \u201creflection\u201d since the election has been a mix of the lamentable and the laughable. You should never go backwards in politics. So this is not a plea for a return to 1997 or 2007. The times, the circumstances, the type of change needed are completely different. But Labour must get back the culture of winning. Because that doesn\u2019t change. The proximate cause of defeat was not complicated or hard to see, but simple and in plain sight. We put forward a leader and a manifesto that voters thought unacceptable to such a degree that many were repelled. Too extreme economically. Anti-western. Lacking in patriotism. And therefore dangerous. No serious political party does such a thing. No serious political party, once it has done it, fails to rectify it. Even as the public settle into five years of Tory government, they are half listening to what is happening with the Labour party. The minimum they must hear is: we get that it was the rejection of a political position and not just a leader. If we can\u2019t go that far, we will have lost the next election within weeks of losing the last. The culture of winning has the following characteristics: Start with a ruthless, hard-headed analysis of political reality. Progressives win from the centre. We can decide that now or waste another four elections before we decide it later. But the centre does not mean the status quo. The confusion is the left\u2019s insistence that \u201cradical\u201d means traditional left policy, but just more of it; the alternative being a \u201cmoderate\u201d version, meaning less of it. The first is radical without being realistic; the second is realistic without being radical. Look around the western world. Take the major countries, with populations of more than 20 million. There\u2019s not one majority social democratic or socialist government. The nearest are Trudeau or Macron and they\u2019re both centre-ground liberals as much as social democrats. The financial crisis did not move people to the traditional left. On cultural issues they moved right; and even on economics, in the USA, for example, the Democrats\u2019 biggest risk is advocating a programme that causes Middle America to re-elect Trump, despite Trump. The challenge is to redefine \u201cradical\u201d, rise above populism of old left or right and fashion a new policy agenda, particularly mastery of a 21st-century technological revolution every bit as significant as the 19th-century Industrial Revolution; and building out from that to programmes of social justice and transformation, including on climate change and inequality. Radical only works if allied to understanding the future; and if driven from the centre, where practical solutions replace slogans. Second, progressive politics works best when in the name of changing the world, we don\u2019t promise the world. No one doubts Labour will spend money. The Tories can say they will spend billions and not an eyelid is batted. Because people will think they\u2019re reluctant to spend. But for us, they think our hearts are so soft that we will be chucking their money at everything. If, as the Tories \u201cend austerity\u201d, all Labour says is \u201cfaster and further\u201d, people will trust them to do it, not us. For many \u2013 though I agree not all \u2013 our manifesto did not ignite hope. It ignited fear. It was a vast wishlist. Free this, free that. Free tuition fees is not a policy. It is a giveaway. Working out how we ensure British universities \u2013 today a powerful engine of our economy, not just our education \u2013 retain their pre-eminent position, when other areas like early years education also demand funding, that is policy making. Third, parties that govern are not the same as protest movements. The latter put pressure on governments to govern differently. They have a place but the Labour party was not formed to be a pressure group, but to win and govern. That is why trade unions should be consulted over policy for public services; but they can\u2019t write the policy. Why Extinction Rebellion raises the profile of an important cause, but it doesn\u2019t have a realistic programme for a government. We should be passionate about the plight of those dependent on food banks and the homeless sleeping rough. But we should measure the sincerity of purpose by whether we\u2019re prepared to do what it takes to win, because only then can we do something about it; that means appealing to people not living on the breadline, as well as those who are. Fourth, make it easy for people to come over to you. One of the huge problems we had with Brexit was that at the crucial moment we needed to reach out across the party divide, our leadership was so sectarian that Lib Dems and soft Tories couldn\u2019t come to us. If someone voted Tory or Lib Dem at the election, they\u2019re not likely to want a socialist revolution at the next. Fifth, patriotism matters, but I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t get to define its basics. These are: pride in our country; support for the armed forces; being strong on law and order. The progressive view of patriotism will never be the same as the conservative one. We will add an emphasis on values of tolerance, equality and a commitment to social justice. But the basics can\u2019t be absent. Sixth, if we denounce our own government\u2019s record, don\u2019t be surprised if the people conclude we shouldn\u2019t be put back into power. The constant assertion by the Labour leadership that Britain\u2019s problems were the product of 40 years of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d, as if the policies of the Thatcher era were the same as the last Labour government, was a hideous combination of bad politics and worse history. Can you imagine the Tories making such an error? Finally, and above all, decide whether it\u2019s about them or about us, about the people or about making us feel good about ourselves. If it\u2019s about them, then winning is the top priority. That means a professional organisation, strategy, preparation, not deluding ourselves that belief in our own righteousness is enough. These things are obvious. The frustration is that it is necessary to say them. \u2022 Tony Blair is a former prime minister and founder and patron of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.",

While the Queen has been in Norfolk, Charles has been at Birkhall in Scotland, William at Kensington Palace, and Harry at Windsor. The meeting will be an opportunity for them to discuss proposals, drawn up after a series of consultations between palace officials and representatives of the UK and Canadian governments, for how Meghan and Harry can achieve their aim of carving out new \u201cprogressive\u201d roles as hybrid royals.

How close, asks Sky\u2019s Geoff Shreeves, were Spurs from getting something?</strong> \u201cYou know how close. And I think the guys in the studio also know how close. Very, very close. I have reasons to be sad with the result, but to be happy with what the boys did and tried to do. Yesterday we spent half an hour defending throw-ins, and lost the game defending a throw-in. And to top it off, the throw-in should be in our favour. So it\u2019s a bit frustrating. Unfortunately the assistant didn\u2019t see it. But I have only reasons to be proud of the boys. We have what we have, and we have to try to create a puzzle with what we have to compete against a good team like they are, and I think we deserve more from this game. We had lots of good chances to score. It is fantastic to compete against such a good team. I think Japhet Tanganga was very good, everyone at the club should be proud of him. That\u2019s Tottenham!\u201d He then gives Liverpool the mother of all back-handed compliments. \u201cThey are so so good and so so strong in every area. And on top of that, they are lucky. They were lucky. They could perfectly concede a goal, they could perfectly finish with ten, the VAR were having their tea and didn\u2019t watch Robertson for a red card.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1a26408f08c39722648ddb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T19:54:16.130Z\">7.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Here\u2019s Jurgen!</strong> \u201cThe result is the most important thing. There was one team that deserved to win and that was us. Away against Tottenham is pretty special. We had big chances but didn\u2019t score. We had situations that weren\u2019t even chances, for example Robbo on the touchline completely free with four in the box, and hitting the first defender. That should be a big chance. But it\u2019s difficult to come here. You can expect them to defend deep and they are really good at counter-attacking. I am fine. If it would be easy to win here, then more teams would do it. We should have scored more. We have to be honest to ourselves. A slightly longer break is good physically but it costs you rhythm. We can do better. I am really happy about the best start, but you don\u2019t get anything for it. I am only interested in what we can get in the summer, and that\u2019s not done yet, because this league is so strong and we face so many tough opponents. We have to be ready. The moment we have enough points that nobody can catch us any more, I will start talking about it. At the moment, I couldn\u2019t be less interested.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1a23b08f08c39722648dd2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T19:40:40.961Z\">7.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jordan Henderson has a chat with Jamie Redknapp on Sky. </strong>\u201cIn the end we made hard work of it. That can always happen when you fail to find the second goal. There is still a lot to improve on, things we can be better at. But Spurs are a good team with good players. A couple of times we were a little bit sloppy. But we moved the ball well and created some decent chances. Thankfully today we kept a clean sheet. We don\u2019t wanna ... we don\u2019t really think about what\u2019s happened. The next challenge is the next game.

Especially in the second half they pressed us and made things difficult.

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s your lot. David Hytner was our man in N17 tonight, and here\u2019s his verdict. Enjoy, enjoy. And thanks for reading this MBM, wherever you are. Nighty night! Jose\u2019s up. How close, asks Sky\u2019s Geoff Shreeves, were Spurs from getting something? \u201cYou know how close. And I think the guys in the studio also know how close. Very, very close. I have reasons to be sad with the result, but to be happy with what the boys did and tried to do. Yesterday we spent half an hour defending throw-ins, and lost the game defending a throw-in. And to top it off, the throw-in should be in our favour. So it\u2019s a bit frustrating. Unfortunately the assistant didn\u2019t see it. But I have only reasons to be proud of the boys. We have what we have, and we have to try to create a puzzle with what we have to compete against a good team like they are, and I think we deserve more from this game. We had lots of good chances to score. It is fantastic to compete against such a good team. I think Japhet Tanganga was very good, everyone at the club should be proud of him. That\u2019s Tottenham!\u201d He then gives Liverpool the mother of all back-handed compliments. \u201cThey are so so good and so so strong in every area. And on top of that, they are lucky. They were lucky. They could perfectly concede a goal, they could perfectly finish with ten, the VAR were having their tea and didn\u2019t watch Robertson for a red card.\u201d Here\u2019s Jurgen! \u201cThe result is the most important thing. There was one team that deserved to win and that was us. Away against Tottenham is pretty special. We had big chances but didn\u2019t score. We had situations that weren\u2019t even chances, for example Robbo on the touchline completely free with four in the box, and hitting the first defender. That should be a big chance. But it\u2019s difficult to come here. You can expect them to defend deep and they are really good at counter-attacking. I am fine. If it would be easy to win here, then more teams would do it. We should have scored more. We have to be honest to ourselves. A slightly longer break is good physically but it costs you rhythm. We can do better. I am really happy about the best start, but you don\u2019t get anything for it. I am only interested in what we can get in the summer, and that\u2019s not done yet, because this league is so strong and we face so many tough opponents. We have to be ready. The moment we have enough points that nobody can catch us any more, I will start talking about it. At the moment, I couldn\u2019t be less interested.\u201d Jordan Henderson has a chat with Jamie Redknapp on Sky. \u201cIn the end we made hard work of it. That can always happen when you fail to find the second goal. There is still a lot to improve on, things we can be better at. But Spurs are a good team with good players. A couple of times we were a little bit sloppy. But we moved the ball well and created some decent chances. Thankfully today we kept a clean sheet. We don\u2019t wanna ... we don\u2019t really think about what\u2019s happened. The next challenge is the next game. We have to keep working and see where that takes us come the end of the season.\u201d Virgil van Dijk speaks. \u201cWe want to analyse this game and do much better, especially in the second half. But three points is massive, especially here. The Champions League final must still hurt for them, and they want to bounce back. Any chance they get, they want to beat us. Especially in the second half they pressed us and made things difficult. [The best-ever start] gives us a good feeling, but you can see there is still room for improvement, especially in the second half. We have to look at the things we have to improve. That\u2019s the mentality we have. Obviously we are in a good situation, but there is still so much work we can do to make it easier at times.\u201d Spurs will be glad to see the back of Liverpool, having now lost their last five matches against the Reds. Next up in the Premier League, a trip to Watford, though before that there\u2019s an FA Cup replay at home to Middlesbrough to be negotiated. Liverpool meanwhile have some toughies coming up, at home to Manchester United, then away to Wolves and West Ham. They\u2019ll be pleased to have started a tricky sequence of fixtures with this (mainly) impressive win. That\u2019s a huge win for Liverpool. Correction: that\u2019s another huge win for Liverpool. They extend their lead at the top of the table - 16 points over Leicester with a game in hand - and stretch their unbeaten run to 38 league games in the process. They\u2019re 17 clear of third-placed Manchester City, having played the same number of games. The reigning champions play at Aston Villa tomorrow, and can leapfrog Leicester, cutting Liverpool\u2019s lead to 14, should they win. Spurs meanwhile are stuck in eighth place, nine points off Chelsea in the fourth Champions League spot. Son cuts in from the right, drops a shoulder, and takes a final shot for Spurs. Aiming for the top left, he can\u2019t get enough curl on the ball, and it\u2019s straight into Alisson\u2019s midriff. And that\u2019s that. Liverpool\u2019s lead at the top of the Premier League is now 16 points. That\u2019s 20 wins and one draw from 21 games, and it\u2019s the best start ever by a team in the English league! 90 min +2: Shaqiri comes on for Salah. Winks races down the right, but his deep cross is cleared easily enough by Alexander-Arnold. 90 min +1: Lamela makes like Origi up the other end and nearly finds space to shoot in the Liverpool box. Gomez toe-pokes the ball away from him. Alisson gathers. Gomez picks Lamela up, irritating the Spurs man, who threatens to kick off. He calms down soon enough. 90 min: Origi executes a crisp pullback on the edge of the Spurs box, but sends his subsequent shot straight at Gazzaniga. There will be three added minutes. 89 min: Lamela spins into a little space down the middle and takes a shot from 25 yards. He tries to thread it into the bottom right. It\u2019s an easy claim for Alisson. 88 min: Wijnaldum jigs in from the left, a lovely run. He enters the box and pulls back for Origi, who can\u2019t get the ball out from under his feet. Spurs clear. 87 min: Robertson leaves his boot in on Alderweireld, kicking the defender on the shin, but escapes censure. A bit naughty. 86 min: This game is suddenly a shapeless mess. Both sides have lost their tactical discipline. So anything could happen now. Stay tuned, won\u2019t you. 85 min: Lallana dribbles around in the midfield and draws a cheap foul from Lamela. He takes the opportunity to go over and roll around for a bit. Lamela isn\u2019t happy, but that was a foolish challenge, with the Liverpool midfielder going nowhere. 84 min: Firmino is bundled over as he races towards the Spurs box. A chance for Liverpool to calm things down a little, and perhaps cause the hosts a few problems. But Robertson\u2019s delivery is no good. Liverpool are a collective bag of nerves. 82 min: What a miss! Aurier, out on the right, curls a glorious low ball towards the far post. Lo Celso, six yards out and level with the left-hand post, creams a shot across Alisson and out for a goal kick. How on earth did he fail to hit the target from there? On the touchline, it\u2019s Jurgen Klopp\u2019s turn to go potty. 81 min: Mane is replaced by Origi. The Spurs crowd have found their voice; they know there\u2019s something in this, despite Liverpool\u2019s earlier dominance. Can they make the leaders regret their profligacy? 80 min: Liverpool are certainly giving up chances now. Lo Celso races off into acres down the right. He reaches the byline and pearls a cross along the corridor of uncertainty. Only Lamela tries to run it home, but misses. Liverpool get away with another one. 79 min: It\u2019s end to end now. Wijnaldum shapes to shoot on the edge of the Spurs D, but is legally bundled off the ball. Spurs go up the other end, Moura lining one up only to be denied by Lallana. The tension is palpable. 77 min: Liverpool\u2019s nerves are beginning to betray them. Alisson comes out of the box and passes the ball straight to Lo Celso. Happily for Liverpool, there\u2019s no easy way for the Spurs man to dispatch the ball towards the unguarded goal, crowded as he is. Liverpool get away with it. But this is very much not over. 76 min: Son makes good down the left and whips a cross through the Liverpool box. There\u2019s nobody in white to convert. Liverpool are beginning to make some sloppy mistakes, in the knowledge that they really should have put this game to bed. But it\u2019s still in the balance. 75 min: Tanganga is good to continue, for now at the very least. The game restarts with a drop ball. Liverpool, their concentration broken, make a big mistake. Passing it around the back, Wijnaldum is robbed by Moura, and the ball\u2019s shifted to Son, just inside the box on the left. Son leans back and lifts his shot over the bar. He should have worked Alisson at the very least. Really, he should have scored. On the touchline, Jose Mourinho holds his head accordingly. 73 min: Liverpool continue to pass it among themselves. The sequence is only brought to an end by Tanganga, who is down rubbing his leg. The play is stopped so he can get some treatment. 71 min: Liverpool stroke it around again. They\u2019ve controlled this match pretty much from the off, but there\u2019s still just one goal in it. Spurs retain hope. A big final 20 minutes coming up. 69 min: Spurs make a double change: Eriksen and Rose make way for Lamela and Lo Celso. Eriksen, the subject of much transfer speculation, receives the bird from his own fans as he departs. The home crowd are pretty sure his mind is elsewhere. 68 min: Spurs can\u2019t get anything going up front. Sanchez tries to split Liverpool\u2019s defence with a long pass down the middle, but there\u2019s nobody there in white, and the ball sails through to Alisson. The crowd groan. 66 min: Robertson overruns a ball out on the left. He\u2019s clumped by Tanganga as they contest a 50-50. Or did he clump Tanganga? He might have caught the young defender on the shin. The pair roll around in agony. Play continues, though, and Alexander-Arnold crosses from the right. Mane tries to guide a header back across Gazzaniga, towards the bottom right. The keeper does extremely well to stop it with a strong arm. Spurs clear the loose ball. 64 min: Liverpool take the heat out of things with more patient possession at the back. Suddenly they spring forward through Gomez and Wijnaldum. Mane then feeds Robertson down the left. He reaches the byline, but can\u2019t find anyone in the middle for a tap-in. The resulting corner isn\u2019t all that. 62 min: Gomez passes the ball straight out of play. He\u2019s been sloppy on several occasions this evening. On the touchline, his manager makes his feelings known in the colourful style, effing and jeffing with great passion. 61 min: Liverpool make the first change of the evening, replacing Oxlade-Chamberlain with Lallana. 60 min: Eriksen scoops a pass wide left for Son, who drops a shoulder to sail inside, past Alexander-Arnold and Oxlade-Chamberlain. His low shot is deflected wide right. The resulting corner is a non-event. But that\u2019s much better from Tottenham. 58 min: Firmino and Salah one-two down the middle, the latter releasing the former into the box with a cushioned flick. Firmino goes for a curler towards the top right. He doesn\u2019t catch it, and it\u2019s easy pickings for Gazzaniga. 57 min: A poor Gomez header drops to Alli, who zips towards the Liverpool box. Just as he\u2019s going to shoot, Van Dijk slides in, bravely seeing Alli\u2019s in the area. A clean tackle, though the ball breaks to Aurier to the right; the full back whips a shot straight down Alisson\u2019s throat. A reminder that this is far from over, no matter how dominant Liverpool have been since the restart. 55 min: Liverpool continue to knock it around. Moura drops deep and breaks up their passing groove, but Wijnaldum is quickly on the case, battling away in the centre circle to re-establish possession for the visitors. 53 min: Liverpool stroke it around the back in hypnotic style. They\u2019re in total control right now. 51 min: Alexander-Arnold cuts in from the right and loops towards the far post, where Firmino and Mane await. Gazzaniga does extremely well to anticipate the cross and claim. 50 min: Liverpool again over-elaborate, Salah breaking down the right, failing to work space to shoot, then failing to tee up Mane on the left. The ball is worked back to the right for Alexander-Arnold, whose bumbling shot bounces harmlessly across the face of goal and out for a goal kick. This game isn\u2019t over yet; they can\u2019t afford to start passing up chances. 49 min: Eriksen\u2019s delivery fails to beat the first man. That\u2019s awful, and it gives Liverpool a chance to break upfield. Eriksen is extremely relieved when Liverpool over-complicate matters and the counter-attack falls to pieces. 48 min: Moura is fouled again, this time by Mane. This time he goes down, and this is a free kick 35 yards out, right of centre. Spurs line up on the edge of the Liverpool box. 46 min: Moura zips into space down the inside right. He\u2019s clipped by Henderson, clumsily so, but stays on his feet and enters the box, because the situation is so promising. He then lashes his shot wide right, spurning it terribly. Spurs want the game pulled back for the free kick, but that\u2019s good refereeing by Martin Atkinson. It was a great chance for Spurs, and Moura clearly wanted to keep going. The second half is GO! Spurs get the ball rolling for the second half. No changes. Meanwhile in an email headed \u201cRichard Keys throw-in strop\u201d - you\u2019d click on it, too, wouldn\u2019t you? - Tony Barr writes: \u201cI\u2019m watching the game live in Dubai. Peter Reid and Andy Gray (two Evertonians) are currently doing a great job of patronising Richard Keys who\u2019s going apoplectic about the throw-in being awarded to Liverpool. I think he might explode if Liverpool win the league.\u201d Half-time reading. Ed Aarons was at the King Power to see Southampton goal machine Danny Ings pay back second-placed Leicester City for that result. On balance, a fair scoreline at the halfway point. Spurs have asked a few questions, but Liverpool carved out three golden chances. As things stand, the leaders are going 16 points clear at the top. But there\u2019s an awfully long way to go. 45 min +2: Van Dijk creams a pass down the left. Too hard. A little less juice, and he\u2019d have sent Robertson scampering clear on goal. As it is, it\u2019s a goal kick. 45 min +1: ... Moura heads harmlessly over from six yards. That was a great chance to flick home at the near post. 45 min: Alli spends Aurier into space down the right. He sends a deep cross towards Moura; Alexander-Arnold rises higher to knock the ball out for a corner on the left. From which ... 43 min: Firmino robs Alli and sends Salah off down the inside right. He enters the box, drops a shoulder to move inside, and whips a low shot wide right. Meanwhile there\u2019s a little controversy over the goal, as the throw that started the move should have been awarded to Spurs. Aurier and Mane had come together on the line, the former playing the ball against the latter. Not one that would have been easy to spot with the naked eye, to be fair to the match officials. 41 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain embarks on a mammoth dribble down the right. Spurs made that easy for him. He reaches the area and clips one inside for Mane, who can\u2019t bring it down on the penalty spot. Spurs clear. 40 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain is booked, hanging out a leg to stop Moura. He can have no complaints. 39 min: There\u2019s a VAR check for handball, when Henderson got involved, heading down towards Salah. But if the ball hit an arm, it was Alli\u2019s. The goal stands. A scrappy one, this. A throw from the left. Spurs don\u2019t clear it, Alderweireld failing to get much purchase on his header. Henderson heads down to Salah, on the penalty spot. Salah slips a pass wide left for Firmino, who drops a shoulder, takes a touch to the left to send Tanganga the wrong way, and slams home. 35 min: Salah and Firmino combine cutely down the left, the latter crossing for Mane who shapes like Zinedine Zidane in the 2002 Champions League final ... but only succeeds in sending his spectacular effort down into the ground, back up and over the bar. Gazzaniga had it covered completely, in any case. 34 min: Alexander-Arnold throws in from the right. Salah spins Rose and very nearly works space to shoot inside the box. He takes one touch too many, and when he eventually pulls the trigger, the chance has gone and it\u2019s an easy block for Sanchez. 32 min: Tanganga nicks the ball off Mane, who slyly falls into him from behind in the centre circle. A foul, though Mane is pretty lucky to avoid a yellow card. It looked a more cynical challenge than the one Gomez actually was booked for. 31 min: Spurs are beginning to cause Liverpool a few problems. They\u2019re pressing hard, and Liverpool are misplacing a few passes. It\u2019s a good contest. 30 min: Another Spurs long pass. Moura and Gomez come together as the pair battle for the high ball. Alisson comes miles out of his area to head clear. Spurs want a foul, and perhaps a second booking for Gomez, but they\u2019re getting neither. 29 min: Liverpool stroke it around the back in the late-Seventies style. Then Mane bursts down the left and attempts a one-two with Wijnaldum. The move breaks down on the edge of the box. 27 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain tries to release Salah down the right with a slide-rule pass, but his team-mate is clearly offside, and the flag goes up. 26 min: Son walks past a non-existent Alexander-Arnold challenge. But fair play to the Liverpool right-back, who recovers to reach Son and usher him away from the danger zone. A good duel in the making here. 24 min: Son goes off up the other end and is tumbled over from behind by Gomez, who is booked. From the resulting free kick, a corner on the right is earned by Alli. And from the set piece, Aurier nearly bustles free down the inside right, but Robertson eventually hacks clear. Not sure how this is still goalless; both teams have had their chances. 22 min: Mane works down the left again and earns a corner off Sanchez. From the corner, hit long, Salah finds Henderson, who dinks back towards the near post for Van Dijk, who must score. Van Dijk doesn\u2019t get any power on his header, allowing Gazzaniga to parry. I wonder if he\u2019d have been an armpit offside? It was borderline. Ridiculous, I know, but here we are. 21 min: Henderson is again caught napping on the ball, this time allowing Alli to zip towards the Liverpool goal. Alli lays off to Eriksen, who sends a pea-roller straight into the arms of Alisson. 20 min: Mane slips a pass down the inside left intended for Salah, who briefly threatens to control and break into the box. But Sanchez is on hand to shepherd him out of play for a goal kick. 19 min: Liverpool are enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession. Spurs are happy enough to sit back and play on the break. They\u2019re looking solid enough right now. Alexander-Arnold tries to tear past Rose down the right, but the Spurs left-back fends him off. 17 min: Liverpool pass it around awhile. Suddenly they spring down the left. Mane reaches the byline and crosses from a tight spot. Salah winds his neck back, but Sanchez anticipates well and clears just in time. 15 min: Robertson heads down the left in the hope of releasing Mane. The new African player of the year is offside, so he doesn\u2019t engage. Robertson chases after his own pass, reaches it, and backheels to eventually find Mane. The move then peters out, but that was distilled essence of Andrew Robertson. His relentless MO captured in amber. 13 min: Spurs are making changes when they go long. Alli chases one down the middle He tries to chest down. Alexander-Arnold kicks the ball up onto his hand. Alli aims for the top right but sends his shot sailing miles over. Had it nestled into the net, chances are that\u2019d have been ruled out for hands. As it is, we simply play on. 12 min: Wijnaldum sends Robertson into acres of space down the left. Real danger for Spurs, so they\u2019re relieved when Robertson clumps an uncharacteristically witless ball through the box at great speed, and out for a throw on the other side. Those in the middle had no hope. 10 min: Salah swings a ball in from the right and nearly finds Mane. Just a bit too much on it, and that\u2019s Gazzaniga\u2019s. Then Robertson whips one in from the left, but can\u2019t find Firmino in the middle. Spurs are holding their shape well. 9 min: Alexander-Arnold scoops a surprise dead ball into the Spurs box, hoping to find Salah. Too clever by half, and easily cleared by Spurs. 8 min: Mane threatens to burst past Tanganga and off down the inside-left channel. The debutant is forced to bowl his opponent to the ground. A free kick the best part of 30 yards out. 7 min: It\u2019s high-octane stuff in these early stages. Both teams snapping into tackles, closing down space, pinging it around at double speed. Son strips Henderson of possession and steams down the inside left. He cuts infield and curls harmlessly wide right from 20 yards. He had Moura in close attendance; he might have done better to slip a pass to him, releasing him into the area. 5 min: Gomez\u2019s misjudgement allows Moura to scamper down the left. He cuts inside before dragging a shot wide left. Alisson had it covered. Spurs have already caused the leaders a couple of problems at the back. 4 min: That\u2019ll fill the new boy with confidence. Less than a couple of minutes into his top-flight career, and he\u2019s already made a goal-saving block from a Brazil international. Not a bad way to announce yourself. Liverpool will wonder how they\u2019re not leading, though. 2 min: Gazzaniga launches long. Moura nearly gets the better of Gomez, but the loose ball breaks to Alli, who wins the first corner of the match down the left. Liverpool take a while to clear the set piece, but are soon tearing upfield on the break. Firmino gets in behind Eriksen down the inside right. He enters the box and curls for the bottom left. Gazzaniga is beaten ... but Tanganga slides in to block! What a start to his Premier League career! The ball breaks to Oxlade-Chamberlain, who should score but hits the post and allows the keeper to snaffle. We\u2019re off! Liverpool get the ball rolling. A huge roar of expectation rings around the shiny new bowl. This place provides such a spectacle. Gomez launches it long, and Tanganga gets his first touch as a Premier League player, heading the ball back upfield. The teams are out and about! Tottenham wear their famous lilywhite, while Liverpool\u2019s men are able to sport their titular red. A classic, old-school, first-choice aesthetic, and a fantastic atmosphere at this wonderful stadium. \u201cJust to say that yes, the away dressing room is smaller, but it\u2019s still bigger than my flat,\u201d sighs David Grey. \u201cEnvious.\u201d That\u2019s London real estate for you. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes. Jurgen Klopp, in a serious mood, speaks: \u201cThey play with five at the back from time to time, so I am not surprised. We have tried to prepare. [Spurs] can do anything. You can play football with this team: Aurier and Rose are proper wingers, they have two top strikers with Moura and Heung-min, and their midfield is football as well. It is not always possible [to impose our game on them] because they are too good for that. But if it is possible, we should try that.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Jose Mourinho has sprung a 20-year-old surprise in defence against a title-chasing Liverpool side. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Tomas Kalas. Jose Mourinho speaks! \u201cTanganga is a good kid, working hard for years. He\u2019s had a good preseason. We watched and analysed. He\u2019s worked hard to have a chance, and this is Tottenham, it\u2019s a good chance for him. He\u2019s fast, he\u2019s very fast, we need fast people when you play against Salah and Mane. We need speed. We lose in experience, but he\u2019s fast. We don\u2019t have Harry Kane, we don\u2019t have another player similar to him. We don\u2019t have another player similar to Sissoko.\u201d Do you have enough to win this game? \u201cYeah.\u201d A peek inside the palatial dressing rooms at the glorious new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. First to the home side\u2019s quarters, where debutant Japhet Tanganga\u2019s shirt hangs alongside some more illustrious names. The away changing room is a wee bit more basic. As you\u2019d expect. A pre-match boost for title-chasing Liverpool. Their nearest challengers, second-placed Leicester City, have been beaten 2-1 at home by Southampton. Some turnaround from that 9-0 shellacking in October. What a job Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl is doing, and hats off to the Saints board for not jerking the knee in the wake of that record-equalling defeat. Hats off also to matchwinner Danny Ings, who has scored yet again, and in the process done his former club a big favour. Liverpool are now 13 points clear with, for the moment, two games in hand on the Foxes. The big news for Tottenham: a Premier League debut for 20-year-old defender Japhet Tanganga. He\u2019s one of five changes to the team that lost at Southampton on New Year\u2019s Day. Danny Rose, Son Heung-min, Harry Winks and Davison Sanchez come in; Ryan Sessegnon and Jan Vertonghen drop to the bench, while Moussa Sissoko, Tanguy NDombele and the hamstrung Harry Kane are out altogether. Liverpool make one change to the XI that saw off Sheffield United. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replaces the injured James Milner. On the bench, and back from injury: Xherdan Shaqiri. Alongside him, hoping to make his Premier League debut: Takumi Minamino. Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Tanganga, Aurier, Winks, Eriksen, Rose, Lucas Moura, Alli, Son. Subs: Vertonghen, Lamela, Vorm, Dier, Lo Celso, Sessegnon, Skipp. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Adrian, Minamino, Lallana, Shaqiri, Origi, Phillips, Williams. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire). A picture paints a thousand words ... And if you\u2019ve been thinking about it, you can be damn sure he is. Kick off is at 5.30pm. It\u2019s on!",

Liverpool have now gone 38 league matches without defeat \u2013 the equivalent of an entire season \u2013 and their return of 61 points from a possible 63 since the beginning of this one represents the best ever start to a campaign by any club in any of Europe\u2019s top five divisions. They are a whopping 16 points clear at the top of the table \u2013 with a game in hand on second-placed Leicester.</p> \n<p>Tottenham pushed them all the way and it might have been a different story had Son Heung-min or the substitute Giovani Lo Celso not fluffed their lines when wonderfully placed in the closing stages. The Lo Celso chance led Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to sink to his knees in disbelief. How had the midfielder missed the target when he had so much of it to aim for from Serge Aurier\u2019s cross?</p> \n<p>Spurs had entered the game in poor form and with a clutch of debilitating injuries, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/09/harry-kane-needs-surgery-out-until-april-tottenham-hamstring-euro-2020\" title=\"\">the high-profile one to Harry Kane</a>. They tried everything in tactical terms, they gave everything on a physical level and Mourinho was on solid ground when he argued that his team deserved something.

They are coming to look invincible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a1f9572e-2f00-493c-80ab-deab818caac1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L2-T5D40OJA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Firmino\u2019s goal stemmed from the award of a controversial throw-in on the left flank, about which Mourinho was not slow to complain, but the Spurs manager did acknowledge that his players had to do more to defend it, particularly as they had practised doing so all week. Jordan Henderson threw himself at the ball \u2013 VAR would confirm that he did not use his hand \u2013 and, when Mohamed Salah found Firmino, the striker did the rest. He allowed the ball to run across his body to deceive the 20-year-old Spurs league debutant, Japhet Tanganga, who had lunged in, before setting up the left-foot finish in the same explosive movement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/11/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Southampton erase memories of 9-0 thrashing as Ings seals comeback win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Klopp felt Liverpool ought to have been out of sight at the interval, with Virgil van Dijk heading too close to Paulo Gazzaniga midway through the first half and Salah driving wide at the end of it.</p> \n<p>The visitors would have been ahead in the second minute but for a remarkable double goalline clearance from Tanganga. First he blocked from Firmino, after the irrepressible striker had chopped inside Christian Eriksen and shot, and then he somehow deflected Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s follow-up on to the far post. Gazzaniga collapsed on to the loose ball.</p> \n<p>Tanganga, a centre-half by trade, had played only once previously \u2013 at Colchester in the Carabao Cup exit \u2013 and Mourinho started him at right-back before switching him to left-back midway through the second half. He was up against first Sadio Man\u00e9 and then Salah, which added up to the ultimate baptism. He acquitted himself well.

      "bodyText": "For J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Liverpool, the victories keep on coming, the records tumbling and it is becoming increasingly difficult to see their progress towards a first league title in 30 years as anything other than a foregone conclusion. Roberto Firmino made the difference on an occasion marked by dramatic plotlines, with the Brazilian\u2019s goal towards the end of a first half that Liverpool controlled following a moment when his mind and body were in glorious high-speed sync. A few numbers. Liverpool have now gone 38 league matches without defeat \u2013 the equivalent of an entire season \u2013 and their return of 61 points from a possible 63 since the beginning of this one represents the best ever start to a campaign by any club in any of Europe\u2019s top five divisions. They are a whopping 16 points clear at the top of the table \u2013 with a game in hand on second-placed Leicester. Tottenham pushed them all the way and it might have been a different story had Son Heung-min or the substitute Giovani Lo Celso not fluffed their lines when wonderfully placed in the closing stages. The Lo Celso chance led Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to sink to his knees in disbelief. How had the midfielder missed the target when he had so much of it to aim for from Serge Aurier\u2019s cross? Spurs had entered the game in poor form and with a clutch of debilitating injuries, including the high-profile one to Harry Kane. They tried everything in tactical terms, they gave everything on a physical level and Mourinho was on solid ground when he argued that his team deserved something. Yet Liverpool have simply forgotten how to not win. They are coming to look invincible. Firmino\u2019s goal stemmed from the award of a controversial throw-in on the left flank, about which Mourinho was not slow to complain, but the Spurs manager did acknowledge that his players had to do more to defend it, particularly as they had practised doing so all week. Jordan Henderson threw himself at the ball \u2013 VAR would confirm that he did not use his hand \u2013 and, when Mohamed Salah found Firmino, the striker did the rest. He allowed the ball to run across his body to deceive the 20-year-old Spurs league debutant, Japhet Tanganga, who had lunged in, before setting up the left-foot finish in the same explosive movement. Klopp felt Liverpool ought to have been out of sight at the interval, with Virgil van Dijk heading too close to Paulo Gazzaniga midway through the first half and Salah driving wide at the end of it. The visitors would have been ahead in the second minute but for a remarkable double goalline clearance from Tanganga. First he blocked from Firmino, after the irrepressible striker had chopped inside Christian Eriksen and shot, and then he somehow deflected Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s follow-up on to the far post. Gazzaniga collapsed on to the loose ball. Tanganga, a centre-half by trade, had played only once previously \u2013 at Colchester in the Carabao Cup exit \u2013 and Mourinho started him at right-back before switching him to left-back midway through the second half. He was up against first Sadio Man\u00e9 and then Salah, which added up to the ultimate baptism. He acquitted himself well. Mourinho argued that Andy Robertson should have been sent off for clattering into Tanganga on 66 minutes, but it was hard to discern any malice. Mourinho set up in a 4-4-1-1 formation with Aurier on the right of midfield, frequently pushed high to engage Robertson, Son on the left and Dele Alli roaming behind Lucas Moura. Mourinho wanted his players to remain compact so as not to allow Liverpool to unleash their pace in behind and, with the visitors hogging possession and ever eager to step on to the front foot, Spurs felt there was scope for them to counter. Son and Alli had a couple of early openings. But this Liverpool team are so quick and cohesive, so remorseless with their pressing, that it is one thing to ask them questions and quite another to call the tune. Spurs were much better in the second half, with Moura trying his jinks and flicks, and Alli carrying the fight. Moura shot wildly, Aurier banged straight at Alisson and Son saw a shot deflect wide. Liverpool had their moments, too, with the best one being a Man\u00e9 header that drew a smart save out of Gazzaniga. Mourinho twisted again, swapping Danny Rose and Eriksen for \u00c9rik Lamela and Lo Celso and recalibrating to 4-1-4-1. Eriksen, who has been linked with a move away this month, had been poor and heard boos upon his removal. Lamela and Lo Celso made a difference and finally Spurs created the gilt-edged chances. Son, though, blazed high after Moura\u2019s lay-off and, when Lo Celso could not finish, Liverpool were on their way to a sixth consecutive clean sheet in the league. They cannot be breached or stopped.",

But we can never see the future clearly. The one certainty I have is that I will continue to practice regenerative agriculture. My goal is to move towards self-sufficiency in my food sources. It is how I can ensure I have access to exactly what I want to eat and serve. Growing food is also addictive, challenging (especially now when it is incredibly dry) and highly fulfilling. Choosing varieties that match the climate is key for successful growing. But on our subtropical farm, where the weather can veer temperate or tropical depending on the season, we have been able to grow almost anything. So I try almost everything. The blue butterfly pea is one of these experiments. It\u2019s a crop I\u2019d grown in Sydney, where it thrived during the summer, but even in the mildest winter it would die without fail, with no hope for resurrection. The seeds went in three years ago here in Arakwal country. The vines continue to flourish and the flowers loom larger and larger with each new flush as the plant matures. Clitoria ternatea is glorious, with an appearance that lives up to its Latin name. The flowers of this leguminous plant have long been used in cooking and Ayurvedic medicine, all throughout south-east Asia and the Middle East. Proponents of its medicinal powers claim it can give you better vision and blood circulation, improve your mood, increase your sex drive and even make you think more clearly. It can certainly amuse your kids endlessly with its natural blue food colouring. Growing up, in Thai culinary culture, I didn\u2019t care about its nutritional qualities.

Infusing the flowers in cold water or making it a tea with other aromatic herbs like lemongrass and pandan is an easy way to drink it. Traditionally, the flowers have been used to colour rice, tapioca and flours, but I have been seeing it pop up in lattes, muffins and used in other creative ways.

Accompanying these laughable mistruths, though, are more dangerous distortions. They are the ones being used to deflect from climate change\u2019s role in creating longer, more severe fire seasons. Two pieces of disinformation stand out from the rest: that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush. Disinformation has spread across social media, finding its way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones. Esteemed climate change expert professor Will Steffen, a member of Australia\u2019s Climate Council and the inaugural director of Australian National University\u2019s Climate Change Institute, is concerned at how disinformation has spread with such ease. \u201cIn my mind, I think it\u2019s a serious issue and it is potentially very dangerous,\u201d Steffen told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s because the bushfire situation is very dangerous \u2026 the evidence is overwhelming that climate change is playing a prominent role in worsening bushfire conditions across Australia. \u201cPeople who are for whatever reason trying to put out false or extremely misleading information are actually doing a huge disservice to the risk to human life in the future, the risk to property, the risk to the natural world, and indeed the risk to economy.\u201d Digital rights experts say the disinformation is yet more evidence that social media platforms are failing in their duty to act responsibly. \u201cWe need to see social media platforms playing a greater role in responding to the disinformation being shared on their platforms about the bushfires,\u201d Digital Rights Watch chair Tim Singleton Norton said. \u201cThis needs to happen in tandem with effective government oversight, transparency, and accountability measures, as well as public education campaigns that give people the tools to identify misinformation.\u201d There are nuggets of truth in some of the disinformation.

      "bodyText": "We are closing this liveblog now. Here\u2019s a summary of what has happened today and you can read the latest story from our Turkey and Middle East correspondent Bethan McKernan here. Iran has admitted that its military unintentionally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner as it flew from its capital, killing all 176 people onboard, after days of rejecting western intelligence claims that it had been hit by an Iranian surface to air missile. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, tweeted his apologies for circulating misleading statements. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has demanded that Iran punish those responsible for the downing of the airliner, as well as pay compensation and apologise. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards accepted responsibility for shooting down UIA 752. Boris Johnson has called Iran\u2019s admission it shot down a passenger plane by mistake an \u201cimportant first step\u201d. Catch up on news and analysis of the disaster: Iran admits unintentionally shooting down Ukrainian airliner Iran plane crash admission triggers international calls for full investigation Iran plane crash admission sparks unrest in Tehran Iranian President Hassan Rouhani promised further investigation into the downing of an Ukrainian passenger plane during a phone conversation with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday, state news agency IRNA reported. \u201cIran welcomes any international cooperation in the framework of international regulations to shed more light on the incident,\u201d Rouhani said, promising further investigation into the crash that Tehran said was caused by its air defences \u201cunintentionally\u201d. Iran and Canada cut diplomatic ties in 2012. In related news, German chancellor Angela Merkel repeated a call for all parties to respect the Iranian nuclear accord, despite Iran\u2019s decision to intensify its enrichment of uranium and moves by the United States to impose economic sanctions, PA reports. Under a deal brokered in 2015, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to restrict its nuclear program. Merkel said: \u201cWe agreed that we should do anything to preserve the deal, the JCPOA. Germany is convinced that Iran should not acquire or have nuclear weapons,\u201d Merkel said during a joint press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Saturday. \u201cFor this reason we will continue to employ all diplomatic means to keep this agreement alive, which is certainly not perfect but it is an agreement and it comprises commitments by all sides.\u201d Unlike the US, which on Friday imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, the Europeans have given Tehran more time to avoid nuclear proliferation rather than begin a process that could lead to a reimposition of UN sanctions. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau is due to speak shortly, his third press conference since the plane was shot down on Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, Canadian officials have expressed frustration over an inability to access the crash site\u2014 despite an invitation from Iranian officials to do so. Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters Friday evening that only two of the 10 members of the delegation had been granted visas for travel to Iran while they waited in Turkey. Two officials from Canada\u2019s transportation safety board are also waiting for proper documentation. In Canada, there have been calls from the Iranian Canadian community for those responsible for downing the aircraft to be held accountable. Payman Parseyan, former president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton, has tweeted an emotional statement following Iran\u2019s admission it brought down the plane. He said: \u201cThere are no winners in this story and only communities left devastated. Iran\u2019s government has yet to be held accountable and answer for this tragedy that took the lives of some [of] our brightest, our friends, neighbours and fellow Canadian[s].\u201d Meanwhile the Iranian Canadian congress said in a statement following the news, reiterating calls for a thorough investigation. \u201cThose who have committed this crime of shooting down a passenger airplane and those who have been responsible in releasing false information must be held accountable. \u201cThe families of the victims of this horrible tragedy must be supported in any way deemed appropriate and desired by the families, including through restitution.\u201d Reuters is reporting that Iran\u2019s Fars news agency has published a report on the protests in Tehran, which have sprung up following the admission that the passenger plane was shot down. This is unusual as the agency, which is widely seen as close to the the powerful Revolutionary Guards, rarely reports on anti-government unrest. The report said protesters were chanting slogans against the nation\u2019s top authorities and that demonstrators on the street had also ripped up pictures of Qassem Soleimani, the prominent commander of the Guard\u2019s Quds Force who was killed in a US drone strike. The agency carried pictures of the gathering and a torn banner of Soleimani. It said the protesters numbered about 700 to 1,000 people. Iran\u2019s civil aviation authority has said that Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752 did not veer off its normal course before an anti-aircraft battery launched a missile at it. The latest admission over the downing of the flight with the loss of 176 passengers comes after UIA\u2019s president and vice-president reacted angrily to what they saw as hints by the Iranian authorities that their crew was in some way to blame for the incident. Protesters in Tehran are demanding the resignation of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to a Reuters report that offers some context to the footage in tweets embedded in an earlier post. \u201cCommander-in-chief [Khamenei] resign, resign,\u201d the videos showed hundreds of people chanting in front of Tehran\u2019s Amirkabir University. Reuters said it could not verify the authenticity of the video footage. The Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office has said it is investigating possible wilfil killing and aircraft destruction in its probe of the crash of a Ukrainian airliner in Iran, Reuters reports. As Iranians protest over their government\u2019s mishandling of the downing of Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752, in London Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn has addressed hundreds marching against the prospect of war with Iran. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), which co-organised the demonstration with the Stop the War Coalition, is carrying photos of the protest on its Twitter feed. Following on from the previous report about domestic reaction to the Iranian mea culpa, reports are emerging on Twitter of protests in the street in Tehran over the government\u2019s handling of the fiasco. Reuters has some domestic Iranian reaction to Iranian government admitting its forces shot down the Ukrainian airliner just outside of Tehran, with many in the country angry at what appears to be incompetence and dishonesty by their leaders. Expressions of condolence over the incident from Supreme Leader and President Hassan Rouhani failed to calm angry Iranians, who used social media to express their outrage against the establishment for concealing the truth. \u201cIt is a national tragedy. The way it was handled and it was announced by the authorities was even more tragic,\u201d said Ali Ansari, a moderate cleric, according to Iran\u2019s semi-official ILNA news agency. Many Iranians asked why authorities did not close down Tehran\u2019s airport and the country\u2019s airspace at a time when they would have been on alert for retaliation after the missile strikes. There were no fatalities in those strikes, launched to avenge the US killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. \u201cThey were so careful not to kill any American in their revenge for Soleimani. But they did not close the airport? This shows how much this regime cares for Iranians,\u201d said Mira Sedaghati in Tehran by telephone. An Iranian military statement carried by state media said the Ukrainian plane, which was headed for Kiev, was mistaken for a \u201chostile target\u201d after it turned toward a sensitive military base of the elite Revolutionary Guards near Tehran, adding that it was a \u201chuman error and unintentional\u201d. \u201cUnintentionally? What does it mean? They concealed this huge tragic news for days just to mourn for Soleimani. Shame on you,\u201d said Reza Ghadyani, in Tabriz city. The country held three days of funeral processions for Soleimani, who was head of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 overseas Quds Force and a national hero. Hundreds of thousands of people participated across the country. Some Iranians called for resignation of officials, dismissing their apologies. \u201cYou took your revenge from Iranians,\u201d tweeted Ahmad Batebi on his @radiojibi Twitter account, in response to Rouhani\u2019s tweet saying that \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake\u201d. \u201cOnly resignation,\u201d tweeted Sadeq on his @sadeq1367 account In a Twitter message on Saturday, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif cast some of the blame for the plane disaster on what he called U.S. adventurism. \u201cIt\u2019s the end line Mr. Minister! You ruined everything!,\u201d responded Bita Razaqi on @bitarazaqi. Boris Johnson has called Iran\u2019s admission it shot down a passenger plane by mistake an \u201cimportant first step\u201d and said it \u201creinforces the importance of de-escalating tensions in the region\u201d. In a statement, the prime minister said: Iran\u2019s admission that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by mistake by its own armed forces is an important first step. This will be an incredibly difficult time for all those families who lost loved ones in such tragic circumstances. We will do everything we can to support the families of the four British victims and ensure they get the answers and closure they deserve. We now need a comprehensive, transparent and independent international investigation and the repatriation of those who died. The UK will work closely with Canada, Ukraine and our other international partners affected by this accident to ensure this happens. This tragic accident only reinforces the importance of de-escalating tensions in the region. We can all see very clearly that further conflict will only lead to more loss and tragedy. It is vital that all leaders now pursue a diplomatic way forward. A video is circulating on Twitter that purports to show the moment that the surface to air missile that downed UIA flight 752 was launched by Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Reuters is now running more detail on the comments by Ukraine International Airlines\u2019 president and vice-president at the press conference they took earlier this afternoon, where they denied suggestions that their crew were in some way responsible for the downing of the jet. Ukraine International Airlines said on Saturday that its plane that crashed in Iran this week had received no warning from Tehran airport about a possible threat to its safety before it took off en route for Kiev. At a briefing by its president and vice-president, the airline also denied the aircraft veered off its normal course after an Iranian military statement said the plane flew close to a sensitive military site of the elite Revolutionary Guards. The airline officials bristled at what they said were hints from Iran that the crew had not acted properly. Iran said earlier that its military mistakenly shot down the plane, saying air defences were fired in error while on high alert in the tense aftermath of Iranian missile strikes on US targets in Iraq. All 176 people onboard were killed. The airline officials called on Iran to take full responsibility for the crash and said the Iranian authorities should have closed the airport. \u201cIf you play at war, you play as much as you want, but there are normal people around who you had to protect,\u201d Vice-president Ihor Sosnovsky said. \u201cIf they are shooting from somewhere to somewhere, they were obliged to close the airport. Obliged. And then shoot as much as you want.\u201d He added that the plane had turned 15 degrees to the right after it had reached 6,000 feet, in accordance with the instructions of the airport dispatcher. Yevhenii Dykhne, the president and chief executive of the airline, made an emotional opening statement to reporters saying the airline had not done anything wrong in terms of following security procedures. \u201cAt the time of departure from ([Kyiv\u2019s] Boryspil airport, the airline had no information about possible threats,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time of departure from Tehran airport, it was exactly the same.\u201d The airline said Tehran airport was operating normally at the time its aircraft took off. Asked why there had been a delay in take-off, Dykhne said the captain had decided to offload some luggage because the plane was too heavily loaded. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has spoken to Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, about the investigation into the downing of the aircraft, a statement from the Ukrainian president\u2019s office said. The presidents have agreed to ask French specialists to decode the plane\u2019s black box. Macron said the formal procedure to launch the international investigation had been started and he would visit Kiev. The relatively quick admission by Iran that Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 was shot down by mistake has drawn comparisons with how Russia handled the MH17 case. Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine by a Buk surface-to-air missile on 17 July 2014. Russia has always denied it played any role in the tragedy, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Nick Waters, an investigator for Bellingcat, an independent investigative website that has been investigating the MH17 crash, has tweeted to say it had been preparing for a similar scenario to play out again with Iran denying involvement. Protesters were due to be gathering outside the BBC\u2019s London HQ at midday to demonstrate against war with Iran, even as attention is deflected for the time being on to the issue of Iran\u2019s accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner. The demonstration, organised by the ever-busy Stop the War Coalition, starts outside BBC Broadcasting House and will march to Trafalgar Square where speakers will address the rally. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, are among the prominent figures expected to join the demo, along with the musician Brian Eno and the standup comic Tez Ilyas. In a statement sent out ahead of the demonstration, Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, the re-imposition of crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy and the US extra-judicial killing in a sovereign state are all steps to war. The danger of war remains high and the prime minister must exert every influence to ensure a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Unless the sanctions are lifted, war and nuclear proliferation are a real threat. Britain must do more to alleviate the sanctions and push to salvage the Iran nuclear deal. The chief of Ukrainian International Airlines, Evgeniy Dikhne, has rejected claims by Iran that the shooting down of its airliner was in some way prompted by a mistake by his crew. Speaking at a press conference arranged before Iran\u2019s surprise admission of responsibility for shooting down UIA flight 752, Dikhne stressed that his company had received no indication from Iranian or international civil aviation authorities that it would be unsafe to fly over the country. He added: Currently, even within the statement by Iran there was a hint saying that our crew has been doing something independently or has been doing something not in the way that they have have been behaving. The vice-president of UIA, Igor Sosnovskiy, continued, saying that Tehran airport had been fully open and operational, despite the tensions between Iran and the US. He spoke of the competency of the crew, who had clocked up thousands of hours of flight time. Iran should have closed the airport, Sosnovskiy said, and having failed to do so the country must take full responsibility for the downing of the jet and the lives lost. A thread here by Reza Khaasteh, a journalist with Iran Front Page news, translates in more detail the statements by the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh in a press conference in which he admits his unit\u2019s responsibility for shooting down UIA 752. The head of the aerospace division of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards has said he \u201cwishes he could die\u201d, as his unit accepted responsibility for shooting down UIA 752. \u201cI wish I could die and not witness such an accident,\u201d Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh said in a video posted online by Iranian state TV on Saturday. According to translations by Reuters, Hajizadeh says he told authorities on Wednesday about the unintentional missile attack, and that the plane was brought down by a short-range missile. He says he partly blames the attack on the US, for its assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani on Iraqi soil last week, which heightened tensions in the region and led to a tit-for-tat strike by Iran on US bases. The former government minister Alistair Burt has commented on the Iranian ambassador\u2019s tweeted apology, saying it is unprecedented and that he has never seen such comments from anyone in that capacity. Burt is one of many on Twitter saying that Hamid Baeidinejad\u2019s admission of guilt is very unusual in a world where issuing denials even in the face of incontrovertible evidence, is usually how states operate. In a statement issued by Justin Trudeau\u2019s office after Iran acknowledged the plane was brought down by its own armed forces, the Canadian prime minister said: Our focus remains closure, accountability, transparency, and justice for the families and loved ones of the victims. This is a national tragedy, and all Canadians are mourning together. We will continue working with our partners around the world to ensure a complete and thorough investigation, and the Canadian government expects full cooperation from Iranian authorities. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has joined calls for an investigation into the downing of UIA 752, as well as offering his condolences to the relatives of victims. Khamenei on Saturday expressed his deep sympathy to the families of the 176 victims, and called on the armed forces to \u201cpursue probable shortcomings and guilt in the painful incident\u201d, according to the Associated Press. Reuters earlier reported that Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, who answer directly to Khamenei, have said they will offer their own explanation and apology for the incident. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has made his first comments on the Iranian admission of guilt today. He says the Canadian government expects \u201cfull cooperation from Iranian authorities\u201d and that its officials \u201cwill continue working with our partners around the world to ensure a complete and thorough investigation\u201d. Credit for Iran\u2019s decision to apologise over the shooting down of UIA flight 752 should be given to the investigative news website Bellingcat, suggests Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling. Of course, Bellingcat was far from the only organisation reporting that the downing of the airliner was the result of an Iranian missile strike. But its impressive geolocation work cannot have hurt in pinning down the truth. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has demanded that Iran punish those responsible for the downing of the airliner, as well as pay compensation and apologise. \u201cWe expect Iran ... to bring the guilty to the courts,\u201d Zelenskiy wrote on Facebook, calling also for the return of remains, according to comments translated and reported by AFP. \u201cWe hope the inquiry will be pursued without deliberate delay and without obstruction,\u201d Zelenskiy added. He said he wanted \u201ctotal access\u201d to the full inquiry for 45 Ukrainian experts, and in a tweet also sought an official apology. Our writers Luke Harding and Peter Beaumont have written the story of the final moments of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752. The plane would have appeared on the radar screen of Iran\u2019s Mehrabad air traffic control centre, which cleared the crew to ascend to 26,000ft. Staff should have identified the Boeing 737-800 plane as a regular civilian jet. Also tracking the skies over Tehran were American satellites. If further missiles were hurled at US targets in Iraq the US\u2019s Space-Based Infrared System would immediately detect them. At 6.15am the system picked up something ominous: the unmistakable heat signature of missiles freshly launched. An Iranian garrison on the ground, due west of the airport, appears to have mistaken the plane for a hostile American object. According to US officials, an Iranian anti-aircraft battery unleashed two Russian-made missiles. The US satellites recorded an infrared blip: an explosion. The results were immediate and catastrophic. Read more: A lot of U-turns on Twitter this morning. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, has tweeted his apologies for circulating misleading statements. The head of the Ukrainian state security service (SBU) says Iran\u2019s statement confirms one of his organisation\u2019s working theories about what caused the crash. Contrary to what some experts had said initially, the SBU thought Iran\u2019s anti-aircraft missile system had been operated manually rather than automatically, Ivan Bakanov said, according to Reuters. Bakanov\u2019s statement came as the head of the airline operating the plane said he had been sure that it was not his staff who were at fault. We did not for a second doubt that our crew and our plane could have been the cause of this terrible, awful air catastrophe, Evgeniy Dikhne said on Facebook. \u201cThey were our best guys and girls. The best.\u201d Iran has admitted that its military unintentionally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner as it flew from its capital, killing all 176 people onboard, after days of rejecting western intelligence claims that it had been hit by an Iranian surface to air missile. A military statement early on Saturday via state TV blamed \u201chuman error\u201d for the downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 on Wednesday. It was followed by an apology from Iran\u2019s president. The downing of the airliner came in the midst of rising tensions between Iran and the US. Iran had just launched reciprocal rocket attacks on US bases in the Middle East after Trump ordered the assassination one of Iran\u2019s top military leaders with a drone strike in Baghdad last week.",

Nesb\u00f8 took a circuitous route to becoming a bestselling author, playing football for Norway\u2019s premier league team Molde before torn knee ligaments ended his career. He went on to form the band Di Derre, who topped the charts in Norway, and worked as a financial analyst before his first novel, <em>The Bat</em>, was published in 1997. Nesb\u00f8\u2019s latest Harry Hole book, <em>Knife</em>, opens with Harry waking from a hangover covered in blood\u2026</p> <p><strong>Harry Hole travels an extremely dark</strong><strong> path in <em>Knife</em>... Was this always the plan?</strong><br>It\u2019s been on the cards for many years, actually. When I wrote my third novel [in the series], that was when I planned what was ahead for Harry. It\u2019s all part of his life story, which belongs not only to the genre of crime fiction but also of classic tragedy. So it was bound to happen.</p> <p><strong>Did you know, when you wrote <em>The Bat</em></strong><strong><em>,</em> that you would still be telling </strong><strong>Harry</strong><strong>\u2019s story 12 books later?</strong><br>I knew that there were some key events in his life. But of course there have been lots of detours that I didn\u2019t plan for.</p> <p><strong><em>Knife </em>finds Harry drinking heavily, miserable, but also full of ingenious moments of intuition. Put like that, he sounds like a lot of fictional detectives</strong><strong>. How do you keep him fresh?</strong><br>I think in many ways it\u2019s easier as you get to know him better. As you get older you get more interested in developing your friendships with your old friends than having new friends because it\u2019s all on a deeper level; you\u2019ve already done all the chit-chat. And it feels a bit the same way with Harry. I really know him, my readers know him, so we can get to the real business right away.</p> <p><strong>Will you ever retire him?</strong><br>He will not have eternal life. He probably won\u2019t die from old age \u2013 but then again, who knows?</p> <p><strong>That</strong><strong> sounds ominous\u2026</strong><br>What I can promise you is that when he is gone, he will not be resurrected.</p> <p><strong>And you won\u2019t pass the Harry Hole franchise on to someone to write after your death?</strong><br>Definitely not. I\u2019m telling you right now \u2013 if that should happen, if you see somebody trying, you can quote me on this.</p> <p><strong>Here in the UK we label all crime writing from Scandinavia as Scandi </strong><strong>noir, or Nordic </strong><strong>noir. Does </strong><strong>it really have something in common, or is it just where the authors come from?</strong><br>I think basically it\u2019s the latter. But then again I see it from the inside, and I can understand from the outside that there are certain similarities. It would be strange if there weren\u2019t any \u2013 we share the same culture, the same social and political backdrop.</p> <p><strong>Crime fiction is criticised for </strong><strong>gratuitous violence against women. Is this something you consider when you\u2019re writing</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Violence against women is a problem in society \u2013 it is something we should talk about. I would be more worried if there was an absence of violence against women in fiction, because it\u2019s a problem in real life. Of course, it\u2019s a question of how you do it, but in general I would be more worried if fiction pretended it wasn\u2019t a problem.</p> <p><strong>When you come to writing the violent scenes in your books, is it difficult?</strong><br>Both yes and no. Since I\u2019m writing in a genre that violence has traditionally been part of, there is a certain choreography to the violence that separates it from real-life violence. It depends on how true you are to the cliches of the genre. I like some of those cliches. Harry Hole borrows a lot from the tradition of the hard-boiled detective novel, and with that comes certain traditions. All storytelling is building on tradition and what has been before.</p> <p><strong>Do you always know the solution when you start writing?</strong><br>Yes, I do. I\u2019m the captain on the ship. I like the feeling when writing chapter one that I can tell my readers: come sit closer, listen carefully, I have this great story to tell you and I know exactly where we\u2019re going.</p> <p><strong>You were working as a stockbroker and touring with your band when you sat down to write your first book. Why did you go for crime?</strong><br>I\u2019d been asked to write a book about the band. I said no, but I was going to Australia for five weeks so I said: \u201cWhen I come back, maybe I will have something else for you\u201d. I figured, at least I know the head and the tail of a crime novel, so since I only had five weeks, I could write a short, simple crime story. It was because I had a deadline!</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table</strong><strong>?</strong><br>You\u2019re interviewing me in the bathroom, but I have a bookshelf in my bathroom. I read <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/infinite-jest-9780349121086.html\" title=\"\"><em>Infinite Jest </em>by David Foster Wallace</a> from time to time \u2013 it\u2019s like a modern <em>Ulysses</em> and I haven\u2019t really finished it but I think he\u2019s a brilliant writer and I really recommend his essays, which are often overlooked.

My mother worked at the library, and I would read anything she brought home - I would read a lot.</p> <p><strong>Which books have stayed with you since childhood?</strong><br>My father grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and he had Mark Twain books, <em>Huck Finn</em> and <em>Tom Sawyer</em>. Those were my favourite books.</p> <p><strong>Who do you admire </strong><strong>most of the writers working today?</strong><br>I really like Ian McEwan. I always enjoy his books. They are both wise and interesting. And a Norwegian writer named <a href=\"https://eng.gyldendal.no/Gyldendal/Authors/Harstad-Johan\" title=\"\">Johan Harstad</a>, who is <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/172-hours-on-the-moon-9781907411519.html\" title=\"\">translated into English</a>; he\u2019s a really good writer.</p> <p><strong>And what do you plan to read next?</strong><br>Right now, I\u2019m reading this brilliant biography by Tom Jones, <em>Over the Top and Back</em>, and it\u2019s really funny and honest.

      "body": "<p>The British music industry\u2019s focus on the male solo artist at the expense of female musicians has been thrown into sharp relief by the nominations for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/britawards\">2020 Brit awards</a>, in which only one British woman \u2013 and no groups featuring women \u2013 was nominated across 25 slots in mixed-gender categories.</p> <p>Pop singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mabel\">Mabel</a> was nominated for best new artist and best song for Don\u2019t Call Me Up \u2013 but the nine other song nominees and four other new artist nominees are solo British males. (US stars Miley Cyrus and Normani make guest appearances in the song category.)</p> <p>All five of the nominees for the top prize, best British album, are solo male artists: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\">Stormzy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/michael-kiwanuka\">Michael Kiwanuka</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lewis-capaldi\">Lewis Capaldi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dave\">Dave</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/harry-styles\">Harry Styles</a>. Of the 198 albums on the longlist for best British album \u2013 drawn up from chart successes and record label submissions \u2013 which are then voted on by the Brits Academy of music industry figures to create the shortlist, only 36 were by women or female-fronted acts.</p> <p>The Brits\u2019 recognition of musicians of colour is vastly improved following the \u201cBritsSoWhite\u201d criticisms of recent years. More than half of the best album and British male and female nominees are non-white, partly due to the good health of British rap and R&amp;B music this year, but also due to the increased diversity of the Brits Academy in a 2016 shakeup that brought in 700 new members. Those changes also made the gender split of voters almost equal, but the skewed gender balance in this year\u2019s nominations will raise questions about how female British talent is being nurtured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdbc6e08a4d3d9254da409847d3ebd9f60c26ff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdbc6e08a4d3d9254da409847d3ebd9f60c26ff1/0_67_3280_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Best British album and best British male nominee \u2026 Harry Styles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best album and best British male nominee \u2026 Harry Styles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nominees for best British group \u2013 long a bastion for male artists \u2013 were also all men: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay\">Coldplay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/foals\">Foals</a>, Bring Me the Horizon, Bastille and the rap duo D-Block Europe. None of those artists received any other nominations, and it\u2019s only the second time in Brits history that no group has been nominated for album of the year, the first time being in 2018.</p> <p>South London rapper Dave, and Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi were the most nominated artists, with four each \u2013 best album, British male, new artist and song. Each of them had a very successful 2019. Dave won the Mercury prize for his album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/08/dave-psychodrama-review-best-british-rap-album\">Psychodrama</a>, a candid, often bleak exploration of race, poverty, family and mental strife, which topped the UK charts. \u201cWhat an honour, and what a way to end the most incredible year. I\u2019m very grateful,\u201d he said. His song nomination was for Location, featuring Burna Boy, the Nigerian artist who also picks up a nomination in the best international male category alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen\">Bruce Springsteen</a>, Dermot Kennedy, Post Malone and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tyler-the-creator\">Tyler, the Creator</a>.</p> <p>Capaldi topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with his power ballad Someone You Loved, nominated in the song category, which was the biggest-selling song of 2019 in the UK (accounting for streams and downloads). His album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/17/lewis-capaldi-divinely-uninspired-to-a-hellish-extent-review\">Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent</a>, was also the UK\u2019s biggest selling album.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abdd017b2d829570a0fb183498a3def17929daf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abdd017b2d829570a0fb183498a3def17929daf4/0_13_3028_1817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Best international female solo artist nominee Ariana Grande.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best international female solo artist nominee \u2026 Ariana Grande.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chasing them with three nominations each are Mabel, the daughter of Neneh Cherry who had two Top 10 hits in 2019, and Stormzy, who will be much fancied after a blockbuster year in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/stormzy-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage\">he headlined Glastonbury</a> and topped the singles chart three times. The Croydon-raised rapper will be hoping to add a second album of the year award, having previously won in 2018.

      "bodyText": "The British music industry\u2019s focus on the male solo artist at the expense of female musicians has been thrown into sharp relief by the nominations for the 2020 Brit awards, in which only one British woman \u2013 and no groups featuring women \u2013 was nominated across 25 slots in mixed-gender categories. Pop singer Mabel was nominated for best new artist and best song for Don\u2019t Call Me Up \u2013 but the nine other song nominees and four other new artist nominees are solo British males. (US stars Miley Cyrus and Normani make guest appearances in the song category.) All five of the nominees for the top prize, best British album, are solo male artists: Stormzy, Michael Kiwanuka, Lewis Capaldi, Dave and Harry Styles. Of the 198 albums on the longlist for best British album \u2013 drawn up from chart successes and record label submissions \u2013 which are then voted on by the Brits Academy of music industry figures to create the shortlist, only 36 were by women or female-fronted acts. The Brits\u2019 recognition of musicians of colour is vastly improved following the \u201cBritsSoWhite\u201d criticisms of recent years. More than half of the best album and British male and female nominees are non-white, partly due to the good health of British rap and R&amp;B music this year, but also due to the increased diversity of the Brits Academy in a 2016 shakeup that brought in 700 new members. Those changes also made the gender split of voters almost equal, but the skewed gender balance in this year\u2019s nominations will raise questions about how female British talent is being nurtured. Nominees for best British group \u2013 long a bastion for male artists \u2013 were also all men: Coldplay, Foals, Bring Me the Horizon, Bastille and the rap duo D-Block Europe. None of those artists received any other nominations, and it\u2019s only the second time in Brits history that no group has been nominated for album of the year, the first time being in 2018. South London rapper Dave, and Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi were the most nominated artists, with four each \u2013 best album, British male, new artist and song. Each of them had a very successful 2019. Dave won the Mercury prize for his album, Psychodrama, a candid, often bleak exploration of race, poverty, family and mental strife, which topped the UK charts. \u201cWhat an honour, and what a way to end the most incredible year. I\u2019m very grateful,\u201d he said. His song nomination was for Location, featuring Burna Boy, the Nigerian artist who also picks up a nomination in the best international male category alongside Bruce Springsteen, Dermot Kennedy, Post Malone and Tyler, the Creator. Capaldi topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with his power ballad Someone You Loved, nominated in the song category, which was the biggest-selling song of 2019 in the UK (accounting for streams and downloads). His album, Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent, was also the UK\u2019s biggest selling album. Chasing them with three nominations each are Mabel, the daughter of Neneh Cherry who had two Top 10 hits in 2019, and Stormzy, who will be much fancied after a blockbuster year in which he headlined Glastonbury and topped the singles chart three times. The Croydon-raised rapper will be hoping to add a second album of the year award, having previously won in 2018. Harry Styles continues a strong post-One Direction career with two nominations \u2013 best album and best British male \u2013 with soul singer Michael Kiwanuka also receiving two in the same categories. The best British female category is split between chart-friendly pop \u2013 Mabel, balladeer Freya Ridings and R&amp;B star Mahalia \u2013 and the more experimental artists Charli XCX and FKA twigs. \u201cIt\u2019s really surreal to be nominated for 3 awards this year,\u201d Mabel said. \u201cThird year in a row to be nominated so fingers crossed it\u2019s the 3rd time lucky and I can take one home this year.\u201d Artists who may feel snubbed include Taylor Swift, left out of the international female artist running in favour of Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Camila Cabello, Lana Del Rey and Lizzo, and Ed Sheeran, who despite releasing a new album in 2019 earned only one nomination, for his No 1 song with Justin Bieber, I Don\u2019t Care. Liam Gallagher, Rita Ora, Mumford and Sons, the Chemical Brothers, Rod Stewart, the Who, Muse and Emeli Sand\u00e9 are among the eligible major British artists who didn\u2019t receive any nominations. Awards for best video and best international group have been removed for 2020. Producer of the year will be announced ahead of the awards ceremony; the rising star award for hotly tipped new talent has already been awarded, to soul singer Celeste.

The former vice-president and senator from Delaware leads nationally but has seen his advantage in Iowa dwindle, with some polls regarding the first formal election-year test placing his closest national rival, Bernie Sanders, at the head of the field. Nationally, however, a new Washington Post/IPSO poll gives Biden a seemingly unassailable lead with black voters, 48% to 20% for Sanders. No other candidate, including Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren (9%), former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and New Jersey senator Cory Booker (both 4%), returned better than single-digit support. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana who has performed strongly in Iowa and New Hampshire, the second state to vote, attracted just 2% support. \u201cI think neither Warren nor Sanders and certainly not Pete Buttigieg have ever had a breakthrough with African American voters sufficient to eliminate Biden\u2019s advantage,\u201d Republican strategist Rick Wilson told the Guardian in an interview conducted before the Post poll was published. \u201cAnd also, Biden\u2019s got the secret weapon.

The poll, of Democrat-leaning registered voters was conducted between 2 and 8 January, and according to the Post \u201cilluminates the contours of Biden\u2019s support among different subsets of the black electorate\u201d.

In Iowa, which will vote on 3 February, Biden has slipped to a virtual tie with Sanders, according to modelling by the FiveThirtyEight website.

      "bodyText": "Scottish Labour\u2019s executive has rejected its leader\u2019s proposals for a special conference on federalism, which could have seen it support a multi-option referendum on independence. The Guardian revealed on Thursday that Scottish party leader Richard Leonard wanted to produce a detailed proposal for a federal UK as Labour\u2019s alternative to full Scottish independence, and put that to a party conference in May. A Scottish Labour source said: \u201cLabour would be more willing to consider supporting a second referendum if it was multi-option,\u201d provoking a furious backlash within the party. During a tense meeting on Saturday, the Scottish executive committee (SEC) rejected Leonard\u2019s proposals and instead voted to hold its own \u201caway day\u201d, in private, to define federalism and draft policy on it. That has delayed a decision on whether to ask for federalism to be included as a third option in a multi-choice independence referendum, alongside full independence or keeping the UK\u2019s current structure. A party source insisted Leonard\u2019s idea of having a special conference was not a formal proposal, and was always subject to SEC approval. However, other sources say Leonard tabled the idea at both a shadow cabinet meeting at Holyrood on Monday, and then argued for it as Labour\u2019s Holyrood group meeting on Tuesday. The SEC met at Labour\u2019s Scottish headquarters in central Glasgow as tens of thousands of people joined a pro-independence march through the city, although a planned rally in Glasgow Green was cancelled due to high winds and heavy rain. Leonard has come under immense pressure to respond to Scottish Labour\u2019s dire election results in the December general election, after the party was again left with one Scottish MP after its worst election result in recent history, polling 18.6%. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and Scottish National party leader, said her party\u2019s victory in 48 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Westminster seats, with 45% of the vote, proved the electorate supported her calls for a second independence vote this year. That demand has been repeatedly rejected by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, with opinion polls not yet showing majority support for leaving the UK. A series of Labour figures, including several defeated Scottish MPs and Clive Lewis, an outsider in the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn as UK party leader, have said the party needed to accept the case for a referendum, and also consider splitting away from the UK party. Ben Bradshaw, the former Labour cabinet minister, told the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel he was \u201c100% certain\u201d Scotland would vote for independence. He added: \u201cThe political class in England \u2013 and this includes my own party \u2013 must very quickly recognise the Scots\u2019 right to self-determination\u201d. Scottish Labour had gone into the election with a manifesto pledge to abolish the House of Lords and replace it with a federal \u201csenate of the nations and regions\u201d. If Labour had won the election, it said a federal system would be introduced after a UK-wide constitutional convention. The UK party\u2019s manifesto did not refer to federalism, but endorsed the constitutional convention proposal and replacing the Lords with a senate of nations and regions. Scottish Labour had backed federalism in 2017, as had Leonard\u2019s predecessor Kezia Dugdale, but December\u2019s election was called before Leonard was able to publish a detailed policy on how federalism would work which was being written by Lady Pauline Bryan.",

After four meetings between the pair, the Sheffield Wednesday manager\u2019s record against the so-called \u201cGodfather of football\u201d reads: won three, drawn one.</p> <p>Thanks to eye-catching late goals from Jacob Murphy and Atdhe Nuhiu, a sometimes chaotic Yorkshire derby played in front of a high-decibel crowd concluded with Monk\u2019s side up to sixth and Bielsa\u2019s down to second. Although the latter are only a point behind West Brom, the gap separating them from third-place Brentford has narrowed to six points. With only one victory in their last six league games, Leeds are wobbling.</p> <p>Bielsa blamed psychology rather than strategy for the setback. \u201cWhen things do not go how we expect there\u2019s a feeling of fear,\u201d said the manager, who is seeking a new striker. \u201cIt was a very important match and we dominated 75% of it, but if the team don\u2019t get what they\u2019re looking for, there\u2019s a sense of doubt.\u201d</p> <p>There appeared no such hesitancy about the sliding-doors moment in Monk\u2019s career in 2017, when he swapped the decent team he was building at Elland Road for unhappy stints at Middlesbrough and then Birmingham \u2013 even if he did record his first two wins against Bielsa while in charge of the latter.</p> <p>On the pitch at least, life has looked up for him at Sheffield Wednesday \u2013 his fifth managerial posting in six years \u2013 but the Hillsborough promotion push is under the looming threat of a points deduction for breaches of the Football League\u2019s financial regulations.</p> <p>If the path to promotion looks slightly more straightforward for Bielsa, the imminent FA disciplinary hearing that could result in his goalkeeper, Kiko Casilla, being suspended for up to 12 games following an allegation of racial abuse represents an ominous cloud on the horizon.</p> <p>Casilla was initially rather underemployed on a helter-skelter afternoon marred by that capricious wind, which blew an alarming amount of litter across the pitch. Goodness knows how the meticulous Bielsa, noted for conducting daily dust inspections at the Leeds training ground, coped with the sight of all that mess billowing in front of the upturned bucket from which he surveys the action.</p> <p>Much of his team\u2019s passing proved similarly incoherent. Although Leeds dominated, they struggled to move the ball either fast or fluently. Patrick Bamford did beat Wednesday\u2019s goalkeeper, Cameron Dawson, after connecting with Mateusz Klich\u2019s cross but he immediately saw his goal ruled out for a clear offside against Klich.</p> <p>A principal subplot was the duel between Jack Harrison and Monk\u2019s right-back, Osaze Urhoghide. The visiting defender frequently thwarted the winger\u2019s promising advances although Harrison did occasionally escape his clutches, on one occasion seeing a shot well saved by Dawson.</p> <p>After Wednesday\u2019s Sam Winnall missed a couple of half-chances, Leeds upped the tempo, pressing high up the pitch but, despite Bielsa\u2019s deployment of all three substitutes, they still lacked the poise needed to unhinge Wednesday\u2019s obdurate defence. The header Harrison directed wastefully wide from Luke Ayling\u2019s cross served as a microcosm of their seemingly slapdash mindset.</p> <p>They paid for it when Stuart Dallas forfeited possession, Nuhiu\u2019s pass picked out Murphy and, from an awkward angle, Murphy lashed the ball home, beating the arguably culpable Casilla at his near post.</p> <p>Wednesday were not quite done. Deep into stoppage time \u2013 and with injury having reduced Dallas to a limping passenger \u2013 Nuhiu got in on the act, volleying Adam Reach\u2019s cutback beyond Casilla after Reach\u2019s pickpocketing of Ben White.</p> <p>\u201cIt was difficult,\u201d said Monk, whose side had shone despite the absence of his injured leading scorer, Steven Fletcher.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to be structurally very good, have courage and a tough heart and force them into mistakes.\u201d</p>",

Bielsa blamed psychology rather than strategy for the setback. \u201cWhen things do not go how we expect there\u2019s a feeling of fear,\u201d said the manager, who is seeking a new striker. \u201cIt was a very important match and we dominated 75% of it, but if the team don\u2019t get what they\u2019re looking for, there\u2019s a sense of doubt.\u201d There appeared no such hesitancy about the sliding-doors moment in Monk\u2019s career in 2017, when he swapped the decent team he was building at Elland Road for unhappy stints at Middlesbrough and then Birmingham \u2013 even if he did record his first two wins against Bielsa while in charge of the latter. On the pitch at least, life has looked up for him at Sheffield Wednesday \u2013 his fifth managerial posting in six years \u2013 but the Hillsborough promotion push is under the looming threat of a points deduction for breaches of the Football League\u2019s financial regulations. If the path to promotion looks slightly more straightforward for Bielsa, the imminent FA disciplinary hearing that could result in his goalkeeper, Kiko Casilla, being suspended for up to 12 games following an allegation of racial abuse represents an ominous cloud on the horizon. Casilla was initially rather underemployed on a helter-skelter afternoon marred by that capricious wind, which blew an alarming amount of litter across the pitch. Goodness knows how the meticulous Bielsa, noted for conducting daily dust inspections at the Leeds training ground, coped with the sight of all that mess billowing in front of the upturned bucket from which he surveys the action. Much of his team\u2019s passing proved similarly incoherent. Although Leeds dominated, they struggled to move the ball either fast or fluently. Patrick Bamford did beat Wednesday\u2019s goalkeeper, Cameron Dawson, after connecting with Mateusz Klich\u2019s cross but he immediately saw his goal ruled out for a clear offside against Klich. A principal subplot was the duel between Jack Harrison and Monk\u2019s right-back, Osaze Urhoghide. The visiting defender frequently thwarted the winger\u2019s promising advances although Harrison did occasionally escape his clutches, on one occasion seeing a shot well saved by Dawson. After Wednesday\u2019s Sam Winnall missed a couple of half-chances, Leeds upped the tempo, pressing high up the pitch but, despite Bielsa\u2019s deployment of all three substitutes, they still lacked the poise needed to unhinge Wednesday\u2019s obdurate defence. The header Harrison directed wastefully wide from Luke Ayling\u2019s cross served as a microcosm of their seemingly slapdash mindset. They paid for it when Stuart Dallas forfeited possession, Nuhiu\u2019s pass picked out Murphy and, from an awkward angle, Murphy lashed the ball home, beating the arguably culpable Casilla at his near post. Wednesday were not quite done. Deep into stoppage time \u2013 and with injury having reduced Dallas to a limping passenger \u2013 Nuhiu got in on the act, volleying Adam Reach\u2019s cutback beyond Casilla after Reach\u2019s pickpocketing of Ben White. \u201cIt was difficult,\u201d said Monk, whose side had shone despite the absence of his injured leading scorer, Steven Fletcher. \u201cWe had to be structurally very good, have courage and a tough heart and force them into mistakes.\u201d",

Goodnight! \u201cOn the subject of big turnarounds,\u201d says Fred Ixer, \u201cIpswich lost 10-1 to Fulham on Boxing Day 1963 and beat them 4-2 two days later.\u201d Tottenham v Liverpool Jose Mourinho has given 20-year-old defender Japhet Tanganga his Premier League debut against the best team in the world. Get the rest of the team news with Scott Murray. Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report from Old Trafford Peep peep! Crikey, that was eventful. These are the final scores in our featured matches Premier League Chelsea 3-0 Burnley Everton 1-0 Brighton Leicester 1-2 Southampton Man Utd 4-0 Norwich Wolves 1-1 Newcastle Championship Charlton 2-2 West Brom Leeds 0-2 Sheffield Wednesday League One Oxford 1-3 Rotherham Sunderland 4-0 Wycombe League Two Swindon 3-1 Crewe Championship Ben Watson has scored a 96th-minute winner for promotion-chasing Nottingham Forest at Reading. No he hasn\u2019t: Reading have equalised from the kick off! \u201cHas there ever been a 10-goal turnaround across two fixtures?\u201d asks Dennis Mumby. There has indeed. In 1994-95, Ipswich beat Man Utd 3-2 at Portman Road and lost 9-0 at Old Trafford. I think Wigan beat Chelsea 3-1 and then lost 8-0 in 2009-10 as well, though would need to check. A superb result for Newcastle, who lost two more players to injury in the first half. Another win for Everton, their third in four Premier League games under Carlo Ancelotti. A glorious and deserved win for Southampton, who exorcised that 9-0 defeat with a quite wonderful performance at the King Power Stadium. Bravo. Chelsea move to within six points of second place after an easy win over Burnley. Atdhe Nuhiu completes a memorable win for Wednesday, and especially for their manager Garry Monk. Manchester United kept up their excellent home form (not counting the mezzanine Carabao Cup) with a thumping win over Norwich. \u201cAs a Liverpool fan I\u2019ve no preference towards other teams in the league but I do really respect how Southampton put their season back together after that 9-0,\u201d says Chris Kempshall. \u201cThe way they\u2019ve played their way out of trouble and stuck by the manager &amp; players is genuinely admirable.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019m really happy for Ralph Hassenhuttl in particular; he seems a very likeable, principled bloke. NO GOAL! Leicester 1-2 Southampton Yes, it has been disallowed for offside. Lordy, what a game. I think this is goingto be disallowed for offside. It\u2019s VARmpit time again. Jacob Murphy has picked Leeds\u2019 pocket in the Yorkshire derby! Wolves 1-1 Newcastle Steve Bruce\u2019s injury-shredded side are eight minutes away from an admirable draw at Molineux. \u201cCan I offer the Allen family?\u201d says Martyn Lunn. \u201cLes Allen, son Clive Allen, nephew Paul Allen, brother Dennis Allen....\u201d Leicester 1-2 Southampton Kasper Schmeichel makes a brilliant save from Danny Ings to keep Leicester in the game! In the context of that 9-0 defeat, this is one of the performances of the season from Southampton. It\u2019s also there! It\u2019s there! The ludicrously in-form Danny Ings has given Southampton a deserved lead at Leicester! They have been fantastic all afternoon, hell-bent on redemption for that 9-0 humiliation, and now they are ahead. Marcus Browne has pulled one back for Oxford. Thanks for all your father/son suggestions, by the way, which I\u2019m looking at when not distracted by live association football. Everton 1-0 Brighton Dominic Calvert-Lewin has a goal disallowed by VAR for handball. He\u2019s back (part 48) The latest scores in our featured matches Premier League Chelsea 3-0 Burnley Everton 1-0 Brighton Leicester 1-1 Southampton Man Utd 4-0 Norwich Wolves 1-1 Newcastle Championship Charlton 1-2 West Brom Leeds 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday League One Oxford 0-3 Rotherham Sunderland 3-0 Wycombe League Two Swindon 3-1 Crewe Crewe have had plenty of the game, but they are facing defeat after a third goal from Danny Rose. The substitute Mason Greenwood gets his ninth goal of a memorable season, driving past Tim Krul from outside the area with typical precision. Crewe were level for only eight minutes. Jerry Yates has put the leaders Swindon back in front. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says John Barry. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a pair that could be better than the Maldinis, then the Mazzolas - Valentino and Sandro - are probably a good bet.\u201d Now that\u2019s a good shout. \u201cDidn\u2019t Eidur Gudjohnsen come on as a sub for his dad when making his debut for Iceland?\u201d asks Gary Naylor. An important equaliser for Crewe at wherever it is Swindon play. Is it still the County Ground? Whatever it\u2019s called, the Norwegian Chuma Anene has scored there. \u201cUmm,\u201d says Craig Macdonald, \u201cthe Charltons spring to mind...\u201d Who\u2019s the daddy? Leicester 1-1 Southampton Now Leicester have had a goal disallowed for offside against Jonny Evans. Scottish Championship It\u2019s now Patrick 0-4 Dundee Utd, with Lawrence Shankland getting his third hat-trick of the season. Leicester 1-1 Southampton: no penalty Shane Long was adjudged offside by VAR. Leicester 1-1 Southampton A penalty has been given to Southampton, but it may be reversed for offside against Shane Long. We\u2019re into VARmpit territory. Leicester 1-1 Southampton Stuart Armstrong misses another decent chance for Southampton, who by all counts have been quite brilliant today. There\u2019s a lot more than three points on offer for them. The latest scores in our featured matches Premier League Chelsea 3-0 Burnley Everton 1-0 Brighton Leicester 1-1 Southampton Man Utd 3-0 Norwich Wolves 1-1 Newcastle Championship Charlton 1-2 West Brom Leeds 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday League One Oxford 0-3 Rotherham Sunderland 3-0 Wycombe League Two Swindon 1-0 Crewe \u201cObviously,\u201d says Mac Millings, \u201cthe best father-son combo is Papa Dadson, last seen in the colours of F.C. Lumezzane. He\u2019s football\u2019s Miandad.\u201d Man Utd 3-0 Norwich Brandon Williams has missed a great chance to make it 4-0. And Marcus Rashford has been replaced by Daniel James; it sounds like an injury precaution. \u201cI would like to add the Laudrup family, with father Finn and brothers Michael and Brian, to the glorious pantheon of footballing families,\u201d says Claus Str\u00f8ander. Never heard of them. \u201cPartick Thistle 0-2 Dundee United, Stenhousemuir 0-1 Brechin,\u201d says Simon McMahon of matters in Scotland. \u201cAs for footballing families, Roy and Rocky Race take some beating.\u201d Everton 1-0 Brighton Leandro Trossard hits the bar for Brighton with a fierce strike. \u201cFather/son combo,\u201d says Redmond Grimes. \u201cSurely Micky and Eden Hazard are worth a mention?\u201d Talking of Johan Cruyff, Hal Robson-Kanu has given West Brom the lead against Charlton in the first minute of the second half. His shot took a decisive deflection off Naby Sarr, and I doubt anyone connected with West Brom could care less about that. Two in three minutes for United. Anthony Martial seals victory over Norwich with a smart header from Juan Mata\u2019s cross. Callum Hudson-Odoi scores his first Premier League goal to seal a rareish home victory for Chelsea. Another one for Rashnaldo. Tim Krul gives away a needless/dodgy (delete as appropriate) penalty by fouling Brandon Williams, and Marcus Rashford whacks it through Krul\u2019s hands. \u201cIn my humble opinion as an Ajax fan, it may be hard to beat Danny/Daley Blind for best father/son duo,\u201d says Stefan Lutter. \u201cPatrick and Justin Kluivert are another good one, though probably not in the running for top position.\u201d As an Ajax fan, doesn\u2019t the father of modern football come to mind? Leicester 1-1 Southampton The away side really should be ahead. Jack Stephens has had a shot cleared off the line by Caglar Soyuncu at the start of the second half. \u201cIs Rashford,\u201d says Duncan Edwards, \u201cturning into a version of Ronaldo?\u201d Heh. There are similarities in their goalscoring pattern, this season being Rashford\u2019s equivalent of the Ronaldo jump in 2006-07. If he\u2019s still scoring hat-tricks in 2032-33, having won umpteen Champions Leagues, we should talk some more. \u201cPerhaps an easy one to suggest being a Chelsea supporter, but could it be argued the Lampards have a strong case at the father/son combo?\u201d says Alec Frost. \u201cFurthermore, nice to see Chelsea taking the lead - perhaps the many problem with this awful home form has been allowing the other team the first goal that they can sit in and defend. Then again, this season we\u2019ve managed to scare ourselves a few times whilst having a comfortable grasp of the game (my mind thinks of Watford).\u201d I was going to say there was never any chance of Burnley winning away to one of the Big Six, then I remembered that mess at Stamford Bridge two seasons ago. Here\u2019s Malcolm Shuttleworth on the subject of father/son combos. \u201cMy father played for Ashton United in the 50s,\u201d he says, \u201cand I was top scorer for my team in the Newbury and District Sunday League for five years running in the 80s. Does that count?\u201d Championship You can read all about promotion-desiring Brentford\u2019s 3-1 win over QPR right here. I thought it was half-time at the Kassam Stadium. In fact they were still playing injury time, and Richard Wood scored to give Rotherham an improbable 3-0 lead. Oxford had kept seven consecutive clean sheets at home in the league. Half-time reading Peep peep! These are the half-time scores in our featured matches: Premier League Chelsea 2-0 Burnley Everton 1-0 Brighton Leicester 1-1 Southampton Man Utd 1-0 Norwich Wolves 1-1 Newcastle Championship Charlton 1-1 West Brom Leeds 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday League One Oxford 0-3 Rotherham Sunderland 3-0 Wycombe League Two Swindon 1-0 Crewe \u201cWhat do you make of Mata\u2019s career with United?\u201d says Phil Podolsky. \u201cAfter two good season with Chelsea there was talk of him being one of the Great Spanish Midfielders, though personally I\u2019ve always thought that was a slight exaggeration.\u201d I have plenty of sympathy for him, because he never really had a run as a No10, but it hasn\u2019t quite happened. He was the right player at the wrong time. There have still been loads of lovely moments of unobtrusive class - I love this pass - and that double at Anfield. Leicester 1-1 Southampton Danny Ings has hit the bar twice in two minutes for Southampton, who are giving Leicester a helluva game. Serie A Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 92, has scored his first goal since returning to AC Milan to put them 2-0 up at Cagliari. The latest scores in our featured matches Premier League Chelsea 2-0 Burnley Everton 1-0 Brighton Leicester 1-1 Southampton Man Utd 1-0 Norwich Wolves 1-1 Newcastle Championship Charlton 1-1 West Brom Leeds 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday League One Oxford 0-2 Rotherham Sunderland 3-0 Wycombe League Two Swindon 1-0 Crewe Chelsea are cruising to victory. Reece James crosses superbly for Tammy Abraham, whose downward header takes a strange bounce and beats Nick Pope. Everton may have been humiliated by Liverpool Under-4s in the FA Cup last weekend, but their Premier League form is terrific. Richarlison has given them the lead against Brighton with a fine goal. Yes, yes, I missed his first goal, but never mind that because Kyle Vassell has lobbed Rotherham into a two-goal lead at Oxford. As things stand, they are top of League One! Rob Hunt has given Swindon the lead in their top-of-the-table clash. \u201cI know I\u2019m getting old and on the downslide,\u201d says Lee Smith, \u201cbut surely Marcus Rashford hasn\u2019t accumulated 200 appearances for Man Utd already?\u201d He surely has, although a third of them have been as a sub. Josh Davison\u2019s excellent header brings Charlton level against West Brom. Leicester 1-1 Southampton Jamie Vardy, 33 today, has had a goal rightly disallowed for offside. Wolves 1-1 Newcastle Another injury for Newcastle! Dwight Gayle has gone off, replaced by Christian Atsu. Newcastle lost four players in the first 47 minutes of their last Premier League game; now they\u2019ve lost another two inside half an hour. I\u2019m struggling to think of a precedent for such misfortune. \u201cAfter watching Kasper Schmeichel make a stunning, point-blank save against an in-form Danny Ings, I got to thinking: are the Schmeichels the best-ever father/son combo?\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cAt the least, Kasper has been in the top three goalkeepers for five seasons while his Dad dominated his era. Who else is there? Ian Wright was brilliant, but was Shaun ever in a top-three forward list? The Redknapps? Not really. Fun subject to consider on a rainy Saturday.\u201d So it is. The Cloughs and Cruyffs were also competent, although off the top of my head I\u2019d pick the Maldinis as the best father/son combo. Marcus Rashford marks his 200th appearance for Manchester United with a goal, finishing confidently from Juan Mata\u2019s cross. Jorginho scores with ease. The penalty was a bit iffy, by all accounts. Chelsea 0-0 Burnley Chelsea have been given a penalty for a foul on Willian. Kenneth Zohore has given promotion-chasing West Brom the lead at the Valley. Sunderland are giving the leaders Wycombe one hell of a beating. The latest scores in our featured matches Premier League Chelsea 0-0 Burnley Everton 0-0 Brighton Leicester 1-1 Southampton Man Utd 0-0 Norwich Wolves 1-1 Newcastle Championship Charlton 0-0 West Brom Leeds 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday League One Oxford 0-0 Rotherham Sunderland 2-0 Wycombe League Two Swindon 0-0 Crewe Chelsea 0-0 Burnley: no goal! VAR has upheld that offside decision at Stamford Bridge, so the score remains 0-0. Stuart Armstong brings Southampton level at the King Power Stadium! His shot took a deflection and beat Kasper Schmeichel. Sunderland double their lead at the Stadium of Light. Chelsea 0-0 Burnley Jeff Hendrick has had a goal disallowed for offside, but it\u2019s being checked by VAR. Poor marking from Newcastle allows Leander Dendoncker to bring Wolves level with a close-range volley from a corner. Leicester, who won 9-0 at St Mary\u2019s earlier in the season, are ahead. Jamie Vardy was the provider this time, superbly making the goal for Dennis Praet. Wolves 0-1 Newcastle This is absurd. Newcastle have suffered yet another injury, with Paul Dummett limping off to be replaced by Florian Lejeune. Sunderland are ahead against the League One leaders. Charlie Wyke ends a fine move, sliding home from Lynden Gooch\u2019s cross.l The in-form Miguel Almiron rifles past Rui Patricio to give Newcastle an early lead at Molineux! Everton 0-0 Brighton Everton have been denied what was apparently a clear penalty after a foul by Webster on Walcott. VAR! what it is good for, etc. \u201cAnother Scottish football update: my son was on the 11.20 M\u00e1laga - Edinburgh Ryanair flight along with the Hibernian squad,\u201d says Joe Sampson. \u201cHe can confirm that their behaviour was exemplary.\u201d I assume they will take collective responsibility for their shameful actions. Manchester United 0-0 Norwich United made a late change to their substitutes, with Tahith Chong replacing former footballer Luke Shaw. He injured a hamstring in the warm-up. Peep peep! It\u2019s Saturday, it\u2019s 3pm, it\u2019s soccer o\u2019clock. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cBeautiful day for football up in Scotland, with heavy rain and gale force winds just about everywhere. With nearest challengers Inverness having their game rained off, Scottish Championship leaders Dundee United travel to Partick Thistle looking to extend their 14-point lead at the top. New signing and former MLS Rookie of the Year Austin, sorry Dillon, Powers goes straight into the squad. Groovy, baby. In Scottish League One game of the day is East Fife v Airdrieonians, and in Scottish League Two the bottom two meet as Brechin, two points behind, travel to face Stenhousemuir.\u201d BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FUNNY GOALKEEPERS. Crystal Palace 1-1 Arsenal Here\u2019s Nick Ames\u2019 report from Selhurst Park. Championship Third-placed Brentford beat QPR 3-1 in the lunchtime game. The match was over after 33 minutes, when Ollie Watkins scored his 18th goal of the season to put Brentford 3-0 up. The early Premier League game has finished Crystal Palace 1-1 Arsenal.

They\u2019re at home to Southampton, who they demolished 9-0 in the return fixture. If they win by three goals they will break the record for the highest aggregate score in one season. The current record is 12-1, jointly held by Blackburn\u2019s 1995-96 side and Spurs\u2019 class of 2009-10. Blackburn beat Nottingham Forest 7-0 at home and 5-1 away, while Spurs maimed Wigan 9-1 at home and 3-0 up north. Scott Murray is covering the early game at Selhurst Park. If you\u2019re not a fan of VAR, look away now, and forever. You\u2019re here for the football, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m not surprised. As Saturday 3pms go, today is pretty decent. Four of the Premier League\u2019s top eight are in action, while Everton have the chance to jump into the top half of the table for the first time since early September. There are some cracking fixtures in the EFL as well, including Leeds v Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship and Swindon v Crewe in League Two. These are our featured games, all of which kick off at 3pm. Premier League Chelsea v Burnley Everton v Brighton Leicester v Southampton Man Utd v Norwich Wolves v Newcastle Championship Charlton v West Brom Leeds v Sheffield Wednesday League One Oxford v Rotherham Sunderland v Wycombe League Two Swindon v Crewe",

      "bodyText": "What a difference 78 days makes. Southampton assuaged the pain of their 9-0 thrashing by Leicester in October with victory courtesy of a late goal from Danny Ings after a performance which illustrated the huge strides they are making under Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. When Dennis Praet opened the scoring for Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side in the 14th minute, the travelling supporters must have feared a repeat of their nightmare at St Mary\u2019s. But having equalised soon after through Stuart Armstrong\u2019s deflected shot, a 14th Premier League goal of the season for the striker who is quickly gaining cult hero status on the south coast nine minutes from time left their Austrian manager cavorting on the touchline in celebration.

Six of the side who started Southampton\u2019s worst-ever defeat had been handed the opportunity to make amends, with Hasenh\u00fcttl admitting during the week that a great deal of soul-searching had taken place since that night in October. The decision to revert to his favoured 4-2-2-2 formation has paid real dividends in recent weeks as they have moved away from relegation trouble, thanks largely to increased solidity in defence. Jamie Vardy\u2019s absence for the wins over West Ham and Newcastle after his wife gave birth to a daughter on New Year\u2019s Day showed that Leicester do not necessarily rely on their talismanic striker, although they are a significantly better side when he is in the team. Rodgers expressed his doubts this week whether the 33-year-old would go back on his decision to retire from international football despite the potential opportunity to earn a recall from Gareth Southgate for this summer\u2019s European Championship. Ings could end up being the main beneficiary if he continues to find the net as consistently as he has this season but he failed to make the most of his first opportunity in the sixth minute after a risky back pass from Harvey Barnes. Southampton were made to pay for their profligacy when a quickly taken free-kick from Ayoze P\u00e9rez picked out Vardy\u2019s run down the left and his cross left Praet with a simple tap-in at the far post for his first goal since his \u00a318m move from Sampdoria in the summer.

Vardy then saw his effort correctly ruled out for offside but it was the visitors who should have gone in ahead at half-time. Ings struck the woodwork twice in the space of 60 seconds after Schmeichel had come to Leicester\u2019s rescue again, with Rodgers looking relieved as the second effort from long range bounced away to safety. The absence of midfield linchpin Wilfred Ndidi, who is set to be sidelined for a month with a knee injury, seemed to hamper the usually fluent hosts in the first period and in swirling wind and rain both sides found conditions difficult. VAR then came to Leicester\u2019s rescue when Shane Long was adjudged to be marginally offside from Armstrong\u2019s through ball before being brought down by Caglar Soyuncu for a penalty, while Kelechi Iheanacho was also correctly denied at the other end for the same offence. But it was another substitute, Che Adams, who provided what proved to be the decisive moment with a perfect pass for Ings to seal the most unlikely of comebacks and a fifth win in Southampton\u2019s last six matches in all competitions. \u201cThe guys left everything on the pitch,\u201d said Hasenh\u00fcttl. \u201cWith the special history of this game we pushed a lot of good buttons during the week, otherwise this kind of performance was not possible.

Burnley were brushed aside with ease and, while Lampard was disappointed not to see more goals, there was plenty to admire about Chelsea\u2019s forward play. Tammy Abraham, leading the line intelligently, notched his 15th goal of a productive campaign and Lampard was delighted to see Callum Hudson-Odoi, a young winger of rich promise, score for the first time in the Premier League after showing the positivity to gamble on C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta\u2019s cross drifting to the far post.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just what was needed in terms of performance and result,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt was so positive from minute one.

Chelsea had the look of a team playing on the edge when the game was goalless and were relieved when Jeff Hendrick\u2019s header was ruled out for the tightest of offside calls against Ben Mee. The linesman\u2019s flag had gone up when Mee headed on Dwight McNeil\u2019s free-kick for Hendrick to turn in from close range and there was an anxious wait for Chelsea before a VAR review confirmed the initial decision was correct.</p> <p>Lampard was full of nervous energy on the touchline. He urged his players to maintain a brisk tempo during the early stages and applauded the way Barkley and Jorginho stretched the play with quick switches to the flanks. Reece James was a dangerous outlet, charging forward from right-back. Chelsea\u2019s positivity was rewarded when Willian scuttled into the area before tumbling over a lunge from Matthew Lowton, Burnley\u2019s right-back. Jorginho opened the scoring in the 27th minute, sending Nick Pope the wrong way with a cool penalty.</p> <p>Burnley had chances to equalise. McNeil saw a low free-kick tipped wide by Kepa Arrizabalaga and they almost scored from the resulting corner, only for Barkley to clear Mee\u2019s header off the line. Chelsea\u2019s defence still looked suspect in the air, though Lampard was encouraged to see Andreas Christensen take his chance on his first league start since the 3-1 defeat by Everton on 7 December.

The Home Office does not disclose how child refugees reached the UK.</p> <p>Giulia Tranchina, a solicitor at <a href=\"https://www.wilsonllp.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wilson</a>, has worked on at least 50 child refugee cases with each one involving illegal entry via lorry. \u201cAll were traumatised with psychiatric issues, most have PTSD and all had endured awful experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cMany had also been tortured. They would try for months to make it by lorry, sleeping in parks or on the streets by day and then making their way to lorry parks at night. Older boys and adults would show them how to jump.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor Simon, a solicitor from <a href=\"https://www.childrenslegalcentre.com/\" title=\"\">Coram Children\u2019s Legal Centre</a> in London has represented dozens of child refugees with the \u201cvast majority\u201d arriving by lorry.</p> <p>\u201cOne made it to the UK by clinging to the wheel arch of a coach, centimetres from the engine and at risk of falling under the wheel at any moment. Another came in a freezer container and spent the whole journey thinking he would die,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Mark Housby, senior caseworker at<a href=\"http://www.swllc.org/\" title=\"\"> South West London Law Centres</a> has represented 12 unaccompanied minors since June with all but one arriving by lorry. His colleague, senior solicitor Rajitha Kumar, is currently representing 33 unaccompanied minors of which 27 travelled by lorry. Another caseworker, Pradeep Kumar, has represented 18 minors since March with just two arriving legally through a government scheme from Greece.</p> <p>\u201cSome have distressing experiences in France and other EU countries. Some did not find any major difference between the persecutors they fled from and the authorities who dealt with them during their journey to the UK,\u201d said Kumar.</p> <p>Such accounts, said Walker, articulated how children are risking their lives because there are not enough safe and legal routes to reach the UK to seek asylum. \u201cInstead of hiding behind misleading stats, the government must recognise it has a responsibility to help children safely claim asylum in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office came in for renewed criticism on Saturday when a coalition of human rights organisations accused it of deliberately and destructively preventing child refugees from being reunited with their families.</p> <p>Criticising last week\u2019s parliamentary vote which blocked the rights of child refugees being reunited with family members living in the UK, Amnesty International UK, Refugee Council and Save the Children said it constituted a \u201cflagrant breach of international law, causing irreversible harm to children in this country\u201d.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThose who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach \u2013 that is the fastest route to safety. There are a number of safe and legal routes available to provide protection for the most vulnerable refugees, including children.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 10,000 unaccompanied children are believed to have entered the UK over the past decade using dangerous methods such as hiding in the back of a lorry according to new analysis that raises fresh scrutiny over the Home Office\u2019s approach towards helping young refugees. Although the Home Office cites the volume of arrivals as proof of its compassion, lawyers accuse it of being disingenuous and say that in reality 90% of the minors have illegally entered the UK and done so by risking their lives. The research, by legal charity Safe Passage, follows last week\u2019s vote in the Commons which rejected proposals to keep protections for child refugees in the redrafted EU withdrawal agreement bill. Latest official statistics reveal that 12,248 unaccompanied minors have been granted protection in the UK since 2010, a number the Home Office says shows off its \u201cproud record of helping vulnerable children\u201d. However, only 700 or so have arrived through government schemes that guarantee the safety of minors. Jennine Walker, head of UK legal and arrivals at Safe Passage, said: \u201cIt beggars belief that the government is proudly proclaiming it has helped thousands of children, when so many of those have endured horrendous journeys just to reach our shores.\u201d An audit of law firms who represent asylum-seeking children suggests that nine out of 10 unaccompanied minors who have illegally entered the UK did so by lorry. The Home Office does not disclose how child refugees reached the UK. Giulia Tranchina, a solicitor at Wilson, has worked on at least 50 child refugee cases with each one involving illegal entry via lorry. \u201cAll were traumatised with psychiatric issues, most have PTSD and all had endured awful experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cMany had also been tortured. They would try for months to make it by lorry, sleeping in parks or on the streets by day and then making their way to lorry parks at night. Older boys and adults would show them how to jump.\u201d Eleanor Simon, a solicitor from Coram Children\u2019s Legal Centre in London has represented dozens of child refugees with the \u201cvast majority\u201d arriving by lorry. \u201cOne made it to the UK by clinging to the wheel arch of a coach, centimetres from the engine and at risk of falling under the wheel at any moment. Another came in a freezer container and spent the whole journey thinking he would die,\u201d she said. Mark Housby, senior caseworker at South West London Law Centres has represented 12 unaccompanied minors since June with all but one arriving by lorry. His colleague, senior solicitor Rajitha Kumar, is currently representing 33 unaccompanied minors of which 27 travelled by lorry. Another caseworker, Pradeep Kumar, has represented 18 minors since March with just two arriving legally through a government scheme from Greece. \u201cSome have distressing experiences in France and other EU countries. Some did not find any major difference between the persecutors they fled from and the authorities who dealt with them during their journey to the UK,\u201d said Kumar. Such accounts, said Walker, articulated how children are risking their lives because there are not enough safe and legal routes to reach the UK to seek asylum. \u201cInstead of hiding behind misleading stats, the government must recognise it has a responsibility to help children safely claim asylum in the UK.\u201d The Home Office came in for renewed criticism on Saturday when a coalition of human rights organisations accused it of deliberately and destructively preventing child refugees from being reunited with their families. Criticising last week\u2019s parliamentary vote which blocked the rights of child refugees being reunited with family members living in the UK, Amnesty International UK, Refugee Council and Save the Children said it constituted a \u201cflagrant breach of international law, causing irreversible harm to children in this country\u201d. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThose who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach \u2013 that is the fastest route to safety. There are a number of safe and legal routes available to provide protection for the most vulnerable refugees, including children.\u201d",

The US is more focused nowadays on China as an economic and military rival, and on defending its interests across the Asia-Pacific region, than on curbing Russian influence or fixing the Middle East.

Trump craves the kudos of brokering a peace deal in Palestine. But Beijing\u2019s military expansionism, its belt and road \u201cdebt diplomacy\u201d, open trade lanes in the South China Sea, and democracy in Taiwan and Hong Kong are Washington\u2019s bigger, long-term concerns.</p> <p>On the Iranian side, the demand that the Americans leave does not arise simply from old grievances dating back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup\" title=\"\">1953 coup </a>against the democratically elected prime minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, although they play a part.

As Trump\u2019s commitment to regional security appeared to wane last year, for example, Saudi Arabia and Qatar took steps to patch up their differences.</p> <p>Shared security concerns have led to ongoing, informal contacts between Arab states and Israel, notwithstanding \u2013 or possibly because of \u2013 Trump\u2019s bias against Palestine. </p> <p>If the US is no longer seen as a reliable defender of its friends, and if it no longer needs or wants to be in the Middle East \u2013 then surely it is time to leave. Yet if the Americans did pull out, what would happen?</p> <h2>1. Iraq and Syria<br></h2> <p>Recent events in Iraq and Syria do not encourage confidence in a post-American future. After the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011, the US and its Gulf allies backed disparate rebel forces. But some of these groups harboured jihadists and extremists, which bolstered Bashar al-Assad\u2019s claims to be fighting terrorists and divided the resistance.</p> <p>The US withdrew its support for the rebels. It also declined to intervene directly when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a>\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons use was crossed. Trump has since hastened American disengagement, notably by abandoning Syrian Kurd allies. Russia filled the vacuum, and is now winning the war for Assad with a <a href=\"https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2020/1/6/Civilians-displacement-Idlib-Syrian-forces\" title=\"\">merciless bombardment of Idlib</a>. </p> <p>Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, US forces officially left in 2011, but in fact several thousand remain, primarily tasked with fighting Isis. Following the Suleimani killing, Iraq\u2019s parliament demanded all US troops leave. But there are signs of second thoughts, amid doubts over the ability of Iraq\u2019s politicians and security forces to hold a divided country together while containing Isis. Syria is a chilling reminder of what can happen when the US turns its back and walks away.</p> <h2>2 Israel</h2> <p>A wholesale US military pull-back would be a traumatic experience for Israel, and one it would try to avoid. The Jewish state has been surrounded by enemies since its conception. Although proudly self-reliant in defence, a symbolic weakening of America\u2019s protective shield would be a blow that could encourage the country\u2019s foes.</p> <p>For these and other reasons, any US regional troop drawdown would almost certainly be accompanied by additional American security guarantees for Israel, possibly including a mutual defence treaty as recently proposed by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. <a href=\"https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/12/08/is-now-the-right-time-for-a-us-israel-defense-pact/\" title=\"\">Israel\u2019s supporters in Congress </a>would ensure the country was not abandoned.</p> <p>At the same time, such a shift could force a much-needed reset for Israel\u2019s political stalemate, undermining the Trump-backed, nationalist hard-right \u2013 typified by Netanyahu \u2013 and opening the way for a centrist coalition more prepared, for example, to cut an equitable two-state deal with the Palestinians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/archive-zip/giv-3902uxJHqara7jPx/\" data-alt=\"Troop numbers map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/archive-zip/giv-3902uxJHqara7jPx/\">Troop numbers map</a> </figure>  <h2>3 Afghanistan</h2> <p>The seemingly endless conflict in Afghanistan, which began with the US invasion after the al-Qaida attacks in September 2001, has been a particular bugbear of Trump\u2019s. He says, not without reason, that billions of dollars have been wasted on a chaotic and often corrupt nation-building exercise that has failed to bring security or effective democratic government and caused record levels of civilian casualties.</p> <p>Trump began in 2017 by sending additional troops, like Obama before him. When that did not work, he resorted to secret negotiations with the Taliban that led to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/donald-trump-cancelled-taliban-talks-camp-david-typical-hot-cold\" title=\"\">aborted peace summit</a> at Camp David. The basic problem was familiar: the Taliban insisted US troops must agree to leave before they would accept a ceasefire or talk to the Afghan government.</p> <p>Since the Taliban are unlikely to relent, Trump or his successor will probably be forced eventually to order a withdrawal, even if it leads to a fundamentalist takeover. The problem, in such a case, is that many of the gains made by Afghans will be lost, and their sacrifices over nearly 20 years worth nought.</p> <h2>4 Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states</h2> <p>The shock of large-scale US downsizing would be felt most keenly here. The modern-day prosperity and influence of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait have been underwritten by American security guarantees, exemplified by the 1990-91 US-led intervention to expel Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion forces from Kuwait.</p> <p>Without the Americans to hold their hands and watch their backs, the Saudi royals\u2019 behaviour could improve significantly. No more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/10/lebanese-leaders-step-up-demands-for-return-of-saad-hariri-resignation-saudi\" title=\"\">kidnappings of Lebanese prime ministers</a>, for example, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\" title=\"\">murders of high-profile journalists</a>. Military adventurism of the type that produced the humanitarian disaster in Yemen would be less likely.</p> <p>The Saudis and the smaller Gulf states, although better armed than Iran, might also be incentivised by American disengagement to take a more conciliatory line towards Tehran \u2013 something that has reportedly already been happening in recent months.</p> <p>On the other hand, they might look around for new protectors \u2013 in the shape of Russia or China, a big Gulf oil customer. No US president could easily countenance such a loss of influence \u2013 nor the loss of lucrative Arab world investments and weapons sales. Getting out is not as simple as Trump might think.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77020718011b4998f6b90f8adbad18b9605cc9ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77020718011b4998f6b90f8adbad18b9605cc9ce/0_0_4708_2826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest against the US killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in the Philippines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest against the US killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in the Philippines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark R Cristino/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5 Terrorism and anti-Americanism</h2> <p>A reduction in the US regional profile could be expected, over time, to bring reductions in anti-Americanism and the targeting of American and allied interests by terrorists who regard the US presence as an affront to the entire Islamic world. A key source of tension with the west might be removed.</p> <p>On the other hand, any loss of US leadership in fighting Isis and successors would be serious. Nato might step into the breach, as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-nato/trump-floats-expanding-nato-to-add-middle-east-idUSKBN1Z82D4\" title=\"\">Trump last week suggested</a> it should. Regional organisations such as the Gulf Cooperation Council and the EU could invest more in security, shared defence and intelligence capabilities \u2013 which might be no bad thing.</p> <p>A lowered profile might also reduce tensions with Turkey which, although nominally an ally, has grown impatient with an \u201carrogant\u201d America. And it could force dictatorships such as Egypt\u2019s, underwritten by Washington, to change their ways \u2013 to the undoubted benefit of all the peoples of the Middle East.</p> <p>Quite how this imagined loss of control, this demotion from hegemon to the status of ordinary country, this ending of the era of American exceptionalism might affect the US itself is an intriguing question. Coming down in the world is a hard thing to stomach. Seventy years on, Britain has still not recovered from its loss of empire. Could America\u2019s self-image cope with such a relegation? Could Trump?</p>",

But some of these groups harboured jihadists and extremists, which bolstered Bashar al-Assad\u2019s claims to be fighting terrorists and divided the resistance. The US withdrew its support for the rebels. It also declined to intervene directly when Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons use was crossed. Trump has since hastened American disengagement, notably by abandoning Syrian Kurd allies. Russia filled the vacuum, and is now winning the war for Assad with a merciless bombardment of Idlib. Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, US forces officially left in 2011, but in fact several thousand remain, primarily tasked with fighting Isis. Following the Suleimani killing, Iraq\u2019s parliament demanded all US troops leave. But there are signs of second thoughts, amid doubts over the ability of Iraq\u2019s politicians and security forces to hold a divided country together while containing Isis. Syria is a chilling reminder of what can happen when the US turns its back and walks away. 2 Israel A wholesale US military pull-back would be a traumatic experience for Israel, and one it would try to avoid. The Jewish state has been surrounded by enemies since its conception. Although proudly self-reliant in defence, a symbolic weakening of America\u2019s protective shield would be a blow that could encourage the country\u2019s foes. For these and other reasons, any US regional troop drawdown would almost certainly be accompanied by additional American security guarantees for Israel, possibly including a mutual defence treaty as recently proposed by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel\u2019s supporters in Congress would ensure the country was not abandoned. At the same time, such a shift could force a much-needed reset for Israel\u2019s political stalemate, undermining the Trump-backed, nationalist hard-right \u2013 typified by Netanyahu \u2013 and opening the way for a centrist coalition more prepared, for example, to cut an equitable two-state deal with the Palestinians. 3 Afghanistan The seemingly endless conflict in Afghanistan, which began with the US invasion after the al-Qaida attacks in September 2001, has been a particular bugbear of Trump\u2019s. He says, not without reason, that billions of dollars have been wasted on a chaotic and often corrupt nation-building exercise that has failed to bring security or effective democratic government and caused record levels of civilian casualties. Trump began in 2017 by sending additional troops, like Obama before him. When that did not work, he resorted to secret negotiations with the Taliban that led to an aborted peace summit at Camp David. The basic problem was familiar: the Taliban insisted US troops must agree to leave before they would accept a ceasefire or talk to the Afghan government. Since the Taliban are unlikely to relent, Trump or his successor will probably be forced eventually to order a withdrawal, even if it leads to a fundamentalist takeover. The problem, in such a case, is that many of the gains made by Afghans will be lost, and their sacrifices over nearly 20 years worth nought. 4 Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states The shock of large-scale US downsizing would be felt most keenly here. The modern-day prosperity and influence of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait have been underwritten by American security guarantees, exemplified by the 1990-91 US-led intervention to expel Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion forces from Kuwait. Without the Americans to hold their hands and watch their backs, the Saudi royals\u2019 behaviour could improve significantly. No more kidnappings of Lebanese prime ministers, for example, or murders of high-profile journalists. Military adventurism of the type that produced the humanitarian disaster in Yemen would be less likely. The Saudis and the smaller Gulf states, although better armed than Iran, might also be incentivised by American disengagement to take a more conciliatory line towards Tehran \u2013 something that has reportedly already been happening in recent months. On the other hand, they might look around for new protectors \u2013 in the shape of Russia or China, a big Gulf oil customer. No US president could easily countenance such a loss of influence \u2013 nor the loss of lucrative Arab world investments and weapons sales. Getting out is not as simple as Trump might think. 5 Terrorism and anti-Americanism A reduction in the US regional profile could be expected, over time, to bring reductions in anti-Americanism and the targeting of American and allied interests by terrorists who regard the US presence as an affront to the entire Islamic world. A key source of tension with the west might be removed. On the other hand, any loss of US leadership in fighting Isis and successors would be serious. Nato might step into the breach, as Trump last week suggested it should. Regional organisations such as the Gulf Cooperation Council and the EU could invest more in security, shared defence and intelligence capabilities \u2013 which might be no bad thing. A lowered profile might also reduce tensions with Turkey which, although nominally an ally, has grown impatient with an \u201carrogant\u201d America. And it could force dictatorships such as Egypt\u2019s, underwritten by Washington, to change their ways \u2013 to the undoubted benefit of all the peoples of the Middle East. Quite how this imagined loss of control, this demotion from hegemon to the status of ordinary country, this ending of the era of American exceptionalism might affect the US itself is an intriguing question. Coming down in the world is a hard thing to stomach. Seventy years on, Britain has still not recovered from its loss of empire. Could America\u2019s self-image cope with such a relegation? Could Trump?",

      "body": "<p>The justice campaigner Gina Miller won two landmark legal victories that forced the government to be accountable to parliament over Brexit. Her autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/23/rise-gina-miller-review-woman-defeated-government-article-50\" title=\"\"><em>Rise</em></a>, charts an extraordinary life of challenges faced and traumas overcome, including harassment and violence. She was born in British Guiana, daughter of Doodnauth Singh, who educated himself despite modest beginnings to become attorney general of independent Guyana. She has lived in Britain since she was 11.</p> <p><strong>In your new year Twitter message, </strong><strong>you quoted </strong><strong>Maya Angelou</strong><strong> about the need \u201cto step off the road in a new direction\u201d. Is that how</strong><strong> you feel?</strong><br>I chose it because what I\u2019m finding quite worrying is that \u2013 on all sides \u2013 we seem to be stuck in a rut psychologically, emotionally and intellectually. And that\u2019s not a good thing. The time for reflection didn\u2019t seem to happen over Christmas. Maybe people still need to vent the anger before we move on. But we still seem to be stuck in these silos.</p> <p><strong>Is the Brexit chapter over for you?</strong><br>Brexit is going to happen. But my approach was always to insist that we mustn\u2019t throw out our constitution with Brexit. The danger of that now is even greater, because we now have what could be a very autocratic government, with both opposition parties falling apart as they try and figure out their way forward. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the battleground shifts. It\u2019s no longer about Europe \u2013 it is actually about our country. How do we preserve Britain as a tolerant place when we don\u2019t have Europe to blame for our problems any more?</p> <p><strong>One of the things that has struck me is how vulnerable our institutions might be in the absence of a written constitution \u2013 is that a likely focus of your campaigning?</strong><br>Yes, you could say the American forefathers wrote their constitution with someone like Trump in mind. We don\u2019t have that. So to my mind, we need to start a conversation about how we keep the flexibility of an unwritten constitution, but maintain certainty in human rights and control executive power. Is there something that can sit between a representative democracy and direct democracy, which gives people more say?</p> <p><strong>You obviously had high hopes for tactical voting to be more effective than it was in the election. Do you think it can ever work in our system?</strong><br>Tactical voting in our country is not new. In 1997, it was very effective. But it only works when you have an alternative that people will vote for. We\u2019ve now had our data back and what is extraordinary is the number of people who did switch \u2013 on both sides. People were very open to the idea of lending their vote. But what happened was there was a very significant shift [in voting intentions] on the weekend before the election. We still don\u2019t know why. But on the Monday, we knew we\u2019d lost and it looked like 30 to 40 seats. In fact, it was more.</p> <p><strong>What do you think happened \u2013 a wave of targeted advertising like that which </strong><strong>Dominic Cummings used in the referendum</strong><strong>?</strong><br>We think something like that. We were listening very closely to all social media, using very sophisticated scraping methods, and this word \u201csafety\u201d started appearing in those conversations that weekend. Not \u201csecurity\u201d but \u201csafety\u201d, which is a very emotive word, particularly in relation to family. We still don\u2019t know what the Tory campaign was \u2013 because if it\u2019s being fed through the dark web or inside Facebook campaigns, we can\u2019t see it. But that word kept coming up. People who seemed prepared to hold their nose and vote Labour were suddenly not prepared to do so.</p> <p><strong>Where were you on the night of the election?</strong><br>I was on the BBC when the result was finally confirmed. The thoughts that kept going through my mind were: how is he going to deliver to this broad church of voters? And what happens when he doesn\u2019t? How much more anger will there be?</p> <p><strong>They are not frightened of stirring up anger, it seems. They seem to believe that they can manipulate it.</strong><br>I wonder how short-sighted that is. It is like winding up a spinning top: you have to eventually let go. You can\u2019t predict how people will display their anger. If you no longer have the EU as the bogeyman, who will take its place? I have already seen many worrying signs that those perceived to be immigrants and foreigners are getting more abuse. I am getting emails from people who have lived here for 40 years and have been told in a supermarket queue to go back home. If you no longer have Brussels to blame, you start to blame the person next door. And then to have someone like Nigel Farage saying there is going to be this big celebration party on 31 January, this is all stoking those flames.</p> <p><strong>Mind you, if his previous celebrations are anything to go by, only a handful are likely to turn up\u2026 </strong><br>That\u2019s true.

      "bodyText": "The justice campaigner Gina Miller won two landmark legal victories that forced the government to be accountable to parliament over Brexit. Her autobiography, Rise, charts an extraordinary life of challenges faced and traumas overcome, including harassment and violence. She was born in British Guiana, daughter of Doodnauth Singh, who educated himself despite modest beginnings to become attorney general of independent Guyana. She has lived in Britain since she was 11. In your new year Twitter message, you quoted Maya Angelou about the need \u201cto step off the road in a new direction\u201d. Is that how you feel? I chose it because what I\u2019m finding quite worrying is that \u2013 on all sides \u2013 we seem to be stuck in a rut psychologically, emotionally and intellectually. And that\u2019s not a good thing. The time for reflection didn\u2019t seem to happen over Christmas. Maybe people still need to vent the anger before we move on. But we still seem to be stuck in these silos. Is the Brexit chapter over for you? Brexit is going to happen. But my approach was always to insist that we mustn\u2019t throw out our constitution with Brexit. The danger of that now is even greater, because we now have what could be a very autocratic government, with both opposition parties falling apart as they try and figure out their way forward. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the battleground shifts. It\u2019s no longer about Europe \u2013 it is actually about our country. How do we preserve Britain as a tolerant place when we don\u2019t have Europe to blame for our problems any more? One of the things that has struck me is how vulnerable our institutions might be in the absence of a written constitution \u2013 is that a likely focus of your campaigning? Yes, you could say the American forefathers wrote their constitution with someone like Trump in mind. We don\u2019t have that. So to my mind, we need to start a conversation about how we keep the flexibility of an unwritten constitution, but maintain certainty in human rights and control executive power. Is there something that can sit between a representative democracy and direct democracy, which gives people more say? You obviously had high hopes for tactical voting to be more effective than it was in the election. Do you think it can ever work in our system? Tactical voting in our country is not new. In 1997, it was very effective. But it only works when you have an alternative that people will vote for. We\u2019ve now had our data back and what is extraordinary is the number of people who did switch \u2013 on both sides. People were very open to the idea of lending their vote. But what happened was there was a very significant shift [in voting intentions] on the weekend before the election. We still don\u2019t know why. But on the Monday, we knew we\u2019d lost and it looked like 30 to 40 seats. In fact, it was more. What do you think happened \u2013 a wave of targeted advertising like that which Dominic Cummings used in the referendum? We think something like that. We were listening very closely to all social media, using very sophisticated scraping methods, and this word \u201csafety\u201d started appearing in those conversations that weekend. Not \u201csecurity\u201d but \u201csafety\u201d, which is a very emotive word, particularly in relation to family. We still don\u2019t know what the Tory campaign was \u2013 because if it\u2019s being fed through the dark web or inside Facebook campaigns, we can\u2019t see it. But that word kept coming up. People who seemed prepared to hold their nose and vote Labour were suddenly not prepared to do so. Where were you on the night of the election? I was on the BBC when the result was finally confirmed. The thoughts that kept going through my mind were: how is he going to deliver to this broad church of voters? And what happens when he doesn\u2019t? How much more anger will there be? They are not frightened of stirring up anger, it seems. They seem to believe that they can manipulate it. I wonder how short-sighted that is. It is like winding up a spinning top: you have to eventually let go. You can\u2019t predict how people will display their anger. If you no longer have the EU as the bogeyman, who will take its place? I have already seen many worrying signs that those perceived to be immigrants and foreigners are getting more abuse. I am getting emails from people who have lived here for 40 years and have been told in a supermarket queue to go back home. If you no longer have Brussels to blame, you start to blame the person next door. And then to have someone like Nigel Farage saying there is going to be this big celebration party on 31 January, this is all stoking those flames. Mind you, if his previous celebrations are anything to go by, only a handful are likely to turn up\u2026 That\u2019s true. But the government is prepared to carry on this tokenism as well. They have the new Brexit coin coming out. Will we have a new plane for Boris emblazoned with the British flag, a new royal yacht commissioned? All that playing to the gallery just heightens those divisions. You have been a lightning rod for a lot of those divisions and the subject of disgraceful abuse and threats. Are you able to walk down the street now? No, I have to be really careful. I hoped that it would dissipate, but if anything it has got more ugly. I have stepped back from social media, but I keep an eye on it and there has been a huge increase in the number of people who are being extremely aggressive and threatening, both sexually and physically.

As a club we\u2019ve got to stick together, we\u2019ve got to be united, we are a family.

The key was pace: of thought and execution.</p> \n<p>United\u2019s opener was impressive. If Juan Mata\u2019s sluggish speed means he has become a squad player his vision is not in doubt. So it was that he could send a curving ball that sliced open the defence and allowed Rashford to hit an aerial finish past Tim Krul.</p> \n<p>United had clicked into a higher gear. The excellent Brandon Williams roved inside, fed Fred and the midfielder took aim. A Rashford sprint along the right ended with a cross that splayed Norwich. Later, he sprayed a 30-yard diagonal from the other wing straight into Aaron Wan-Bissaka\u2019s path.</p> \n<p>On the touchline Mike Phelan, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s assistant, was a head-in-hands embodiment of United\u2019s frustration they had still not doubled their advantage.</p> \n<p>Without David de Gea they would have conceded an equaliser just before the break, too. When Norwich broke quickly Emiliano Buend\u00eda was allowed to dance across the face of the area and feed Todd Cantwell and only an outstanding save sustained United\u2019s lead.</p> \n<p>They heeded the warning and attacked from the start of the second half and were rewarded almost instantly. Maguire fed Rashford and he played the ball in behind to the galloping Williams. The 19-year-old\u2019s pace took him past Krul who upended him and the referee, Anthony Taylor, awarded the penalty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/11/tottenham-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">Tottenham v Liverpool: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rashford smashed the ball home and United were soon poised to go 3-0 ahead. This was courtesy of another deft Mata ball \u2013 from a short corner \u2013 that had Anthony Martial leaping between Grant Hanley and Alexander Tettey to head in.</p> \n<p>Williams should have made it four as Norwich fell apart. Fred chipped a pass to Martial along the right and he relayed the ball to Andreas Pereira. He flipped a delivery across goal and the left-back\u2019s 50-yard run finished with him somehow missing from mere inches.</p> \n<p>After Daniel James replaced Rashford, United hunted for more goals to boost their confidence. Mason Greenwood \u2013 on for Pereira \u2013 delivered, beating Krul with an impressive 20-yard finish.</p> \n<p>Daniel Farke, whose side remain bottom, said: \u201cIt is not easy for the belief or the confidence. But it is important to be realistic. It was not a season-defining game for us.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Marcus Rashford decorated his 200th Manchester United appearance with a two-goal display of menace that ensured victory over a hapless Norwich. The forward was taken off just before the hour and headed for the changing room. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cWhat an achievement to get to 200 games at his age. He is absolutely top-class to work with. A great kid, wants to learn, improve, knows to keep his feet on the ground and today he\u2019s carrying a few knocks but no chance he\u2019s going to say to me before the game he doesn\u2019t want to play.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r is unsure whether Rashford will be able to face Wolves in Wednesday\u2019s FA Cup third-round replay. \u201cI don\u2019t know but if he\u2019s ready he\u2019s played many games so [we] might have to look at how we can manage him,\u201d the manager said. Midway through the second half the singing section were heard chanting against Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, and owners, the Glazers. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the players will get it but I noticed. As a club we\u2019ve got to stick together, we\u2019ve got to be united, we are a family. I can only say from when I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve been backed by the owners, I\u2019ve been backed by Ed and they\u2019re supporting me. \u201cWe are in all competitions. We are still in the Carabao Cup, FA Cup, we\u2019re fifth in the league, still challenging, we\u2019ve improved the position from last season, we\u2019ve got the Europa League. \u201cThey\u2019ve [the fans] just got to believe me when I say I feel we are doing loads of good things behind the scenes, we are going in the right direction. \u201cSee the group today \u2013 the attitude, the work-rate, that\u2019s the core of the group that\u2019s going to go forward.\u201d Harry Maguire was a headline inclusion \u2013 the captain recovering quickly from a hip problem \u2013 as United were bright throughout. The key was pace: of thought and execution. United\u2019s opener was impressive. If Juan Mata\u2019s sluggish speed means he has become a squad player his vision is not in doubt. So it was that he could send a curving ball that sliced open the defence and allowed Rashford to hit an aerial finish past Tim Krul. United had clicked into a higher gear. The excellent Brandon Williams roved inside, fed Fred and the midfielder took aim. A Rashford sprint along the right ended with a cross that splayed Norwich. Later, he sprayed a 30-yard diagonal from the other wing straight into Aaron Wan-Bissaka\u2019s path. On the touchline Mike Phelan, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s assistant, was a head-in-hands embodiment of United\u2019s frustration they had still not doubled their advantage. Without David de Gea they would have conceded an equaliser just before the break, too. When Norwich broke quickly Emiliano Buend\u00eda was allowed to dance across the face of the area and feed Todd Cantwell and only an outstanding save sustained United\u2019s lead. They heeded the warning and attacked from the start of the second half and were rewarded almost instantly. Maguire fed Rashford and he played the ball in behind to the galloping Williams. The 19-year-old\u2019s pace took him past Krul who upended him and the referee, Anthony Taylor, awarded the penalty. Rashford smashed the ball home and United were soon poised to go 3-0 ahead. This was courtesy of another deft Mata ball \u2013 from a short corner \u2013 that had Anthony Martial leaping between Grant Hanley and Alexander Tettey to head in. Williams should have made it four as Norwich fell apart. Fred chipped a pass to Martial along the right and he relayed the ball to Andreas Pereira. He flipped a delivery across goal and the left-back\u2019s 50-yard run finished with him somehow missing from mere inches. After Daniel James replaced Rashford, United hunted for more goals to boost their confidence. Mason Greenwood \u2013 on for Pereira \u2013 delivered, beating Krul with an impressive 20-yard finish. Daniel Farke, whose side remain bottom, said: \u201cIt is not easy for the belief or the confidence. But it is important to be realistic. It was not a season-defining game for us.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The trade war with China is over; long live the trade war. That is the message from Donald Trump as the US president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/31/donald-trump-says-he-will-sign-first-phase-of-us-china-trade-deal\" title=\"\">promotes a pact with Beijing</a> that has both settled the frayed nerves of traders across the world\u2019s financial markets and put those same traders on notice that the battle will continue for years to come.</p> <p>This week the White House is expected to publish details of a first- phase deal that cuts the import tariffs from 15% to 7.5% on more than $100bn of Chinese imports as soon as the agreement is implemented. The deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, although Trump said on Friday it might be \u201cshortly thereafter\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, China has agreed to spend at least $200bn a year on US produce, which cheered American farmers, who have been effectively locked out of China\u2019s vast food market for more than 18 months.</p> <p>And since 1 January, China has paved the way for an agreement that will cut tariffs on more than 850 products, from frozen pork to semiconductors. Calculations by Bloomberg showed that the tariff <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-23/china-to-cut-tariffs-on-goods-including-pork-tech-items\" title=\"\">cuts will affect almost $400bn</a> (\u00a3309bn) of foreign goods sold to China annually, out of its total import bill of $2tn. In addition, tariffs that Trump and trade representative Robert Lighthizer threatened to impose on mobile phones, laptops and other hi-tech products made in China will no longer apply.</p> <p>As a truce, it works to calm an increasingly volatile situation ahead of what is expected to be a bruising election year. But it leaves much of the new high-tariff infrastructure in place. For instance, a 25% levy by the US on $250bn of Chinese goods \u2013 mostly parts for goods assembled in US factories \u2013 remains in effect.</p> <p>Across the spectrum of imported goods, the average tariff on Chinese goods will fall to 19.3% \u2013 which is more than six times what it stood at before the trade war began in 2018, and still seven percentage points higher than a year ago, according to the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p> <p>David Dollar, a China expert at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, says the main benefit of the first-stage deal is that it puts an end to the almost monthly escalation of tariffs seen last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of disruption and pain, and there hasn\u2019t been a lot of progress on the most important issues</p> <footer> <cite>Scott Paul, Alliance for American Manufacturing</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He says the momentum for at least a temporary cessation of hostilities was huge after Trump realised his campaign was costing US businesses billions of dollars.</p> <p>\u201cThe trade war with China has been a sobering experience for the White House,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump\u2019s staff believed tariffs would be a win-win and there would be a boost for domestic firms as well as a hit to China, but the first thing just didn\u2019t happen.

      "bodyText": "The trade war with China is over; long live the trade war. That is the message from Donald Trump as the US president promotes a pact with Beijing that has both settled the frayed nerves of traders across the world\u2019s financial markets and put those same traders on notice that the battle will continue for years to come. This week the White House is expected to publish details of a first- phase deal that cuts the import tariffs from 15% to 7.5% on more than $100bn of Chinese imports as soon as the agreement is implemented. The deal is expected to be signed on Wednesday, although Trump said on Friday it might be \u201cshortly thereafter\u201d. Meanwhile, China has agreed to spend at least $200bn a year on US produce, which cheered American farmers, who have been effectively locked out of China\u2019s vast food market for more than 18 months. And since 1 January, China has paved the way for an agreement that will cut tariffs on more than 850 products, from frozen pork to semiconductors. Calculations by Bloomberg showed that the tariff cuts will affect almost $400bn (\u00a3309bn) of foreign goods sold to China annually, out of its total import bill of $2tn. In addition, tariffs that Trump and trade representative Robert Lighthizer threatened to impose on mobile phones, laptops and other hi-tech products made in China will no longer apply. As a truce, it works to calm an increasingly volatile situation ahead of what is expected to be a bruising election year. But it leaves much of the new high-tariff infrastructure in place. For instance, a 25% levy by the US on $250bn of Chinese goods \u2013 mostly parts for goods assembled in US factories \u2013 remains in effect. Across the spectrum of imported goods, the average tariff on Chinese goods will fall to 19.3% \u2013 which is more than six times what it stood at before the trade war began in 2018, and still seven percentage points higher than a year ago, according to the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics. David Dollar, a China expert at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, says the main benefit of the first-stage deal is that it puts an end to the almost monthly escalation of tariffs seen last year. He says the momentum for at least a temporary cessation of hostilities was huge after Trump realised his campaign was costing US businesses billions of dollars. \u201cThe trade war with China has been a sobering experience for the White House,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump\u2019s staff believed tariffs would be a win-win and there would be a boost for domestic firms as well as a hit to China, but the first thing just didn\u2019t happen. For the past year, US manufacturing has been in recession and shedding jobs, despite the president\u2019s tweets to the contrary.\u201d Caterpillar, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, has seen profits squeezed both directly and indirectly by the trade war. For more than a year, the company\u2019s US-made diggers were slapped with a 40% tariff by Beijing, and at the same time the firm was coping with a 25% tariff on parts made in China and destined for US assembly plants. The China tariff has fallen back to 15% since last summer, boosting Caterpillar\u2019s share price, but the firm\u2019s international business, considered a bellwether for the global economy, has yet to recover its 2017 value. General Motors, Ford, electric-car maker Tesla and tech companies Apple and Microsoft \u2013 which were caught by tariffs on semiconductors \u2013 have also been hit during the past year and only recently began, with the prospect of a truce, to recover sales. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly disappointing the last three years has built up to this agreement, and there\u2019s no clear path forward after this,\u201d Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said last month. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of disruption and pain, and there hasn\u2019t been a lot of progress on the most important issues.\u201d A deal that forces Beijing to buy US soya beans is expected to benefit farmers who have struggled to find alternative markets for their produce following an effective blockade by the Chinese against US exports. London-based firm Llewellyn Consulting says the cumulative effect of tariff increases by both countries has probably knocked a full percentage point off US GDP growth, and the same amount off China\u2019s stuttering economy, quoting data from the American Action Forum, which monitors the effects of tariffs worldwide. John Llewellyn, who heads the consultancy and is a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, believes the increased tariffs, combined with Trump\u2019s use of import restrictions and his attacks on the World Trade Organization (which seeks to reduce tariffs), could be having an even bigger effect. \u201cTrump\u2019s systematic attack on the post-second-world-war international order \u2013 which is more than \u2018ordinary\u2019 protectionism \u2013 may be having greater effects than history-based calculations would suggest,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if there is much progress on a second-stage deal ahead of November\u2019s presidential election. And I don\u2019t expect the US to start a fresh trade war with Europe \u2013 with so many potential unintended consequences \u2013 in an election year.\u201d James Knightley, global chief economist at ING bank, was one of the first to argue, last week, that a deal with China may allow Trump to turn his gaze towards Brussels.

Artists from the world of entertainment will be attending as well as performing, along with leading activists, scientists, broadcasters and journalists, including Observer food writer Jay Rayner. There will also be ecologically ethical food and drink available, with the collaboration of the acclaimed chef Skye Gyngell. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, audience Q&amp;A sessions with leading scientists will take place in the auditorium. Among the environmentalists and theorists involved are the teenage conservationist and influencer Bella Lack, and the psychotherapist Caroline Hickman. Evening \u2018warm up\u2019 sessions will take place at 7pm, with 20 minutes of standup comedy from performers including Brydon, Manford, and Steve Furst, best known as Little Britain\u2019s Lenny Beige, followed by the full performance of the Tony Award-winning Christopher Durang play, Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike. Set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the British production, directed by Tony Award-winner Walter Bobbie, was first performed to critical acclaim at the Theatre Royal Bath last summer. It is a parodic tribute to the poignant plays of Anton Chekov and it tells the story of a brother and sister who are visited by their successful sister, an actress, and her younger boyfriend.",

      "body": "<p>Who could object to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/10/nhs-lung-cancer-screening-could-save-5000-lives-a-year\" title=\"\">NHS screening smokers for lung cancer</a> \u2013 aren\u2019t their lives as important as everyone else\u2019s?</p> <p>Prof Charles Swanton, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, argues that 5,000 lives could be saved each year by introducing screening for lung cancer. The people screened would be classed as at risk, either from their own smoking or a family history of lung cancer. Swanton and other experts spoke before the publication of two reports (calling for more funds for cancer research and treatment) from the thinktank Demos and the University College London School of Pharmacy. Regarding lung cancer screening, Swanton described the data as \u201cextraordinary. If we had a drug half as good as that, we would have adopted it by now.\u201d</p> <p>That all sounds promising, especially for those of us who might once have considered putting \u201cgood at smoking\u201d in the \u201cspecial skills\u201d section of our CVs. Survival from lung cancer is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/11/uk-still-behind-in-cancer-survival-despite-recent-surge\" title=\"\">about 15%</a> in the UK (one of the lowest rates in Europe), but the disease can be curable when caught early. Screening on the grounds of family history is one thing. But what about smokers/former smokers (yes, I do mean idiots like me) who, some may perceive, \u201cbrought it on themselves\u201d?</p> <p>This isn\u2019t an idle query. British people can be brutally judgmental about who deserves what medical initiative. You see it in the objections to liver transplants for alcoholics or to obese people being offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/16/obesity-surgery-halves-risk-of-death-compared-to-lifestyle-changes-alone\" title=\"\">gastric band surgery</a>. In such cases, there is the distinct feeling that some believe NHS resources would be better directed elsewhere, which is both understandable... and completely monstrous. Should only those leading perfect lives receive help, while anyone who makes a mistake, even just taking up a bad habit in youth, must be punished and left to rot?</p> <p>This censorious, begrudging attitude reveals the worst of us. Of course people should be proactive about their health, reducing risk factors by not smoking, drinking less alcohol, eating well and exercising regularly, not least to help the beleaguered cash-strapped NHS. Nor should anyone start viewing lung cancer screenings as a safety net or as an excuse to continue smoking. However, who truly has a perfect record regarding their lifestyle choices and who would even want such a record, to go along with what amounts to a medicalised cult of perfection?</p> <p>It\u2019s also important because it feeds into a wider societal concept of who deserves help. Entering the second decade of Tory government, there has already been a concerted (arguably highly successful) effort to establish the idea of the deserving and undeserving poor. Now, with the NHS under threat as never before, the last thing British people need is the idea of the deserving and underserving sick. Who \u201cdeserves\u201d exciting new NHS treatments and initiatives, such as potentially life-saving lung cancer screenings? The only possible ethical answer is \u2013 everybody does.</p> <h2>Dominic Cummings should give his wardrobe the bum\u2019s rush</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ea3e999303d23171165131b041d28f0ea6f9efd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ea3e999303d23171165131b041d28f0ea6f9efd/0_112_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings: not a pretty sight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty O\u2019Connor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t ask for much in life, but could I please never see Dominic Cummings\u2019 naked arse cheeks again?

      "bodyText": "Who could object to the NHS screening smokers for lung cancer \u2013 aren\u2019t their lives as important as everyone else\u2019s? Prof Charles Swanton, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, argues that 5,000 lives could be saved each year by introducing screening for lung cancer. The people screened would be classed as at risk, either from their own smoking or a family history of lung cancer. Swanton and other experts spoke before the publication of two reports (calling for more funds for cancer research and treatment) from the thinktank Demos and the University College London School of Pharmacy. Regarding lung cancer screening, Swanton described the data as \u201cextraordinary. If we had a drug half as good as that, we would have adopted it by now.\u201d That all sounds promising, especially for those of us who might once have considered putting \u201cgood at smoking\u201d in the \u201cspecial skills\u201d section of our CVs. Survival from lung cancer is about 15% in the UK (one of the lowest rates in Europe), but the disease can be curable when caught early. Screening on the grounds of family history is one thing. But what about smokers/former smokers (yes, I do mean idiots like me) who, some may perceive, \u201cbrought it on themselves\u201d? This isn\u2019t an idle query. British people can be brutally judgmental about who deserves what medical initiative. You see it in the objections to liver transplants for alcoholics or to obese people being offered gastric band surgery. In such cases, there is the distinct feeling that some believe NHS resources would be better directed elsewhere, which is both understandable... and completely monstrous. Should only those leading perfect lives receive help, while anyone who makes a mistake, even just taking up a bad habit in youth, must be punished and left to rot? This censorious, begrudging attitude reveals the worst of us. Of course people should be proactive about their health, reducing risk factors by not smoking, drinking less alcohol, eating well and exercising regularly, not least to help the beleaguered cash-strapped NHS. Nor should anyone start viewing lung cancer screenings as a safety net or as an excuse to continue smoking. However, who truly has a perfect record regarding their lifestyle choices and who would even want such a record, to go along with what amounts to a medicalised cult of perfection? It\u2019s also important because it feeds into a wider societal concept of who deserves help. Entering the second decade of Tory government, there has already been a concerted (arguably highly successful) effort to establish the idea of the deserving and undeserving poor. Now, with the NHS under threat as never before, the last thing British people need is the idea of the deserving and underserving sick. Who \u201cdeserves\u201d exciting new NHS treatments and initiatives, such as potentially life-saving lung cancer screenings? The only possible ethical answer is \u2013 everybody does. Dominic Cummings should give his wardrobe the bum\u2019s rush I don\u2019t ask for much in life, but could I please never see Dominic Cummings\u2019 naked arse cheeks again? As Cummings entered No 10 last week, his baggy, crumpled trousers fell down his legs, like some failed suburban grime artist. In his recent job advert for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll bin you within weeks if you don\u2019t fit\u201d, but sadly didn\u2019t apply the same strict criteria to his trousers. A fraction more slippage, and the entire nation would\u2019ve been triggered. Have we gone from Builder\u2019s Crack to Aide\u2019s Arse now? In truth, this was just another example of how Cummings\u2019s carefully formulated anti-styling betrays a poignant inner neediness. He dresses like he\u2019s just been rejected as a backing dancer for a Skepta video and has lain face down and weeping in a skip behind Subway to get over it.

What more could you want?\u201d From their desks, they can also look over to the living room and the side of their \u201cpod\u201d, which rises up from behind the sofa. The wooden pod is effectively a room within the wider room \u2013 living room to the front and bedroom to the back \u2013 that houses a walk-in closet and a pale grey shower room. \u201cWe always wanted a pod,\u201d says Morris. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a piece of furniture that sits in the open space.\u201d But it came with a battle, as their builder wasn\u2019t happy with the idea of a glass ceiling (now synthetic), which Morris and Failenschmid were set on for the pod\u2019s shower room, to give a feeling of height and to steal light from the clerestory. \u201cWe had to convince everyone we wanted a see-through ceiling for all that borrowed light,\u201d Klaus explains. As for the house\u2019s bare, wooden walls, Failenschmid grew up with wooden houses in Germany (Passivhaus is also a German concept), and they were both drawn to the idea of panelling, until they settled on cross-laminated timber \u2013 steely strong, with no decorating required: \u201cIt\u2019s plywood on steroids,\u201d says Morris. And they love the \u201chonest\u201d effect. \u201cLiving in a wooden house is supposed to be good for you,\u201d says Failenschmid. \u201cI certainly find it calming to live here.\u201d seymoursmith.co.uk",

It was only when Clark was in the sin-bin that Saracens lost control, Evans scoring just before and shortly after the interval when the visitors ran out of numbers and lost the lead. It was a period when the decision to rest so many players looked as if it would backfire: Manu Vunipola showed his inexperience by following up a break with a loose pass on halfway that was picked up by the Ospreys and led to the position from which they scored their first try, but the 19-year old was not fazed by the lapse and played a key part in the victory, kicking 17 points and teasing the defence.

      "body": "<p>I never expected I\u2019d be proud of myself for having a one-night stand. Before I quit drinking, I\u2019d always say I \u201cloved dating\u201d. Truthfully, I loved drinking and drunk sex was often the logical conclusion of the evening. I\u2019d convince myself that having four or five drinks on a Wednesday and going home with a guy I just met was an \u201cinvestment\u201d in trying to get into a relationship, because nothing screams girlfriend-material like abruptly leaving at 2am to avoid wetting the bed.</p> <p>I was drunk every single time I had sex with someone new until I quit drinking entirely. I\u2019d have sober sex with them later, once I got comfortable, but never the first time. Drinking felt critical to exposing myself \u2013 alcohol replaced clothing and physical distance as my security blanket. </p> <p>I quit drinking last March. I\u2019d been trying to moderate it for years, but it had slowly got worse \u2013 I desperately wanted it out of my life. Initially, I thought about sobriety in terms of what I\u2019d never do again. In particular, I wondered if I\u2019d ever again be able to date, much less sleep with someone I\u2019d just met. The idea seemed impossible \u2013 I was struggling to make even five minutes of small talk, not because being newly sober made it hard to talk to people, but because alcohol had enabled me to pretend I was good at it.</p> <p>I wanted to go easy on myself. I took a deliberate break from even thinking about sex or dating. I sublet an apartment with a twin bed, perhaps subconsciously because I believed I wouldn\u2019t be having sex for a while. I ate marshmallow fluff and sprinkles for dinner every night for a week. I accepted that I was on a \u201cbreak\u201d. I just prayed it wasn\u2019t permanent. I was afraid of something, but I didn\u2019t know what.</p> <p><em><strong>Five months into</strong></em> my sobriety, I went to a wedding on a tiny island. Leaving LA was a nice reprieve from the deep pessimism that had set in \u2013 was I destined to be alone forever in my sober existence? When would I be free? When would I be laid? In the hours before the wedding, I sat on a dock with my close friend and told her tearfully I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever know intimacy again.</p> <p>I recovered \u2013 the wedding was wonderful. Any time I get out of LA and meet people who don\u2019t work in entertainment, I feel re-energised. I met a cute engineer. He was blond and skinny and very much my type. He\u2019d later claim he didn\u2019t \u201crealise\u201d I was flirting with him when I told him he looked like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/25/jesse-eisenberg-interview-film-social-network-superman-tom-lamont\" title=\"\">Jesse Eisenberg</a> (what is wrong with people?).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Drinking felt critical to exposing myself. It replaced clothing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I asked my friend if he was single and she said she\u2019d find out. I told her not to bother \u2013 it was only 6pm and the long, sober night stretched out dauntingly before me. There was no way I\u2019d be able to sustain flirting with him long enough to invite in anything sexual. I knew what it took for me to get comfortable enough with someone to sleep with them \u2013 at least four glasses of white wine.</p> <p>I ate cake while everyone else was dancing. I smiled at the cute engineer. He came over to chat. He told me he\u2019d never met a woman who brought up sex so quickly, but, in my defence, he asked what I did for work (I was a sex writer at the time). I could tell he was into me, but it still seemed unlikely that either of us would be able to \u201cclose\u201d. Normally, I flirt by touching the other person. Sober, my physical movements were too stilted \u2013 even a quick shoulder graze was not an option. I could either keep my hands in my lap or pat down his shoulders like I was airport security. I chose the former.</p> <p>He got a beer and offered me one. I declined. I hadn\u2019t told him I didn\u2019t drink \u2013 I worried it would arouse suspicion. He\u2019d had maybe two beers and wasn\u2019t remotely drunk, but I\u2019d never been the more sober one before. Usually, I\u2019d match a guy drink-for-drink, which meant I\u2019d end up significantly drunker (I\u2019m dainty, OK?). I was uncomfortable with an imbalance in the other direction. In fact, in later months, I\u2019d decide to have sex only with someone who\u2019s completely sober.</p> <p>He mentioned he was staying on an air mattress in an AirBnB with eight other people. I was sharing a hotel room with just one person, and I knew she\u2019d be out late. Even though I\u2019d never been there sober, I recognised the juncture we\u2019d arrived at. If I wanted to sleep with him, all I had to do was ask. My hotel was a five-minute walk away. In just four words and 10 minutes, I could finally lift the sexless-sobriety spell. I was too close.</p> <p>\u201cWant to come over?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>He smiled and said he did. He still had most of a beer, so he chugged some and then offered it to me. It was about half-full.</p> <p>I paused. I paused for longer than I wish I\u2019d paused. When I used to try to \u201cmoderate\u201d my drinking, I\u2019d consider anything less than a full drink to be \u201czero\u201d, so I\u2019d go about my night having slightly less than a glass of wine at four different bars. Half a beer was nothing. I could round it down. I could still be sober if I drank it, right? It would be just the tiniest bit of lubricant I needed to make sex an option.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t take it, but I definitely noted how close I got. Every time I think I\u2019ve fully settled into sobriety, I realise how much further I have to go. Still, I didn\u2019t give in then, and I haven\u2019t given in yet, but I can\u2019t assume I\u2019m ever \u201cfixed\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My sober one-night stand was the first time I took control</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We went back to my hotel. I\u2019d never been naked in front of a new guy sober and I wanted to bite the bullet (I wish that phrase didn\u2019t apply, but sadly, it does). I\u2019d describe undressing myself as ripping off a Band-Aid \u2013 approximately the same speed, but no wincing on his part, thank God. </p> <p>Once sex was underway, I was thrilled. It was not unlike throwing your hands up while riding a bicycle and realising you can still balance \u2013 I had taken away alcohol, one of the most basic tools I had, and I was completely fine. I hadn\u2019t lost my footing. I was elated \u2013 I no longer had to feel limited by sobriety. The world was my bedroom again.</p> <p>The actual sex didn\u2019t feel much different from drunk sex, except that I asserted control for the first time. I didn\u2019t have alcohol to make me feel good, so I required sexual satisfaction if it were to be a positive experience.</p> <p>Deliberation is my favourite part of sobriety. I make active choices. I accommodate people less and prioritise myself more. I used to depend on wine to power through miserable evenings when I would rather have been home, but I can\u2019t any more. When I want to be home, I\u2019m usually home. I leave dates after 45 minutes if the guy pisses me off \u2013 I don\u2019t get blackout enough to tolerate him, as I once did. And I wasn\u2019t about to have sex I didn\u2019t want to have, so I had to take responsibility for making it a good experience for myself. I didn\u2019t ignore his sexual pleasure \u2013 if anything, my focus on the physical experience allowed me to be more in touch with what he wanted as well. I didn\u2019t let sex happen to me, I made it happen for me.</p> <p>I know now why I\u2019d been afraid to have sex sober. I felt inexperienced. Sadly, though, I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t give specific numbers, but if my number of sexual partners were the age of a woman, you could legally have sex with her (but you probably shouldn\u2019t). When I had sex drunk, I\u2019d defer to the other person on all major decisions. My sober one-night stand was the first time I asked for what I wanted because I could no longer rely on alcohol to entertain me.</p> <p>I had leaned on alcohol to do so many things, and I wanted to reclaim each of them again. I no longer needed alcohol to perform standup comedy, go to parties, sit through family dinners, or read the news. And I didn\u2019t need it for sex. I was proud of myself for my first sober one-night stand.</p> <h2>My tips for sober dating</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Don\u2019t rush yourself</strong> It took me months to feel comfortable about the reality of sober sex with someone I didn\u2019t know very well. If you\u2019re used to dating and drinking, it can be a big adjustment.</p> <p><strong>2. Be communicative</strong> Without alcohol, you\u2019re going to feel everything, so let them know what feels good.</p> <p><strong>3. Get to know someone</strong> In general, I now wait several more dates with a new date. It takes me longer to warm up without alcohol, but the benefit has been that once I do decide I\u2019m attracted to someone, I\u2019m really attracted.</p>",

I accepted that I was on a \u201cbreak\u201d. I just prayed it wasn\u2019t permanent. I was afraid of something, but I didn\u2019t know what. Five months into my sobriety, I went to a wedding on a tiny island. Leaving LA was a nice reprieve from the deep pessimism that had set in \u2013 was I destined to be alone forever in my sober existence? When would I be free? When would I be laid? In the hours before the wedding, I sat on a dock with my close friend and told her tearfully I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever know intimacy again. I recovered \u2013 the wedding was wonderful. Any time I get out of LA and meet people who don\u2019t work in entertainment, I feel re-energised. I met a cute engineer. He was blond and skinny and very much my type. He\u2019d later claim he didn\u2019t \u201crealise\u201d I was flirting with him when I told him he looked like Jesse Eisenberg (what is wrong with people?). I asked my friend if he was single and she said she\u2019d find out. I told her not to bother \u2013 it was only 6pm and the long, sober night stretched out dauntingly before me. There was no way I\u2019d be able to sustain flirting with him long enough to invite in anything sexual. I knew what it took for me to get comfortable enough with someone to sleep with them \u2013 at least four glasses of white wine. I ate cake while everyone else was dancing. I smiled at the cute engineer. He came over to chat. He told me he\u2019d never met a woman who brought up sex so quickly, but, in my defence, he asked what I did for work (I was a sex writer at the time). I could tell he was into me, but it still seemed unlikely that either of us would be able to \u201cclose\u201d. Normally, I flirt by touching the other person. Sober, my physical movements were too stilted \u2013 even a quick shoulder graze was not an option. I could either keep my hands in my lap or pat down his shoulders like I was airport security. I chose the former. He got a beer and offered me one. I declined. I hadn\u2019t told him I didn\u2019t drink \u2013 I worried it would arouse suspicion. He\u2019d had maybe two beers and wasn\u2019t remotely drunk, but I\u2019d never been the more sober one before. Usually, I\u2019d match a guy drink-for-drink, which meant I\u2019d end up significantly drunker (I\u2019m dainty, OK?). I was uncomfortable with an imbalance in the other direction. In fact, in later months, I\u2019d decide to have sex only with someone who\u2019s completely sober. He mentioned he was staying on an air mattress in an AirBnB with eight other people. I was sharing a hotel room with just one person, and I knew she\u2019d be out late. Even though I\u2019d never been there sober, I recognised the juncture we\u2019d arrived at. If I wanted to sleep with him, all I had to do was ask. My hotel was a five-minute walk away. In just four words and 10 minutes, I could finally lift the sexless-sobriety spell. I was too close. \u201cWant to come over?\u201d I asked. He smiled and said he did. He still had most of a beer, so he chugged some and then offered it to me. It was about half-full. I paused. I paused for longer than I wish I\u2019d paused. When I used to try to \u201cmoderate\u201d my drinking, I\u2019d consider anything less than a full drink to be \u201czero\u201d, so I\u2019d go about my night having slightly less than a glass of wine at four different bars. Half a beer was nothing. I could round it down. I could still be sober if I drank it, right? It would be just the tiniest bit of lubricant I needed to make sex an option. I didn\u2019t take it, but I definitely noted how close I got. Every time I think I\u2019ve fully settled into sobriety, I realise how much further I have to go. Still, I didn\u2019t give in then, and I haven\u2019t given in yet, but I can\u2019t assume I\u2019m ever \u201cfixed\u201d. We went back to my hotel. I\u2019d never been naked in front of a new guy sober and I wanted to bite the bullet (I wish that phrase didn\u2019t apply, but sadly, it does). I\u2019d describe undressing myself as ripping off a Band-Aid \u2013 approximately the same speed, but no wincing on his part, thank God. Once sex was underway, I was thrilled. It was not unlike throwing your hands up while riding a bicycle and realising you can still balance \u2013 I had taken away alcohol, one of the most basic tools I had, and I was completely fine. I hadn\u2019t lost my footing. I was elated \u2013 I no longer had to feel limited by sobriety. The world was my bedroom again. The actual sex didn\u2019t feel much different from drunk sex, except that I asserted control for the first time. I didn\u2019t have alcohol to make me feel good, so I required sexual satisfaction if it were to be a positive experience. Deliberation is my favourite part of sobriety. I make active choices. I accommodate people less and prioritise myself more. I used to depend on wine to power through miserable evenings when I would rather have been home, but I can\u2019t any more. When I want to be home, I\u2019m usually home. I leave dates after 45 minutes if the guy pisses me off \u2013 I don\u2019t get blackout enough to tolerate him, as I once did. And I wasn\u2019t about to have sex I didn\u2019t want to have, so I had to take responsibility for making it a good experience for myself. I didn\u2019t ignore his sexual pleasure \u2013 if anything, my focus on the physical experience allowed me to be more in touch with what he wanted as well. I didn\u2019t let sex happen to me, I made it happen for me. I know now why I\u2019d been afraid to have sex sober. I felt inexperienced. Sadly, though, I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t give specific numbers, but if my number of sexual partners were the age of a woman, you could legally have sex with her (but you probably shouldn\u2019t). When I had sex drunk, I\u2019d defer to the other person on all major decisions. My sober one-night stand was the first time I asked for what I wanted because I could no longer rely on alcohol to entertain me. I had leaned on alcohol to do so many things, and I wanted to reclaim each of them again. I no longer needed alcohol to perform standup comedy, go to parties, sit through family dinners, or read the news. And I didn\u2019t need it for sex. I was proud of myself for my first sober one-night stand. My tips for sober dating 1. Don\u2019t rush yourself It took me months to feel comfortable about the reality of sober sex with someone I didn\u2019t know very well. If you\u2019re used to dating and drinking, it can be a big adjustment. 2. Be communicative Without alcohol, you\u2019re going to feel everything, so let them know what feels good. 3. Get to know someone In general, I now wait several more dates with a new date. It takes me longer to warm up without alcohol, but the benefit has been that once I do decide I\u2019m attracted to someone, I\u2019m really attracted.",

We were very dominant, controlled the game, we created chances, we were so good in transition. I was really pleased with the first half. The first ten to 15 minutes of the second half, credit to them, they started to put balls into the box and we had more difficulties. We conceded a goal where we switched off completely, that is unacceptable and I am really upset with that. But after that we reacted very well. I haven\u2019t seen [the Aubameyang challenge] but I think it was a harsh challenge. Knowing Auba I don\u2019t think he meant to do it, but maybe he mistimed it. To control Palace for 90 minutes is impossible, but to play the way we did, I am very pleased.\u201d He also confirms that Lucas Torreira has picked up an injury. Calm, level-headed, no-nonsense analysis from Arteta there.

      "bodyText": "No word from Roy, again, the elusive scamp. So that\u2019s your lot. Nick Ames was at Selhurst Park, and his verdict is in. You know what to do: click and enjoy! And many thanks for reading this MBM. See you again soon. Mikel Arteta speaks. \u201cThe first 35 minutes is exactly what I want my Arsenal team to play like. We were very dominant, controlled the game, we created chances, we were so good in transition. I was really pleased with the first half. The first ten to 15 minutes of the second half, credit to them, they started to put balls into the box and we had more difficulties. We conceded a goal where we switched off completely, that is unacceptable and I am really upset with that. But after that we reacted very well. I haven\u2019t seen [the Aubameyang challenge] but I think it was a harsh challenge. Knowing Auba I don\u2019t think he meant to do it, but maybe he mistimed it. To control Palace for 90 minutes is impossible, but to play the way we did, I am very pleased.\u201d He also confirms that Lucas Torreira has picked up an injury. Calm, level-headed, no-nonsense analysis from Arteta there. He really does cut an impressive figure. Gary Cahill speaks to BT Sport: \u201cIt was frustrating. When they went down to ten, we pushed a bit more. Frustrating not to get the win. But then again first half they were very good, we found it tough to deal with their passing and movement. But when we got to grips with it, I thought we certainly deserved a point. I knew [the Aubameyang challenge] looked bad on the pitch.\u201d Man-of-the-match Jordan Ayew adds: \u201cIt was a poor first half, but second half we were the better team and deserved to equalise. I\u2019m a striker, so I\u2019ll take anything!\u201d That\u2019s a good point for Palace, seeing they didn\u2019t turn up until the 30-minute mark. Their unbeaten sequence against the Gunners stretches to four matches. 90 min +6: The free kick drops to Tomkins, who lashes wildly over from the left-hand edge of the D. Sokratis goes down, claiming to have been elbowed, but there wasn\u2019t anything in it. A brush of the forearm, little else. 90 min +5: A free kick for Palace out on the right, and a chance for the hosts to load the box. One last chance. Before it can be taken, Luiz picks up the ball and demands the free kick be taken somewhere else. A brief shoving match ensues. 90 min +3: Nelson sends Pepe into space down the left. With Xhaka offering himself on the overlap, Pepe clanks the ball into the nearest Palace player. That\u2019s a poor pass, with Palace very light at the back, a sensational late winner there for the taking. He should have sent Xhaka free. 90 min +2: Lacazette is replaced by Nelson. \u201cThe pre-Arteta Arsenal would have folded like a cheap suit after the red card,\u201d argues Mary Waltz. \u201cGive them credit for going for the three points.\u201d 90 min +1: The first of four added minutes flies by without too much incident. 90 min: Zaha goes down in the penalty area, tumbling under not much pressure. He really wants a spot kick, but neither referee nor VAR is falling for the grift. 89 min: Lacazette is booked for a common-or-garden foul, a result of the totting-up process. 87 min: Palace haven\u2019t put too much pressure on Arsenal since the red card. Time\u2019s running out if they\u2019re to take advantage of their extra man. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Walton who got the Lacazette challenge wrong,\u201d writes Ruth Purdue. \u201cMartin Keown grudgingly thought it was a yellow. That sort of tackle was fine when he did it maybe?\u201d 85 min: Tomkins goes sliding in on Martinelli. Arsenal surround the referee, demanding a red card. It was certainly late; arguably out of control. But front on, and just a yellow. BREAKING NEWS: Peter Walton agrees! 84 min: In fact, credit where it\u2019s due: Guaita fingertipped Pepe\u2019s effort onto the post. What a wonderful save! 83 min: Pepe hits the post! Martinelli juggles his way down the right and slips the ball inside for Lacazette, who shuttles it further left for Pepe. Pepe sends a low fizzer past Guaita and onto the bottom of the right-hand post. A fine effort, but one that unluckily pings back towards the keeper instead of going in. Guaita can\u2019t gather first time, though, and Lacazette tries to stab home the loose ball. Guaita smothers at point-blank range and gathers. What an escape for Palace! 81 min: Palace stroke it around the middle, without too much urgency. The crowd urge them to pick up the pace. 79 min: ... nothing happens. 78 min: Tomkins wins a header off Zaha\u2019s left-wing cross. It loops over Leno towards the top left. Sokratis acrobatically hooks off the line, just in time. Palace argue the ball also brushed his arm, but they\u2019re not getting that decision. Maitland-Niles clears for a corner, from which ... 76 min: A little bit of space down the inside-left channel for Martinelli. He wins a corner, from which Xhaka takes a clean whack at goal from the right of the D. He connects well, but his effort is blocked and cleared. Arsenal aren\u2019t giving up hope of the win, despite going down to ten men. 75 min: The game itself has fallen a bit flat since the sending off, as both teams come to terms with the new landscape. 73 min: Peter Walton, though. Sweet mercy. What a company drone. The Man always right. There won\u2019t be a more obvious potential leg-breaker all season, but God forbid questioning a decision made by a fellow official. BT Sport aren\u2019t getting much bang for their buck, to say the very least. 71 min: Martinelli comes on for Ozil, who has done very little. His first contribution to the story is to be fouled from behind by McCarthy, who is booked for his trouble. 69 min: Meyer is replaced by Cenk Tosun, making his Palace debut. Hopefully Meyer hasn\u2019t been badly hurt. He walked off and doesn\u2019t seem in too much pain as he sits back in his seat in the dugout, but that was a very unpleasant challenge. Here\u2019s hoping all\u2019s well. 67 min: Yep, off you go. That was a no-brainer of a decision. Aubameyang caught Meyer above the ankle, studs showing, the player\u2019s leg bending in a sickening fashion. The Arsenal captain can have no complaints. 66 min: On BT Sport, Peter Walton, whose job it is to agree with whatever the referee does, like a good company man, suggests there\u2019s not enough force for a red card. That\u2019s preposterous. It\u2019s an obvious red. 65 min: Aubameyang comes sliding in on Meyer, and that\u2019s a booking. In fact, it should be a red card. He\u2019s studded him above the ankle. That\u2019s a bad challenge. VAR will have a look at that. 64 min: Moves of two passes or more are at a premium right now. All a bit scrappy. 62 min: Ozil takes a whack on the ankle from McCarthy, who came in from behind with unnecessary force. The referee doesn\u2019t react, much to Ozil\u2019s annoyance. 61 min: This one goes to the near post as well. Luiz rises highest and flicks a fine header inches over the bar, the ball landing on the top of the netting. So nearly payback for his role in the equaliser. 60 min: Ozil and Pepe combine down the right to earn a corner for Arsenal. Pepe takes. It\u2019s whipped towards the near post. Lacazette gets there first, but can\u2019t flick a header goalwards. It\u2019ll be another corner, though. 59 min: Free kick for Palace in the centre circle. McCarthy larrups it straight out of play for a goal kick. Very poor. 57 min: This is good end-to-end stuff now. Meyer takes a snapshot from the left of the D, but slices it wildly right of the target. A fair chance this won\u2019t end 1-1. 56 min: Arsenal try to respond immediately, Guendouzi slipping a pass down the inside right for Lacazette, who nearly spins McArthur, but not quite. The defender just about holds his ground, allowing Guaita to claim. This is certainly better from Palace. Meyer springs a high Arsenal line down the right. Kouyate cushions the resulting cross on the spot for Ayew, who shoots towards the left of goal. The ball takes an absurd break off Luiz, looping over Leno, suddenly stranded, in slow motion. And in it goes, bouncing apologetically into the bottom left. That could be an own goal, not sure if Ayew\u2019s effort was off target, but let\u2019s give it to the striker. 53 min: McCarthy is sent into a pocket of space down the left by Zaha. He drops a shoulder and enters the box, but Guendouzi steps cleverly into the space, stealing possession and earning a free kick. This is better from Palace, though. 52 min: Luiz clears the set piece with ease. Leno has yet to be called into action. 51 min: Kouyate is clattered unceremoniously by Maitland-Niles, as the Palace man attempts to spin free down the left. That\u2019s a booking, and a free kick in a dangerous position, just to the side of the Arsenal box. 49 min: Luiz faffs again, this time deliberately over a free kick in the midfield, to draw some of Palace\u2019s early second-half sting. Full marks for game management. 47 min: Luiz knocks over Meyer, and it\u2019s a free kick out on the right touchline. McCarthy hoicks it into the box. Tomkins wins a header, and Ayew latches onto the ball in the six-yard box, with Luiz snoozing. But the flag goes up for offside. Relief for Luiz, who was faffing around in the grand style. Here we go again! Palace get the ball rolling for the second half. Torreira appears to have picked up an injury, and he\u2019s replaced by Guendouzi. A big loss for Arsenal; Torreira was arguably their best player in the first half. He was certainly heavily involved. Big shoes for Guendouzi to fill. Half-time entertainment. Nothing of note happens in them, other than the crowd giving their own team the bird as they pass the ball meekly backwards. The hosts need a serious rethink. Arsenal will be more than happy, especially with their fast start. 45 min: There will be two added minutes to this first half. 44 min: Pepe is booked for tangling with a prone McCarthy, petulantly letting his boot brush the Palace man. 43 min: McCarthy launches another long free kick towards the Arsenal box. Tomkins brings the ball down and nearly bursts through the pack on the edge of the area, but Torreira gets involved and clears. Palace have had 53% possession in the last five minutes. Small acorns, and all that. 41 min: Kouyate barges his way through a couple of half-arsed Arsenal challenges, and enters the box on the left. He\u2019s not afforded that much time to shoot, though, and can only send a speculative snapshot towards the top right. Leno makes a nine-course tasting menu of dealing with Kouyate\u2019s effort, nearly spilling it into the top right, but he gathers himself, and the ball, just in time. 39 min: This has become scrappy. Kolasinic bowls Kouyate to the ground. A free kick out on the right. Palace line up on the edge of the box. Luiz clears McArthur\u2019s ball in. Lacazette threatens to break, but clumsily clatters McCarthy, and the chance of racing up the other end, with Palace light at the back, is gone. 37 min: Arsenal waste the free kick, which leads to a bit of head tennis and nothing more. 36 min: Tomkins cynically checks Torreira, who is bustling down the inside left. A free kick in a dangerous position. 34 min: Palace want a penalty, as Kouyate tries to scoop the ball past Luiz as the pair chase backwards down the inside-right channel. Luiz\u2019s hand was raised. They\u2019re not getting it, though, both players being so close together. 33 min: Sokratis shoves Ayew to the ground. A garden-variety free kick in the centre circle, though it nearly kicks off as the pair tangle on the floor. Team-mates step in to ensure the situation doesn\u2019t escalate. 32 min: McArthur slams Ozil legally to gain possession, then sends Zaha away down the left. Zaha dribbles in an absent-minded fashion, eventually forgetting to take the ball along with him. The chance of launching a dangerous attack is gone. But Palace are finally putting their back into this, and they\u2019re finally in the game. Just the best part of half an hour too late. 30 min: Another break in play as Pepe and Torreira clatter into each other in mid air. Pepe was eased into that by Zaha, nudging slyly from behind. Both are momentarily winded; both seem fine to continue. 28 min: Kolasinac rolls around in agony. He doesn\u2019t know whether to hold his ankle or his head. He\u2019s turned his ankle while being accidentally whacked on the back of the nut by a Palace knee. After reaching for both top and tail, he eventually opts for his ankle, then gets up as though nothing\u2019s happened. On we go. 27 min: Palace have finally woken up. A free kick out on the right. McCarthy floats the set piece towards Cahill, just inside the box. It sails out of play for a goal kick. But this is a vast improvement from the hosts, who, as Mary Waltz observes, \u201clook like someone slipped some Ambien in their vitamin pack this morning\u201d. 25 min: Ayew twists and turns, advancing down the middle. He lays off to Meyer, who slips a pass wide left for Zaha. Finally something for the home fans to shout about. A swell of noise as Zaha enters the box. It quickly subsides as he loses control, and Torreira buys a cheap free kick to relieve the pressure. 24 min: A little bit of possession for Palace at last. They don\u2019t do much with it, Cahill just failing to release Zaha down the left, but that\u2019s better, and at least Arsenal are finally made to chase for a while. Onwards and upwards. 22 min: VAR hasn\u2019t stuck its unwanted neb in yet. But that isn\u2019t stopping the crowd loudly singing the latest addition to the great British songbook, Fuck VAR. As protest songs go, it\u2019s right up there with the best. 20 min. A telling match statistic: Arsenal have made 117 passes so far, while Palace have made just one in the final third. This has been as one-sided as it gets; only the scoreline fails to reflect the huge gulf. 18 min: Torreira releases Aubameyang into acres of space down the right. Danger here. Fortunately for the hosts, the flag goes up for offside, though that\u2019s a poor decision. He was on, and play should have continued. A break for Palace, who have been a complete non-event so far. 17 min: Ozil flicks a cute pass down the right, releasing Pepe from a tight spot. Pepe skins Riedewald, and upon entering the box should get a shot away at the very least. But he stumbles and lets the ball run through to Guaita. That could easily have been a second. 15 min: Ayew comes through the back of Xhaka in the middle of the park. A frustrated lunge, and he\u2019s slightly fortunate not to go in the book. 14 min: That\u2019s no more than Palace deserve, too. They\u2019ve been so passive, ever since the get-go. Arsenal have been afforded the run of the shop, and they\u2019ve not looked the gift horse in the mouth. No more than Arsenal deserve. They ping it around awhile. Palace stand around like traffic cones. Then Luiz slips a ball down the middle from deep. Ozil and Lacazette combine crisply to spring Aubameyang clear. He draws Guaita and slams the ball into the bottom right. An 18-pass move! 11 min: Palace still haven\u2019t put together anything resembling a passing sequence. Some more groans from the home faithful as possession is again squandered cheaply. 9 min: McCarthy plays the ball back towards Cahill, who waits for Guaita to come and collect. The keeper doesn\u2019t arrive. Cahill hooks into the crowd. Palace can\u2019t string two passes together at the minute. A few groans from the crowd. Palace are a model of passivity right now. 7 min: Palace continue to sit back. Arsenal continue to knock it about. They\u2019ve had 87 percent possession so far! Aubameyang and Kolasinac combine down the left and eventually run the ball out for a goal kick, though they nearly ripped Palace open. The home side need to wake up. 5 min: Aubameyang drifts down the left and scoops a cross towards nobody in particular. Riedewald nearly makes a hash of a chest-down and hoof upfield, but just about manages to get the ball away before Lacazette can make his presence felt. A gust of wind didn\u2019t help Riedewald, to be fair. 4 min: Palace are sitting deep, allowing Arsenal to hog the ball. The visitors stroke it around the middle for a while, just because they can. They don\u2019t really go anywhere, but that\u2019s not the point: they\u2019ve started much better than they did against Leeds in the cup. 2 min: But Arsenal have started very much on the front foot. Kolasinac makes his way down the left, forcing Riedewald into a hurried clearance. A couple of early statements of intent by the visitors. 10 seconds or so. Aubameyang makes his way down the left and wins a corner off Kelly. Corner. The ball might have gone out before Aubameyang played it off Kelly, but here we are. Ah, but it\u2019s all a waste of time, as the referee spots some pushing in the box and it\u2019s a free kick to Palace. Stand down. And we\u2019re off! A fine atmosphere at Selhurst, as there almost always is. What a fine ground. Arsenal get the ball rolling. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve named the same side in successive Premier League matches for a year. Oh Unai, we hardly knew ye. No word from Hodgson. Perhaps he talked earlier; if so, your super soaraway Guardian MBM missed it. Anyway, the teams are out! Palace are in their red and blue shirts, while Arsenal sport second-choice yellow, an ersatz tribute to the famous bruised banana kit of the George Graham era. We\u2019ll be off sooner than you think. Mikel Arteta speaks. \u201cIt\u2019s an early kick off, and a very difficult ground to come. Hopefully we are ready from the first minute. I want everybody ready. The team can compete, and I have the squad to make changes if we need to do that. It\u2019s a great atmosphere here, it will be tough. It is incredible what Roy Hodgson has done in the game.\u201d Palace welcome back Wilfried Zaha, while captain Luka Milivojevic is suspended. All in all, there are four changes to their side from last week\u2019s FA Cup defeat to Derby County. Zaha, Vincente Guaita, James Tomkins and James McArthur step up, taking the place of Milivojevic, Wayne Hennessey, Brandon Pierrick and Connor Wickham. Four changes for Arsenal to the side that beat Leeds in the FA Cup on Monday evening. Bernd Leno, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Lucas Torreira and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang take the places of Emiliano Martinez, Rob Holding, Matteo Guendouzi and Reiss Nelson. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Kelly, Tomkins, Cahill, Riedewald, Meyer, McCarthy, Kouyate, McArthur, Zaha, Ayew. Subs: Dann, Hennessey, Tosun, Wickham, Woods, Kirby, Pierrick. Arsenal: Leno, Maitland-Niles, Papastathopoulos, Luiz, Kolasinac, Torreira, Xhaka, Pepe, Ozil, Aubameyang, Lacazette. Subs: Holding, Nelson, Martinez, Willock, Guendouzi, Martinelli, Saka. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire). Two years ago, give or take a couple of weeks, Arsenal went four goals up against Crystal Palace in 22 minutes. They ended up winning that one 4-1, but since then, they\u2019ve not had the best of it against their London rivals. A 2-2 draw at Selhurst Park in October 2018. A 2-3 reverse at the Emirates last April. And they shipped a two-goal lead at home in October, Palace coming back for a draw that hammered one of the last nails in Unai Emery\u2019s coffin. Arsenal weren\u2019t in too good a shape back then. But times change. Palace have won only one of their last seven matches in all competitions, while Arsenal are two on the bounce, a record that might not be much to write home about, until you consider the Gunners had only previously won one in 15. Under new boss Mikel Arteta, their tails are up, even if they relied on the profligacy of Leeds United in the cup on Monday night. So Palace are cooling; Arsenal are hotting up. But neither are particularly predictable right now, and it\u2019s too early to establish trends. There have been 23 goals in the last five matches between these two, so good luck working out how it\u2019ll all come down this lunchtime. The Premier League is back after the FA Cup interregnum. It\u2019s a London derby. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm.",

Trump claimed in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Friday night he would \u201clove everybody to testify\u201d, including Bolton, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. But he went on to say \u201cthere are things that you can\u2019t do from the standpoint of executive privilege\u201d. \u201cEspecially a national security adviser,\u201d Trump added. \u201cYou can\u2019t have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China and North Korea, everything. You just can\u2019t do that.\u201d Asked if that meant he would invoke executive privilege to prevent Bolton from testifying, Trump said: \u201cI think you have to for the sake of the office.\u201d Democrats believe Bolton, ousted by Trump last September, has key insight into the president\u2019s failed efforts to secure a so-called quid pro quo with the government of Ukraine. Trump is alleged to have demanded investigations into a conspiracy theory about election interference and unsubstantiated allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden, a possible rival in November\u2019s election, in return for almost $400m in crucial military aid and a White House meeting. Those efforts led to impeachment hearings in the Democrat-led House and ultimately two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, that the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on Friday she would send to the Senate early next week. Impeachment hearings contained dramatic testimony from White House aides, including that Bolton had referred to approaches to Ukraine as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d and refused to get involved. Bolton, who was ambassador to the United Nations under George W Bush, surprised the White House earlier this week by announcing he would testify at Trump\u2019s Senate trial if subpoenaed to do so. In a statement he said he had tried to \u201cresolve serious competing issues\u201d in weighing \u201cmy obligations both as a citizen and as a former national security adviser\u201d and concluded that he was prepared to testify. There remains significant doubt, however, that the issue will come to a head, irrespective of Trump\u2019s pronouncement. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has joined other leading Republicans in asserting that no witnesses should be called, and claimed on Thursday to have enough votes to start the trial on that basis. Democrats need to persuade four Senate Republicans to join them in a vote on trial rules to allow witnesses. They received a glimmer of hope Friday when Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine, said she had been working with a small group of colleagues to find a compromise. \u201cWe should be completely open to calling witnesses,\u201d Collins said, according to the Bangor Daily News. Trump\u2019s removal is a long shot. A two-thirds majority of 100 senators is required for a conviction and there are few indications any Republicans are likely to break ranks. Trump also had scathing words for Pelosi in the Fox News interview, saying it was \u201cridiculous\u201d she had held on to the articles of impeachment for several weeks. \u201cShe should have sent them a long time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just belittles the process.

They wanted to ensure that our country avoided needless conflict and they understood that presidential war-making would be harmful to our democracy.\u201d Trump\u2019s interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham was broadcast on Friday night. Asked what Iran had been targeting, he revisited remarks to reporters and at a rally on Thursday when he said: \u201cWe will tell you that probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad.\u201d That embassy was attacked by pro-Iranian groups on New Year\u2019s Eve, another event contributing to Trump\u2019s authorisation of the strike on Suleimani. Trump then told Ingraham he could \u201creveal that I believe it probably would\u2019ve been four embassies\u201d. \u201c[It] could have been military bases,\u201d he said, \u201ccould have been a lot of other things too. But it was imminent, and then all of a sudden, he [Suleimani] was gone.\u201d The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told reporters on Friday the US \u201chad specific information on an imminent threat, and those threats included attacks on US embassies period full stop\u201d. Pompeo claimed \u201cAmerican facilities including American embassies, military bases, American facilities throughout the region\u201d were at risk. But the Washington Post cited \u201ca senior administration official and a senior defense official\u201d who said they \u201cwere only aware of vague intelligence about a plot against the embassy in Baghdad and that the information did not suggest a fully formed plot. Neither official said there were threats against multiple embassies\u201d. One official told the Post there was concern about a possible attempt to bomb the Baghdad embassy. Responding to Trump\u2019s interview, Murphy said he had \u201cplaced a request \u2026 for a briefing on the new intelligence surrounding the imminent attacks on US embassies that the president referred to today, but somehow didn\u2019t come up in the full Senate briefing on Wednesday\u201d. Trump also told Fox News his \u201cbiggest thing\u201d was not letting US enemies such as Iran have nuclear weapons. The president withdrew from the Iran nuclear accord, meant to slow Tehran\u2019s progress towards a weapon, in May 2018. After the strike on Suleimani, Tehran said it was ending commitments under the deal. On Saturday the news site Axios reported that national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said \u201cthe chances of sitting down with the Iranians and getting to a deal have improved significantly\u201d because Soleimani was \u201coff the battlefield\u201d. On Fox News, Trump was also asked about comments from Democrats including Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana who is showing strongly in the presidential primary, which implied the US was partly to blame for Iran shooting down the airliner bound for Ukraine. \u201cI think it\u2019s just lowlife,\u201d Trump said, calling Buttigieg a \u201clousy mayor of a place that is not doing well\u201d. Trump said he would be \u201cOK\u201d with US troops withdrawing from Iraq, as demanded by the Iraqi parliament after the Suleimani strike, leading to confusion over US plans before the administration confirmed troops would stay. He claimed the Iraqi government was saying it wanted US troops out \u201cpublicly\u201d but \u201cthey don\u2019t say that privately\u201d. Defending his decision last year to remove US troops from the border between Turkey and Syria, which led to a Turkish incursion against Kurdish forces allied to the US in the fight against Islamic State, Trump insisted it \u201cturned out to be such a successful move\u201d. \u201cLook what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been fighting over that border for a thousand years. Why should we do it? And then they say \u2018he left troops in Syria\u2019. Do you know what I did? I left troops to take the oil. I took the oil \u2013 the only troops are protecting the oil.\u201d US troops do remain stationed near oilfields in Syria, but \u201ctaking the oil\u201d, repeatedly advocated by Trump, would be illegal under international law as applied and accepted around the world since 1945. In the aftermath of the Suleimani strike, Trump repeatedly threatened to strike Iranian cultural sites, an act that would also have constituted a war crime. In the face of international criticism, the president climbed down.",

      "body": "<h2>Kampala, Uganda: a tour of tropical modernism</h2> <p>Under a tree outside Uganda\u2019s National Theatre sits architect <a href=\"http://adengoarchitecture.com/\" title=\"\">Doreen Adengo</a>, sheltering from the sun that beats down before heavy rain at this time of year. It\u2019s here she begins her tours of African or \u201ctropical\u201d modernist buildings in Kampala\u2019s central business district, aiming to increase awareness and appreciation of their architecture. She started last year, inspired by architect Manuel Herz\u2019s book <a href=\"http://www.manuelherz.com/african-modernism-architecture-of-independence\" title=\"\">African Modernism \u2013 The Architecture of Independence</a>, featuring buildings in Zambia, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Ghana. Herz\u2019s work explores the politics behind these buildings \u2013 mainly constructed in the 50s and 60s \u2013 from colonial projects to nation-building for proud new African leaders.</p> <p>\u201cThe National Theatre fits with our equatorial climate,\u201d says Adengo of the first stop on her tour. \u201cThe rings on the exterior stop the sun from going into the building directly, and it has double facades for ventilation.\u201d This <em>brise soleil</em> is typical of Uganda\u2019s modernist architecture: clever, free air conditioning. \u201cArchitects studied the sun path and wind patterns, and oriented buildings accordingly,\u201d Adengo says.</p> <p>But while the Europeans who carefully designed these buildings considered the climate, Adengo says this typically western theatre didn\u2019t adapt to African culture: \u201cIn our theatre, there is no division between audience and performer.\u201d This could be one reason why most Kampalans haven\u2019t actually entered the theatre. \u201cThey come here to hang out, park cars, have meetings. There\u2019s more activity outside than in,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>In modern Uganda\u2019s short history, buildings and spaces have been reappropriated again and again by the people \u2013 and their rulers. Another building on the tour, <a href=\"https://www.serenahotels.com/serenakampala/en/meetings/default.html\" title=\"\">Kampala Serena International Conference Centre</a>, was built in 1975 for Uganda\u2019s infamous former president, Idi Amin.

Back then, the government had big budgets for such ventures, allowing for \u201cgrand, experimental and cutting-edge design in concrete\u201d.</p> <p>Today, architects in Kampala mostly work with private clients, who have a taste for flashy \u201cDubai glass\u201d. Modernist buildings have suffered as a result: an ATM has been installed on top of a mural depicting the story of money and exchange at the front of Tropical Bank; the once brutalist beauty Cham Towers has been covered in gold aluminium panels. Adengo winces when she looks at them: \u201cArchitecture and preservation are not a top priority for Uganda.\u201d</p> <p>But she is passionate about protecting this architecture and is now working with the Uganda Museum \u2013 the country\u2019s first modern building \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/keeping_it_modern/\" title=\"\">Keeping it Modern</a>, a Getty Foundation project that aims to preserve modernist buildings around the world. She hopes to do the museum\u2019s building justice, using concrete and other original materials in what will be the first conservation management of a modernist building in Uganda.

You might glimpse a tiled courtyard or panels of delicate fretwork, but then a door swings shut or you turn a corner. The city\u2019s riads were designed to keep the best decoration on the inside.</p> <p>Luckily, there are more accessible examples of the city\u2019s architecture, ranging from 19th-century palaces to the ultra contemporary. For palatial Islamic style, head to <a href=\"https://www.palais-bahia.com/\" title=\"\">Palais Bahia</a> and <a href=\"https://visitmarrakech.com/discover-marrakech/tourist-attractions/dar-si-said-museum\" title=\"\">Dar Si Said</a>. There is perfection in the small details \u2013 the geometric tiling and carved ceilings \u2013 but step back and a calmer overall symmetry reveals itself.</p> <p>Vestiges of Morocco\u2019s colonial past live on in the city\u2019s Ville Nouvelle and Gueliz areas. This is where you will find the 30s <a href=\"https://www.en.grandcafedelaposte.restaurant/\" title=\"\">Grande Cafe </a><a href=\"https://www.en.grandcafedelaposte.restaurant/\" title=\"\">de </a><a href=\"https://www.en.grandcafedelaposte.restaurant/\" title=\"\">la Poste</a>, with its checkerboard tiles, elegant staircases and lazily turning fans. The building was revived in 2006 by Parisian architects <a href=\"http://www.studioko.fr/#en-diary-home\" title=\"\">Studio KO</a>, who have a base in the city and are better known for designing the nearby <a href=\"https://www.museeyslmarrakech.com/en/\" title=\"\">Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent</a>. Its silhouette of intersecting arcs and sharper angles was inspired by drawings in the fashion designer\u2019s archives, and exterior brickwork is arranged to resemble the warp and weft of fabric. Interior surfaces are softer and smoother, designed to evoke the lining of a couture jacket.</p> <p>Saint Laurent\u2019s legacy also includes the neighbouring <a href=\"https://www.jardinmajorelle.com/en/\" title=\"\">Jardin Majorelle</a>, bought by the designer and his partner Pierre Berg\u00e9 in 1980 to save it from hotel developers. This exotic garden was created by French artist Jacques Majorelle in the 20s, but the luminous cobalt he chose for the walls (later adding it to the fountain, path borders and even plant pots) almost eclipses the greenery. His studio, designed by architect Paul Sinoir, brings together art deco curves, Moorish pillars and cubist inspired overhangs. It now houses a museum of Berber culture, but the longest queues are to take selfies against its \u201cMajorelle blue\u201d walls. Visit the gardens first thing to avoid the Insta crush.</p> <p>The city has a raft of restored riads that function as hotels, varying in authenticity. One of the first was <a href=\"https://el-fenn.com/\" title=\"\">El Fenn</a> and its use of traditional tadelakt (waterproof plaster) and saturated colours is still inspiring.

What? Where is Tbilisi?\u2019\u201d But Offermann, who had been working with Georgian artists for several years, had fallen in love with the city\u2019s energy and sense of untapped potential.</p> <p>The Georgian capital\u2019s burgeoning art, fashion and underground clubbing scene has earned it the nickname \u201cthe new Berlin\u201d. But that only tells half the story, says Offermann. At the crux of Europe and Asia, and emerging from decades of Soviet occupation, the capital of Georgia has a style all of its own. \u201cThe scene here is really interesting,\u201d says Offermann. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of creativity and something exciting happening. Just to get basic art supplies is a challenge, so the artists work with whatever materials and colours they can find and that brings surprises with it.\u201d</p> <p>This same resourcefulness also applies to venues. The lack of purpose-built cultural spaces has resulted in a certain ingenuity, with art cafes opening in crumbling art nouveau houses, pop-up galleries in Soviet-era factories and nightclubs taking over abandoned spaces \u2013 the city\u2019s most famous techno club, Bassiani, can be found beneath the Dinamo football stadium. Similarly, <a href=\"http://projectartbeat.com/en\" title=\"\">Project ArtBeat</a>,<a href=\"http://projectartbeat.com/en\" title=\"\"> </a>which has been instrumental in promoting Georgian contemporary artists, began life as a mobile gallery travelling the country in a shipping container before finding a permanent home in the old town.</p> <p>Offermann\u2019s gallery, <a href=\"https://www.lc-queisser.com/\" title=\"\">LC Queisser</a>, is next door to <a href=\"https://fabrikatbilisi.com/\" title=\"\">Fabrika</a>, a former textile factory that is now home to a hip hostel, artist studios, shops, bars and a courtyard that hosts regular cultural events.</p> <p>Another Soviet-era factory \u2013 a former printing press \u2013 has been drafted into service as Tbilisi\u2019s newest design hotel, <a href=\"https://stambahotel.com/\" title=\"\">The Stamba</a>, where the exposed concrete of the brutalist structure is offset by abundant foliage, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and exquisite pieces of contemporary Georgian design. The hotel is also home to the Tbilisi Photo and Multimedia Museum and gives space to artist studios.</p> <p>Along with its sister property, the equally stylish <a href=\"https://roomshotels.com/\" title=\"\">Rooms Hotel</a>, the Stamba played host to several events during the most recent <a href=\"http://www.tbilisifashionweek.com/\" title=\"\">Tbilisi fashion week</a>, an event that is credited with changing perceptions of the city. This May will also see the return of the <a href=\"https://tbilisiartfair.art/\" title=\"\">Tbilisi Art Fair</a> for its third year, and it is hoped that the growing popularity of this event will give a similar boost to the visual arts.</p> <p>\u201cThe art fair is a really great time to visit Tbilisi as everything is open, there is lots happening and you\u2019ll see the city at its best,\u201d says Offermann. \u201cFor so long the city was closed to the world, but visitor numbers are growing and there is real potential to make this into a centre for design and art.\u201d </p> <h2>Glasgow, Scotland: DIY and the spirit of innovation</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3af3fb28a53d90d99cc5e287be97430bc713dd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3af3fb28a53d90d99cc5e287be97430bc713dd1/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The neogothic mansion of Mount Stuart, Isle of Bute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The neo-gothic mansion of Mount Stuart, Isle of Bute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Fenn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scotland\u2019s biggest art draw this spring is the <a href=\"https://glasgowinternational.org/\" title=\"\">Glasgow International Festival</a>.

In the early 20th century, the Old Town (Altstadt) and its infamous Cabaret Voltaire nightclub were at the heart of the Swiss avant-garde movement. A century later, the neighbourhood has rediscovered its creative mojo with a flurry of new gallery openings and an attention-grabbing new extension to the <a href=\"https://www.kunsthaus.ch/en/\" title=\"\">Kunsthaus art museum</a> on Heimplatz. Designed by David Chipperfield Architects, it won\u2019t open until Februry 2021, but is already creating a buzz with talk of a new \u201cart quarter\u201d for the city and new galleries vying for prime spots on the narrow medieval lanes around the museum.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 20th century, the Old Town was a gathering place for artists and writers and I think there is now a revival going on,\u201d says Fabian Lang, who returned home to Zurich last year to <a href=\"https://fabianlang.ch/\" title=\"\">open his own gallery</a> after eight years working in London and Venice. In the past two years, he estimates that at least eight new galleries have opened in the immediate area, including big names such as <a href=\"https://www.levygorvy.com/\" title=\"\">L\u00e9vy Gorvy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.presenhuber.com/\" title=\"\">Galerie Eva Presenhuber</a> .</p> <p>\u201cZurich has changed in the 10 years since I went away,\u201d says Lang. \u201cThere is a sense of it opening up and becoming more international. It\u2019s still a small city but now it has more of a big-city feel.\u201d</p> <p>Nowhere is this more apparent than in Zurich-West, the once-gritty, now-gentrified industrial neighbourhood that became the city\u2019s epicentre of cool in the mid-1990s when the old L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u brewery was transformed into a huge cultural space. Big-name galleries such as <a href=\"https://www.peterkilchmann.com/\" title=\"\">Peter Kilchmann</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hauserwirth.com/\" title=\"\">Hauser &amp; Wirth</a> https://www.hauserwirth.com quickly followed and the area is now home to the <a href=\"https://migrosmuseum.ch/en/\" title=\"\">Migros Museum of Contemporary Art</a>, as well as countless cool bars and retail outlets, such as the 26-metre <a href=\"https://www.freitag.ch/en\" title=\"\">Freitag Tower</a> , which is made from stacked freight containers and where you can shop for bags made from recycled lorry tarpaulin and seatbelts.</p> <p>For a crash course in Swiss design, from Swatch watches to Toblerone boxes, the <a href=\"https://museum-gestaltung.ch/en\" title=\"\">Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung</a>, in a restored modernist building on Ausstellungsstrasse, is a must-visit. Last spring, the museum reopened the Pavilion Le Corbusier on the shores of Lake Zurich after extensive renovations. The glass and steel building was the final project by the celebrated architect before his death. He called it his Gesamtkunstwerk \u2013 \u201ctotal work of art\u201d \u2013 designing everything from the angular free-floating roof to the door handles. Combining Swiss precision with boundary-pushing design, it is the perfect landmark for Zurich.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kampala, Uganda: a tour of tropical modernism Under a tree outside Uganda\u2019s National Theatre sits architect Doreen Adengo, sheltering from the sun that beats down before heavy rain at this time of year. It\u2019s here she begins her tours of African or \u201ctropical\u201d modernist buildings in Kampala\u2019s central business district, aiming to increase awareness and appreciation of their architecture. She started last year, inspired by architect Manuel Herz\u2019s book African Modernism \u2013 The Architecture of Independence, featuring buildings in Zambia, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Ghana. Herz\u2019s work explores the politics behind these buildings \u2013 mainly constructed in the 50s and 60s \u2013 from colonial projects to nation-building for proud new African leaders. \u201cThe National Theatre fits with our equatorial climate,\u201d says Adengo of the first stop on her tour. \u201cThe rings on the exterior stop the sun from going into the building directly, and it has double facades for ventilation.\u201d This brise soleil is typical of Uganda\u2019s modernist architecture: clever, free air conditioning. \u201cArchitects studied the sun path and wind patterns, and oriented buildings accordingly,\u201d Adengo says. But while the Europeans who carefully designed these buildings considered the climate, Adengo says this typically western theatre didn\u2019t adapt to African culture: \u201cIn our theatre, there is no division between audience and performer.\u201d This could be one reason why most Kampalans haven\u2019t actually entered the theatre. \u201cThey come here to hang out, park cars, have meetings. There\u2019s more activity outside than in,\u201d she laughs. In modern Uganda\u2019s short history, buildings and spaces have been reappropriated again and again by the people \u2013 and their rulers. Another building on the tour, Kampala Serena International Conference Centre, was built in 1975 for Uganda\u2019s infamous former president, Idi Amin. Now part of a luxury hotel, its basement was used as a torture chamber under Amin and President Milton Obote. \u201cThere was this moment of optimism around independence,\u201d Adengo says of the flagship buildings built for modern Uganda, such as the parliament and post office. Back then, the government had big budgets for such ventures, allowing for \u201cgrand, experimental and cutting-edge design in concrete\u201d. Today, architects in Kampala mostly work with private clients, who have a taste for flashy \u201cDubai glass\u201d. Modernist buildings have suffered as a result: an ATM has been installed on top of a mural depicting the story of money and exchange at the front of Tropical Bank; the once brutalist beauty Cham Towers has been covered in gold aluminium panels. Adengo winces when she looks at them: \u201cArchitecture and preservation are not a top priority for Uganda.\u201d But she is passionate about protecting this architecture and is now working with the Uganda Museum \u2013 the country\u2019s first modern building \u2013 on Keeping it Modern, a Getty Foundation project that aims to preserve modernist buildings around the world. She hopes to do the museum\u2019s building justice, using concrete and other original materials in what will be the first conservation management of a modernist building in Uganda. Adengo hopes it will \u201cpave the way for many more\u201d. To join Doreen Adengo\u2019s African Modernism tour of Kampala, email info@adengoarchitecture.com Marrakech, Morroco: where the ancient meets the modern The beauty of Marrakech\u2019s buildings can be elusive. You might glimpse a tiled courtyard or panels of delicate fretwork, but then a door swings shut or you turn a corner. The city\u2019s riads were designed to keep the best decoration on the inside. Luckily, there are more accessible examples of the city\u2019s architecture, ranging from 19th-century palaces to the ultra contemporary. For palatial Islamic style, head to Palais Bahia and Dar Si Said. There is perfection in the small details \u2013 the geometric tiling and carved ceilings \u2013 but step back and a calmer overall symmetry reveals itself. Vestiges of Morocco\u2019s colonial past live on in the city\u2019s Ville Nouvelle and Gueliz areas. This is where you will find the 30s Grande Cafe de la Poste, with its checkerboard tiles, elegant staircases and lazily turning fans. The building was revived in 2006 by Parisian architects Studio KO, who have a base in the city and are better known for designing the nearby Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent. Its silhouette of intersecting arcs and sharper angles was inspired by drawings in the fashion designer\u2019s archives, and exterior brickwork is arranged to resemble the warp and weft of fabric. Interior surfaces are softer and smoother, designed to evoke the lining of a couture jacket. Saint Laurent\u2019s legacy also includes the neighbouring Jardin Majorelle, bought by the designer and his partner Pierre Berg\u00e9 in 1980 to save it from hotel developers. This exotic garden was created by French artist Jacques Majorelle in the 20s, but the luminous cobalt he chose for the walls (later adding it to the fountain, path borders and even plant pots) almost eclipses the greenery. His studio, designed by architect Paul Sinoir, brings together art deco curves, Moorish pillars and cubist inspired overhangs. It now houses a museum of Berber culture, but the longest queues are to take selfies against its \u201cMajorelle blue\u201d walls. Visit the gardens first thing to avoid the Insta crush. The city has a raft of restored riads that function as hotels, varying in authenticity. One of the first was El Fenn and its use of traditional tadelakt (waterproof plaster) and saturated colours is still inspiring. Visit by booking lunch or dinner \u2013 then take in the style while you dine. Los Angeles, US: new frontier town for design Los Angeles has never quite achieved the cultural kudos of New York or San Francisco, but with tech startups priced out of northern California and LA offering low-cost spaces for artists and designers, it has become a frontier town for new ideas in work, wellness and creativity. Landmark buildings are reopening with new purpose \u2013 workspace hub NeueHouse has moved into Downtown\u2019s Bradbury Building (built in 1893), a 1927 fire station has become the Arts District Firehouse hotel and a Beverly Hills villa once owned by Elvis Presley is now Casa Perfect, the California outpost of New York gallery The Future Perfect. \u201cThe design scene here is a lot less saturated than it is in New York,\u201d says Tom Parker, co-founder of London\u2019s Fettle Design, which has an LA office. Fettle recently completed restaurant Olivetta on Melrose Avenue. \u201cThere is more space to find a niche for yourself as there are no big design agencies here and the European aesthetic blends well with California\u2019s laid-back, beachy style.\u201d West Hollywood in particular is turning into a pedestrian-friendly design centre, home to talent such as textile artists Block Shop and ceramicists Bari Ziperstein and Ben Medansky. After the hugely successful launch of Frieze LA last year at Hollywood\u2019s Paramount Studios, this year\u2019s fair has expanded to include Focus LA, a selection of emerging LA galleries including Various Small Fires and as-is.la. A number of new hotels have opened to house the art crowd, including the 1 Hotel and Ian Schrager\u2019s latest Edition. And while you\u2019re there, check out the LA masterpieces by some of architecture\u2019s biggest names. Many of the city\u2019s unique properties can be toured for a few dollars if you book in advance, such as Case Study House 22 (better known as the Stahl House), the Eames house, Watts Tower and Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Hollyhock House. Brussels, Belgium: take a ride through outdoor art \u201cBelgium is full of great design talents, yet it doesn\u2019t show off about it,\u201d says Liv Vaisberg. She should know. Vaisberg is co-founder of Brussels\u2019 Collectible design fair, heading into its third year this March. Alongside international galleries, Collectible has a showcase for new names. \u201cThe fair acts as a platform for designers, mostly emerging or with no gallery representation, who have the chance to take centre stage and present their own work to potential clients,\u201d says fellow co-founder Cl\u00e9lie Debehault. As major Belgian institutions the Design Museum Ghent, CID Grand-Horn and Z33 also exhibit, Collectible is a snapshot of Belgium\u2019s design scene from the grassroots up. Don\u2019t neglect Belgium\u2019s art scene while you\u2019re there. 2020 is the year of Van Eyck and Ghent\u2019s Museum of Fine Art is holding a major exhibition to celebrate, reuniting more than half the world\u2019s remaining Van Eyck works. While in Antwerp, visit interior designer Axel Vervoordt\u2019s Kanaal cultural complex just outside the city. The converted distillery is a remarkable space, including flats by Vervoordt, as well as galleries and installation spaces that anyone can view by appointment. Featured works include Anish Kapoor\u2019s At the Edge of the World (1998) and James Turrell\u2019s Red Shift (1995), as well as pieces by Marina Abramovic and Takis. And if you are in Antwerp, it is just a one-hour drive to Limburg to experience a completely different sort of design: bicycle trails. A series of cycle tracks opened last year that lets you cycle through the trees, as well as at eye-level through a pond. A final track arrives this year where you can cycle underground. There are now more than 2,000km of trails throughout the province of Limburg, including a ride that takes you past outdoor artworks curated by major Belgian gallery Z33. Tbilisi, Georgia: welcome to the new Berlin When Lisa Offermann moved from Berlin to Tbilisi to open an art gallery in 2018, some of her friends and colleagues thought she was mad. \u201cThey were like: \u2018Why? What? Where is Tbilisi?\u2019\u201d But Offermann, who had been working with Georgian artists for several years, had fallen in love with the city\u2019s energy and sense of untapped potential. The Georgian capital\u2019s burgeoning art, fashion and underground clubbing scene has earned it the nickname \u201cthe new Berlin\u201d. But that only tells half the story, says Offermann. At the crux of Europe and Asia, and emerging from decades of Soviet occupation, the capital of Georgia has a style all of its own. \u201cThe scene here is really interesting,\u201d says Offermann. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of creativity and something exciting happening. Just to get basic art supplies is a challenge, so the artists work with whatever materials and colours they can find and that brings surprises with it.\u201d This same resourcefulness also applies to venues. The lack of purpose-built cultural spaces has resulted in a certain ingenuity, with art cafes opening in crumbling art nouveau houses, pop-up galleries in Soviet-era factories and nightclubs taking over abandoned spaces \u2013 the city\u2019s most famous techno club, Bassiani, can be found beneath the Dinamo football stadium. Similarly, Project ArtBeat, which has been instrumental in promoting Georgian contemporary artists, began life as a mobile gallery travelling the country in a shipping container before finding a permanent home in the old town. Offermann\u2019s gallery, LC Queisser, is next door to Fabrika, a former textile factory that is now home to a hip hostel, artist studios, shops, bars and a courtyard that hosts regular cultural events. Another Soviet-era factory \u2013 a former printing press \u2013 has been drafted into service as Tbilisi\u2019s newest design hotel, The Stamba, where the exposed concrete of the brutalist structure is offset by abundant foliage, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and exquisite pieces of contemporary Georgian design. The hotel is also home to the Tbilisi Photo and Multimedia Museum and gives space to artist studios. Along with its sister property, the equally stylish Rooms Hotel, the Stamba played host to several events during the most recent Tbilisi fashion week, an event that is credited with changing perceptions of the city. This May will also see the return of the Tbilisi Art Fair for its third year, and it is hoped that the growing popularity of this event will give a similar boost to the visual arts. \u201cThe art fair is a really great time to visit Tbilisi as everything is open, there is lots happening and you\u2019ll see the city at its best,\u201d says Offermann. \u201cFor so long the city was closed to the world, but visitor numbers are growing and there is real potential to make this into a centre for design and art.\u201d Glasgow, Scotland: DIY and the spirit of innovation Scotland\u2019s biggest art draw this spring is the Glasgow International Festival. Not only can visitors view exciting new work at top museums and galleries \u2013 including sculpture by Eva Rothschild at The Modern Institute and a large-scale commission by Turner prize-winner Duncan Campbell at Kelvin Hall that incorporates electromagnetics and animation \u2013 but across the city, artists are also putting on events at the unlikeliest of venues. A repurposed waiting room at the Queen\u2019s Park Railway Club will house artist Graham Fagen\u2019s solo show inspired by an archive of notes, letters, name tags and invitations that all spell his name wrong; and Glasgow Women\u2019s Library will host a programme of talks about lesbian history and culture in the UK. \u201cThere\u2019s a real do-it-yourself attitude among artists in Glasgow which is typified during the festival at The Old Hairdresser\u2019s bar,\u201d says Andrew Hamilton, co-director of The Modern Institute. \u201cIt always hosts amazing performances and gigs and ends up becoming an unofficial hub. It\u2019s these kinds of spaces that really make things interesting here.\u201d He cites the artist-led Celine, the contemporary David Dale and the commercial Koppe Astner galleries as other venues worth visiting \u2013 at any time of year. \u201cAt all of these places, artists don\u2019t have to be 10 years into a career to have a show.\u201d For architecture fans, Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u2019s connection to the city can be seen through places such as Mackintosh House, set within the Hunterian Art Gallery, where the original fixtures, furniture and key interiors from his home have been re-assembled. While there, take the ferry ride to the Isle of Bute and the neo-gothic mansion Mount Stuart. It\u2019s full of design innovations (the world\u2019s first domestic heated swimming pool, an early telephone system) and has a contemporary visual arts programme featuring, until the end of February, an outdoor commission by Scottish sculptor Martin Boyce, inspired by a dismantled tennis court. \u201cThe city has such a rich art scene; there\u2019s a sense that everyone is contributing to something bigger,\u201d says Glasgow International director Richard Parry. \u201cArtists in Scotland really get on with it and create work on their own terms.\u201d Glasgow International runs from 24 April to 10 May Tokyo, Japan: an immersive exchange of culture From Michelin-star restaurants tucked down alleyways to basement karaoke bars, so much of life in Japan happens behind closed doors \u2013 which is where airKitchen comes in. The idea is to connect home cooks with travelling foodies who can book cooking classes run by locals across Japan. Once you have whipped up ramen noodles or a trio of traditional desserts, say, you tuck into your efforts with the host. This notion of encouraging visitors to feel part of the country is also evident at Trunk(Hotel), which opened in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya neighbourhood in 2017. \u201cWe wanted guests to immerse themselves in our culture,\u201d says Hiroe Tanaka, creative director of the Trunk Atelier. \u201cThe social spaces encourage a sense of community; we use them as a platform for local talent through programming DJs and other events.\u201d Last year, the company opened a second, very different venture: Trunk(House), a one-bedroom micro-hotel (sleeps four) in a former geisha house in the Kagurazaka district known as Little Kyoto. \u201cJust as creatives in the past would use the salons in this neighbourhood as places of cultural exchange, we hope that Trunk(House) will leave guests inspired,\u201d says Tanaka, who worked alongside studio Tripster on the interiors that combine pared-back style with contemporary design: tea sets by Tom Sachs, furniture by Stephen Kenn and lighting by Jean Prouve. \u201cOur commissions followed the rough brief of Tokyo-ness; the result is a collection of art that embodies the essence of the city.\u201d The two-year-old Yayoi Kusama Museum is only a 20-minute stroll away and you can visit the Kume Sekkei-designed building dedicated to the avant-garde Japanese artist. Also pop into the Ghibli Museum, which celebrates the work of award-winning animation director Hayao Miyzaki and Studio Ghibli. Currently you can see an exhibition of Miyzaki\u2019s original plans and drawings for the foundation of the museum. And make sure you see a Ghibli film in the Saturn theatre in the museum\u2019s basement. This month\u2019s film is A Sumo Wrestler\u2019s Tail. Zurich, Switzerland: cutting-edge and cool precision The birthplace of dadaism and the Helvetica typeface, Zurich is no stranger to innovative art and design. In the early 20th century, the Old Town (Altstadt) and its infamous Cabaret Voltaire nightclub were at the heart of the Swiss avant-garde movement. A century later, the neighbourhood has rediscovered its creative mojo with a flurry of new gallery openings and an attention-grabbing new extension to the Kunsthaus art museum on Heimplatz. Designed by David Chipperfield Architects, it won\u2019t open until Februry 2021, but is already creating a buzz with talk of a new \u201cart quarter\u201d for the city and new galleries vying for prime spots on the narrow medieval lanes around the museum. \u201cIn the 20th century, the Old Town was a gathering place for artists and writers and I think there is now a revival going on,\u201d says Fabian Lang, who returned home to Zurich last year to open his own gallery after eight years working in London and Venice. In the past two years, he estimates that at least eight new galleries have opened in the immediate area, including big names such as L\u00e9vy Gorvy and Galerie Eva Presenhuber . \u201cZurich has changed in the 10 years since I went away,\u201d says Lang. \u201cThere is a sense of it opening up and becoming more international. It\u2019s still a small city but now it has more of a big-city feel.\u201d Nowhere is this more apparent than in Zurich-West, the once-gritty, now-gentrified industrial neighbourhood that became the city\u2019s epicentre of cool in the mid-1990s when the old L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u brewery was transformed into a huge cultural space. Big-name galleries such as Peter Kilchmann and Hauser &amp; Wirth https://www.hauserwirth.com quickly followed and the area is now home to the Migros Museum of Contemporary Art, as well as countless cool bars and retail outlets, such as the 26-metre Freitag Tower , which is made from stacked freight containers and where you can shop for bags made from recycled lorry tarpaulin and seatbelts. For a crash course in Swiss design, from Swatch watches to Toblerone boxes, the Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung, in a restored modernist building on Ausstellungsstrasse, is a must-visit. Last spring, the museum reopened the Pavilion Le Corbusier on the shores of Lake Zurich after extensive renovations. The glass and steel building was the final project by the celebrated architect before his death. He called it his Gesamtkunstwerk \u2013 \u201ctotal work of art\u201d \u2013 designing everything from the angular free-floating roof to the door handles. Combining Swiss precision with boundary-pushing design, it is the perfect landmark for Zurich.",

It made me understand the only thing in life we\u2019re sure of is right now. Enjoy every moment. Do I miss breakfast television? Yes. I\u2019d love to do a wellbeing programme now. But no matter where I am \u2013 music festivals, schools, cruise ships \u2013 crowds follow. I\u2019m the Pied Piper of health!

The chair is covered in woolly fabric, with an office blind on each side. \u201cI find these blinds quite beautiful and filmic but also ominous and claustrophobic, as they represent offices and meeting rooms and other terrors,\u201d says Barnes.</p> <p>Despite the concepts, Barnes remains true to his roots: these are all pieces you could sit on in an unfurnished flat. \u201cIf you can only look at something rather than use it,\u201d he says, it quickly becomes invisible and impotent, I think.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Ace &amp; Jig\u2019s ethical clothing with long-term commitment</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2918902f3445e0da9a664809467cf9deb918dcd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2918902f3445e0da9a664809467cf9deb918dcd7/0_110_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clothing by Ace &amp; Jig.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clothing by Ace &amp; Jig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ace &amp; Jig</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many clothing brands scramble to sort out their supply chain and eco credentials, <a href=\"https://aceandjig.com/\" title=\"\">Ace &amp; Jig</a> celebrates 10 years of life as an environmentally aware, slow-fashion label that aims to produce zero waste and prolong the lifespan of their clothes.

It is not only our existence that is costing the earth, but also our demise. Traditional burials are the worst culprits, with toxic embalming fluids and copious concrete and timber usage. Cremations produce high carbon dioxide emissions and even natural burials, which are on the rise, require land.</p> <p>But what if we could swiftly and naturally become human compost that could nourish new life? This sustainable option will become a reality in Seattle in spring 2021, when the first <a href=\"https://www.recompose.life/\" title=\"\">Recompose</a> facility offering \u201cnatural organic reduction\u201d opens in the city\u2019s SoDo neighbourhood. Washington State is the first US state to legalise this process, which uses one-eighth of the energy of cremation.</p> <p>Founder and CEO of Recompose, Katrina Spade, invented the system taking cues from farming methods used for recycling livestock. \u201cWe\u2019re using nature \u2013 which has perfected the life/death cycle \u2013 as a model for human death care,\u201d she says. \u201cWe saw an opportunity to both give back to the earth and reconnect us with natural cycles.\u201d Early prototypes were designed in collaboration with <a href=\"https://olsonkundig.com/\" title=\"\">Olson Kundig</a>, and now the Seattle-based architecture firm is transforming a 1960s-built warehouse into the inaugural 18,500 sq ft facility.</p> <p>The process is coffin-free. Corpses are wrapped in a cotton shroud and placed on a steel cradle filled with straw, wood chips and alfalfa. A \u201claying-in\u201d ritual follows that the family can attend, during which more of these ingredients are added, before the cradle slides into a hexagonal receptacle. Staff remove the shroud and seal the compartment to allow the 30-day process to begin.</p> <p>Renderings of Recompose: Seattle reveal a futuristic-like hive, with a central gathering space for ceremonies, surrounded by hexagonal-shaped storage for up to 75 bodies. The design deliberately references nature, \u201cspecifically, the collective community of a beehive\u201d, says architect Alan Maskin, a principal of Olson Kundig. \u201cIt has good structural properties, enabling us to vertically stack the vessels, which is important because Recompose\u2019s focus is on providing a sustainable death-care alternative for our cities, where space is at a premium.\u201d After a month, the rich, dark, newly created soil is removed and can be donated to local forest conservation projects or taken home by relatives and used to plant new life. </p> <h2>Paraa\u2019s community-led urban design in Bangladesh</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be229d20aeab7b226a454678707f97cd82575345\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be229d20aeab7b226a454678707f97cd82575345/0_336_6044_3626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dhaka, Bangladesh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Paraa\u2019s constructions in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fayed Masud Khan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you grow up in a place like Dhaka, you know something in the city is not right,\u201d says Kazi Arefin, an architect who works in the Bangladeshi capital. Dhaka is a sprawling metropolis of extremes. In the centre, the rich hide from smoggy traffic jams in the back of air-conditioned cars, while the poor balance on the narrow seats of elaborately decorated cycle rickshaws. At the wrong time of day, a 10-minute journey can take hours.</p> <p>Arefin decided the best way to find a role for his work was to start a \u201cdesign and architecture studio focused on enhancing communities\u201d. The result was Paraa, founded in 2011 with urban planner and artist Ruhul Abdin. Their projects, often for charities, include training centres, children\u2019s homes and hospitals. Workers and residents are involved in the design from the start. This way, says Kazi, they \u201cfeel ownership of a space and that the project suits their needs\u201d.</p> <p>When Paraa designed a homeless shelter in 2015, for example, they quickly found that the priorities of its users \u2013 mainly women with children \u2013 were not always the same as those of the charity running the project. The users \u201cwanted a space in which to play, to wash, to cook\u201d, says Paraa\u2019s co-founder, Ruhul Abdin. \u201cAnd lots of bathrooms!\u201d</p> <p>Managing and supporting these initiatives through good design can play a vital role in spotlighting the issues many city dwellers in Dhaka face. Paraa\u2019s 10m high Bamboo Playspace, which won a Berger award for excellence in architecture in 2017, shows how buildings can forge bonds.</p> <p>While the public structure is used by children across the local community, it is connected to <a href=\"https://leedobd.org/peace-home/\" title=\"\">Leedo Peace Home</a>, a refuge for street children who are often disabled. \u201cIt\u2019s become a bridge between those children who might otherwise be seen as troubled and local communities, who are now their friends.\u201d</p> <h2>Designing for the art world with Apfel</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8580a26bd3409e033da25d78206e550c9568610\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8580a26bd3409e033da25d78206e550c9568610/250_0_1500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Deller\u2019s All That Is Solid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Deller\u2019s All That Is Solid, with typography by Apfel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Apfel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the gate of their east London studio onwards, you get a sense of graphic designers Kirsty Carter and Emma Thomas\u2019 approach. Their agency name is written in letters sketched specifically for the metalwork, and produced according to the proportions of the golden ratio. <a href=\"https://apracticeforeverydaylife.com/\" title=\"\">The name spelt out is Apfel</a> which stands for A Practice For Everyday Living, a nod to the title of French scholar <a href=\"https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780190221911/obo-9780190221911-0036.xml\" title=\"\">Michel de Certeau</a>\u2019s 1980 book, The Practice of Everyday Life.</p> <p>Carter and Thomas started the company in 2003, after meeting on the Royal College of Art\u2019s communication, art and design course. They were inspired by De Certeau\u2019s description of \u201ca way of making sense of a place by collecting materials, subverting existing patterns and drawing together new stories\u201d. As Carter says: \u201cWe loved the connection of De Certeau\u2019s writing \u2026 the references you gather from your daily rituals of everyday life.\u201d</p> <p>Now Apfel is the art world\u2019s favourite studio, working with institutions such as the Tate and individual artists, designing posters, art books, exhibition signage and invitations \u2013 encompassing everything from the micro to the macro.</p> <p>Its breakthrough moment came in 2011, overseeing the visual identity for <a href=\"https://hepworthwakefield.org/\" title=\"\">The Hepworth Wakefield</a>, the museum dedicated to the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, creating new typefaces, signage and wayfinding, as well as website and permanent exhibition graphics. \u201cIt was unusual for them to trust a single design agency, let alone one so young,\u201d says Thomas. </p> <p>The project is typical of the space they like to work in: that intersection between art and design in areas involving what Carter describes as \u201ca closeness and a conversation: a sense of collaboration\u201d.</p> <p>This attention to detail is clear in all its projects. Apfel makes books and catalogues for Portuguese artist<a href=\"http://www.kurimanzutto.com/en/artists/leonor-antunes\" title=\"\"> Leon</a><a href=\"http://www.kurimanzutto.com/en/artists/leonor-antunes\" title=\"\">or Antunes</a>. All feature exposed binding, which echoes the stitching in Antunes\u2019 work. The packaging Apfel created for the shoe brand <a href=\"https://www.johnlobb.com/en_gb/\">John Lobb</a> has a speckled pattern inspired by the shavings and spatters found on the company\u2019s workshop floor.</p> <p>The duo seem particularly proud of their work creating artist monographs, which they have done for names including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/29/lee-krasner-living-colour-barbican-london-review\" title=\"\">Lee Krasner</a>, David Hockney and Jeremy Deller. \u201cPrinted material is a space in the same way an exhibition is,\u201d says Thomas. De Certeau couldn\u2019t have put it better.</p> <h2>Skating and educating with Skateistan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b74576a64624b3481e14a6d22936eedd74eb0513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b74576a64624b3481e14a6d22936eedd74eb0513/0_121_4759_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A happy customer at Skateistan\u2019s centre at Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A happy customer at Skateistan\u2019s centre at Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Buchanan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This week brought BAFTA and Oscar nominations for the delightful short film <a href=\"https://grainmedia.co.uk/work/learning-to-skateboard-in-a-warzone\">Learning to Skateboard in a War Zone (if you\u2019re a Girl)</a>. The documentary features the amazing work of <a href=\"https://skateistan.org/\">Skateistan</a>. This not-for-profit organisation works in Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa to give local children a safe space to develop. As well as learning to skateboard, children can access education, arts programmes and even clean water. The project was started by Australian Oliver Percovich in Kabul in 2007 when he moved there with his girlfriend. When he saw how much local teenagers enjoyed using the skateboards he lent them, he set up Skateistan. The organisation grew, opening Afghanistan\u2019s first skate park but also building classrooms so visitors could learn, too. Street workers were offered accelerated learning programmes so they could graduate to public school. Special classes for children with disabilities were also added, giving opportunities to girls to develop became a key mission. Skateistan has four schools \u2013 in Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan, Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Johannesburg, South Africa \u2013 and this year a fifth is opening in Bamyan, central Afghanistan. Outreach workers are already in the area working with children to design their ideal skate schools \u2013 spaces where they can be safe but also have fun.</p>",

One of his pieces \u2013 A Wild Sheep Chaise: Dolphin Hotel Club Chair, inspired by Haruki Murakami\u2019s novel A Wild Sheep Chase \u2013 does exactly that. The chair is covered in woolly fabric, with an office blind on each side. \u201cI find these blinds quite beautiful and filmic but also ominous and claustrophobic, as they represent offices and meeting rooms and other terrors,\u201d says Barnes. Despite the concepts, Barnes remains true to his roots: these are all pieces you could sit on in an unfurnished flat. \u201cIf you can only look at something rather than use it,\u201d he says, it quickly becomes invisible and impotent, I think.\u201d Ace &amp; Jig\u2019s ethical clothing with long-term commitment While many clothing brands scramble to sort out their supply chain and eco credentials, Ace &amp; Jig celebrates 10 years of life as an environmentally aware, slow-fashion label that aims to produce zero waste and prolong the lifespan of their clothes. The Brooklyn-based company has an impressive history with their Indian textile workers, offering free childcare and fresh vegetables to staff (90% of whom are women). Their latest initiative is to foster Ace &amp; Jig communities for customers by organising meet-ups. Join if you\u2019d like to resell old styles, clothes swap or pick up scrap fabrics for patching. For a recent project, customers worked together to make squares from scraps and create quilts. Recompose: getting serious about the circle of life \u201cEarth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust\u201d \u2013 on a densely populated planet, it is hard to achieve this without serious environmental implications. It is not only our existence that is costing the earth, but also our demise. Traditional burials are the worst culprits, with toxic embalming fluids and copious concrete and timber usage. Cremations produce high carbon dioxide emissions and even natural burials, which are on the rise, require land. But what if we could swiftly and naturally become human compost that could nourish new life? This sustainable option will become a reality in Seattle in spring 2021, when the first Recompose facility offering \u201cnatural organic reduction\u201d opens in the city\u2019s SoDo neighbourhood. Washington State is the first US state to legalise this process, which uses one-eighth of the energy of cremation. Founder and CEO of Recompose, Katrina Spade, invented the system taking cues from farming methods used for recycling livestock. \u201cWe\u2019re using nature \u2013 which has perfected the life/death cycle \u2013 as a model for human death care,\u201d she says. \u201cWe saw an opportunity to both give back to the earth and reconnect us with natural cycles.\u201d Early prototypes were designed in collaboration with Olson Kundig, and now the Seattle-based architecture firm is transforming a 1960s-built warehouse into the inaugural 18,500 sq ft facility. The process is coffin-free. Corpses are wrapped in a cotton shroud and placed on a steel cradle filled with straw, wood chips and alfalfa. A \u201claying-in\u201d ritual follows that the family can attend, during which more of these ingredients are added, before the cradle slides into a hexagonal receptacle. Staff remove the shroud and seal the compartment to allow the 30-day process to begin. Renderings of Recompose: Seattle reveal a futuristic-like hive, with a central gathering space for ceremonies, surrounded by hexagonal-shaped storage for up to 75 bodies. The design deliberately references nature, \u201cspecifically, the collective community of a beehive\u201d, says architect Alan Maskin, a principal of Olson Kundig. \u201cIt has good structural properties, enabling us to vertically stack the vessels, which is important because Recompose\u2019s focus is on providing a sustainable death-care alternative for our cities, where space is at a premium.\u201d After a month, the rich, dark, newly created soil is removed and can be donated to local forest conservation projects or taken home by relatives and used to plant new life. Paraa\u2019s community-led urban design in Bangladesh \u201cWhen you grow up in a place like Dhaka, you know something in the city is not right,\u201d says Kazi Arefin, an architect who works in the Bangladeshi capital. Dhaka is a sprawling metropolis of extremes. In the centre, the rich hide from smoggy traffic jams in the back of air-conditioned cars, while the poor balance on the narrow seats of elaborately decorated cycle rickshaws. At the wrong time of day, a 10-minute journey can take hours. Arefin decided the best way to find a role for his work was to start a \u201cdesign and architecture studio focused on enhancing communities\u201d. The result was Paraa, founded in 2011 with urban planner and artist Ruhul Abdin. Their projects, often for charities, include training centres, children\u2019s homes and hospitals. Workers and residents are involved in the design from the start. This way, says Kazi, they \u201cfeel ownership of a space and that the project suits their needs\u201d. When Paraa designed a homeless shelter in 2015, for example, they quickly found that the priorities of its users \u2013 mainly women with children \u2013 were not always the same as those of the charity running the project. The users \u201cwanted a space in which to play, to wash, to cook\u201d, says Paraa\u2019s co-founder, Ruhul Abdin. \u201cAnd lots of bathrooms!\u201d Managing and supporting these initiatives through good design can play a vital role in spotlighting the issues many city dwellers in Dhaka face. Paraa\u2019s 10m high Bamboo Playspace, which won a Berger award for excellence in architecture in 2017, shows how buildings can forge bonds. While the public structure is used by children across the local community, it is connected to Leedo Peace Home, a refuge for street children who are often disabled. \u201cIt\u2019s become a bridge between those children who might otherwise be seen as troubled and local communities, who are now their friends.\u201d Designing for the art world with Apfel From the gate of their east London studio onwards, you get a sense of graphic designers Kirsty Carter and Emma Thomas\u2019 approach. Their agency name is written in letters sketched specifically for the metalwork, and produced according to the proportions of the golden ratio. The name spelt out is Apfel which stands for A Practice For Everyday Living, a nod to the title of French scholar Michel de Certeau\u2019s 1980 book, The Practice of Everyday Life. Carter and Thomas started the company in 2003, after meeting on the Royal College of Art\u2019s communication, art and design course. They were inspired by De Certeau\u2019s description of \u201ca way of making sense of a place by collecting materials, subverting existing patterns and drawing together new stories\u201d. As Carter says: \u201cWe loved the connection of De Certeau\u2019s writing \u2026 the references you gather from your daily rituals of everyday life.\u201d Now Apfel is the art world\u2019s favourite studio, working with institutions such as the Tate and individual artists, designing posters, art books, exhibition signage and invitations \u2013 encompassing everything from the micro to the macro. Its breakthrough moment came in 2011, overseeing the visual identity for The Hepworth Wakefield, the museum dedicated to the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, creating new typefaces, signage and wayfinding, as well as website and permanent exhibition graphics. \u201cIt was unusual for them to trust a single design agency, let alone one so young,\u201d says Thomas. The project is typical of the space they like to work in: that intersection between art and design in areas involving what Carter describes as \u201ca closeness and a conversation: a sense of collaboration\u201d. This attention to detail is clear in all its projects. Apfel makes books and catalogues for Portuguese artist Leonor Antunes. All feature exposed binding, which echoes the stitching in Antunes\u2019 work. The packaging Apfel created for the shoe brand John Lobb has a speckled pattern inspired by the shavings and spatters found on the company\u2019s workshop floor. The duo seem particularly proud of their work creating artist monographs, which they have done for names including Lee Krasner, David Hockney and Jeremy Deller. \u201cPrinted material is a space in the same way an exhibition is,\u201d says Thomas. De Certeau couldn\u2019t have put it better. Skating and educating with Skateistan This week brought BAFTA and Oscar nominations for the delightful short film Learning to Skateboard in a War Zone (if you\u2019re a Girl). The documentary features the amazing work of Skateistan. This not-for-profit organisation works in Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa to give local children a safe space to develop. As well as learning to skateboard, children can access education, arts programmes and even clean water. The project was started by Australian Oliver Percovich in Kabul in 2007 when he moved there with his girlfriend. When he saw how much local teenagers enjoyed using the skateboards he lent them, he set up Skateistan. The organisation grew, opening Afghanistan\u2019s first skate park but also building classrooms so visitors could learn, too. Street workers were offered accelerated learning programmes so they could graduate to public school. Special classes for children with disabilities were also added, giving opportunities to girls to develop became a key mission. Skateistan has four schools \u2013 in Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan, Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Johannesburg, South Africa \u2013 and this year a fifth is opening in Bamyan, central Afghanistan. Outreach workers are already in the area working with children to design their ideal skate schools \u2013 spaces where they can be safe but also have fun.",

The Guardian revealed on Friday that counter-terrorism police had placed the non-violent protest group on a list of extremist ideologies that should be reported to the authorities running the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme. Police now say that was an error. Amnesty International condemned the decision on Saturday as criticism grew and questions remained about how Extinction Rebellion (XR) came to be included in the guide alongside neo-Nazi and terrorist groups. The climate emergency campaign group was included in a 12-page document produced by Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) titled \u201cSafeguarding young people and adults from ideological extremism\u201d. XR has instructed lawyers. Jules Carey, who acted for XR when it successfully struck down police protest bans in the courts last year, told the Guardian that the latest guidance was unlawful. \u201cIt is extraordinary that Counter Terrorism Policing South East have added Extinction Rebellion to the list of terrorist groups and extremist organisations that the Prevent strategy was set up to deal with. \u201cThe guidance issued by the CTPSE is clearly unlawful. It constitutes an unlawful interference with human rights including free speech, right to assemble and enjoyment of a private life. \u201cThe guidance is clearly designed to harm Extinction Rebellion and cast those who support the movement as domestic extremists. It is a glaring example of the sort of overzealous policing we have come to expect around protests. Being referred to Prevent could have long-lasting and life-changing consequences for a young school activist.\u201d After inquiries by the Guardian police said they were recalling the guidance and that XR had been included in error in the guide, which was distributed to police, government and teachers in November 2019. Carey, of Bindmans solicitors, said: \u201cIt is not sufficient that CTPSE have sought to recall the guide from those that they shared it with. The advice in the guide \u2026 itself needs to be formally withdrawn and any decision taken to refer an activist of XR to Prevent needs to be urgently reversed.\u201d Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK\u2019s campaigns director, said the police guidance added to longstanding concerns about Prevent. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply shocking that the police ever seriously considered classifying peaceful climate crisis protesters as extremists.

This episode only adds to our existing concerns about Prevent, which is a highly dubious scheme sorely in need of a proper, independent and impartial review.\u201d Prevent is the the government\u2019s anti-radicalisation programme. It is intended to spot people at risk of becoming involved in terrorism and divert them away from extremism. Concerns have been raised that it impinges on freedom of thought and speech. Its supporters, which include the government and the police, say it is vital to stop the flow of recruits to Islamist and extreme rightwing violence, but it has been accepted that changes may be needed. A review of Prevent that is due to report later this year is expected to be delayed after its original chair stepped down following criticism and a legal challenge. The police document revealed by the Guardian said that issues to look out for included people who speak in \u201cstrong or emotive terms about environmental issues like climate change, ecology, species extinction, fracking, airport expansion or pollution\u201d. The guide advises readers to listen and look out for young people who \u201cneglect to attend school\u201d or \u201cparticipate in planned school walkouts\u201d \u2013 an allusion to the school strikes for the climate, a global movement of which the activist Greta Thunberg is a lead proponent. Thousands of UK pupils and millions worldwide walked out of school last year in protest at government inaction on the climate crisis. The document also flags young people taking part in non-violent direct action, such as sit-down protests, banner drops or \u201cwriting environmentally themed graffiti\u201d. The disclosure that XR has been listed alongside proscribed groups such as National Action and al-Muhajiroun is being blamed on police in the south-east of England rather than a decision at the national level. Clare Collier of the civil rights group Liberty said: \u201cThis is a startling example of how Prevent stifles free speech, labels dissent as dangerous and gives the police sweeping powers to monitor non-violent, non-criminal behaviour.

      "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s admission that it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane has been met with international demands for a full investigation into the disaster, in which 176 people died during a period of soaring tensions between Tehran and Washington. A statement on Iran\u2019s official IRNA news agency on Saturday morning said the military had made an \u201cunforgivable mistake\u201d in targeting Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 shortly after it took off from Tehran\u2019s international airport on Wednesday. It was followed by condolences from Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and an apology from the country\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani. The Boeing 737 was hit by two surface-to-air missiles in the hours after Tehran launched ballistic missile strikes on US military bases in Iraq. The airliner was downed as a result of human error at a time when miltary forces were on high alert, the statement said. Iranian officials had previously denied a missile strike was to blame, dismissing the allegations as western propaganda and blaming mechanical malfunction. Saturday\u2019s statement was greeted with some relief that the immediate cause of the disaster had been made clear, but Ukraine, Canada and other countries with citizens among the victims have since made fresh calls for further measures from Tehran. The Ukrainian president, Volodymy Zelenskiy, said: \u201cEven before the termination of the international commission, Iran has pleaded guilty to crashing the Ukrainian plane. But we insist on full admission of guilt. We expect from Iran assurances of readiness for full and open investigation, bringing those responsible to justice, returning the bodies of the dead, payment of compensation, official apologies through diplomatic channels.\u201d He later wrote on Facebook: \u201cWe expect Iran ... to bring the guilty to the courts,\u201d , adding that he was scheduled to speak to Rouhani on Saturday afternoon. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said his country\u2019s focus was on \u201cclosure, accountability, transparency and justice\u201d for the families of the 57 Canadian victims. Iran has invited investigators from Canada, Ukraine and Boeing to visit the accident site on the outskirts of Tehran and said it would welcome representatives of other countries whose citizens had died. Responsible parties would be held accountable, Iran\u2019s military said, and its systems would be upgraded to prevent such mistakes in future. Khamenei said he sent deep sympathy to the families of the victims and expressed a desire for a comprehensive investigation. He called on the armed forces to \u201cpursue probable shortcomings and guilt in the painful incident\u201d. The acknowledgement of responsibility has renewed questions about why authorities did not shut down the country\u2019s main international airport and its airspace after launching the missile attacks on Iraq when they feared US reprisals were possible. The strikes on the two US bases on Iraqi soil were retaliation for the US drone strike that killed the powerful Quds force leader Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad on 3 January, the culmination of months of tit-for-tat attacks that recently threatened to push Washington and Tehran into war. It also undermines the credibility of information provided by senior Iranian officials so far. As recently as Friday, Ali Abedzadeh, the head of the national aviation department, told reporters with certainty that a missile had not caused the crash. The cabinet spokesman, Ali Rabiei, dismissed reports of a missile on Thursday, saying they rubbed salt on a painful wound for families of the victims. Air crash experts have raised serious concerns since the accident over the handling of the crash site, including the removal of debris, sparking fears that Tehran has sought to eliminate evidence from the area. The passenger plane was mistaken for a hostile target after it turned toward a sensitive military centre, said General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards aerospace division. His unit accepted full responsibility for downing the plane, he said. In an address broadcast by state TV, he said he wished he was dead when he learned about the accident. He said the Revolutionary Guards had strengthened their air defences and were at the \u201chighest level of readiness\u201d for fear the US would retaliate. He said an officer made the \u201cbad decision\u201d to open fire on the plane after mistaking it for a cruise missile. The public acknowledgement is likely to inflame public sentiment inside Iran against the authorities after citizens rallied around their leaders in the wake of Suleimani\u2019s killing. The vast majority of the passengers on the plane were Iranians or Iranian-Canadians, and the crash came a few weeks after a widespread crackdown on protests triggered by a rise in fuel prices. The flight, which was bound for Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 57 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians and three Britons. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that Khamenei had ordered top security officials to review the crash on Friday morning and announce the results. \u201cIf some individuals, in any position, were aware of the issue but made statements contradicting the reality or hid the truth for any reason, they should be named and tried,\u201d said Fars, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards. Others speculated that the security forces may have concealed information from civilian authorities. \u201cConcealing the truth from the administration is dreadful,\u201d Mohammad Fazeli, a sociology professor in Tehran, wrote on social media. \u201cIf it had not been concealed, the head of civil aviation and the government spokesmen would not have persistently denied it. Concealing the truth for three days is dangerous.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Mention the word pension to a self-employed person and there is a high chance you will put the fear of God into them. According to a survey of 2,000 people by National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), the government-backed pensions provider, only 24% of self-employed people are actively saving into a pension.</p> <p>Given the rollercoaster nature of working for yourself \u2013 limited company owners and sole traders\u2019 incomes can widely fluctuate from one month to the next \u2013 the thought of regularly stashing away money into a pot that can only be tapped into decades down the line does not sound very appealing.</p> <p>However, with 5 million self-employed workers in the UK, experts warn members of this group are likely to face financial crisis when they retire, if indeed they ever do.</p> <p>The new flat-rate state pension is currently <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/what-youll-get\" title=\"\">\u00a3168.60 per week</a>, or \u00a38,767 a year, and then only if you have made full national insurance contributions. So unless people expect to work until they die, most self-employed workers will need some additional kind of financial safety net to see them through retirement and older age.</p> <p>Unlike employees whose companies are legally obliged to sign them up to the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/auto-enrolment-pensions\" title=\"\">auto-enrolment scheme</a>, it is left to self-employed people to sort out their own provisions for the future.</p> <p>John Greer from the financial services company Quilter says: \u201cVery often, the self-employed catch up with long-term savings once they have an established income and businesses, which is logical and natural behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a different mindset to those with an employer who have a static income and a lot of responsibility like sickness benefits, and income protection is given to the employer.\u201d</p> <p>Greer recommends planning some level of financial contingency for the future. \u201cGenerally, the rule of thumb is whatever age you are, save half of it. For example, if you\u2019re 20, start putting 10% [of your income] aside; if you start later at 40 years old then save 20%.\u201d</p> <p>Holly Mackay, the founder and chief executive of Boring Money, believes the best way to start saving for retirement is to set up a traditional pension scheme. \u201cThe most important thing to do is just to start. Even if it\u2019s \u00a320 or \u00a350 a month, the first step is often the hardest. You do lose access to your money whenever you want, but if you can set aside even small amounts, the government top-ups are effectively free money,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Self-employed people do not have the luxury of a company pensions department to sort things out, but they do qualify for the same tax relief \u2013 and it is very generous.</p> <p>If you are a basic-rate taxpayer, this means you will receive an extra \u00a325 for every \u00a3100 you pay in. For higher-rate taxpayers, you can claim back a further \u00a325 for every \u00a3100 you pay in, when you come to do your tax return. Different rules apply in Scotland. The maximum you can invest in one year is \u00a340,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"247bee3be78d14c510e685247c70fe1f29b7f451\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/247bee3be78d14c510e685247c70fe1f29b7f451/0_46_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nest workplace pensions booklet and documents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Government-backed pension Nest has some of the lowest charges in the industry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avpics/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You have three choices. Firstly, an ordinary personal pension, which is offered by most providers and managed by large investment companies. Secondly, a self-invested personal pension [SIPP] that you manage and can select the investment options for, whether stocks and shares or a trust.</p> <p>Thirdly, there is the government-backed pension Nest, which has some of the lowest charges in the industry and accepts contributions from \u00a310. It is simple to sign up and there are a range of funds based around your age when you join. For many self-employed people who want something simple and cheap, this is likely to be the best option.</p> <p>What about Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs)? Their big advantage is that you can access the money any time and you do not have to wait until 55 years old, as with pension schemes. The drawback is that you do not receive tax relief when you put your money in. If you are under 40, consider the Lifetime ISA (LISA), which you can either use to buy your first home or to save for retirement.</p> <p>A lot of small technology companies are launching apps and websites they claim make it much easier for the self-employed to open a pension. <a href=\"https://www.pensionbee.com/\" title=\"\">PensionBee</a> helps savers consolidate their old pensions into one new plan. \u201cCustomers can then manage their pension like they manage their bank account \u2013 accessing their balance and making contributions 24/7 via our web or mobile apps,\u201d says the PensionBee chief executive, Romi Savova.</p> <p>Digital-only <a href=\"https://getpenfold.com/\" title=\"\">Penfold</a> aims to take the stress out of setting up a pension. \u201cIt takes less than five minutes to set up a pension online \u2013 and there\u2019s minimum jargon,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Note that these providers tend to charge slightly more than the Nest pension scheme. Also look out for the launch of <a href=\"https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/what-we-offer/personal-pension/personal-pension-account?cmpgn=PS1219UKPASIP0001&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAmNbwBRBOEiwAqcwwpRjnNnafaVUxHzid9ZT1NyuMS3VnFtOadd7RnpRbfv_P4fe8sZ_c1BoCv8IQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" title=\"\">Vanguard\u2019</a>s pension scheme, due early this year. Vanguard, a giant in the investment market with more than 30 million customers, says charges will be as low as 0.15% a year for its SIPP.</p> <p>But all the above pension plans involve the money going into the stock market, with the hope profits and dividends will pay out in the future. But lots of people do not trust the market, or financial advisers, and would prefer to stick their cash into what they know best \u2013 property. But while this was probably the right thing to do financially 10 or 20 years ago, it is a lot more risky today. House prices are already at very elevated levels, and the new tax regime on buy to let makes it far less lucrative.</p> <p>So what are self-employed people doing? We spoke to a selection around the country about their plans for the future.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m starting with just \u00a310 a month but plan to increase that to \u00a3200\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb1658b3141cc0e24cbd31acc5967a3dd8435591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb1658b3141cc0e24cbd31acc5967a3dd8435591/0_330_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Euan Gray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Euan Gray had been planning to simply sell his house and get a smaller one.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Euan Gray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Euan Gray, 41, a self-employed roofer from Basingstoke, organised his first pension through Penfold three months ago after being questioned by friends when he was on holiday. \u201cMy friends just asked me what I was doing about my pension.

      "bodyText": "Mention the word pension to a self-employed person and there is a high chance you will put the fear of God into them. According to a survey of 2,000 people by National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), the government-backed pensions provider, only 24% of self-employed people are actively saving into a pension. Given the rollercoaster nature of working for yourself \u2013 limited company owners and sole traders\u2019 incomes can widely fluctuate from one month to the next \u2013 the thought of regularly stashing away money into a pot that can only be tapped into decades down the line does not sound very appealing. However, with 5 million self-employed workers in the UK, experts warn members of this group are likely to face financial crisis when they retire, if indeed they ever do. The new flat-rate state pension is currently \u00a3168.60 per week, or \u00a38,767 a year, and then only if you have made full national insurance contributions. So unless people expect to work until they die, most self-employed workers will need some additional kind of financial safety net to see them through retirement and older age. Unlike employees whose companies are legally obliged to sign them up to the government\u2019s auto-enrolment scheme, it is left to self-employed people to sort out their own provisions for the future. John Greer from the financial services company Quilter says: \u201cVery often, the self-employed catch up with long-term savings once they have an established income and businesses, which is logical and natural behaviour. \u201cIt\u2019s a different mindset to those with an employer who have a static income and a lot of responsibility like sickness benefits, and income protection is given to the employer.\u201d Greer recommends planning some level of financial contingency for the future. \u201cGenerally, the rule of thumb is whatever age you are, save half of it. For example, if you\u2019re 20, start putting 10% [of your income] aside; if you start later at 40 years old then save 20%.\u201d Holly Mackay, the founder and chief executive of Boring Money, believes the best way to start saving for retirement is to set up a traditional pension scheme. \u201cThe most important thing to do is just to start. Even if it\u2019s \u00a320 or \u00a350 a month, the first step is often the hardest. You do lose access to your money whenever you want, but if you can set aside even small amounts, the government top-ups are effectively free money,\u201d she says. Self-employed people do not have the luxury of a company pensions department to sort things out, but they do qualify for the same tax relief \u2013 and it is very generous. If you are a basic-rate taxpayer, this means you will receive an extra \u00a325 for every \u00a3100 you pay in. For higher-rate taxpayers, you can claim back a further \u00a325 for every \u00a3100 you pay in, when you come to do your tax return. Different rules apply in Scotland. The maximum you can invest in one year is \u00a340,000. You have three choices. Firstly, an ordinary personal pension, which is offered by most providers and managed by large investment companies. Secondly, a self-invested personal pension [SIPP] that you manage and can select the investment options for, whether stocks and shares or a trust. Thirdly, there is the government-backed pension Nest, which has some of the lowest charges in the industry and accepts contributions from \u00a310. It is simple to sign up and there are a range of funds based around your age when you join. For many self-employed people who want something simple and cheap, this is likely to be the best option. What about Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs)? Their big advantage is that you can access the money any time and you do not have to wait until 55 years old, as with pension schemes. The drawback is that you do not receive tax relief when you put your money in. If you are under 40, consider the Lifetime ISA (LISA), which you can either use to buy your first home or to save for retirement. A lot of small technology companies are launching apps and websites they claim make it much easier for the self-employed to open a pension. PensionBee helps savers consolidate their old pensions into one new plan. \u201cCustomers can then manage their pension like they manage their bank account \u2013 accessing their balance and making contributions 24/7 via our web or mobile apps,\u201d says the PensionBee chief executive, Romi Savova. Digital-only Penfold aims to take the stress out of setting up a pension. \u201cIt takes less than five minutes to set up a pension online \u2013 and there\u2019s minimum jargon,\u201d it says. Note that these providers tend to charge slightly more than the Nest pension scheme. Also look out for the launch of Vanguard\u2019s pension scheme, due early this year. Vanguard, a giant in the investment market with more than 30 million customers, says charges will be as low as 0.15% a year for its SIPP. But all the above pension plans involve the money going into the stock market, with the hope profits and dividends will pay out in the future. But lots of people do not trust the market, or financial advisers, and would prefer to stick their cash into what they know best \u2013 property. But while this was probably the right thing to do financially 10 or 20 years ago, it is a lot more risky today. House prices are already at very elevated levels, and the new tax regime on buy to let makes it far less lucrative. So what are self-employed people doing? We spoke to a selection around the country about their plans for the future. \u2018I\u2019m starting with just \u00a310 a month but plan to increase that to \u00a3200\u2019 Euan Gray, 41, a self-employed roofer from Basingstoke, organised his first pension through Penfold three months ago after being questioned by friends when he was on holiday. \u201cMy friends just asked me what I was doing about my pension. I said \u2018nothing\u2019. I thought I could sell my house and get a smaller one. They said I should have something in place.\u201d Gray says the \u00a310 minimum contribution levels appealed to him. \u201cBeing self-employed, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m getting and when.\u201d Gray is investing \u00a310 a month. \u201cI just wanted to get the ball rolling, it\u2019s not going to return anything as it is, but when I have a good month, I\u2019ll increase it to \u00a3100 to \u00a3200.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m doing buy to let as my pension\u2019 Romany Romany, 50, a magician who owns two properties in Brighton and Bournemouth, the latter of which she rents out, views property as her retirement trick. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in pensions because you only get it when you\u2019re older \u2026 I feel more in control of a property where I can actually receive rent, and while property is going up, I also get an income [when I sell]. If I couldn\u2019t physically work anymore, that would be my emergency fund. And with a pension, I couldn\u2019t [access that]. It\u2019s good to have. I feel secure.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m just going to invest in my business and not put money into a pension\u2019 Jennifer Bailey, 41, the founder of Calla, a footwear brand for women with bunions, sees her company as her pension. \u201cAlthough I only launched my business three years ago, my plan is that one day I will sell it and use that money to live off. With pensions, you don\u2019t get the same return as property or selling a business. If you have the skill set or can do something like invest in property or a business, I\u2019d sooner do that.\u201d Bailey says a property she bought before she met her partner will also go towards her pot. \u2018I can\u2019t afford a pension. I\u2019ll probably have to work for the rest of my life\u2019 Claire de Lune, 29, a ceramic artist and graphic designer in Margate, says she does not have the money to pay into a pension as she needs the funds for living, contingency and running her business. \u201cI save where I can, but there\u2019s always something that needs [to be] fixed, or replaced, or I save up so I can take a few days off,\u201d says De Lune. She says that with her current projected state pension estimated at \u00a38,000 per year, which she says will not cover rent, \u201cI will be working for the rest of my life, and most likely be living in a van when I\u2019m 85. \u201cI love my work and plan to make art for the rest of my life, but our current system basically ensures that my generation will all be homeless in \u2018retirement\u2019, unless we could purchase a home in our 20s.\u201d She believes there needs to be a fundamental shift in the system. \u201cIf we had long-term rental solutions like in Europe, where we have rights as tenants, and can feel settled and in control of our property, then our attitude towards the future would be different \u2013 perhaps then a pension wouldn\u2019t feel like a joke.\u201d",

Kyrgios looking bewildered as he fails to connect with a volley drilled at him at the net.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1983a78f085eda5c1160c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T08:16:25.850Z\">8.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>First set: Kyrgios 0-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): </strong>Bautista Agut has started superbly. Nothing flash, no highlight reel winners, just efficiently putting the ball back across the net time and time again, making Kyrgios hit shot after shot and inevitably drawing the error. 40-0 arrives without the Spaniard breaking sweat, at which point Kyrgios begins muttering out loud. An ace seals the deal at 40-15. Kyrgios, and Hewitt, have some thinking to do. They need to figure out how to shorten the points and unsettle Bautista Agut\u2019s rhythm. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1982d28f087e8308e6c691\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T08:12:53.214Z\">8.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>First set: Kyrgios* 0-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): </strong>Kyrgios eases to 30-0 with some forehands that he hits with such rotation from the hips he practically corkscrews himself into the court. Consecutive errors at the net bring RBA back to 30-30, the second of which the product of a miraculous backhand return. Another long rally earns Spain a break point - and Bautista Agut takes it! What a shock! Kyrgios, who has barely lost serve all tournament, is behind the eight ball already. Silence in Sydney. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e197ffd8f087e8308e6c68b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T08:09:03.713Z\">8.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>First set: Kyrgios 0-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): </strong>A gentle opening point leads to the barest ripple of applause for Spain but the volume goes up a factor of decibels when Kyrgios finishes a long rally to make it 15-15. 30-30 offers a sniff to Kyrgios but the second prolonged backhand-to-backhand exchange of the game ends with the Australian finding the net. Bautista Agut isn\u2019t given an easy hold though when Kyrgios ups his pace to force a deuce-inducing error.</p> \n  <p>Another long rally, this time much more expansive, again ends with Kyrgios planing a backhand into the net. This looks to be the tone of RBA\u2019s service games, methodical, conservative baseline hitting. It\u2019s a risk-reward because if he does that too long there\u2019s every chance Kyrgios will try something audacious - and succeed - as he does with a whipcrack crosscourt forehand from the corner - or fail - as he does with a backhand down the line that leaks wide. Bautista Agut then does hold, after an age.</p> \n  <p>An atmosphere not felt in Australia since the Sydney Olympics, says Todd Woodbridge courtside. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1980f58f087e8308e6c68d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T08:02:04.673Z\">8.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here we go, Bautista Agut to serve...</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e19633e8f085eda5c116066\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T08:00:55.923Z\">8.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While Kyrgios is inevitably the player to catch the eye, his opponent boasts a higher ranking, a longer streak of good form and the kind of hard working all-round game tailor made for team tennis. </p> \n  <p>Roberto Bautista Agut has been ranked inside the top 30 since 2014, winning titles in five of the past six seasons.

The opening singles contest pits <strong>Nick Kyrgios against Roberto Bautista Agut</strong>.

The doubles line-ups are subject to change, so we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it. </p> \n  <p>The line-ups are mouth-watering, but the pairings have robbed us of the box office bonanza that Kyrgios v Nadal would have generated.

Australia\u2019s last gasp victory over GB ignited the tournament and reinforced the value of team tennis to the Australian sporting psyche. Spain also relied on a doubles tiebreak to progress, downing Belgium after Rafael Nadal was upset by David Goffin. </p> \n  <p>Whoever wins tonight already knows they face Novak Djokovic\u2019s Serbia in Sunday\u2019s decider. </p> \n  <p>If you would like to join in the conversation, please send your emails to <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a> or tweets to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">@JPHowcroft</a>.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74b4b747af8af7594d0527d4e4cc87cfd08dae5a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74b4b747af8af7594d0527d4e4cc87cfd08dae5a/0_0_2540_1813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Nadal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Nadal will lead Spain against Australia in the semi-finals of the ATP Cup.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ciro de Luca/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T05:21:25.483Z\">at 5.21am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

Focus now shifts to Sunday\u2019s final between the two powerhouses Spain and Serbia. Until next time. It\u2019s been a decent showing from Australia though, not just tonight, but throughout this tournament. Disappointment today after those defeats for Kyrgios and de Minaur, but nevertheless a successful campaign. Here\u2019s Rafa: \u201cI have been playing at very high level. For me, energy levels have been a bit low. Yesterday was heavy conditions.\u201d To the crowd: \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure playing in front of you guys. This is a country which has a big respect for the sport, so a big thank you.\u201d On tomorrow\u2019s final against Serbia and his old foe Novak Djokovic: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough battle.\u201d So, Nadal steps up when needed and Spain will contest the inaugural ATP Cup final against Serbia, leaving the home crowd in Sydney disappointed. A terrific final set from the world No 1, who buckled down as de Minaur tired. Third set: de Minaur 6-4, 5-7, 1-6 Nadal* (*denotes server): De Minaur bamboozles Nadal with a couple of half-volley forehands to open, but he has a lapse in concentration following a lengthy second point and sends a ball out. Nadal wobbles before steadying the Spanish ship and at 30-30, after de Minaur finds the net again, he has match point. De Minaur is long on his return of serve and Spain are through! Third set: de Minaur* 6-4, 5-7, 1-5 Nadal (*denotes server): Nadal\u2019s power is there for all to see \u2013 forehand, backhand, both are put to devastating use this game. In between de Minaur takes inspiration from the Spaniard\u2019s ending to the last game and double faults. Lletyon Hewitt looks pensive on the sidelines. Rightly so, as Nadal breaks again, and he will now serve for the match. Third set: de Minaur 6-4, 5-7, 1-4 Nadal* (*denotes server): De Minaur\u2019s not willing to lie down just yet! He moves to 30-0 up on Nadal\u2019s serve, albeit thanks to a net cord on the second point, for which he holds up his hands up in what Jim Courier earlier, and correctly, called a \u201cfauxpology\u201d. Nadal shows typical fight to pull level at 30-30 but an error then gifts Australia a potentially crucial break point! And would you believe it? Nadal double faults to open the door to de Minaur! Third set: de Minaur* 6-4, 5-7, 0-4 Nadal (*denotes server): For a moment De Minaur looks tense in his shotmaking. He finds the net with what should be a regulation backhand to kick off this fourth game, then his radar is off again to hand Nadal a 30-0 lead. Much better from the Australian to pull a point back as he advances to the net and puts the ball away on the next point, but another unforced error then follows. He saves the first break point with an ace but can\u2019t topple Nadal in what is possibly the best point of the night, an attempted drop shot ultimately falling into the net after a thrilling 19-shot rally! Classic Nadal! Spain move to within two games of the match, and the tie. Third set: de Minaur 6-4, 5-7, 0-3 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal is hitting the ball beautifully now; everything is coming right out of the middle of his racket. He races into a 40-0 lead, with De Minaur unable to find a response, before wrapping things up when the Australian goes wide. A three-game advantage to Spain now, and de Minaur will need something really quite special now if he is to get back into this set. Third set: de Minaur* 6-4, 5-7, 0-2 Nadal (*denotes server): Oof, Nadal creams a crosscourt backhand winner back past the advancing de Minaur on the first point. The Australian challenges a call on the next point, alas to no avail, and then hits the net on the next. De Minaur finds himself in a hole at 0-40 down. And that hole gobbles him up when he is way long on the first of Nadal\u2019s break points. \u201cTeam Spain\u201d are in the ascendency here. Third set: de Minaur 6-4, 5-7, 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): Thanks Jonathan, superb shift. What a time to take over the blog. Nadal kicks off the third set with the ball in hand, knowing the momentum is with him and Spain at this point in time. Can he capitalise? Some big serving from the Spaniard sees him secure the first game. A big game for de Minaur coming up now... Second set: de Minaur* 6-4 5-7 Nadal (*denotes server): Nadal has a glimmer at 0-15 but returns wildly to allow de Minaur control. It\u2019s ceded again by the Australia with an error, but Nadal keeps the gifts moving like a game of pass the parcel. The rally at 30-30 begins conservative but grows in intensity and significance every shot, Nadal grinding his way into the ascendancy, eventually forcing an error. Nadal\u2019s first break point of the night is a set point! And he gets it! A rally full of shanks and mishits somehow ends the Spaniard\u2019s way. He\u2019s had to scrap for his life to just to remain alive in this match, and he\u2019s taken it to a third set. What a fighter. Can de Minaur continue to back himself? Find out with Mike Hytner. Second set: de Minaur 6-4 5-6 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal eases to 30-0 but a double fault provokes that edgy reaction from a crowd on the edge of its seat, the stifled applause trying not to be disrespectful to an error but simultaneously egg on their man. There\u2019s no holding back a few shots later when de Minaur wrestles control of a brutal rally before a net cord drops his way for 30-30. Could this finally be the decisive moment? Not yet; Nadal rips a rare backhand power drive crosscourt, a shot he\u2019s failed to execute so often tonight. But then he goes wide on the forehand for deuce. \u201cKeep backing yourself mate!\u201d bellows Hewitt from the corner with hands cupped to his mouth. His charge does, but he returns long at deuce then overshoots the proceeding rally to lose his grip on the possible break. Second set: de Minaur* 6-4 5-5 Nadal (*denotes server): There\u2019s just the merest hint of de Minaur dropping his intensity out there, but it hardly matters because Nadal is so off his game. Three errors give Australia breathing room and a fourth has both men reaching for the towels. Can the veteran dig himself out of this hole? Second set: de Minaur 6-4 4-5 Nadal* (*denotes server): Both men have gone largely untroubled on serve this set, and Nadal again holds to love. He\u2019s battling, but he\u2019s clinging on. Now de Minaur has to serve to stay in the set. Second set: de Minaur* 6-4 4-4 Nadal (*denotes server): De Minaur isn\u2019t just staying with Nadal when rallies form, he\u2019s dictating terms, playing with such intensity he invites the error. 15-0 is hard work, 30-0 swifter, then 40-0 arrives after a superb rally in which Nadal looked the only possible victor but de Minaur is in some dreamlike state, reaching the net to hammer a winner to the delight of the crowd past a stunned Nadal. Another easy hold. Second set: de Minaur 6-4 3-4 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal has first use of the new balls and he races to 40-0. Jim Courier on TV comments how noticeable the impact of the new Dunlop balls have been this week, compared to regular events. De Minaur steals a point but Nadal closes out the game in quick time. Second set: de Minaur* 6-4 3-3 Nadal (*denotes server): Australia hold swiftly in a game that again allows de Minaur to find a winner that would ordinarily be a match highlight, but his line drive wrong-footing Nadal was simply just another regular point in this performance of career-defining quality. Second set: de Minaur 6-4 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes server): Another backhand error from Nadal levels the scores at 15-all, then the first double fault of the match opens the door for de Minaur. He can\u2019t force his way through though as Nadal finds his range off the tee to move to 40-30, then survives a testing rally that de Minaur throws the kitchen sink at. Still on serve in this second set but de Minaur remains neck deep in Plan A, which is attack, followed by attack, with the occasional attack thrown in for variety. No sign of fatigue, stage-fright, or second guessing himself. Second set: de Minaur* 6-4 2-2 Nadal (*denotes server): De Minaur races to 40-0 but Nadal digs in and shows his rival he\u2019s still got enough pep in his forehand when he wants to to claw a point back. Not that it matters, another rally ends with a comet streaking from the Australian\u2019s backhand across the court and away for the winner. Second set: de Minaur 6-4 1-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal grinds out a hold to 15. He looks like a heavyweight rinsed after a long session on the heavy bag while the whipper snapper on the other side of the net is happily jumping rope ready for the next bell. Second set: de Minaur* 6-4 1-1 Nadal (*denotes server): Just once in my life I would love to feel what de Minaur is experiencing right now. He is in pure flow. The Australian is anticipating every shot from Nadal and returning it with interest. His racquet is the extension of his arm which is channeling a tsunami of adrenaline. The Spain bench is in disbelief. Winner after winner after breathtaking winner. De Minaur holds to love with some astonishing tennis. You can hear the shrieks of awe in the crowd. It is Nadal against vintage Nadal in mirror image. What a performance. Second set: de Minaur 6-4 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): The psychology on display is fascinating. Nadal is inscrutable, as usual, but something is not quite right, be it fatigue, injury or technique. De Minaur has the stare of a man who went to a rave in a field in Hampshire in 1989 and is having the time of his ruddy life. The scoreboard reads 40-30 but the narrative is all about those two de Minaur points, brimful of purpose, the latter finished with a skimming backhand slice of extravagant bravery, the product of him climbing into a Nadal second serve once again miles inside the baseline. All that said, Nadal clings on to hold. Between sets, here\u2019s a chance to catch up on that news from earlier than Bianca Andreescu will not feature at the Australian Open. First set: de Minaur* 6-4 Nadal (*denotes server): Nadal is now noticeably running long arcs to convert backhands into forehands but in doing so he sends one into the net then another long. With each, belief grows in de Minaur, and he has the freedom of Sydney when he drills a forehand down the line as clean and heavy as a Jimmy Page riff. Three set points, but he only needs one. The demon is giving Nadal nightmares. Advantage Australia. First set: de Minaur 5-4 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal cruises to 40-0 - that\u2019s 15-points in a row on serve - but the run is broken by another shonky backhand. He should see the game out, but again on the backhand side, he can\u2019t put away a delicate volley at the net then an overhead, and suddenly the crowd is back involved at 40-30. De Minaur is now flying, pressuring Nadal from the baseline, forcing him so deep the camera angle has had to be widened to accommodate the depths Nadal is going to. From nowhere Nadal is serving at deuce, and he goes long with yet another backhand! The crowd is as loud as it has been all week, roaring its approval. De Minaur allows some air to escape, netting set point, and then Nadal steps on the afterburners with two big barely-returnable serves. De Minaur to serve for the set. First set: de Minaur* 5-3 Nadal (*denotes server): For the first time tonight de Minaur doesn\u2019t race away early in his service game. He has chances to win the opening two points but dumps sharp volleys into the net with winners at his mercy. He fights hard to earn 15-30 then 30-30, the latter point courtesy of what is an increasingly prominent problem Nadal is having on his backhand. It would be perverse to call it the yips, but for a man of his calibre it is alarming how off his timing is. Another backhand goes long for 40-30 and de Minaur now has a very clear plan of attack, working the weak backhand side before hammering safely into the open court for the hold. Questions for Nadal to answer, and technical ones, not just matchplay. First set: de Minaur 4-3 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal, now with sweat cascading off his nose like water down a log flume, skips through a second routine hold in a row. First set: de Minaur* 4-2 Nadal (*denotes server): \u201cLive by the sword, die by the sword,\u201d says Tim Henman on commentary about de Minaur\u2019s strategy. The Australian has been ferocious so far, going for every opening, and nailing most of them. He streaks to 40-0 without breaking sweat but Nadal reminds him of his class with a forehand that moves through the air like a Roberto Carlos free-kick and a backhand drilled past his opponent\u2019s toes. At 30-40 what feels like would could be a pivotal rally begins to unfold, players shifting one side then the other before de Minaur hits long. 40-0 to deuce - is this Nadal\u2019s opportunity? No. A backhand finds the net then de Minaur crunches a forehand winner for a gritty hold. First set: de Minaur 3-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): Routine hold for the king of Roland Garros. First set: de Minaur* 3-1 Nadal (*denotes server): De Minaur is playing loose and nimbly, hitting fluidly on both wings with superb timing. And he is crushing the ball. 15, 30, 40-love all arrive with sumptuous strokes, massive forehands cross court, passes fizzing with topspin, and the crowd is raucous. Nadal doesn\u2019t lose hope though, despite the blitzkrieg coming his way and he stays alive to 40-30 until a de Minaur ace ices the game. First set: de Minaur 2-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): Woof! De Minaur climbs all over Nadal\u2019s second serve, smashing it with both feet off the ground miles inside the baseline, and he follows that up with a blistering inside-out forehand down the line to go up 0-30. Nadal responds with trademark intensity, winning four points in a row with steadily increasing force to get on the scoreboard. There was something ominous in watching the Spaniard go through the gears so quickly, like Concorde idling on the runway then busting through the speed of sound with power and grace. First set: de Minaur* 2-0 Nadal (*denotes server): Both men trade forehand winners down the line to show that this could be a high-quality duel, but Nadal then drops his guard again, struggling with his returns and hitting wide without facing pressure. De Minaur can\u2019t capitalise, dumping game point into the net. The Australian doesn\u2019t let it get to him, rattling a 151kph forehand winner then testing Nadal on both flanks until he provokes a mistake. The demon defends his early break. First set: de Minaur 1-0 Nadal* (*denotes server): It doesn\u2019t take long for the demon to state his intentions, crafting a point in the manner of David Goffin in his upset over Nadal, picking his time to attack, and attacking hard, turning two baseline rallies to his advantage and shifting 15-0 to 15-30. An early unforced error then hands Australia two break points! And a second unforced error gift-wraps it for them. What a start! Nadal broken in his opening game, de Minaur buzzing around the court like Billy Whizz, and the crowd on its feet. Nadal to serve, game on... Love the coin toss kid, rocking the Rambo look with the Osaka peace sign. Good areas. The players are out, warming up, and we\u2019ll be underway shortly in what could turn into the biggest night of de Minaur\u2019s career; or just another day at the office for Nadal. If the opening match was hard to call before it got underway, there\u2019s no doubting the second rubber looks lopsided on paper. World number one, 19-time grand slam champion, and recent Davis Cup Finals winner Rafael Nadal, against 20-year old world number 18 Alex de Minaur. They\u2019ve met twice before, Nadal winning both in straight sets, most recently at last year\u2019s Australian Open. Same, before I have a night on the tiles. No worries Australia, Alex de Minaur only has *checks notes* Rafael Nadal to beat to keep Australia afloat. The lazy narrative (that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll seen soon enough) would be all about Nick Kyrgios choking, smashing his racquet or failing to live up to the hype, but he was simply outplayed by a superb top-ten opponent whose discipline, patience, and defensive brilliance controlled the match as soon as it began. Vamos Roberto Bautista Agut. Second set: Kyrgios 1-6 4-6 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): A nervous hum shakes around Ken Rosewall Arena when RBA makes a rare unforced error to gift Kyrgios 0-15. The Spaniard is soon back on his own terms through, ascending to 30-15 with a superb forehand winner down the line. That becomes 40-15 following his latest demonstration of defensive excellence, meaning two match points. He only needs one. Roberto Bautista Agut wins in straight sets. Second set: Kyrgios* 1-6 4-5 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): For the umpteenth time tonight Kyrgios is 0-30 down on his normally dominant serve, that soon becomes 15-40 and Bautista Agut has two match points. Not for long, Kyrgios kabooms consecutive aces to take the game to deuce. Make that a hat-trick! But RBA remains impassive and whips a forehand down the line with masses of side-spin that swings into the corner to return us to deuce. Another big serve gives Kyrgios another game point but this time he slaps a forehand into the gutter with the game begging. He makes no mistake at the third time of asking, but Bautista Agut still has the match on his racquet. Second set: Kyrgios 1-6 3-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): RBA eases to another game by applying his tried and trusted method of inviting Kyrgios to hit tennis balls across the net until one misses the court. Get this - Bautista Agut has made only 5 (five) unforced errors all match; two in the first set, three in this. Superb tennis from the Spaniard. Kyrgios now serving to stay in it. Meanwhile, US Open champion, and one of the pre-tournament favourites, Bianca Andreescu, has just pulled out of the Australian Open. Second set: Kyrgios* 1-6 3-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Kyrgios is again faced with 30-30 on his own serve after cruising through the tournament off his own racquet. A rasping ace - his eighth, to RBA\u2019s four - hands him game point, then a second obliterates any lingering tension. Second set: Kyrgios 1-6 2-4 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Racquet smashing has been a feature of this event and Kyrgios\u2019s latest indiscretion you have to put as much down to the infuriation he must be feeling playing an opponent so relentless - and calm with it. For a firebrand like Kyrgios it must seem so alien. The Australian starts the following game well, and he\u2019s deep into his work at 30-30, forcing RBA to run miles to keep in touch, but the Spaniard holds firm. Kyrgios does force deuce next point though but again wastes a golden opportunity, dumping a backhand volley into the net after attacking ferociously to force his man a half-step off his game. The same tactic pays dividends next time, earning a second deuce, and the crowd responds. For perhaps the second time tonight there\u2019s a glimmer of some form and energy coming from Kyrgios, and he converts it into an advantage after an unusually unrythmical rally. But he can\u2019t convert, despite diving full length (and taking some skin off his elbow) to reach a drop shot. Now the longest game of the match, Bautista Agut is under rare pressure, but he releases it all with a serve right down the centre line, then orchestrating a trademark rally until Kyrgios falters. Massive, massive hold for Spain. Second set: Kyrgios* 1-6 2-3 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Nobody could possibly read Kyrgios\u2019s serve better than Bautista Agut is doing tonight. He\u2019s all over the Australian again to put the pressure on at 0-30 but Kyrgios puts his foot on the gas to get back level, but he clips one of his flicked skidding forehands wide with the court begging to concede a breakpoint - and RBA accepts it! Kyrgios thought he had deuce but his almost-ace was called a let, forcing another serve which Bautista Agut returned, naturally, and by the end of a skittish rally Kyrgios was demolishing his racquet by the back of the court. Advantage Spain. Second set: Kyrgios 1-6 2-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bosh! Finally Kyrgios wins one of those long rallies to even things up at 15-15, but boy did he have to work hard to win the point. A couple of deep backhand slices - a la Barty - and a couple of rasping forehands engineer some space and the Australian makes no mistake putting the finish away. Another rally follows and Kyrgios again goes to the backhand slice, and this time RBA goes long. Is a change of momentum brewing? Not decisively. Kyrgios fought hard to earn deuce, but once there Bautista Agut closed the door. Second set: Kyrgios* 1-6 2-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): 0-30 on the Kyrgios serve results in a despondent Canberran holding out his hands as if to say \u201cwhat can I do?\u201d. What he can do is continue to serve like a man with a rocket launcher on his shoulder and smash monster forehands from the baseline until RBA fails to deal with one. Four points in a row has the crowd on its feet and Lleyton Hewitt giving his charge the eyes - that\u2019s right, those eyes - and telling him to get his head up. We might have a match on our hands after all. Second set: Kyrgios 1-6 1-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut is driving Kyrgios to distraction. When the Australian goes for the corners, the Spaniard is there, when there\u2019s a rally RBA is patient, when there\u2019s an opening he hits it with surgical precision. Kyrgios is throwing everything at him but Spain win the game to love. Second set: Kyrgios* 1-6 1-0 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): This is a game loaded with significance. Kyrgios has to start the second set strongly on his own serve - and he does - doubling his match total of aces on his way to 40-15 then finding a very handy second serve that Bautista Agut sends long to take the upper hand in the set. Bautista Agut is playing at the top of his game, Kyrgios well under, and this is one-way traffic. First set: Kyrgios 1-6 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Spain take the opening set in just 30 minutes, Bautista Agut sealing the deal with the most straightforward service game of the night so far. Can Kyrgios respond? First set: Kyrgios* 1-5 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Finally a couple of quick cheap points on the Kyrgios serve to get the crowd involved. Is Bautista Agut fazed? Of course not. He\u2019s immediately back in his zone, imitating a massive brick wall that just returns whatever is smashed at it. 30-30 arrives eventually, aided by a brilliant RBA drop, but Kyrgios kicks away with just his second ace of the night and finally, to the delight of Ken Rosewall Arena, he finishes off the game after punishing the ball deep into Bautsita Agut\u2019s forehand corner often enough for the Spaniard to relent. First set: Kyrgios 0-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Kyrgios needs to find a spark from somewhere, but he slips to 0-30 without so much as a rally and 0-40 when he dumps his latest backhand into the net after his monster forehands failed to pierce RBA\u2019s armour. Kyrgios is hitting harder and harder, practically hitting the sponsor\u2019s logo from the ball, but Bautista Agut is unmoved, calmly returning the ball away from his territory like a series of instructional videos. Kyrgios does whistle one winner past to earn 15-40 but the game is over soon after. Hats off to RBA, this is pristine tennis, neutralising his big hitting opponent. First set: Kyrgios* 0-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): This is not looking good for Australia. Kyrgios slips to 0-30 after first trying to over-egg a winner before the wall that is RBA returned enough shots destined for cheers that Kyrgios lost his flow. A superb winner down the line gives Spain two break points at 15-40 but the Australian finally finds his range with his serves to claw back to deuce. Again, a desperate, lunged return from RBA forces Kyrgios into hitting a winner, and once again he misses, trying to find the extra inch he requires to beat the defensive masterclass. And from the third break point Bautista Agut makes it count! Kyrgios looking bewildered as he fails to connect with a volley drilled at him at the net. First set: Kyrgios 0-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut has started superbly. Nothing flash, no highlight reel winners, just efficiently putting the ball back across the net time and time again, making Kyrgios hit shot after shot and inevitably drawing the error. 40-0 arrives without the Spaniard breaking sweat, at which point Kyrgios begins muttering out loud. An ace seals the deal at 40-15. Kyrgios, and Hewitt, have some thinking to do. They need to figure out how to shorten the points and unsettle Bautista Agut\u2019s rhythm. First set: Kyrgios* 0-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Kyrgios eases to 30-0 with some forehands that he hits with such rotation from the hips he practically corkscrews himself into the court. Consecutive errors at the net bring RBA back to 30-30, the second of which the product of a miraculous backhand return. Another long rally earns Spain a break point - and Bautista Agut takes it! What a shock! Kyrgios, who has barely lost serve all tournament, is behind the eight ball already. Silence in Sydney. First set: Kyrgios 0-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): A gentle opening point leads to the barest ripple of applause for Spain but the volume goes up a factor of decibels when Kyrgios finishes a long rally to make it 15-15. 30-30 offers a sniff to Kyrgios but the second prolonged backhand-to-backhand exchange of the game ends with the Australian finding the net. Bautista Agut isn\u2019t given an easy hold though when Kyrgios ups his pace to force a deuce-inducing error. Another long rally, this time much more expansive, again ends with Kyrgios planing a backhand into the net. This looks to be the tone of RBA\u2019s service games, methodical, conservative baseline hitting. It\u2019s a risk-reward because if he does that too long there\u2019s every chance Kyrgios will try something audacious - and succeed - as he does with a whipcrack crosscourt forehand from the corner - or fail - as he does with a backhand down the line that leaks wide. Bautista Agut then does hold, after an age. An atmosphere not felt in Australia since the Sydney Olympics, says Todd Woodbridge courtside. Here we go, Bautista Agut to serve... While Kyrgios is inevitably the player to catch the eye, his opponent boasts a higher ranking, a longer streak of good form and the kind of hard working all-round game tailor made for team tennis. Roberto Bautista Agut has been ranked inside the top 30 since 2014, winning titles in five of the past six seasons. A career breakthrough arrived last year when he reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon, earning points that vaulted him from the fringes of the top 20 to the verge of the top ten. He eventually crossed that threshold a few weeks later, capping a consistent campaign by helping Spain secure the inaugural Davis Cup Finals in Madrid. Head-to-head: Kyrgios and Bautista Agut have only met once before on the ATP Tour with the Australian coming out on top. However, it was five years ago, so it\u2019s hard to read too much into it. Where will the opening rubber be won and lost? If Kyrgios brings his A game on serve he\u2019s a handful for anybody, and he has brought his A game to the ATP Cup so far in his three unbeaten singles matches, dropping serve only twice and leading the tournament for aces (57). The ATP has published some more scary numbers, including 62 per cent (103/65) of Kyrgios\u2019s first serves going unreturned, with that figure standing at 37 per cent (21/57) for second serves, miles ahead of his nearest rivals. Despite an official ranking of 29, the 24-year-old is rated sixth by the ATP Tour for his ability to handle pressure situations (converting and saving break points, winning tiebreaks, and winning deciding sets). For comparison, numbers one and two on that list are Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Ken Rosewall Arena looks like it\u2019ll be full tonight, meaning the best part of 10,000 fans in attendance. Most of them cheering on Australia, you\u2019d expect. Before the anthems there\u2019s a touching presentation to Australian legend Tony Roche, recipient of the inaugural Tim Gullikson Career Coach Award, a gong created by the ATP Tour to recognise the influence of coaches in tennis. Not far away now. The teams are making their way out onto the court at Ken Rosewall Arena. This is not ATP Cup related, but another reminder that Madison Keys is a good egg. She\u2019s also very good at tennis, and will take on Naomi Osaka or Karolina Pliskova in tomorrow\u2019s Brisbane International final. The longer this delay drags on, the more likely I am to discuss Rafa\u2019s hair situation. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve felt strongly about for some time. Some questions, while we wait for the second semi to get underway: Have you enjoyed the ATP Cup? Has it felt like a men\u2019s World Cup of tennis? Is it a good lead in to the Australian Open? Is it better than the Hopman Cup / Brisbane &amp; Sydney Internationals? Answers to jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com or @JPHowcroft please. Conditions: After the stifling heat and humidity of earlier rounds conditions are clement under the canopy of Ken Rosewall Arena. The temperature will be in the low 20sC while the air quality - still far from ideal - is an improvement on recent days courtesy of a southerly breeze. The good news is the changeover from the opening semi to the second can now take place after Serbia completed a clean sweep over Russia with victory in the doubles. We\u2019re not going to hit a 6.30pm start, but we shouldn\u2019t be delayed by too long. Australia are flying high after their spectacular quarter-final victory over Great Britain. Nick Kyrgios stole the show, especially with his bear-hugging celebration on court with doubles partner Alex de Minaur. On the topic of scheduling, we\u2019re witnessing a potential snafu right now with the final rubber of the Serbia v Russia semi-final still occupying Ken Rosewall Arena. Serbia are already through after winning both singles rubbers but this dead doubles encounter is going to delay the start of the second semi. By how much, who knows? It\u2019s currently on serve early in the second set tiebreak with Serbia up one set. Nadal credited some of his poor form in the quarter-finals to the long journey east to Sydney from Perth. His lament will be familiar to fans of Australian team sports for whom the challenge is a seasonal occurrence. That\u2019s these three hours\u2019 time changing, different weather conditions, playing against a team that have been here for the last ten days, and we are the only team coming from Perth and playing until the last day of Perth and arriving here during the evening with jet lag, with everything. And today we had very heavy conditions out there, so probably we had the worst situation possible to play this tie.\u201d Hello everybody and welcome to live game-by-game coverage of the second ATP Cup semi-final between Australia and Spain from Ken Rosewall Arena in Sydney. Action gets underway at 6.30pm local time. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware by now these ties are a best of three affair with two singles rubbers followed by a doubles. The opening singles contest pits Nick Kyrgios against Roberto Bautista Agut. After that Alex de Minaur has the unenviable task of taking on world number one Rafael Nadal. The doubles line-ups are subject to change, so we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it. The line-ups are mouth-watering, but the pairings have robbed us of the box office bonanza that Kyrgios v Nadal would have generated. There is famously no love lost between the two. Both nations arrive in the semis after scraping through nail-biting quarter-finals. Australia\u2019s last gasp victory over GB ignited the tournament and reinforced the value of team tennis to the Australian sporting psyche. Spain also relied on a doubles tiebreak to progress, downing Belgium after Rafael Nadal was upset by David Goffin. Whoever wins tonight already knows they face Novak Djokovic\u2019s Serbia in Sunday\u2019s decider.

      "body": "<p>In a year not short on drama, it was one of the great moments of 2019. After the Queen agreed to prorogue parliament for five weeks at Boris Johnson\u2019s request, and after the English and Scottish courts could not agree whether the suspension was lawful, in September it was left to the supreme court to resolve the issue. And over the days of deliberation that followed, Brenda Hale came into her own. On 24 September, she announced the court\u2019s blistering judgment: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s advice to her majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect\u2026 The prorogation was also void and of no effect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/video/2019/sep/24/supreme-court-rules-prorogation-unlawful-void-and-of-no-effect-video\" title=\"\">Parliament has not been prorogued.</a>\u201d Her tone was emphatic, delivered in an austere black dress with a huge silver spider brooch crawling up her right shoulder. The ruling delivered the ultimate slap down for Johnson; there was even talk that the prime minister might have to resign. MPs returned to work the following day.</p> <p>For many outside the law, it was the first we had seen of Brenda Marjorie Hale, but already she had decades of experience as a glass-ceiling smasher. In 2004, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/biographies-of-the-justices.html\" title=\"\">she was made Britain\u2019s first female law lord</a>. In 2009, she became the first woman to serve on the UK\u2019s new supreme court; in 2017, she became its first woman president. Already dubbed \u201cthe Beyonc\u00e9 of the legal world\u201d, after the prorogation ruling Baroness Hale of Richmond became a household name \u2013 a septuagenarian rock star. There were calls for the spider brooch to be given its own Twitter account, and fans could buy spider-brooch T-shirts and an illustrated children\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/oct/10/supreme-court-lady-hale-becomes-star-childrens-book\" title=\"\">celebrating Hale\u2019s journey</a> from Yorkshire schoolgirl to head of the UK\u2019s highest court.</p> <p>Rarely has so much been projected on to one woman. Although the judgment was made unanimously by 11 justices, it was regarded by some as a personal intervention \u2013 an expression of Hale\u2019s liberal beliefs. And however many times she said that the brooch was just a randomly chosen piece of jewellery, it took on a larger metaphorical significance \u2013 a reference to the web Hale had spun to trap an unruly government. Of course, this was nonsense: as all the judges insisted, they were simply ruling on whether the suspension of parliament had been lawful or not.</p> <p>Now, four months later, it\u2019s all over. When Hale turns 75 on 31 January, she will have to retire \u2013 because that is the law. We meet at Middlesex Guildhall, home of the supreme court in Parliament Square, Westminster. It\u2019s a funny mix of old and new, fusty and modern. The library is grand, wood-panelled with stained-glass windows, hung with portraits of judges past. The toilets, meanwhile, are very much 21st century \u2013 unisex and fitted with sanitary bins. A procession of boisterous schoolchildren snakes through the entrance. The supreme court prides itself on its openness to the public.</p> <p>Hale\u2019s head of press, Janet Coull Trisic, briefs me before we start. She says Lady Hale would like me to mention a series of portraits by the British artist Catherine Yass (featuring female legal pioneers, Hale among them) that was recently unveiled here, <a href=\"http://www.contemporaryartsociety.org/consultancy/projects/supreme-court-united-kingdom-catherine-yass-commission/\" title=\"\">celebrating 100 years of women in the legal profession</a>. She says Lady Hale will not answer any questions she considers political or inappropriate. It all sounds terribly formal, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll warm up once we get going. After all, we have so much in common: we both come from the north, were state educated, and work in professions with more than their fair share of public school alumni.</p> <p>Hale is waiting for me in her office \u2013 diminutive, twinkle-eyed, razor-sharp. She wears a maroon dress, maroon shoes and sits in a maroon chair. The dress is offset by a silver brooch: another eight-legged creature, this time an octopus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got an ego. I try to keep it in check, and to be patient, but I\u2019m sometimes a bit quick with people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I compliment her on the unisex toilets and tell her I reckon a male president would have run a mile from such loos. She smiles. \u201cYep. Well, he might!\u201d But in a flash she turns fierce. \u201cDon\u2019t stereotype all male judges,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t make me complicit.\u201d She is quick to jump on anything she sees as an attempt to pigeonhole or put words into her mouth.</p> <p>Like the library, Hale is a funny mix of old and new, fusty and modern. She may be on the verge of retiring, but she makes it clear that she is not about to dispense with propriety. While US judges are political appointees, British judges are not allowed to make partisan pronouncements \u2013 as she reminds me at every opportune moment.</p> <p>Is she dismayed that she has to quit just as her career is reaching new heights? In the US, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, associate justice of the supreme court, is still going strong at 86. \u201cI actually think 75 is fine. Seventy I think is too young.\u201d But she\u2019s barely done two years in the job, and seems to be having the time of her life. \u201cYou\u2019re doing your best to goad me into it, but I don\u2019t feel that,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cI have been a full-time judge for 26 years. It\u2019s a long time, and it\u2019s time to leave it to the others to get on with the job.\u201d</p> <p>The supreme court is a tribunal of last resort, focusing on cases of the greatest public and constitutional importance. The 12 judges rule on points of law \u2013 ie whether the law has been applied correctly rather than whether the right verdict has been reached. Only a few minutes before our interview, the court handed down another significant judgment \u2013 and again the government was found wanting. Five supreme court judges, including Hale, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/27/thousands-of-asylum-seekers-may-be-due-damages-after-court-home-office-ruling\" title=\"\">ruled that</a> the Home Office falsely imprisoned asylum seekers, without having proper policies to determine whether an individual poses a risk of absconding.</p> <p>\u201cThe law is quite clear,\u201d Hale says. \u201cYou can only lock asylum seekers up if there is a risk of absconding, and you\u2019ve got clear guidelines on how you decide. And the government\u2019s guidance didn\u2019t even say that\u2019s the only basis on which you can lock them up. So you can imagine their poor case workers going through this guidance and not addressing their minds to the right question.\u201d</p> <p>Does Hale think Britain is becoming a crueller country? She looks at Coull Trisic, who sits between us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a legal question, is it?\u201d Coull Trisic says.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a legal question at all,\u201d Hale says. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s proper for me to answer it. I may have my personal opinion about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25c2b26deaf54511492cdb41fd72963b9a5c4c1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c2b26deaf54511492cdb41fd72963b9a5c4c1a/82_61_1691_1015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The supreme court rules prorogation \u2018unlawful\u2019 on 24 September 2019. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The supreme court rules prorogation \u2018unlawful\u2019 on 24 September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Can I ask your personal opinion on whether we\u2019ve become a crueller country?</p> <p>\u201cYou can ask me all sorts of things, as long as you accept that there are certain things that are not appropriate for me to talk about. I\u2019ve got to be very careful not to look as if I\u2019m making political comments.\u201d Silence. Hale is brilliant at saying just as much as she wants, and not a word more; she simply comes to a polished stop and waits.</p> <p>Is there a judgment she look backs on that she is most proud of, that she would take to a desert island? She beams. \u201cWell, it\u2019s funny you should put it that way, because I\u2019d probably have great fun working out my eight Desert Island Judgments. In fact that\u2019s a nice thought, and thank you for it.\u201d</p> <p>OK, let\u2019s hear them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d have to go away and think about eight.\u201d</p> <p>What about three?</p> <p>\u201cNumber one would probably be the prorogation case, where we said it was not within the power of the prime minister to suspend parliament for such a long time at such a critical moment. That\u2019s quite a source of, not pride, but satisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>Why does it mean so much to her? \u201cWell, it means a lot to the constitution.\u201d She refers me back to the 17th century and the constitutional settlement, making strong eye contact throughout. I can\u2019t help feeling she\u2019s testing me. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got a very clear understanding of the way the constitutional settlement worked out then, so we were acting in support of that.\u201d</p> <p>Hale moves on to the second of her three favourite judgments. <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0002-judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">In 2011, the </a><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0002-judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0002-judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">court ruled that a mother</a><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0002-judgment.pdf\" title=\"\"> who was due to be deported to Tanzania</a><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0002-judgment.pdf\" title=\"\"> should be allowed to stay: the interests of her children took priority</a>. \u201cThe government conceded that it would be a disproportionate interference with their rights to deport the mother. So that established taking account of the interests of children who were affected by all sorts of governmental decisions.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0060-judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">Her third choice is another 2011 judgment</a> which established that domestic violence does not have to be physical. \u201cWe said, no, it involves all kinds of domination and abuse. Psychological domination \u2013 what we now call coercive control. We didn\u2019t have that phrase then.\u201d Hale explains the impact of the judgment by referencing the fictional case of Rob and Helen Titchener in The Archers, which climaxed in her stabbing him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/09/coercive-reationship-helen-tichener-archers-domestic-abuse\" title=\"\">after years of coercive control</a>. As she does, I see what a wonderful teacher Hale must be. She relates the storyline with total recall and explains its significance with perfect clarity. \u201cThe Archers educated the public, because the public saw what that man was doing bit by bit: destroying that woman\u2019s personality by making her leave her job, cutting her off from her family, marrying her without anybody else being present, confiscating her mobile phone, stopping her driving, probably making her pregnant against her will. We could all see that. But of course, the family and neighbours couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cafa4e5f1e648fbb7ec1a4208456411b10515f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cafa4e5f1e648fbb7ec1a4208456411b10515f3/0_76_1731_1356/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Hale and fellow judges mark the start of the legal year in Westminster, London, October 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"783\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marking the start of the legal year with fellow judges in Westminster, October 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After this judgment, Hale was harangued by elements of the press who regarded the supreme court as intrusive and nannying. \u201cThank goodness Lady Hale has never set foot in our home, or I\u2019d be sleeping under Blackfriars Bridge tonight,\u201d wrote columnist Cristina Odone in the Telegraph. \u201cI am, you see, guilty of domestic violence: I shout at my husband on a regular basis.\u201d I mention Odone\u2019s comment. \u201cYes, but that\u2019s not what it was about,\u201d Hale says curtly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about shouting. It was about something more insidious than that.\u201d</p> <p>Women are at the heart of two out of three of your favourite judgments, I say. She nods. \u201cI think a sense of the position of many women, and the necessity of the law to understand that position, is an important part of my work.\u201d When she was appointed a law lord, Hale created a coat of arms for her new title bearing the motto Omnia Feminae Aequissimae, meaning \u201cwomen are equal to everything\u201d. But her feminism has been used against her by the right. In a particularly venomous attack in 1995, the Daily Mail accused Hale of having \u201cher fingerprints all over some of the most revolutionary draft bills\u201d the Law Commission had ever produced, and being \u201ca feminist of the kind who would like to see changes in the way society is organised\u201d.</p> <p>While it is true that Hale has always championed women\u2019s rights, it\u2019s less clear that she is the anti-establishment radical both her critics and fans describe. Her parents were both headteachers, and her father\u2019s best friend was the local vicar. She may cling to her beloved north Yorkshire roots, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the way she talks: path is \u201cparth\u201d, room is \u201crum\u201d. She frequently throws Latin expressions into casual conversation (\u201cMirabile dictu\u201d), and at times her language is so archaically correct that she might have stepped out of a Jane Austen novel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not sure I ever liked Brenda. There was a popular book in the 70s about a woman called Brenda and she was a bitch</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hale makes a point of the fact that, unlike most of her male peers, she did not attend public school; but she did go on to Cambridge University from grammar school. Two facts invariably quoted in the official biographies are that she graduated in 1966 with the only starred first in her year, and in 1969 passed her bar exam with the highest overall mark. At university, she was one of only six women studying law, in a year group of more than 100. Rather than being anti-establishment, she took the establishment men on at their own game and trounced them. I ask if she was always phenomenally clever. \u201cWell, that\u2019s for others to say,\u201d she replies.</p> <p>Never does she sound more establishment than when I ask her, at the beginning of our interview, what I should call her \u2013 Brenda or Lady Hale. I assume it\u2019s going to be Brenda. But Hale looks at Coull Trisic and says, \u201cWell, Lady Hale is the correct form of address.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I call her Lady Hale,\u201d Coull Trisic agrees.</p> <p>I swallow loudly, momentarily lost for words. I hadn\u2019t expected Hale would have a touch of the Ben Kingsleys (the actor insists on being called Sir Ben).</p> <p>\u201cSome people do call me Brenda,\u201d she adds. But it\u2019s clear that she does not want me to be one of them.</p> <p>\u201cMy PA, Ayo, who has been with me many years still calls me Dame Brenda,\u201d she says. She is not offended that Ayo is still an honour behind \u2013 she finds it amusing. \u201cOh,\u201d I say, and swallow loudly again.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Brenda Hale was born in Leeds and grew up in Richmond. She talks about the town with huge affection: the medieval castle, the cobbled market place, the close community. She and her two sisters were all head girls at the local girls\u2019 grammar school, and Hale says she owes much of her success to her parents, who brought their daughters up to believe they could achieve anything; gender was no barrier. They assumed their girls would go to university, preferably Oxford or Cambridge.</p> <p>Hale is often compared to Bader Ginsburg, and there are many obvious similarities: both are professors; both made their name in academic law; both serve on the supreme court; both were from non-legal families, triumphed over male hegemony in the judiciary and have rock star soubriquets (while Hale is Beyonc\u00e9, Ginsburg is known as the Notorious RBG). But there are also significant differences. In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYR414Q8v6A\" title=\"\">they gave a talk together in the US</a> and were asked what the professional responsibility of a lawyer was. After Ginsburg replied that a lawyer had to \u201cmake things a little better in your community, your nation and your world\u201d, Hale responded, \u201cI want to be more down to earth \u2013 the greatest challenge for the legal profession is to be honest, and it\u2019s the first duty.\u201d While Ginsburg is a self-proclaimed idealist, Hale prefers to see herself simply as a practitioner.</p> <p>In 1984, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/lady-hale-career-breaking-barriers-judiciary\" title=\"\">Hale became the first woman and the youngest person</a> appointed to the Law Commission, at the age of 39. It was here that she helped devise the Children Act 1989, which allocated duties to courts, local authorities and parents to ensure children are safeguarded. This is another reform she looks back on with satisfaction \u2013 and another that caused controversy. Columnist Melanie Phillips wrote in the Daily Mail that, as the \u201cprinciple architect\u201d of the Act, Hale had \u201chelped destroy the authority of adults and made it impossible for teachers, social workers or even parents physically to restrain children from mischief without the child reporting them to the police\u201d. But there was considerable support from elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f43af9fff00f68514e210954fc383975f239e6e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f43af9fff00f68514e210954fc383975f239e6e0/412_1048_6601_3960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Hale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After sitting for a month in Hong Kong\u2019s court of final appeal, Hale will formally retire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Spring/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1986, Hale was made professor of law at Manchester University, after two decades in academia. Most judges come direct from the bar; is it true that there is a snobbery about academia? \u201cYes.\u201d Even so, Hale says her background proved beneficial. \u201cThe advantage is that you have to think about the law in the round \u2013 the whole subject, not just the individual case. So it gives you a different perspective from the one you get just dealing with case, after case, after case.\u201d</p> <p>But now she is preparing to step down. After sitting for a month in Hong Kong\u2019s court of final appeal, she will formally retire, and spend more time indulging her passions \u2013 walking, gardening, opera, family (her daughter Julia lives on the same street in London, and she has three stepchildren). Does she think she is leaving the law in a better state than when she qualified? \u201cIn certain respects, yes. I think what I\u2019m happiest with is that people now take equality very seriously as a value in the law and in the way people are treated. Equality and non-discrimination. By equality, I mean treating people equally, I don\u2019t mean equality of outcome \u2013 that is a very different thing.\u201d</p> <p>It is odd to be sitting here talking about increased equality while under orders to use her title. \u201cLady Brenda Hale,\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t find all this Lady stuff very easy.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. I\u2019m still waiting for the punch on the arm and the \u201cGotcha!\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t come.</p> <p>\u201cI know. <em>I know.</em> That\u2019s why I\u2019m laughing.\u201d She seems to enjoy my discomfort.</p> <p>I tell her my mother is called Marjorie, Hale\u2019s middle name, and ask if she likes it. She says it was her mother\u2019s name, too, and she\u2019s happy enough with it. \u201cIt\u2019s the Brenda I don\u2019t really like.\u201d Why not? \u201cAh well, what\u2019s the book called? It was popular in the 1970s. A Handful Of Dust. This is all about a really decent aristocratic chap who marries a not-decent aristocratic woman called Brenda and she treats him very badly, is unfaithful to him, etc. But of course he does the decent thing and lets her divorce him because that\u2019s what they did, and she then takes him to the cleaners. So he takes a trip up the Amazon where he is captured by some barmy Englishman who makes him stay there and read Dickens novels to him.\u201d Again, there is this incredible recall of detail and ability to summarise on the spot. So she only started disliking her name then? \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure I ever liked it. Not particularly happy with it, but not unhappy. Then I read that book, and she was called Brenda and she was an absolute bitch.\u201d But despite her protestations, Brenda seems rather appropriate; it\u2019s the Queen\u2019s nickname, and there is something rather regal about Hale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"133265267c57506cfae2c43aa78491178bc59925\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/133265267c57506cfae2c43aa78491178bc59925/451_1461_6626_2372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits by Catherine Yass celebrate 100 years of women in the legal profession\" width=\"1000\" height=\"358\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits by Catherine Yass celebrate 100 years of women in the legal profession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugo Glendinning</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m staring at her octopus. What is it with the animal brooches? Simple, she says: they were a way of glamming up her drab work clothes. \u201cIt started off when I was in the family division wearing dark suits. My husband started giving me brooches to cheer them up a bit, to feminise them, and it just grew from there \u2013 a lot of frogs, a lot of creatures.\u201d</p> <p>In 1992, Hale married her second husband, Julian Farrand, former dean of the law faculty at Manchester university. Their wedding took place a few days after she and her first husband, Anthony Hoggett QC, Julia\u2019s father, were divorced. She refers to Farrand affectionately as her \u201cfrog prince\u201d. There are a number of Frog and Toad of Toad Hall figurines lined up on her desk, all tributes to Farrand. \u201cIt\u2019s his driving style,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s where all the Toad stuff started.\u201d Toad is known for his love of fast cars. </p> <p>Who are her heroes? Hale reels off a list of lawyers: former senior law lord Lord Bingham; family division judge Margaret Booth; Lord Atkin, widely credited with creating the law of negligence. And outside the law? \u201cOne would be Archbishop Desmond Tutu. He kept a certain spirit alive, which was hugely influential in how things worked out in the immediate aftermath [of Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison].\u201d</p> <p>What I also love about Tutu, I say, is that he knows his weakness \u2013 he\u2019s got a massive ego. I ask her if she has a big ego. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got an ego. I try to keep it in check.\u201d Does she succeed? \u201cOther people had better tell you the answer to that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae310fd30812d5d445ac776c902aa0d875eddd65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae310fd30812d5d445ac776c902aa0d875eddd65/71_333_4666_2799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Hale with husband Julian Farrand at Buckingham Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With husband Julian Farrand at Buckingham Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A couple of years ago, journalist Afua Hirsch (author of Equal To Everything, the children\u2019s book about Hale) <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/lady-justice-is-the-judiciary-ready-for-brenda-hale\" title=\"\">wrote a profile for Prospect magazine</a> in which an unnamed former colleague of Hale\u2019s said she found her \u201ca totally fascinating woman\u201d but \u201cdifficult to work with\u201d. The ex-colleague added: \u201cYou have to be obstreperous as a woman to get there, to break the glass ceiling \u2013 it\u2019s painful, it leaves you with cuts.\u201d</p> <p>Does Hale recognise that description? \u201cYes, probably. I try very hard to be patient, but I\u2019m sometimes a bit quick with people. I probably ask a lot of people. Certain people. But I also think certain people find women \u2018obstreperous\u2019 when they would not find the same behaviour from a man obstreperous. They\u2019d just call them determined or authoritative. It wouldn\u2019t be a criticism.\u201d</p> <p>Coull Trisic tells me we have 15 minutes left. I ask her whether she tells Hale when she\u2019s being quick with her. \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018We\u2019ll do it that way and we\u2019ll get it done.\u2019 She\u2019s my boss and I\u2019ll go, \u2018OK\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>I seem to have touched a tender spot. Hale is thinking aloud. \u201cWhat I\u2019m struggling with is, I think I am less bossy and assertive than most of the men I see around me.\u201d She is still doing battle with obstreperous. Firm is a fairer word, she decides.</p> <p>Over the decades, Hale has witnessed so much progress for women in the legal system, both as practitioners and in terms of their access to justice. Does she worry that some of these gains are now being reversed? In September last year, Crown Prosecution Service figures showed that the number of rape convictions were the lowest they had been in a decade, despite an increase in the number of reported incidents \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/12/prosecutions-in-england-and-wales-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade\" title=\"\">prosecutions were down by 3</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/12/prosecutions-in-england-and-wales-at-lowest-level-in-a-decade\" title=\"\">3% on the year and convictions fell by 26%</a>.</p> <p>Will she leave her job feeling \u2013 Hale interrupts before I can finish the sentence. \u201cJob done? No, no.\u201d Why not? \u201cI think the question of prosecuting sex offences generally is problematic for obvious reasons. How do you establish a case that is going to have a better than evens chance of getting a conviction? To what extent do you take into account the known facts about some of the prejudices that some juries have?\u201d</p> <p>There are other areas where she worries the law may not be doing enough to protect women. Digital technology, she says, has brought its own set of problems. \u201cWhat might not have been an issue 20 years ago is now a serious issue: trolling on social media. It\u2019s a problem for men, but it\u2019s a particular problem for women. So there may be things the law needs to do to catch up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13bbba80b7d0f386c3df736027df0cce1c9f89d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13bbba80b7d0f386c3df736027df0cce1c9f89d7/12_292_3138_1882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Hale shows Prince Charles around the supreme court.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Showing Prince Charles around the supreme court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the past five years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/12/the-guardian-view-on-legal-aid-cuts-have-caused-chaos-and-must-be-reversed\" title=\"\">the legal aid budget has shrunk</a> by more than \u00a31bn, while the justice bill in general has been slashed by 40%.

I think there has been a worrying period since 2012 [when funding cuts were introduced]. It is difficult to claw back what has been given up. I think massive efforts are going into trying to modernise the justice system. If they work, that will be a good thing, but whether they will is very much open to question.\u201d She pauses. \u201cIt would be great if a lot more prominence were given to the problems of the justice system than currently is, including by journalists.\u201d</p> <p>I tell her I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re living in a country <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deporting-families-of-foreign-offenders\" title=\"\">where we deport migrants</a> who have broken the law rather than simply letting them serve their prison sentence. What has happened to the concept of rehabilitation? \u201cWell, usually they deport them <em>after</em> they\u2019ve served their sentence,\u201d she says. Exactly: so it\u2019s a double punishment. \u201cI think I\u2019d better not comment on that.

      "bodyText": "In a year not short on drama, it was one of the great moments of 2019. After the Queen agreed to prorogue parliament for five weeks at Boris Johnson\u2019s request, and after the English and Scottish courts could not agree whether the suspension was lawful, in September it was left to the supreme court to resolve the issue. And over the days of deliberation that followed, Brenda Hale came into her own. On 24 September, she announced the court\u2019s blistering judgment: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s advice to her majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect\u2026 The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued.\u201d Her tone was emphatic, delivered in an austere black dress with a huge silver spider brooch crawling up her right shoulder. The ruling delivered the ultimate slap down for Johnson; there was even talk that the prime minister might have to resign. MPs returned to work the following day. For many outside the law, it was the first we had seen of Brenda Marjorie Hale, but already she had decades of experience as a glass-ceiling smasher. In 2004, she was made Britain\u2019s first female law lord. In 2009, she became the first woman to serve on the UK\u2019s new supreme court; in 2017, she became its first woman president. Already dubbed \u201cthe Beyonc\u00e9 of the legal world\u201d, after the prorogation ruling Baroness Hale of Richmond became a household name \u2013 a septuagenarian rock star. There were calls for the spider brooch to be given its own Twitter account, and fans could buy spider-brooch T-shirts and an illustrated children\u2019s book celebrating Hale\u2019s journey from Yorkshire schoolgirl to head of the UK\u2019s highest court. Rarely has so much been projected on to one woman. Although the judgment was made unanimously by 11 justices, it was regarded by some as a personal intervention \u2013 an expression of Hale\u2019s liberal beliefs. And however many times she said that the brooch was just a randomly chosen piece of jewellery, it took on a larger metaphorical significance \u2013 a reference to the web Hale had spun to trap an unruly government. Of course, this was nonsense: as all the judges insisted, they were simply ruling on whether the suspension of parliament had been lawful or not. Now, four months later, it\u2019s all over. When Hale turns 75 on 31 January, she will have to retire \u2013 because that is the law. We meet at Middlesex Guildhall, home of the supreme court in Parliament Square, Westminster. It\u2019s a funny mix of old and new, fusty and modern. The library is grand, wood-panelled with stained-glass windows, hung with portraits of judges past. The toilets, meanwhile, are very much 21st century \u2013 unisex and fitted with sanitary bins. A procession of boisterous schoolchildren snakes through the entrance. The supreme court prides itself on its openness to the public. Hale\u2019s head of press, Janet Coull Trisic, briefs me before we start. She says Lady Hale would like me to mention a series of portraits by the British artist Catherine Yass (featuring female legal pioneers, Hale among them) that was recently unveiled here, celebrating 100 years of women in the legal profession. She says Lady Hale will not answer any questions she considers political or inappropriate. It all sounds terribly formal, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll warm up once we get going. After all, we have so much in common: we both come from the north, were state educated, and work in professions with more than their fair share of public school alumni. Hale is waiting for me in her office \u2013 diminutive, twinkle-eyed, razor-sharp. She wears a maroon dress, maroon shoes and sits in a maroon chair. The dress is offset by a silver brooch: another eight-legged creature, this time an octopus. I compliment her on the unisex toilets and tell her I reckon a male president would have run a mile from such loos. She smiles. \u201cYep. Well, he might!\u201d But in a flash she turns fierce. \u201cDon\u2019t stereotype all male judges,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t make me complicit.\u201d She is quick to jump on anything she sees as an attempt to pigeonhole or put words into her mouth. Like the library, Hale is a funny mix of old and new, fusty and modern. She may be on the verge of retiring, but she makes it clear that she is not about to dispense with propriety. While US judges are political appointees, British judges are not allowed to make partisan pronouncements \u2013 as she reminds me at every opportune moment. Is she dismayed that she has to quit just as her career is reaching new heights? In the US, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, associate justice of the supreme court, is still going strong at 86. \u201cI actually think 75 is fine. Seventy I think is too young.\u201d But she\u2019s barely done two years in the job, and seems to be having the time of her life. \u201cYou\u2019re doing your best to goad me into it, but I don\u2019t feel that,\u201d she says, firmly. \u201cI have been a full-time judge for 26 years. It\u2019s a long time, and it\u2019s time to leave it to the others to get on with the job.\u201d The supreme court is a tribunal of last resort, focusing on cases of the greatest public and constitutional importance. The 12 judges rule on points of law \u2013 ie whether the law has been applied correctly rather than whether the right verdict has been reached. Only a few minutes before our interview, the court handed down another significant judgment \u2013 and again the government was found wanting. Five supreme court judges, including Hale, ruled that the Home Office falsely imprisoned asylum seekers, without having proper policies to determine whether an individual poses a risk of absconding. \u201cThe law is quite clear,\u201d Hale says. \u201cYou can only lock asylum seekers up if there is a risk of absconding, and you\u2019ve got clear guidelines on how you decide. And the government\u2019s guidance didn\u2019t even say that\u2019s the only basis on which you can lock them up. So you can imagine their poor case workers going through this guidance and not addressing their minds to the right question.\u201d Does Hale think Britain is becoming a crueller country? She looks at Coull Trisic, who sits between us. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a legal question, is it?\u201d Coull Trisic says. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a legal question at all,\u201d Hale says. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s proper for me to answer it. I may have my personal opinion about it.\u201d Can I ask your personal opinion on whether we\u2019ve become a crueller country? \u201cYou can ask me all sorts of things, as long as you accept that there are certain things that are not appropriate for me to talk about. I\u2019ve got to be very careful not to look as if I\u2019m making political comments.\u201d Silence. Hale is brilliant at saying just as much as she wants, and not a word more; she simply comes to a polished stop and waits. Is there a judgment she look backs on that she is most proud of, that she would take to a desert island? She beams. \u201cWell, it\u2019s funny you should put it that way, because I\u2019d probably have great fun working out my eight Desert Island Judgments. In fact that\u2019s a nice thought, and thank you for it.\u201d OK, let\u2019s hear them. \u201cI\u2019d have to go away and think about eight.\u201d What about three? \u201cNumber one would probably be the prorogation case, where we said it was not within the power of the prime minister to suspend parliament for such a long time at such a critical moment. That\u2019s quite a source of, not pride, but satisfaction.\u201d Why does it mean so much to her? \u201cWell, it means a lot to the constitution.\u201d She refers me back to the 17th century and the constitutional settlement, making strong eye contact throughout. I can\u2019t help feeling she\u2019s testing me. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got a very clear understanding of the way the constitutional settlement worked out then, so we were acting in support of that.\u201d Hale moves on to the second of her three favourite judgments. In 2011, the supreme court ruled that a mother who was due to be deported to Tanzania should be allowed to stay: the interests of her children took priority. \u201cThe government conceded that it would be a disproportionate interference with their rights to deport the mother. So that established taking account of the interests of children who were affected by all sorts of governmental decisions.\u201d Her third choice is another 2011 judgment which established that domestic violence does not have to be physical. \u201cWe said, no, it involves all kinds of domination and abuse. Psychological domination \u2013 what we now call coercive control. We didn\u2019t have that phrase then.\u201d Hale explains the impact of the judgment by referencing the fictional case of Rob and Helen Titchener in The Archers, which climaxed in her stabbing him after years of coercive control. As she does, I see what a wonderful teacher Hale must be. She relates the storyline with total recall and explains its significance with perfect clarity. \u201cThe Archers educated the public, because the public saw what that man was doing bit by bit: destroying that woman\u2019s personality by making her leave her job, cutting her off from her family, marrying her without anybody else being present, confiscating her mobile phone, stopping her driving, probably making her pregnant against her will. We could all see that. But of course, the family and neighbours couldn\u2019t.\u201d After this judgment, Hale was harangued by elements of the press who regarded the supreme court as intrusive and nannying. \u201cThank goodness Lady Hale has never set foot in our home, or I\u2019d be sleeping under Blackfriars Bridge tonight,\u201d wrote columnist Cristina Odone in the Telegraph. \u201cI am, you see, guilty of domestic violence: I shout at my husband on a regular basis.\u201d I mention Odone\u2019s comment. \u201cYes, but that\u2019s not what it was about,\u201d Hale says curtly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about shouting. It was about something more insidious than that.\u201d Women are at the heart of two out of three of your favourite judgments, I say. She nods. \u201cI think a sense of the position of many women, and the necessity of the law to understand that position, is an important part of my work.\u201d When she was appointed a law lord, Hale created a coat of arms for her new title bearing the motto Omnia Feminae Aequissimae, meaning \u201cwomen are equal to everything\u201d. But her feminism has been used against her by the right. In a particularly venomous attack in 1995, the Daily Mail accused Hale of having \u201cher fingerprints all over some of the most revolutionary draft bills\u201d the Law Commission had ever produced, and being \u201ca feminist of the kind who would like to see changes in the way society is organised\u201d. While it is true that Hale has always championed women\u2019s rights, it\u2019s less clear that she is the anti-establishment radical both her critics and fans describe. Her parents were both headteachers, and her father\u2019s best friend was the local vicar. She may cling to her beloved north Yorkshire roots, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the way she talks: path is \u201cparth\u201d, room is \u201crum\u201d. She frequently throws Latin expressions into casual conversation (\u201cMirabile dictu\u201d), and at times her language is so archaically correct that she might have stepped out of a Jane Austen novel. Hale makes a point of the fact that, unlike most of her male peers, she did not attend public school; but she did go on to Cambridge University from grammar school. Two facts invariably quoted in the official biographies are that she graduated in 1966 with the only starred first in her year, and in 1969 passed her bar exam with the highest overall mark. At university, she was one of only six women studying law, in a year group of more than 100. Rather than being anti-establishment, she took the establishment men on at their own game and trounced them. I ask if she was always phenomenally clever. \u201cWell, that\u2019s for others to say,\u201d she replies. Never does she sound more establishment than when I ask her, at the beginning of our interview, what I should call her \u2013 Brenda or Lady Hale. I assume it\u2019s going to be Brenda. But Hale looks at Coull Trisic and says, \u201cWell, Lady Hale is the correct form of address.\u201d \u201cYes, I call her Lady Hale,\u201d Coull Trisic agrees. I swallow loudly, momentarily lost for words. I hadn\u2019t expected Hale would have a touch of the Ben Kingsleys (the actor insists on being called Sir Ben). \u201cSome people do call me Brenda,\u201d she adds. But it\u2019s clear that she does not want me to be one of them. \u201cMy PA, Ayo, who has been with me many years still calls me Dame Brenda,\u201d she says. She is not offended that Ayo is still an honour behind \u2013 she finds it amusing. \u201cOh,\u201d I say, and swallow loudly again. *** Brenda Hale was born in Leeds and grew up in Richmond. She talks about the town with huge affection: the medieval castle, the cobbled market place, the close community. She and her two sisters were all head girls at the local girls\u2019 grammar school, and Hale says she owes much of her success to her parents, who brought their daughters up to believe they could achieve anything; gender was no barrier. They assumed their girls would go to university, preferably Oxford or Cambridge. Hale is often compared to Bader Ginsburg, and there are many obvious similarities: both are professors; both made their name in academic law; both serve on the supreme court; both were from non-legal families, triumphed over male hegemony in the judiciary and have rock star soubriquets (while Hale is Beyonc\u00e9, Ginsburg is known as the Notorious RBG). But there are also significant differences. In 2008, they gave a talk together in the US and were asked what the professional responsibility of a lawyer was. After Ginsburg replied that a lawyer had to \u201cmake things a little better in your community, your nation and your world\u201d, Hale responded, \u201cI want to be more down to earth \u2013 the greatest challenge for the legal profession is to be honest, and it\u2019s the first duty.\u201d While Ginsburg is a self-proclaimed idealist, Hale prefers to see herself simply as a practitioner. In 1984, Hale became the first woman and the youngest person appointed to the Law Commission, at the age of 39. It was here that she helped devise the Children Act 1989, which allocated duties to courts, local authorities and parents to ensure children are safeguarded. This is another reform she looks back on with satisfaction \u2013 and another that caused controversy. Columnist Melanie Phillips wrote in the Daily Mail that, as the \u201cprinciple architect\u201d of the Act, Hale had \u201chelped destroy the authority of adults and made it impossible for teachers, social workers or even parents physically to restrain children from mischief without the child reporting them to the police\u201d. But there was considerable support from elsewhere. In 1986, Hale was made professor of law at Manchester University, after two decades in academia. Most judges come direct from the bar; is it true that there is a snobbery about academia? \u201cYes.\u201d Even so, Hale says her background proved beneficial. \u201cThe advantage is that you have to think about the law in the round \u2013 the whole subject, not just the individual case. So it gives you a different perspective from the one you get just dealing with case, after case, after case.\u201d But now she is preparing to step down. After sitting for a month in Hong Kong\u2019s court of final appeal, she will formally retire, and spend more time indulging her passions \u2013 walking, gardening, opera, family (her daughter Julia lives on the same street in London, and she has three stepchildren). Does she think she is leaving the law in a better state than when she qualified? \u201cIn certain respects, yes. I think what I\u2019m happiest with is that people now take equality very seriously as a value in the law and in the way people are treated. Equality and non-discrimination. By equality, I mean treating people equally, I don\u2019t mean equality of outcome \u2013 that is a very different thing.\u201d It is odd to be sitting here talking about increased equality while under orders to use her title. \u201cLady Brenda Hale,\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t find all this Lady stuff very easy.\u201d She laughs. I\u2019m still waiting for the punch on the arm and the \u201cGotcha!\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t come. \u201cI know. I know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m laughing.\u201d She seems to enjoy my discomfort. I tell her my mother is called Marjorie, Hale\u2019s middle name, and ask if she likes it. She says it was her mother\u2019s name, too, and she\u2019s happy enough with it. \u201cIt\u2019s the Brenda I don\u2019t really like.\u201d Why not? \u201cAh well, what\u2019s the book called? It was popular in the 1970s. A Handful Of Dust. This is all about a really decent aristocratic chap who marries a not-decent aristocratic woman called Brenda and she treats him very badly, is unfaithful to him, etc. But of course he does the decent thing and lets her divorce him because that\u2019s what they did, and she then takes him to the cleaners. So he takes a trip up the Amazon where he is captured by some barmy Englishman who makes him stay there and read Dickens novels to him.\u201d Again, there is this incredible recall of detail and ability to summarise on the spot. So she only started disliking her name then? \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure I ever liked it. Not particularly happy with it, but not unhappy. Then I read that book, and she was called Brenda and she was an absolute bitch.\u201d But despite her protestations, Brenda seems rather appropriate; it\u2019s the Queen\u2019s nickname, and there is something rather regal about Hale. I\u2019m staring at her octopus. What is it with the animal brooches? Simple, she says: they were a way of glamming up her drab work clothes. \u201cIt started off when I was in the family division wearing dark suits. My husband started giving me brooches to cheer them up a bit, to feminise them, and it just grew from there \u2013 a lot of frogs, a lot of creatures.\u201d In 1992, Hale married her second husband, Julian Farrand, former dean of the law faculty at Manchester university. Their wedding took place a few days after she and her first husband, Anthony Hoggett QC, Julia\u2019s father, were divorced. She refers to Farrand affectionately as her \u201cfrog prince\u201d. There are a number of Frog and Toad of Toad Hall figurines lined up on her desk, all tributes to Farrand. \u201cIt\u2019s his driving style,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s where all the Toad stuff started.\u201d Toad is known for his love of fast cars. Who are her heroes? Hale reels off a list of lawyers: former senior law lord Lord Bingham; family division judge Margaret Booth; Lord Atkin, widely credited with creating the law of negligence. And outside the law? \u201cOne would be Archbishop Desmond Tutu. He kept a certain spirit alive, which was hugely influential in how things worked out in the immediate aftermath [of Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison].\u201d What I also love about Tutu, I say, is that he knows his weakness \u2013 he\u2019s got a massive ego. I ask her if she has a big ego. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got an ego. I try to keep it in check.\u201d Does she succeed? \u201cOther people had better tell you the answer to that.\u201d A couple of years ago, journalist Afua Hirsch (author of Equal To Everything, the children\u2019s book about Hale) wrote a profile for Prospect magazine in which an unnamed former colleague of Hale\u2019s said she found her \u201ca totally fascinating woman\u201d but \u201cdifficult to work with\u201d. The ex-colleague added: \u201cYou have to be obstreperous as a woman to get there, to break the glass ceiling \u2013 it\u2019s painful, it leaves you with cuts.\u201d Does Hale recognise that description? \u201cYes, probably. I try very hard to be patient, but I\u2019m sometimes a bit quick with people. I probably ask a lot of people. Certain people. But I also think certain people find women \u2018obstreperous\u2019 when they would not find the same behaviour from a man obstreperous. They\u2019d just call them determined or authoritative. It wouldn\u2019t be a criticism.\u201d Coull Trisic tells me we have 15 minutes left. I ask her whether she tells Hale when she\u2019s being quick with her. \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018We\u2019ll do it that way and we\u2019ll get it done.\u2019 She\u2019s my boss and I\u2019ll go, \u2018OK\u2019.\u201d I seem to have touched a tender spot. Hale is thinking aloud. \u201cWhat I\u2019m struggling with is, I think I am less bossy and assertive than most of the men I see around me.\u201d She is still doing battle with obstreperous. Firm is a fairer word, she decides. Over the decades, Hale has witnessed so much progress for women in the legal system, both as practitioners and in terms of their access to justice. Does she worry that some of these gains are now being reversed? In September last year, Crown Prosecution Service figures showed that the number of rape convictions were the lowest they had been in a decade, despite an increase in the number of reported incidents \u2013 prosecutions were down by 33% on the year and convictions fell by 26%. Will she leave her job feeling \u2013 Hale interrupts before I can finish the sentence. \u201cJob done? No, no.\u201d Why not? \u201cI think the question of prosecuting sex offences generally is problematic for obvious reasons. How do you establish a case that is going to have a better than evens chance of getting a conviction? To what extent do you take into account the known facts about some of the prejudices that some juries have?\u201d There are other areas where she worries the law may not be doing enough to protect women. Digital technology, she says, has brought its own set of problems. \u201cWhat might not have been an issue 20 years ago is now a serious issue: trolling on social media. It\u2019s a problem for men, but it\u2019s a particular problem for women. So there may be things the law needs to do to catch up.\u201d Over the past five years the legal aid budget has shrunk by more than \u00a31bn, while the justice bill in general has been slashed by 40%. Today, legal aid is denied to most housing, welfare, family and immigration cases. Hale admits the financial cuts are her greatest concern. \u201cThe removal of legal aid from whole subject matters has been unfortunate to say the least. The justice system generally finds itself in a very needy state.\u201d I tell her I\u2019m horrified that most people now have less access to justice. Will these cuts be reversed? \u201cI\u2019ve got to be really careful what I say about legal aid. I can\u2019t adopt the language you\u2019re using. I can\u2019t. I think there has been a worrying period since 2012 [when funding cuts were introduced]. It is difficult to claw back what has been given up. I think massive efforts are going into trying to modernise the justice system. If they work, that will be a good thing, but whether they will is very much open to question.\u201d She pauses. \u201cIt would be great if a lot more prominence were given to the problems of the justice system than currently is, including by journalists.\u201d I tell her I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re living in a country where we deport migrants who have broken the law rather than simply letting them serve their prison sentence. What has happened to the concept of rehabilitation? \u201cWell, usually they deport them after they\u2019ve served their sentence,\u201d she says. Exactly: so it\u2019s a double punishment. \u201cI think I\u2019d better not comment on that. I really better not comment on that,\u201d Hale says, but her tone suggests she is hardly sympathetic to this practice. I think she is finally warming up. \u201cOne hour, two minutes,\u201d says Coull Trisic, looking at the time. Well, at least I\u2019ve got a lot off my chest, I say. \u201cYou have, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Hale says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got more off your chest than I have.\u201d True. But I\u2019ve got a sneaky feeling that, once she is no longer shackled by office, we will be hearing a lot more from Lady Hale. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

This command, sober and urgent, related in part to the music played. Shostakovich wrote his epic Symphony No 11, \u201cThe Year 1905\u201d, just after the Hungarian uprising of 1957. Its title refers back to the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d massacre of anti-tsarist demonstrators in St Petersburg early last century. Vivid, brooding, ferocious, the work proved ideal for the huge forces crammed on stage at the Barbican, with notably brilliant work from the solo cor anglais, the hard-worked, thunderous percussion section, the darkly lyrical violas \u2013 especially in their third-movement melody \u2013 and the beautifully drilled, gutsy cellos. The Spanish conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn, himself a former orchestral flautist, managed to inspire the best in everyone, including those far away on the back desks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This orchestra has undergone its own velvet revolution in the past decade</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Britten\u2019s <em>Sinfonia da Requiem</em>, above all a lament against war, its shadowy nuances not easily captured by so large an ensemble, and Eisler\u2019s demonstration song Auf den Strassen zu singen (We are singing in the streets), tell their own story of loss and protest. Turning themselves into a fresh-voiced choir for the Eisler, the NYO showed their versatility as musicians, also performing some of the revolutionary songs that Shostakovich buried in his symphony.

From the short, stirring platform welcome by a violinist from Glasgow, and a note in the programme from the NYO\u2019s leader, 17-year-old Kynan Walker from Sutton Coldfield, this was no ordinary event. \u201cTonight\u2019s programme shows our want for change,\u201d Walker writes, going on to cite issues in which many young people have been involved, from Brexit and the NHS to the environment.

His publishers should perhaps have given him more time to wait and see how Brexit would play out after the inevitable general election and Boris Johnson had obtained the necessary majority for the EU-exit process. Perhaps in time they will grant him a new edition and allow him to travel to places where the backstop ends \u2013 not on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic but rather the port of Larne. This will be the location and the pressure point of a so-called border down the Irish Sea, where goods and services are subjected to checks. It\u2019s a scenario that unionists will regard as a dangerous slippage towards decoupling the region from the rest of the union. Patterson is at his best when he gets into the detail of Northern Irish life, from the tiny rainbow flags and \u201cUppa Queers\u201d T-shirts on sale at Belfast Pride 2019 to the burst bass drum left on a loyalist street after an Orange Order parade last summer. So, send him up to Larne and let him loose in this ultra-loyalist town that will soon become the real backstop frontier for Brexit Britain. \u2022 Backstop Land by Glenn Patterson is published by Head of Zeus (RRP \u00a313.99).

      "bodyText": "Steamed pudding is one of those desserts that people tend to think of as a bit dated and boring. However, you can really go to town on the flavour combinations. Here, we\u2019re talking white chocolate pudding with pockets of stem ginger and lemon, and served with a brown sugar custard. This is comfort food at its finest. White chocolate, ginger and lemon steamed pudding with brown sugar custard Prep 20 min Cook 2 hr 15 min Serves 4-6 For the steamed pudding 175g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing 175g soft light brown sugar 3 large eggs 175g self-raising flour Zest of 2 lemons \u00bd tsp fine sea salt 1 tsp vanilla extract 2 tbsp milk 1 tsp ground ginger 100g white chocolate, chopped 150g stem ginger, chopped For the custard 250ml double cream 650ml whole milk 2 tsp vanilla bean paste 4 large egg yolks 3 tbsp cornflour 200g light brown sugar To finish Candied lemon 4 tbsp crystallised ginger, chopped 50g white chocolate, melted 30g icing sugar, to dust Generously grease a 1.2-litre pudding basin with a knob of butter, then cut out a disc of baking parchment and stick it to the bottom. Using a stand mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing between each addition. Sieve in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest, salt, vanilla, milk and ground ginger, and beat until incorporated. Fold in the white chocolate and stem ginger. Tip into the basin, smoothing the surface so it\u2019s level. Cover with a lid or secure a layer of greaseproof paper and foil over the top, pleating the centre to allow the pudding to expand, and securing with string. To cook, put a saucer on the bottom of a large saucepan. Put the pudding on top, then pour enough boiling water into the saucepan for it to reach halfway up the basin. Pop the lid on, bring the water to a boil, then turn down the heat to a rolling simmer \u2013 have some extra water ready, just in case you need to top up. It should take one and a half to two hours. Meanwhile, make the custard. Combine the double cream and milk in a pan. Add the vanilla, and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, mix the egg yolks, cornflour and sugar in a bowl. Once the cream and milk just reach boiling point, slowly add the yolk mix, stirring constantly. Cook on a low heat, stirring, until thickened. It\u2019s ready when the custard reaches 82C on a food thermometer, or thickly coats the back of a spoon. To check if the pudding is ready, poke a skewer through the foil pleat: if it comes out clean, it\u2019s ready. Lift the pudding from the saucepan and set aside for five minutes, then turn out on to a serving plate. To finish, sprinkle with candied lemon and crystalised ginger, add a squiggle of melted chocolate and a dusting of icing sugar, then pour the custard around the pudding, and serve.",

A wonderfully eccentric brass band were playing carols in the station entrance, and the gothic beast of the cathedral seemed to be listening, peering through the roof like an intrigued T-rex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1508c09aacb3bc52f20a185ecbdafaf3e0a9ad7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1508c09aacb3bc52f20a185ecbdafaf3e0a9ad7f/0_0_1082_747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"cologne vienna train map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Pointy-faced ICE trains were nosing about as I waited for my sleeper. It drifted in around 9.15pm: a long purple Nightjet train pulled by a bright red locomotive, with a mix of standard seating, couchette compartments and more luxurious sleeper cars.</p> <p>The train exuded excitement, mystery and warmth. Fellow passengers took pictures. \u201cIs this a special train then?\u201d a German man asked me. \u201cI think so,\u201d I said, distracted by his resemblance to J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cIt\u2019s the Vienna sleeper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, I forget that people get excited about such things. For me it\u2019s just my train home.\u201d</p> <p>I mulled this as I boarded \u2013 the apparent novelty of a night train in 2019. Only 10 years ago, they seemed an endangered species as country by European country discontinued its services \u2014 the French, the Swiss and then, finally, the Germans in 2016. Yet, only three years later, the market has turned around, and Nightjet\u2019s owner, \u00d6BB \u2013 the Austrian Federal Railway that kept the faith \u2013 is reaping the rewards. The UK has two sleeper services: the GWR Night Riviera from London Paddington to Cornwall, and the Caledonian Sleeper from Euston to Scotland\u2019s far north. But as recently as the 1980s and early 90s a nocturnal network ushered travellers from Kings Cross to Newcastle and Sunderland; Paddington to Milford Haven; Euston to Holyhead, Liverpool and Manchester; Nottingham to Glasgow; and Plymouth and Bristol to Birmingham and Edinburgh.</p> <p>As I drifted off, swaddled in my train\u2019s soft concertina of sounds , I thought of the driver\u2019s view \u2014 infinite arrows of rails and light. Red, yellow, green and silver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6539a865125731cc90f45fe700bca5d47bb3941d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6539a865125731cc90f45fe700bca5d47bb3941d/0_216_6480_3888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Austria\u2019s Nightjet train\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new Nightjet service between Brussels and Vienna launches on 19 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harald Eisenberger</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boarding at Cologne, I made my way down the sleeper car corridor, with its numbered compartments. Many of the sleeper sections have sofa-like seats, which the carriage attendant will later fold away, lowering hinged beds from the wall \u2013 the cabins sleep three, laddered one above the other. My room was cosy and light, with a wash basin and mirror tucked in a cupboard, and a small desk that could be folded away. After filling in my tick-box selection for the next morning\u2019s breakfast, my steward gave me a key card so I could lock my door if I wished to pad up the carriage to the shower and washroom.</p> <p>My coach was a mix of families, tourists and business people.

      "bodyText": "I wake in the pre-dawn light \u2013 still inky blue in the compartment. I lie there, feeling the train rock beneath me and then push up the window blind with a foot. I\u2019m rolling through misty flatlands. The landscape spooling past. Austria. Last night I was in Cologne. A wonderfully eccentric brass band were playing carols in the station entrance, and the gothic beast of the cathedral seemed to be listening, peering through the roof like an intrigued T-rex. Pointy-faced ICE trains were nosing about as I waited for my sleeper. It drifted in around 9.15pm: a long purple Nightjet train pulled by a bright red locomotive, with a mix of standard seating, couchette compartments and more luxurious sleeper cars. The train exuded excitement, mystery and warmth. Fellow passengers took pictures. \u201cIs this a special train then?\u201d a German man asked me. \u201cI think so,\u201d I said, distracted by his resemblance to J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cIt\u2019s the Vienna sleeper.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, I forget that people get excited about such things. For me it\u2019s just my train home.\u201d I mulled this as I boarded \u2013 the apparent novelty of a night train in 2019. Only 10 years ago, they seemed an endangered species as country by European country discontinued its services \u2014 the French, the Swiss and then, finally, the Germans in 2016. Yet, only three years later, the market has turned around, and Nightjet\u2019s owner, \u00d6BB \u2013 the Austrian Federal Railway that kept the faith \u2013 is reaping the rewards. The UK has two sleeper services: the GWR Night Riviera from London Paddington to Cornwall, and the Caledonian Sleeper from Euston to Scotland\u2019s far north. But as recently as the 1980s and early 90s a nocturnal network ushered travellers from Kings Cross to Newcastle and Sunderland; Paddington to Milford Haven; Euston to Holyhead, Liverpool and Manchester; Nottingham to Glasgow; and Plymouth and Bristol to Birmingham and Edinburgh. As I drifted off, swaddled in my train\u2019s soft concertina of sounds , I thought of the driver\u2019s view \u2014 infinite arrows of rails and light. Red, yellow, green and silver. Boarding at Cologne, I made my way down the sleeper car corridor, with its numbered compartments. Many of the sleeper sections have sofa-like seats, which the carriage attendant will later fold away, lowering hinged beds from the wall \u2013 the cabins sleep three, laddered one above the other. My room was cosy and light, with a wash basin and mirror tucked in a cupboard, and a small desk that could be folded away. After filling in my tick-box selection for the next morning\u2019s breakfast, my steward gave me a key card so I could lock my door if I wished to pad up the carriage to the shower and washroom. My coach was a mix of families, tourists and business people. Some boarded long after I\u2019d turned in and I felt the train slow at a half-dozen stations before I fell asleep, muzzily aware of doors banging and people whispering as they made their way past. My bed was comfortable \u2013 firm mattress, warm duvet. Reading spotlights made the room feel super snug. The thermostat control above the door was effectual. Having an attendant a buzzer call away in case of emergency \u2013 or just the need for tea \u2013 was a happy reassurance. There was a welcome pack of sparkling wine, soap, snacks, slippers, eye mask and ear plugs, but I slept very well unplugged. Indeed it was a thrill to stir and find the train still and ticking somewhere unknown, and then wake only a moment later to find time had slipped and, yes, we were rolling again, somewhere else now, speeding away over tracks unknown \u2013 a trance-like adventure. The following morning I have breakfast with Bernhard Reider of \u00d6BB.

      "body": "<p>Years ago, on my allotment, a tiny weed appeared among my beans. Out of intrigue, empathy \u2013 whatever the reason, I left it to see what it would become. A year later I had forgotten about it, buried beneath other weeds. Then, one dusk, there it was, a glowing white spire with the sun setting behind it: <em>Digitalis purpurea</em> subsp. <em>albiflora</em>, the less common form of Europe\u2019s native foxglove. It ignited a weedy epiphany: what if these plants, seen as problems to be evicted, are a source of easy beauty in our gardens?</p> <p>Since childhood I\u2019ve felt a connection with weeds. Behind our family\u2019s cottage garden in Buckinghamshire, I used to run through forests of giant hogweed (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=458\" title=\"\">Heracleum mantegazzianum</a></em>), understanding its sap was dangerous. I swung from vines of wild <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/94170/i-Clematis-i-Alba-Luxurians-(Vt)/Details\" title=\"\">Clematis alba</a></em> and stomped over ivy (<em><a href=\"https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/hedera-helix/\" title=\"\">Hedera helix</a></em>). I fed dandelions with fertiliser to grow bigger flowers. From buttercups to daisies, weeds are probably the first flowers most of us know.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"656de8bfd42a1f32f08094294557d1209dcc32df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/656de8bfd42a1f32f08094294557d1209dcc32df/0_309_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red valerian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve actively incorporated weeds such as red valerian into gardens for clients.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Somewhere there\u2019s an unspoken scale that ranks plants from \u201cweed\u201d to \u201cwildflower\u201d through to \u201cornamental\u201d. At one end sits Japanese knotweed (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=218\" title=\"\">Fallopia japonica</a></em>) and, at the other, native bluebells (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/8890/hyacinthoides-non-scripta/details\" title=\"\">Hyacinthoides non-scripta</a></em>); dog rose (<em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/16017/Rosa-canina-(S)/Details\" title=\"\">Rosa canina</a></em>) sits in the middle, feeling confused. But a plant is a plant, and if you like it, you should grow it no matter what label it\u2019s been given. \u201cWeed\u201d is merely a broad and usually negative term applied to any plant that pops up where you weren\u2019t expecting it.</p> <p>While many people get frustrated with weeds in gardens, I\u2019ve grown increasingly fond of them. They\u2019re beautiful, and they\u2019re part of the natural world, attracting bees, butterflies and hoverflies. Part of me likes them because they\u2019re so familiar, and come with an emotional connection. A more rebellious part of me likes weeds purely because other people tell me not to. You should avoid weeds that put up too much of a fight, such as couch grass, and those that are invasive in the wild, like Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam.

      "bodyText": "Years ago, on my allotment, a tiny weed appeared among my beans. Out of intrigue, empathy \u2013 whatever the reason, I left it to see what it would become. A year later I had forgotten about it, buried beneath other weeds. Then, one dusk, there it was, a glowing white spire with the sun setting behind it: Digitalis purpurea subsp. albiflora, the less common form of Europe\u2019s native foxglove. It ignited a weedy epiphany: what if these plants, seen as problems to be evicted, are a source of easy beauty in our gardens? Since childhood I\u2019ve felt a connection with weeds. Behind our family\u2019s cottage garden in Buckinghamshire, I used to run through forests of giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum), understanding its sap was dangerous. I swung from vines of wild Clematis alba and stomped over ivy (Hedera helix). I fed dandelions with fertiliser to grow bigger flowers. From buttercups to daisies, weeds are probably the first flowers most of us know. Somewhere there\u2019s an unspoken scale that ranks plants from \u201cweed\u201d to \u201cwildflower\u201d through to \u201cornamental\u201d. At one end sits Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and, at the other, native bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta); dog rose (Rosa canina) sits in the middle, feeling confused. But a plant is a plant, and if you like it, you should grow it no matter what label it\u2019s been given. \u201cWeed\u201d is merely a broad and usually negative term applied to any plant that pops up where you weren\u2019t expecting it. While many people get frustrated with weeds in gardens, I\u2019ve grown increasingly fond of them. They\u2019re beautiful, and they\u2019re part of the natural world, attracting bees, butterflies and hoverflies. Part of me likes them because they\u2019re so familiar, and come with an emotional connection. A more rebellious part of me likes weeds purely because other people tell me not to. You should avoid weeds that put up too much of a fight, such as couch grass, and those that are invasive in the wild, like Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam. But who would be without nutritious stinging nettles, great for soup, insects and homemade fertiliser? These days, as a professional garden designer and horticulturist, I\u2019ve actively incorporated weeds into gardens for clients: ivy-leaved toadflax (Cymbalaria muralis), wild carrot (Daucus carota), common knapweed (Centaurea nigra), yarrow (Achillea millefolium) and red valerian (Centranthus ruber). I\u2019m not the only one: many gardens at the Chelsea flower show now include them; Sarah Price\u2019s Mediterranean garden from 2018 featured wild carrot, red valerian, and common fennel (Foeniculum vulgare). Think twice before you pull them up; they can provide food and shelter for wildlife over winter. Seed heads not only look beautiful at this time of year, but you can scatter their seeds for next summer. Designing with weeds is no different from any other plant. Cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris) and wild carrot suit modern and traditional borders; common fumitory (Fumaria officinalis) works well in tropical raised beds alongside banana plants; and common daisies (Bellis perennis) look great in window boxes. Here are a few to get you started \u2013 and the ones to avoid. Five weeds to encourage Wild carrot Its lifecycle is filled with beauty, from ferny foliage to flat white flowers. Common knapweed A slender meadow weed that brings height with its colourful flowers; an excellent source of nectar. Red valerian A non-native loved by butterflies and the hummingbird hawk moth. Caper spurge (Euphorbia lathyris) Structural, and perfect in part-shade. Has biennial growth, so you can make the most of its low foliage one year, its tall, standout flowers the next. Common fumitory Part of the poppy family, it has clusters of tiny pink flowers each with a dark tip that fades to almost white. Five weeds to remove Hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) Its pure white trumpet flowers look pretty, but it spreads like wildfire. Couch grass Often in gardens and allotments. Extract as much as you can, then repeat regularly. Green alkanet, (Pentaglottis sempervirens) Owner of a deep and stubborn taproot. Dig it out, making sure you get all of the root. Horsetail (Equisetum arvense) Will spread rapidly and aggressively. Weed-suppressant matting will kill it, but it takes two years to do the job. Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) Beautiful, sweetly scented pink flowers, but invasive in damp soils. \u2022 Wild About Weeds by Jack Wallington is published by Laurence King, \u00a319.99.",

The responsible parties would be referred to a judicial department within the military and held accountable, it said. A fuller explanation and apology would be forthcoming from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards later on Saturday, IRNA news reported, citing an informed source within the Guards. The jetliner, a Boeing 737-800, went down on the outskirts of Tehran during takeoff a few hours after Iran had launched a barrage of missiles at US forces in Iraq in the early hours of Wednesday. The strikes on two US bases were in retaliation for the US drone strike that killed the al-Quds force leader, Qassem Suleimani, in Baghdad on 3 January \u2013 the culmination of a recent series of tit-for-tat attacks that threatened to push Washington and Tehran into war. Iran\u2019s acknowledgement of responsibility renews questions of why authorities did not shut down the country\u2019s main international airport and its airspace after launching ballistic missile attacks, when they feared US reprisals were possible. It also undermines the credibility of information provided by senior Iranian officials so far. As recently as Friday, Ali Abedzadeh, the head of the national aviation department, told reporters with certainty that a missile had not caused the crash.

Western security officials began briefing on Thursday afternoon that intelligence suggested the plane had been accidentally shot down by two surface-to-air missiles fired by the Iranian military. A preliminary report released by Iran\u2019s civil aviation authority the day after the crash found that the pilots of the doomed plane did not make radio contact but had attempted to turn back to the airport before the plane went down. Experts raised serious concerns over the handling of the crash site, such as over the removal of debris, prompting fears that Tehran had sought to eliminate evidence from the area. Iran has invited investigators from Canada and Ukraine and from Boeing to visit the crash site on the outskirts of Tehran and said it would also welcome representatives of other countries whose citizens were killed. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 57 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians and three Britons.

In what may be the latest attempt to either squat on or protect the couple\u2019s brand, it was lodged on Thursday by an applicant who appears to be based in Italy and filed it in German, with English listed as a second language. Database searches suggest it was made in the name of Ui Phoenix Kerbl, possibly after the Guardian reported on Thursday that the Sussexes had yet to register their brand outside of the UK. Six categories of goods and services were listed \u2013 covering areas including toiletries, sporting goods, toys and alcoholic beverages \u2013 in the application to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). An examination process by EUIPO officials will begin, which may involve them raising concerns, but if no objection is raised then the trademark will be published in 23 EU languages. There are also fees \u2013 \u20ac850 for one class of trademark and payable online \u2013 that will have to be paid. From the date of publication onwards, third parties who believe that the trademark should not be registered have three months to object and must oppose the trademark by filling in a form and paying a fee of \u20ac320. One in five applications for EU trademarks are opposed by the owners of trademarks that are already on the market.

Ownership was switched to the couple in December. Before the latest apparent attempt to squat on their brand, the couple were reminded of the risks they could face by a failed attempt in the UK last April to trademark hundreds of items from adhesive bras to energy drinks in the name of \u201cSussex Royal\u201d. The application, which came from Malta in the name of John Burnett, appears to have been an attempt to squat on the couple\u2019s name but fell foul of the special protection that \u201cRoyal\u201d has in UK intellectual property law.

      "body": "<h2>When was your first day at the Guardian?</h2> <p>It was 19 November 1979. After two interviews I was delighted to be offered the role of the Guardian\u2019s Midlands correspondent, based in my hometown of Wolverhampton. Previously I had worked at the town\u2019s Express and Star paper, completed a postgraduate course in journalism at Cardiff University and then joined Cardiff\u2019s Western Mail as leader and features editor. I remember feeling early on that it seemed an amazing way of earning a living, and I got to do so many interesting, varied things.<br></p> <h2>What came next?</h2> <p>I progressed to being the paper\u2019s Ireland correspondent, based in Belfast. It was a period of tremendous unrest \u2013 the Brighton bomb and the introduction of shoot-to-kill. I met Ian Paisley, Gerry Adams, and members of the UDA. I recall standing on the Falls Road and seeing the police shoot a man dead a few feet away from me. We produced fair-minded coverage of the Troubles. I grew to know where all the phone boxes were between Derry and Belfast and made it my business to reach them before my Press Association counterpart so that I could be the first to file my copy.</p> <p>In 1987 I became the Guardian\u2019s news editor. It was pretty intimidating given the experience on the desk at that time, and I hadn\u2019t worked in London much, but it was hugely vibrant, exciting and lively. In addition to this being the time of our first big redesign, politics was in flux \u2013 the Thatcher era ended and in 1990, John Major became the prime minister. It was this same year that I became the assistant editor, in charge of putting the paper out each night. In 1995, I was promoted to deputy editor responsible for news.<br></p> <h2>Can you tell us about your career highlights?</h2> <p>One of my first stories as assistant editor was the libel claim brought against the Guardian by the Police Federation in a case seen as a test of the media\u2019s ability to report investigations into police corruption allegations. Had we lost the case, it would have cost us about \u00a32.5m in today\u2019s money.</p> <p>We reported on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1996/oct/01/conservatives.uk\">Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith\u2019s \u201ccash for questions\u201d scandal</a>. After questions in parliament, we realised Hamilton\u2019s defamation action would collapse. It was billed as the \u00a310m libel case and we ran the story with the headline \u201cA liar and a cheat\u201d.</p> <p>Then, of course, we covered the actions of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/jun/06/newspapers-national-newspapers\">Treasury minister Jonathan Aitken</a>, who denounced \u201cwicked lies\u201d told by the Guardian and Granada TV\u2019s World in Action about his business activities. He was so smooth and polished, even tipped as the next PM, and he was quoted as saying: \u201cIf it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of fair play, so be it.\u201d He launched libel writs against the Guardian and the case took two years to get to court. Then Owen Bowcott uncovered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/nov/24/uk\">vital piece of evidence in Switzerland</a> that proved Aitken had lied about who had footed the bill for his stay in the Paris Ritz, and his case collapsed. Aitken went to prison for perjury and perverting the course of justice. The headline we ran read \u201cHe lied and lied and lied\u201d.</p> <p>I recall 1997 and Blair\u2019s general election victory very clearly \u2013 it felt like a new dawn, a time of great hope, energy and progression. But the Guardian was vehemently against the Iraq war and never seduced by the justifications that were offered up for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc9eaa9555ef35403d1dbbb5fcf7a53866e08551\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc9eaa9555ef35403d1dbbb5fcf7a53866e08551/0_241_6539_3923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Johnson and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner with the first tabloid edition of the Guardian in January 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Johnson and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner with the first tabloid edition of the Guardian in January 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What sets the Guardian apart from other publications?</h2> <p>I think our bravery and commitment to truth. It\u2019s also our attention to political nuance, which can be seen in our reporting of the Balkans, Afghanistan and Syria. Reporting like this is sometimes dangerous and always expensive, but it is reporting we must do because of the impact it has on the world. The consequences of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">phone hacking scandal</a> reverberated widely, as did our undercover reporting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">Sports Direct and the gig economy</a>. The series on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/16/andy-woodward\">abuse in football</a> exposed culprits and revealed huge numbers of victims, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush</a> changed the law and resulted in the resignation of a home secretary, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">Snowden leaks</a> sparked conversations around privacy that are still going on today.<br></p> <h2>How has the industry changed since you started?</h2> <p>The means of delivery is probably where the biggest shift can be seen. When a story breaks, our first thought now is the web \u2013 the Guardian is now truly global. We have the advantages of the web, of being an English-language paper, and of course our operations in the US and Australia. We are a 24/7 organisation now.</p> <p>In many ways, it\u2019s unrecognisable compared with when I first started, but at its core, the Guardian hasn\u2019t changed. We still have a dedication to fairness, to rigour, and to effecting positive change in the world and moving the dial. We refuse to bow to external pressures. We have grown from a paper on one small island to something which has millions of readers across the world, meaning our potential for impact is huge. All the financial support we receive is returned to our journalism, and that reader-funded model is working well for us so far, which is a pretty amazing thing.</p> <h2>Which journalists do you most admire?</h2> <p>I have worked with many world-class investigative journalists over the years. And I\u2019ve worked closely with three brilliant editors-in-chief \u2013 Peter Preston, Alan Rusbridger and Katharine Viner. They are united by the qualities of huge drive and foresight. Katharine\u2019s editorship is already characterised by energy, exuberance and engagement. She also has a terrific sense of mischief and, when things look tricky, of remarkable bravery too.</p> <h2>What advice would you give for reporters just starting out?</h2> <p>Stamina is key \u2013 you have to be able to keep digging away at a story, to ask the right questions, listen carefully to the answers, and exercise rigour at all times. You also have to be technically adept, understand politics and the wider context of stories, and have a nose for seeking out interesting stories and contacts. For the Guardian in particular, I\u2019d say originality is important. But moreover, you should be sceptical rather than cynical, and have a profound curiosity about the world.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "When was your first day at the Guardian? It was 19 November 1979. After two interviews I was delighted to be offered the role of the Guardian\u2019s Midlands correspondent, based in my hometown of Wolverhampton. Previously I had worked at the town\u2019s Express and Star paper, completed a postgraduate course in journalism at Cardiff University and then joined Cardiff\u2019s Western Mail as leader and features editor. I remember feeling early on that it seemed an amazing way of earning a living, and I got to do so many interesting, varied things. What came next? I progressed to being the paper\u2019s Ireland correspondent, based in Belfast. It was a period of tremendous unrest \u2013 the Brighton bomb and the introduction of shoot-to-kill. I met Ian Paisley, Gerry Adams, and members of the UDA. I recall standing on the Falls Road and seeing the police shoot a man dead a few feet away from me. We produced fair-minded coverage of the Troubles. I grew to know where all the phone boxes were between Derry and Belfast and made it my business to reach them before my Press Association counterpart so that I could be the first to file my copy. In 1987 I became the Guardian\u2019s news editor. It was pretty intimidating given the experience on the desk at that time, and I hadn\u2019t worked in London much, but it was hugely vibrant, exciting and lively. In addition to this being the time of our first big redesign, politics was in flux \u2013 the Thatcher era ended and in 1990, John Major became the prime minister. It was this same year that I became the assistant editor, in charge of putting the paper out each night. In 1995, I was promoted to deputy editor responsible for news. Can you tell us about your career highlights? One of my first stories as assistant editor was the libel claim brought against the Guardian by the Police Federation in a case seen as a test of the media\u2019s ability to report investigations into police corruption allegations. Had we lost the case, it would have cost us about \u00a32.5m in today\u2019s money. We reported on Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith\u2019s \u201ccash for questions\u201d scandal. After questions in parliament, we realised Hamilton\u2019s defamation action would collapse. It was billed as the \u00a310m libel case and we ran the story with the headline \u201cA liar and a cheat\u201d. Then, of course, we covered the actions of the Treasury minister Jonathan Aitken, who denounced \u201cwicked lies\u201d told by the Guardian and Granada TV\u2019s World in Action about his business activities. He was so smooth and polished, even tipped as the next PM, and he was quoted as saying: \u201cIf it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of fair play, so be it.\u201d He launched libel writs against the Guardian and the case took two years to get to court. Then Owen Bowcott uncovered the vital piece of evidence in Switzerland that proved Aitken had lied about who had footed the bill for his stay in the Paris Ritz, and his case collapsed. Aitken went to prison for perjury and perverting the course of justice. The headline we ran read \u201cHe lied and lied and lied\u201d. I recall 1997 and Blair\u2019s general election victory very clearly \u2013 it felt like a new dawn, a time of great hope, energy and progression. But the Guardian was vehemently against the Iraq war and never seduced by the justifications that were offered up for it. What sets the Guardian apart from other publications? I think our bravery and commitment to truth. It\u2019s also our attention to political nuance, which can be seen in our reporting of the Balkans, Afghanistan and Syria. Reporting like this is sometimes dangerous and always expensive, but it is reporting we must do because of the impact it has on the world. The consequences of the phone hacking scandal reverberated widely, as did our undercover reporting on Sports Direct and the gig economy. The series on abuse in football exposed culprits and revealed huge numbers of victims, Windrush changed the law and resulted in the resignation of a home secretary, and the Snowden leaks sparked conversations around privacy that are still going on today. How has the industry changed since you started? The means of delivery is probably where the biggest shift can be seen. When a story breaks, our first thought now is the web \u2013 the Guardian is now truly global. We have the advantages of the web, of being an English-language paper, and of course our operations in the US and Australia. We are a 24/7 organisation now. In many ways, it\u2019s unrecognisable compared with when I first started, but at its core, the Guardian hasn\u2019t changed. We still have a dedication to fairness, to rigour, and to effecting positive change in the world and moving the dial. We refuse to bow to external pressures. We have grown from a paper on one small island to something which has millions of readers across the world, meaning our potential for impact is huge. All the financial support we receive is returned to our journalism, and that reader-funded model is working well for us so far, which is a pretty amazing thing. Which journalists do you most admire? I have worked with many world-class investigative journalists over the years. And I\u2019ve worked closely with three brilliant editors-in-chief \u2013 Peter Preston, Alan Rusbridger and Katharine Viner. They are united by the qualities of huge drive and foresight. Katharine\u2019s editorship is already characterised by energy, exuberance and engagement. She also has a terrific sense of mischief and, when things look tricky, of remarkable bravery too. What advice would you give for reporters just starting out? Stamina is key \u2013 you have to be able to keep digging away at a story, to ask the right questions, listen carefully to the answers, and exercise rigour at all times. You also have to be technically adept, understand politics and the wider context of stories, and have a nose for seeking out interesting stories and contacts. For the Guardian in particular, I\u2019d say originality is important. But moreover, you should be sceptical rather than cynical, and have a profound curiosity about the world.",

Takeaway boxes and empty bottles rest on crates full of wires, while a small rug added for ambience is covered in upended cardboard boxes. Heat, meanwhile, is provided by two whirring laptops, their screens full of chunky colour bars representing something technical Crossan doesn\u2019t even attempt to explain. The 23-year-old only got back from Asia yesterday, marking the end of a tour in support of 2017\u2019s Grammy-nominated, self-titled debut, which saw him collaborate with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/asap-rocky\">A$AP Rocky</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn\">Damon Albarn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/22/christine-and-the-queens-ive-just-discovered-sex-i-cant-stop-yet\">Christine and the Queens</a>. Now he\u2019s got to figure out how to play his forthcoming new album RYC (Raw Youth Collage) with a full band, hence the place looking like an unmanned stockroom.</p> <p>While that sun-dappled first album poked and prodded at the pop zeitgeist, fusing tropical house and trap while joining the dots between Disclosure and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/28/jamie-xx-smith-solo-debut-album-in-colour\">Jamie xx</a>, its grungier follow-up offers a sonic volte face. Out go the uplifting bangers and in come dense guitars \u2013 fuelled by his childhood obsessions with bands such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/joydivision\">Joy Division</a>, Talking Heads and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/blur\">Blur</a> \u2013 and a lyrical heaviness that reflects, well, 2020. \u201c[My debut] was about pop music, essentially, but trying to come at it from an oblique angle,\u201d Crossan says, perched precariously on a cardboard box. \u201cI think in the past five years that grand obelisk of \u2018pop music\u2019 has been destroyed, because as the next generation come in they\u2019re really not interested in genres. Anything can become pop.\u201d He also sees the lyrical themes of this new, looser kind of \u201cpop\u201d shifting, too. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real appetite for vulnerability and emotional transparency. We\u2019ve had a good decade of \u2018Put your hands in the air like you just don\u2019t care\u2019 and people are like: \u2018This isn\u2019t reflective of what\u2019s happening geopolitically any more.\u2019\u201d He smiles knowingly at that last bit. \u201cThey want something that connects to the world they\u2019re living in, and I think there\u2019s something about the guitar that\u2019s really expressive.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0uvt97Xn20\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F0uvt97Xn20?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>RYC, which features Slowthai on the punk-y rumble of Deal Wiv It and US singer Clairo on the blown-out psychedelia of lead single I Don\u2019t Think I Can Do This Again, bristles with a sort of manic energy you wouldn\u2019t necessarily associate with Crossan\u2019s quietly studious approach to music-making. He\u2019s the quintessential nerd (\u201cI was never cool and I\u2019m still not,\u201d he confesses), as comfortable dissecting the minutiae of production as he is unpacking the broader, sociological reasons behind certain cultural shifts. While his debut loosely explored romance, RYC wrestles with his generation\u2019s emotional crutch: nostalgia. \u201cI think it must be some sort of reptile brain thing where it\u2019s like: \u2018Well, if I try and remember a good time, maybe that means there will be another one,\u2019\u201d he says. It\u2019s a soothing balm he\u2019s used to ease his own anxiety. \u201cEveryone does it whether they know they do, or like that they do it.\u201d As if to prove how far album two has drifted from the nonchalant bops of his debut, RYC also explores hauntology, the nostalgia-adjacent idea that culture is stuck in a haunting loop of self-reference. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/diplo\">Diplo</a> he is not, basically.</p> <p>Born in the \u201cmysterious solitude\u201d of Guernsey, Crossan was initially keen to become a lawyer or a journalist, \u201cbecause I like wordy technicalities and details\u201d. Growing up he spent most of his time with his two brothers, playing video games (the name Mura Masa is taken from an old Japanese folklore tale he\u2019d seen in a game) and skateboarding. A talented musician, he also ended up in various groups, dabbling in folk, punk and metal before playing bass in a wedding band. Prior to that he was in a \u201cvery new age-y\u201d church band, like his father before him. (\u201c[I was] later to fall away from the church,\u201d he says solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big part of my life anymore.\u201d) At the age of 15, inspired by the burgeoning trap scene, he started producing his own music. While he wouldn\u2019t say he was itching to escape Guernsey and absorb the \u201cworries of the mainland\u201d, he decided to go to university in Sussex, more on a whim than with any concrete ambitions. By the time he\u2019d dropped out at the end of his first year he had a manager and record deal, with early tracks such as Lotus Eater picking up significant radio play.</p> <p>Even in those early days Crossan knew what he wanted. When it was mooted that his 2015 instrumental track Lovesick Fuck should be re-released with a guest vocalist he offered his new major label three options. \u201cI was like: \u2018I want Rihanna, I want [A$AP] Rocky or I want Childish Gambino, and if it\u2019s none of those I don\u2019t want to do it,\u2019\u201d he laughs. He got his way: a version with A$AP Rocky, released in late 2016 as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJM4AQSbZDk\">Love$ick</a>, went on to be nominated for an Ivor Novello songwriting award.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJM4AQSbZDk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZJM4AQSbZDk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The success of his debut led to production work with everyone from Stormzy to Chic to BTS, with the idea being the extracurricular stuff would run concurrently with the artist project.

      "bodyText": "In a cramped south London rehearsal space, producer Mura Masa, AKA Alex Crossan, is quietly losing the plot. Takeaway boxes and empty bottles rest on crates full of wires, while a small rug added for ambience is covered in upended cardboard boxes. Heat, meanwhile, is provided by two whirring laptops, their screens full of chunky colour bars representing something technical Crossan doesn\u2019t even attempt to explain. The 23-year-old only got back from Asia yesterday, marking the end of a tour in support of 2017\u2019s Grammy-nominated, self-titled debut, which saw him collaborate with A$AP Rocky, Damon Albarn and Christine and the Queens. Now he\u2019s got to figure out how to play his forthcoming new album RYC (Raw Youth Collage) with a full band, hence the place looking like an unmanned stockroom. While that sun-dappled first album poked and prodded at the pop zeitgeist, fusing tropical house and trap while joining the dots between Disclosure and Jamie xx, its grungier follow-up offers a sonic volte face. Out go the uplifting bangers and in come dense guitars \u2013 fuelled by his childhood obsessions with bands such as Joy Division, Talking Heads and Blur \u2013 and a lyrical heaviness that reflects, well, 2020. \u201c[My debut] was about pop music, essentially, but trying to come at it from an oblique angle,\u201d Crossan says, perched precariously on a cardboard box. \u201cI think in the past five years that grand obelisk of \u2018pop music\u2019 has been destroyed, because as the next generation come in they\u2019re really not interested in genres. Anything can become pop.\u201d He also sees the lyrical themes of this new, looser kind of \u201cpop\u201d shifting, too. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real appetite for vulnerability and emotional transparency. We\u2019ve had a good decade of \u2018Put your hands in the air like you just don\u2019t care\u2019 and people are like: \u2018This isn\u2019t reflective of what\u2019s happening geopolitically any more.\u2019\u201d He smiles knowingly at that last bit. \u201cThey want something that connects to the world they\u2019re living in, and I think there\u2019s something about the guitar that\u2019s really expressive.\u201d RYC, which features Slowthai on the punk-y rumble of Deal Wiv It and US singer Clairo on the blown-out psychedelia of lead single I Don\u2019t Think I Can Do This Again, bristles with a sort of manic energy you wouldn\u2019t necessarily associate with Crossan\u2019s quietly studious approach to music-making. He\u2019s the quintessential nerd (\u201cI was never cool and I\u2019m still not,\u201d he confesses), as comfortable dissecting the minutiae of production as he is unpacking the broader, sociological reasons behind certain cultural shifts. While his debut loosely explored romance, RYC wrestles with his generation\u2019s emotional crutch: nostalgia. \u201cI think it must be some sort of reptile brain thing where it\u2019s like: \u2018Well, if I try and remember a good time, maybe that means there will be another one,\u2019\u201d he says. It\u2019s a soothing balm he\u2019s used to ease his own anxiety. \u201cEveryone does it whether they know they do, or like that they do it.\u201d As if to prove how far album two has drifted from the nonchalant bops of his debut, RYC also explores hauntology, the nostalgia-adjacent idea that culture is stuck in a haunting loop of self-reference. Diplo he is not, basically. Born in the \u201cmysterious solitude\u201d of Guernsey, Crossan was initially keen to become a lawyer or a journalist, \u201cbecause I like wordy technicalities and details\u201d. Growing up he spent most of his time with his two brothers, playing video games (the name Mura Masa is taken from an old Japanese folklore tale he\u2019d seen in a game) and skateboarding. A talented musician, he also ended up in various groups, dabbling in folk, punk and metal before playing bass in a wedding band. Prior to that he was in a \u201cvery new age-y\u201d church band, like his father before him. (\u201c[I was] later to fall away from the church,\u201d he says solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big part of my life anymore.\u201d) At the age of 15, inspired by the burgeoning trap scene, he started producing his own music. While he wouldn\u2019t say he was itching to escape Guernsey and absorb the \u201cworries of the mainland\u201d, he decided to go to university in Sussex, more on a whim than with any concrete ambitions. By the time he\u2019d dropped out at the end of his first year he had a manager and record deal, with early tracks such as Lotus Eater picking up significant radio play. Even in those early days Crossan knew what he wanted. When it was mooted that his 2015 instrumental track Lovesick Fuck should be re-released with a guest vocalist he offered his new major label three options. \u201cI was like: \u2018I want Rihanna, I want [A$AP] Rocky or I want Childish Gambino, and if it\u2019s none of those I don\u2019t want to do it,\u2019\u201d he laughs. He got his way: a version with A$AP Rocky, released in late 2016 as Love$ick, went on to be nominated for an Ivor Novello songwriting award. The success of his debut led to production work with everyone from Stormzy to Chic to BTS, with the idea being the extracurricular stuff would run concurrently with the artist project. Did he ever think of only being a producer? \u201cMaybe I\u2019m too selfish to just be a producer,\u201d he says after a pause. \u201cAlso, I feel like I have something to say that\u2019s interesting or unique. The people I looked up to were people like Justin Vernon [AKA Bon Iver] and Kevin Parker [AKA Tame Impala] \u2013 these kind of multi-instrumentalists who are the front of projects,\u201d he adds. \u201cI really like how they\u2019ve created their own worlds and then they can lend bits of that out to artists who are looking to do interesting things.\u201d While his debut was safely in the pocket of the pop sound of the time, you suspect he\u2019s revelling in going against the grain now.

Isn\u2019t there a danger, I say, playing boomer\u2019s advocate, that people aren\u2019t taking in how awful things are? That it\u2019s just about swapping funny memes? \u201cIt\u2019s a way of dealing with it,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many ways you can cope with being in dire means, and one way is humour.\u201d Unsurprisingly, he has no time for the insult his generation has been lumbered with. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being a snowflake?\u201d he says, his voice tweaking for the first time. \u201cI think if you\u2019re calling someone a snowflake that just means you\u2019ve been upset by something they\u2019re saying.

      "body": "<p>I don\u2019t know when I first heard my grandfather\u2019s story. But I do remember the little green book with the white cross on it. The book was kept in a black steel cabinet in our living room, one that was usually locked, its contents mysterious. There must be important things in there, I thought, that were not for me to see.</p> <p>My paternal grandparents were part of my childhood; my sister and I called them Oma and Opa and paid them regular visits, but we knew very little about our mother\u2019s parents. They were long dead: my grandmother in 1972, my grandfather in 1979, six years before my birth. The only proof of their existence was a faded black-and-white photo embedded in a glass hemisphere, which my mother kept on her bedside table. In the picture, my grandmother is wearing a high-necked dress and a pearl necklace, and my grandfather a suit and tie, their faces radiating severity. They looked, to my child\u2019s eyes, the way I imagined people from the olden days did; they were from a different world, a different time. I knew my grandmother had been a nurse, and my grandfather a pharmacist, and that they had run a retirement home together near Bremen in Germany. We never visited their grave.</p> <p>For as long as I can remember, I have felt a weight resting on me; a sadness that has always been part of me, but also feels as if it doesn\u2019t belong to me. I am not the only member of my generation of the family to feel this way: one relative remembers having a recurring nightmare, even as a small child, in which all the people around her are shot. She pretends to be dead and is the sole survivor. And while there has been plenty of trauma in the two branches of the family \u2013 war, forced expulsion from East Prussia, violence \u2013 one story overshadows everything else: a 12-fold murder.</p> <p>On the night of 20 November 1945, my maternal grandfather\u2019s entire family, including his four children, were killed on their farm in Blockland, on the outskirts of Bremen. My severely injured grandfather was the only survivor. Years later, he started a second family, from which I am descended. The killings went down in history as the \u201cBlockland murders\u201d and were the subject of detailed press coverage at the time, and again in the 1960s, when a number of those involved were pardoned. My grandfather documented the events of that night in the little green book, but he never talked to my mother and his other children about it. The more the murder was reported, the greater the silence within the family. None of my grandfather\u2019s four children remembers when and how they found out about his first, murdered family. No one talked about it at home, and they never asked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77a7a93c5d2e6591ede2546f35bbde2fb261d58f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77a7a93c5d2e6591ede2546f35bbde2fb261d58f/372_915_4591_2755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lilli Heinemann\u2019s grandparents in a paperweight kept beside her mother\u2019s bed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heinemann\u2019s grandparents in a paperweight kept beside her mother\u2019s bed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eva Tuerbl/The Guardian, courtesy of Lilli Heinemann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In my 20s, I studied fashion design in Berlin and then moved to London. I met people I still count among my closest friends, and found love. But, time and again, I was overcome by fear and panic. Shortly before my 30th birthday, in an attempt to understand why I felt that way, I decided to look back at my family\u2019s past. I wanted to find out if it was possible for trauma to be passed across two generations; if the source of my inexplicable fear dates back to the night of 20 November 1945.</p> <p>I knew I was breaking decades of silence within the family. I read my grandfather\u2019s little green book, published in the 1960s and titled Forgiveness Not Vengeance; over its 40 pages, he describes in detail what happened that night. I talked to my mother and her three siblings, some of whom I hadn\u2019t seen since I was a child. I met a good friend of my grandfather, and one of my grandmother\u2019s sisters who I had never met. I spent days in the Bremen state archive, reading files, trawling through newspaper articles and learning the details of the brutal murders. For me, the most astounding thing was that my grandfather had forgiven the murderers and, in some cases, appealed for their life sentences to be commuted. </p> <p>How do you learn to forgive a loss so catastrophic?</p> <p>***</p> <p>In late 1945 my grandfather, Wilhelm Hamelmann, then 43, was living with his family in the remote neighbourhood of Blockland. The flat, waterlogged land was drained by ditches and canals, and the farms were set far apart. On the evening of 20 November, my grandfather and the other residents of the farm were at home: his parents-in-law, Wilhelm and Meta Flothmeier; his parents, Heinrich and Berta Hamelmann; his wife, Margaret; their four children, Ruth, Martha, Lieschen and Willi; a visitor by the name of Beta Gerdes; the maid, Meta Howald; and the farmhand, Fritz Heitmann \u2013 13 people in all. They spent the evening together and went to bed around 10.</p> <p>Shortly before midnight \u2013 as my grandfather recounted at the trial, and later in his book \u2013 they were woken by loud noises. My grandfather got up and went into the hall, where he was approached by a group of armed men, former forced labourers from Poland. The intruders were led by a man who spoke good German; he pointed his gun at my grandfather and forced him to fetch everyone in the house. They were locked in a bedroom, under guard. The men cut the telephone line, blacked out the windows with pillows and rummaged through cupboards, drawers and chests, stealing clothing, valuables and jewellery, heaping up their spoils. Then the ringleader ordered my grandfather and the others down to the cellar.</p> <p>In the cramped room, the ceiling was too low for an adult to stand upright, so they knelt on the damp floor. The ringleader and three accomplices followed them in and ordered my grandfather to swear he wouldn\u2019t report them to the police. He declared he had no intention of reporting them. The leader loaded his gun and handed out bullets to one of the other men, who slid them into the magazine of his pistol. The ringleader stepped up to my grandfather and fired. The shot missed my grandfather\u2019s head but hit him in the chest, entering his lung; he slumped to the ground. Everyone else was shot dead. In the subsequent trial, the number of shooters was not made clear, but it must have been at least two \u2013 the police found bullets of two different calibres. My grandfather, lying on the ground, was also hit in his left foot, his right arm and his buttocks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"45d37c576c31020a0c84fe0c70b4109febc80353\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d37c576c31020a0c84fe0c70b4109febc80353/0_707_6132_3679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lilli Heinemann shot in Berlin for Guardian Weekend magazine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lilli Heinemann: \u2018How do you learn to forgive a loss so catastrophic?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eva Tuerbl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After firing the last shot, the men switched off the light and left the cellar. Their leader returned three times to make sure no one was moving. The last time, he walked up to my grandfather, lifted up his uninjured right leg, pulled off the shoe and threw the leg back down on the floor. He did the same with the left leg, which was bleeding heavily from the foot. Despite the pain, my grandfather played dead until the attackers left the farm. Then, using his unharmed left arm and right leg, he crawled in the dark over the corpses of his family, up into the living room. Somehow, he managed to reach a neighbouring farm, 2km away, on a child\u2019s bicycle \u2013 the only means of transport the men hadn\u2019t taken. Once there, he called the police and was taken to the hospital in Bremen, where he spent the next three months recovering.</p> <p>The photographs I found at the Bremen state archive in the summer of 2018 must have been taken shortly after the police arrived at the scene. I flicked through a file containing police reports and medical certificates. An envelope was stuck to the back of one autopsy report. I opened it, unsuspecting and unprepared, and took out three black-and-white photos that shocked me to the core. I couldn\u2019t look, and I couldn\u2019t look away. They showed the view into the cellar on the night of the murder, from three different angles. The lifeless human bodies were packed close, curled up, blood flowing from their mouths and noses and dried on their faces, nightshirts soaked in the stuff. Beside them were provisions \u2013 jars and pots of preserves, egg boxes, potatoes. I looked at the pictures knowing that if these people hadn\u2019t died, I wouldn\u2019t be alive today.</p> <p>When I began my research I was unprepared, almost naive. I hadn\u2019t realised it would lead to sleepless nights spent crying, not understanding why I felt so sad about the deaths of people I never knew.</p> <p>***</p> <p>My grandfather was a deeply religious man. Besides working as a pharmacist, he was on the governing board of a church in Bremen. During the second world war, the community was part of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Confessing-Church\" title=\"\">Confessing Church</a>, an opposition movement that stood against the Nazi regime from 1934 onwards, resisting the alignment of Protestantism with National Socialism.</p> <p>A guiding principle of his faith was the commandment to love thy neighbour. A good friend of his \u2013 a much younger man who met him while working for the church \u2013 described him to me with a mixture of respect and admiration. \u201cHe was a crystal-clear thinker. He didn\u2019t talk much, but what he did say had weight to it. I learned from him that you have to live with people\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 you can and must help them to bear them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His second family, like his first, had three girls and a\u00a0boy. Three were given the same names as his dead children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his book, my grandfather describes how he prayed on the night of the murder, and was granted peace and strength. He details his thoughts as he left the cellar: \u201cWhat kind of God allows such a thing to happen? How can you reconcile this with \u2018love thy enemies\u2019? When people have caused you immeasurable suffering, you have to demand vengeance.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt became immediately apparent to me that the enemy had struck at my sense of reason, and if I were to lose this battle, my whole self would be lost.\u201d And then something that many will find incomprehensible: \u201cThe Lord granted me love directly \u2013 His love \u2013 for these poor people seduced by Satan\u2026 His mercy was my mercy. His forgiveness was my forgiveness.\u201d</p> <p>The ringleader of the intruders, Zygmunt, whose surname I have been unable to find, fled that night and was never caught. Some years after the trial, my grandfather learned where he was living but never followed it up. \u201cI don\u2019t need to pursue him,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have entrusted that poor man to my Lord. Let Him grant him mercy, that he may deliver his heart to God.\u201d</p> <p>My grandfather\u2019s forgiveness may have been grounded in his faith, but it was also political. He saw the crime in the context of its time, understood that the young men, who had been brought to Germany and exploited as forced labourers, had experienced terrible things themselves. In an April 1967 newspaper article, my grandfather was quoted as saying: \u201cThese people had lived through difficult experiences that had filled them with hate\u2026 The leader of the gang had lost his parents in the war. The SS had shot them dead in Poland.\u201d</p> <p>Why the robbery ended in mass murder remains a mystery. The intruders had no relationship with my grandfather and his family. One of the men later said in court that he had asked Zygmunt what had happened in the cellar; he had answered \u201cthat he had finally got revenge for his family\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bbe028e9fcb513023b191a57e821f2fbb6f2c7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bbe028e9fcb513023b191a57e821f2fbb6f2c7e/0_26_2668_1965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hamelmann with a newspaper article showing the suspects in the dock in 1946.

The next day, they were presented to my grandfather, critically injured in his hospital bed. He thought he recognised them as the men from the night of the murder. The authorities, mindful of public opinion, wanted swift arrests. That they were satisfied with the hand gestures of a severely injured and traumatised victim suggests they had already decided who they wanted to see in court.</p> <p>On 1 December 1945, the victims\u2019 funeral took place at Wasserhorst cemetery in Blockland \u2013 without my grandfather, who couldn\u2019t leave his sickbed. He asked for his words to be read aloud: \u201cOur house was always a house of love, where the lowest found respect and the poorest found help. This shall continue to be my lodestar. Now is an especially apt time for people to begin again to appreciate and do good to one another.\u201d</p> <p>The trial began several months later. In his book, my grandfather wrote that, the day before, the public prosecutor told him he would be seeking the death penalty for all eight men. My grandfather asked him to do so only for the ringleader and the men who carried out the shootings, and to demand lesser penalties for the others.</p> <p>After only three days, the judges passed sentence. The ringleader, Zygmunt, convicted in absentia, and four other men were condemned to death by firing squad. A further three received life sentences. Another was given 40 years in prison. A ninth man was arrested in Munich several months later and also sentenced to life imprisonment. The court files have been lost, so we cannot know the reasons for the different sentences. Although the murder weapons were never discovered, there was other incriminating evidence, including the fingerprints of two suspects. My grandfather could identify five defendants in court, and there were partial confessions. However, none of the suspects admitted to the murders. The four condemned men were executed on a former firing range on 13 July 1946.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ace5cea1d8d5861829cd5e4777145ecc8ee077f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ace5cea1d8d5861829cd5e4777145ecc8ee077f7/0_316_2171_2565/846.jpg\" alt=\"Article published in Hamburger Abendblatt, 1967, showing Wilhelm Hamelmann visiting prisoners who were part of the robbery in 1945 in which 12 members of his family were murdered\" width=\"846\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1967 article about Hamelmann visiting two of the convicted men in prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Lilli Heinemann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My grandfather met my grandmother in hospital, where she had been caring for him as a nurse. With accommodation scarce after the war, they had no alternative but to move back into the Blockland farm. They started a family and had four children. As with my grandfather\u2019s first family, there were three girls and one boy. The first three were given the same names as the dead children: Ruth, Elisabeth and Wilhelm. My mother was not named after the fourth murdered child. She was born much later, on 20 November 1958, the anniversary of the killings.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It has been two years since my mother and I began talking about that night and its legacy. In our first conversation, she tells me that everyone in the family suffered: the case was so widely known in the 60s that reporters doorstepped the family home. When I tell her I intend to publish my research, she says it is no one else\u2019s business. We talk more over the next few months, and gradually she begins to understand.</p> <p>In one of our conversations, she recalls that pictures of her father\u2019s first family were set up on the piano on her birthday. \u201cAt some point I wondered why. But I never asked out loud,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was an unspoken weight hanging over the household. I don\u2019t know if it was only at that time of year, or if it was always there.\u201d</p> <p>In 1967, more than 20 years after the murders, my grandfather discovered that a journalist had spoken to three inmates of Hamburg-Fuhlsb\u00fcttel prison, Czeslaw Godlewski, Michael Strocki and Marjan Oboza. They were three of the men sentenced to life imprisonment, having been found guilty of taking part in the robbery but not the shooting. The men\u2019s appeals for clemency had been repeatedly denied; a pardon was dependent on the men returning to Poland, but their home country refused to take them.</p> <p>My grandfather decided to visit the prisoners. On 8 April 1967, he wrote, he was received by the prison director, and spoke to Godlewski and Oboza. The third inmate, Strocki, refused to talk, saying he had no interest in a pardon. The two men were brought to see my grandfather in a visiting room, one at a time. Godlewski was defensive, certain my grandfather wouldn\u2019t be able to help him. Oboza didn\u2019t understand why my grandfather was visiting him, and said he\u2019d had sleepless nights. A few weeks later, my grandfather returned to the prison.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unprocessed trauma is passed on to the next generation, revealing itself in their dreams, feelings and behaviour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a letter dated 29 April 1967, which I found in the Bremen state archive, my grandfather wrote to the US ambassador, requesting that the two men be pardoned: \u201cI have now visited Godlewski in Fuhlsb\u00fcttel penitentiary and told him I have forgiven him. Should he be pardoned, I hope to take him in and employ him as a janitor in a private old people\u2019s home that I own\u2026 As the man most affected by the attack, I ask you, Your Excellency, for mercy for a man who did wrong in the confusion of an unprecedented time and who regrets. He has served 21 years. That is a very long time\u2026 Hate will only ever sow hate, and therefore it is time to stop hating once and for all.\u201d</p> <p>His appeals were heard. In December 1968, Oboza was released on probation and housed in Bielefeld, where my grandfather visited him several times. Godlewski was also pardoned in March 1969, and initially taken to a home near Hagen. My grandfather did take him in, at the retirement home he ran with my grandmother; but before long, constant anonymous threats forced him to move Godlewski to an undisclosed location.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In 2018, I make two visits to my aunt in her house outside Bremen. We lost touch when I was a teenager, as by then she and my mother had little contact. My aunt is in her early 70s, cautious and composed. She and my other aunt took over the retirement home after their parents\u2019 death; my cousin is now in charge. Sitting together in her garden, I mention my research and ask for her help. We spread out all the newspaper articles and photos on a table. It feels strange to question my aunt in this way, but she is friendly and tries to answer as well as she can. She can\u2019t tell me when she found out about the murders, or describe how they have affected her life.</p> <p>But she does remember meeting Godlewski, who had been 23 when he committed the crime. At the time, she was a young adult working in her parents\u2019 retirement home. They didn\u2019t talk much, but he seemed reserved and friendly. More difficult than meeting Godlewski, she says, was the \u201cterrible time\u201d when journalists were writing about her father, the telephone ringing every day, and the family heckled on the street by strangers.</p> <p>My aunt says the family stood by my grandfather\u2019s decision; they knew that \u201cforgiveness, not vengeance\u201d were more than just words for him. She hands me a yellowed file labelled \u201cBlockland correspondence\u201d, in which my grandfather kept the many letters he received in response to his forgiveness. Many are long, handwritten missives full of admiration and appreciation. Others testify to a lack of understanding: \u201cYour intention has <em>nothing</em> to do with Christianity. It is incomprehensible to everyone. Did you ever think of those cruelly murdered? How can you do this to your poor children?\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>More than 70 years have passed since the murders. Everyone I speak to in my family is willing to talk, but I get a sense that they would prefer to let the subject lie. Time and again I hear: \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about it\u201d and, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we leave the past in peace?\u201d I ask them about the story\u2019s significance in their own lives. They look at me in surprise, as if they\u2019ve never thought about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"33a04844177534794f19ba872541e8b0735e3b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33a04844177534794f19ba872541e8b0735e3b5f/1795_926_1549_2413/642.jpg\" alt=\"Wilhelm Hamelmann\u2019s book about the murders of his family and his forgiveness, published by a Christian publishing house in the 1960s\" width=\"642\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamelmann\u2019s book about the murders</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eva Tuerbl/The Guardian, courtesy of Lilli Heinemann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I travel to Hamburg to meet the psychologist Sandra Konrad and ask her about what Sigmund Freud referred to as \u201cemotional inheritance\u201d. One of Konrad\u2019s specialist areas is the way trauma is passed down through multiple generations. She explains that the transmission of trauma can take place on different levels: via genetics, our ties to our parents, the atmosphere in which we grow up, the stories that are told, and the stories that are left untold. Anything shrouded in silence occupies a particularly significant space. She explains that the core of a trauma lies in the inability to process terrible experiences, to overcome them by grieving, and to integrate them into our own stories. Unprocessed trauma is then passed on to the next generation, revealing itself in their dreams, feelings and behaviour.</p> <p>I can\u2019t say whether my anxiety \u2013 fears I can now live with \u2013 can be traced back to my grandfather\u2019s experiences, other family traumas or my own experiences. But what I do recognise is that his story is part of me, just as other family stories are. Having disentangled this secret, I now have the ability to process it.</p> <p>Of all my family members, I am the most distant from the event, and yet I know the most about it. Perhaps I can only dig into it because of that distance; because it\u2019s less painful for me. Or it might be that my wish to offload this inherited burden is greater. Even as I write, I notice the weight of it becoming lighter, less threatening.</p> <p>Many of my questions remain unanswered. I admire my grandfather for forgiving, but I still don\u2019t understand how he was able to. It may be that forgiveness was a survival strategy for him, the only way he could go on living. But where was his anger? Where was his pain? And what does his refusal to permit himself these feelings mean for me?</p> <p>While I may never fully understand this, I have got to know my late grandfather in other ways. I\u2019m told he was popular everywhere, a role model for many \u2013 always cheerful, slightly chaotic and \u201ccrazy about cars\u201d, a man who loved to drive his <a href=\"https://www.borgward.com/company/history/\" title=\"\">Borgward Isabella</a> far too fast.

      "bodyText": "I don\u2019t know when I first heard my grandfather\u2019s story. But I do remember the little green book with the white cross on it. The book was kept in a black steel cabinet in our living room, one that was usually locked, its contents mysterious. There must be important things in there, I thought, that were not for me to see. My paternal grandparents were part of my childhood; my sister and I called them Oma and Opa and paid them regular visits, but we knew very little about our mother\u2019s parents. They were long dead: my grandmother in 1972, my grandfather in 1979, six years before my birth. The only proof of their existence was a faded black-and-white photo embedded in a glass hemisphere, which my mother kept on her bedside table. In the picture, my grandmother is wearing a high-necked dress and a pearl necklace, and my grandfather a suit and tie, their faces radiating severity. They looked, to my child\u2019s eyes, the way I imagined people from the olden days did; they were from a different world, a different time. I knew my grandmother had been a nurse, and my grandfather a pharmacist, and that they had run a retirement home together near Bremen in Germany. We never visited their grave. For as long as I can remember, I have felt a weight resting on me; a sadness that has always been part of me, but also feels as if it doesn\u2019t belong to me. I am not the only member of my generation of the family to feel this way: one relative remembers having a recurring nightmare, even as a small child, in which all the people around her are shot. She pretends to be dead and is the sole survivor. And while there has been plenty of trauma in the two branches of the family \u2013 war, forced expulsion from East Prussia, violence \u2013 one story overshadows everything else: a 12-fold murder. On the night of 20 November 1945, my maternal grandfather\u2019s entire family, including his four children, were killed on their farm in Blockland, on the outskirts of Bremen. My severely injured grandfather was the only survivor. Years later, he started a second family, from which I am descended. The killings went down in history as the \u201cBlockland murders\u201d and were the subject of detailed press coverage at the time, and again in the 1960s, when a number of those involved were pardoned. My grandfather documented the events of that night in the little green book, but he never talked to my mother and his other children about it. The more the murder was reported, the greater the silence within the family. None of my grandfather\u2019s four children remembers when and how they found out about his first, murdered family. No one talked about it at home, and they never asked. In my 20s, I studied fashion design in Berlin and then moved to London. I met people I still count among my closest friends, and found love. But, time and again, I was overcome by fear and panic. Shortly before my 30th birthday, in an attempt to understand why I felt that way, I decided to look back at my family\u2019s past. I wanted to find out if it was possible for trauma to be passed across two generations; if the source of my inexplicable fear dates back to the night of 20 November 1945. I knew I was breaking decades of silence within the family. I read my grandfather\u2019s little green book, published in the 1960s and titled Forgiveness Not Vengeance; over its 40 pages, he describes in detail what happened that night. I talked to my mother and her three siblings, some of whom I hadn\u2019t seen since I was a child. I met a good friend of my grandfather, and one of my grandmother\u2019s sisters who I had never met. I spent days in the Bremen state archive, reading files, trawling through newspaper articles and learning the details of the brutal murders. For me, the most astounding thing was that my grandfather had forgiven the murderers and, in some cases, appealed for their life sentences to be commuted. How do you learn to forgive a loss so catastrophic? *** In late 1945 my grandfather, Wilhelm Hamelmann, then 43, was living with his family in the remote neighbourhood of Blockland. The flat, waterlogged land was drained by ditches and canals, and the farms were set far apart. On the evening of 20 November, my grandfather and the other residents of the farm were at home: his parents-in-law, Wilhelm and Meta Flothmeier; his parents, Heinrich and Berta Hamelmann; his wife, Margaret; their four children, Ruth, Martha, Lieschen and Willi; a visitor by the name of Beta Gerdes; the maid, Meta Howald; and the farmhand, Fritz Heitmann \u2013 13 people in all. They spent the evening together and went to bed around 10. Shortly before midnight \u2013 as my grandfather recounted at the trial, and later in his book \u2013 they were woken by loud noises. My grandfather got up and went into the hall, where he was approached by a group of armed men, former forced labourers from Poland. The intruders were led by a man who spoke good German; he pointed his gun at my grandfather and forced him to fetch everyone in the house. They were locked in a bedroom, under guard. The men cut the telephone line, blacked out the windows with pillows and rummaged through cupboards, drawers and chests, stealing clothing, valuables and jewellery, heaping up their spoils. Then the ringleader ordered my grandfather and the others down to the cellar. In the cramped room, the ceiling was too low for an adult to stand upright, so they knelt on the damp floor. The ringleader and three accomplices followed them in and ordered my grandfather to swear he wouldn\u2019t report them to the police. He declared he had no intention of reporting them. The leader loaded his gun and handed out bullets to one of the other men, who slid them into the magazine of his pistol. The ringleader stepped up to my grandfather and fired. The shot missed my grandfather\u2019s head but hit him in the chest, entering his lung; he slumped to the ground. Everyone else was shot dead. In the subsequent trial, the number of shooters was not made clear, but it must have been at least two \u2013 the police found bullets of two different calibres. My grandfather, lying on the ground, was also hit in his left foot, his right arm and his buttocks. After firing the last shot, the men switched off the light and left the cellar. Their leader returned three times to make sure no one was moving. The last time, he walked up to my grandfather, lifted up his uninjured right leg, pulled off the shoe and threw the leg back down on the floor. He did the same with the left leg, which was bleeding heavily from the foot. Despite the pain, my grandfather played dead until the attackers left the farm. Then, using his unharmed left arm and right leg, he crawled in the dark over the corpses of his family, up into the living room. Somehow, he managed to reach a neighbouring farm, 2km away, on a child\u2019s bicycle \u2013 the only means of transport the men hadn\u2019t taken. Once there, he called the police and was taken to the hospital in Bremen, where he spent the next three months recovering. The photographs I found at the Bremen state archive in the summer of 2018 must have been taken shortly after the police arrived at the scene. I flicked through a file containing police reports and medical certificates. An envelope was stuck to the back of one autopsy report. I opened it, unsuspecting and unprepared, and took out three black-and-white photos that shocked me to the core. I couldn\u2019t look, and I couldn\u2019t look away. They showed the view into the cellar on the night of the murder, from three different angles. The lifeless human bodies were packed close, curled up, blood flowing from their mouths and noses and dried on their faces, nightshirts soaked in the stuff. Beside them were provisions \u2013 jars and pots of preserves, egg boxes, potatoes. I looked at the pictures knowing that if these people hadn\u2019t died, I wouldn\u2019t be alive today. When I began my research I was unprepared, almost naive. I hadn\u2019t realised it would lead to sleepless nights spent crying, not understanding why I felt so sad about the deaths of people I never knew. *** My grandfather was a deeply religious man. Besides working as a pharmacist, he was on the governing board of a church in Bremen. During the second world war, the community was part of the Confessing Church, an opposition movement that stood against the Nazi regime from 1934 onwards, resisting the alignment of Protestantism with National Socialism. A guiding principle of his faith was the commandment to love thy neighbour. A good friend of his \u2013 a much younger man who met him while working for the church \u2013 described him to me with a mixture of respect and admiration. \u201cHe was a crystal-clear thinker. He didn\u2019t talk much, but what he did say had weight to it. I learned from him that you have to live with people\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 you can and must help them to bear them.\u201d In his book, my grandfather describes how he prayed on the night of the murder, and was granted peace and strength. He details his thoughts as he left the cellar: \u201cWhat kind of God allows such a thing to happen? How can you reconcile this with \u2018love thy enemies\u2019? When people have caused you immeasurable suffering, you have to demand vengeance.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt became immediately apparent to me that the enemy had struck at my sense of reason, and if I were to lose this battle, my whole self would be lost.\u201d And then something that many will find incomprehensible: \u201cThe Lord granted me love directly \u2013 His love \u2013 for these poor people seduced by Satan\u2026 His mercy was my mercy. His forgiveness was my forgiveness.\u201d The ringleader of the intruders, Zygmunt, whose surname I have been unable to find, fled that night and was never caught. Some years after the trial, my grandfather learned where he was living but never followed it up. \u201cI don\u2019t need to pursue him,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have entrusted that poor man to my Lord. Let Him grant him mercy, that he may deliver his heart to God.\u201d My grandfather\u2019s forgiveness may have been grounded in his faith, but it was also political. He saw the crime in the context of its time, understood that the young men, who had been brought to Germany and exploited as forced labourers, had experienced terrible things themselves. In an April 1967 newspaper article, my grandfather was quoted as saying: \u201cThese people had lived through difficult experiences that had filled them with hate\u2026 The leader of the gang had lost his parents in the war. The SS had shot them dead in Poland.\u201d Why the robbery ended in mass murder remains a mystery. The intruders had no relationship with my grandfather and his family. One of the men later said in court that he had asked Zygmunt what had happened in the cellar; he had answered \u201cthat he had finally got revenge for his family\u201d. Eight of the 10 suspects, all young men in their early 20s, were arrested in the Tirpitz displaced persons camp in Bremen-Gr\u00f6pelingen and handed over to a US military tribunal (at the time, Bremen was part of the US occupied zone). The next day, they were presented to my grandfather, critically injured in his hospital bed. He thought he recognised them as the men from the night of the murder. The authorities, mindful of public opinion, wanted swift arrests. That they were satisfied with the hand gestures of a severely injured and traumatised victim suggests they had already decided who they wanted to see in court. On 1 December 1945, the victims\u2019 funeral took place at Wasserhorst cemetery in Blockland \u2013 without my grandfather, who couldn\u2019t leave his sickbed. He asked for his words to be read aloud: \u201cOur house was always a house of love, where the lowest found respect and the poorest found help. This shall continue to be my lodestar. Now is an especially apt time for people to begin again to appreciate and do good to one another.\u201d The trial began several months later. In his book, my grandfather wrote that, the day before, the public prosecutor told him he would be seeking the death penalty for all eight men. My grandfather asked him to do so only for the ringleader and the men who carried out the shootings, and to demand lesser penalties for the others. After only three days, the judges passed sentence. The ringleader, Zygmunt, convicted in absentia, and four other men were condemned to death by firing squad. A further three received life sentences. Another was given 40 years in prison. A ninth man was arrested in Munich several months later and also sentenced to life imprisonment. The court files have been lost, so we cannot know the reasons for the different sentences. Although the murder weapons were never discovered, there was other incriminating evidence, including the fingerprints of two suspects. My grandfather could identify five defendants in court, and there were partial confessions. However, none of the suspects admitted to the murders. The four condemned men were executed on a former firing range on 13 July 1946. My grandfather met my grandmother in hospital, where she had been caring for him as a nurse. With accommodation scarce after the war, they had no alternative but to move back into the Blockland farm. They started a family and had four children. As with my grandfather\u2019s first family, there were three girls and one boy. The first three were given the same names as the dead children: Ruth, Elisabeth and Wilhelm. My mother was not named after the fourth murdered child. She was born much later, on 20 November 1958, the anniversary of the killings. *** It has been two years since my mother and I began talking about that night and its legacy. In our first conversation, she tells me that everyone in the family suffered: the case was so widely known in the 60s that reporters doorstepped the family home. When I tell her I intend to publish my research, she says it is no one else\u2019s business. We talk more over the next few months, and gradually she begins to understand. In one of our conversations, she recalls that pictures of her father\u2019s first family were set up on the piano on her birthday. \u201cAt some point I wondered why. But I never asked out loud,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was an unspoken weight hanging over the household. I don\u2019t know if it was only at that time of year, or if it was always there.\u201d In 1967, more than 20 years after the murders, my grandfather discovered that a journalist had spoken to three inmates of Hamburg-Fuhlsb\u00fcttel prison, Czeslaw Godlewski, Michael Strocki and Marjan Oboza. They were three of the men sentenced to life imprisonment, having been found guilty of taking part in the robbery but not the shooting. The men\u2019s appeals for clemency had been repeatedly denied; a pardon was dependent on the men returning to Poland, but their home country refused to take them. My grandfather decided to visit the prisoners. On 8 April 1967, he wrote, he was received by the prison director, and spoke to Godlewski and Oboza. The third inmate, Strocki, refused to talk, saying he had no interest in a pardon. The two men were brought to see my grandfather in a visiting room, one at a time. Godlewski was defensive, certain my grandfather wouldn\u2019t be able to help him. Oboza didn\u2019t understand why my grandfather was visiting him, and said he\u2019d had sleepless nights. A few weeks later, my grandfather returned to the prison. In a letter dated 29 April 1967, which I found in the Bremen state archive, my grandfather wrote to the US ambassador, requesting that the two men be pardoned: \u201cI have now visited Godlewski in Fuhlsb\u00fcttel penitentiary and told him I have forgiven him. Should he be pardoned, I hope to take him in and employ him as a janitor in a private old people\u2019s home that I own\u2026 As the man most affected by the attack, I ask you, Your Excellency, for mercy for a man who did wrong in the confusion of an unprecedented time and who regrets. He has served 21 years. That is a very long time\u2026 Hate will only ever sow hate, and therefore it is time to stop hating once and for all.\u201d His appeals were heard. In December 1968, Oboza was released on probation and housed in Bielefeld, where my grandfather visited him several times. Godlewski was also pardoned in March 1969, and initially taken to a home near Hagen. My grandfather did take him in, at the retirement home he ran with my grandmother; but before long, constant anonymous threats forced him to move Godlewski to an undisclosed location. *** In 2018, I make two visits to my aunt in her house outside Bremen. We lost touch when I was a teenager, as by then she and my mother had little contact. My aunt is in her early 70s, cautious and composed. She and my other aunt took over the retirement home after their parents\u2019 death; my cousin is now in charge. Sitting together in her garden, I mention my research and ask for her help. We spread out all the newspaper articles and photos on a table. It feels strange to question my aunt in this way, but she is friendly and tries to answer as well as she can. She can\u2019t tell me when she found out about the murders, or describe how they have affected her life. But she does remember meeting Godlewski, who had been 23 when he committed the crime. At the time, she was a young adult working in her parents\u2019 retirement home. They didn\u2019t talk much, but he seemed reserved and friendly. More difficult than meeting Godlewski, she says, was the \u201cterrible time\u201d when journalists were writing about her father, the telephone ringing every day, and the family heckled on the street by strangers. My aunt says the family stood by my grandfather\u2019s decision; they knew that \u201cforgiveness, not vengeance\u201d were more than just words for him. She hands me a yellowed file labelled \u201cBlockland correspondence\u201d, in which my grandfather kept the many letters he received in response to his forgiveness. Many are long, handwritten missives full of admiration and appreciation. Others testify to a lack of understanding: \u201cYour intention has nothing to do with Christianity. It is incomprehensible to everyone. Did you ever think of those cruelly murdered? How can you do this to your poor children?\u201d *** More than 70 years have passed since the murders. Everyone I speak to in my family is willing to talk, but I get a sense that they would prefer to let the subject lie. Time and again I hear: \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about it\u201d and, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we leave the past in peace?\u201d I ask them about the story\u2019s significance in their own lives. They look at me in surprise, as if they\u2019ve never thought about it. I travel to Hamburg to meet the psychologist Sandra Konrad and ask her about what Sigmund Freud referred to as \u201cemotional inheritance\u201d. One of Konrad\u2019s specialist areas is the way trauma is passed down through multiple generations. She explains that the transmission of trauma can take place on different levels: via genetics, our ties to our parents, the atmosphere in which we grow up, the stories that are told, and the stories that are left untold. Anything shrouded in silence occupies a particularly significant space. She explains that the core of a trauma lies in the inability to process terrible experiences, to overcome them by grieving, and to integrate them into our own stories. Unprocessed trauma is then passed on to the next generation, revealing itself in their dreams, feelings and behaviour. I can\u2019t say whether my anxiety \u2013 fears I can now live with \u2013 can be traced back to my grandfather\u2019s experiences, other family traumas or my own experiences. But what I do recognise is that his story is part of me, just as other family stories are. Having disentangled this secret, I now have the ability to process it. Of all my family members, I am the most distant from the event, and yet I know the most about it. Perhaps I can only dig into it because of that distance; because it\u2019s less painful for me. Or it might be that my wish to offload this inherited burden is greater. Even as I write, I notice the weight of it becoming lighter, less threatening. Many of my questions remain unanswered. I admire my grandfather for forgiving, but I still don\u2019t understand how he was able to. It may be that forgiveness was a survival strategy for him, the only way he could go on living. But where was his anger? Where was his pain? And what does his refusal to permit himself these feelings mean for me? While I may never fully understand this, I have got to know my late grandfather in other ways. I\u2019m told he was popular everywhere, a role model for many \u2013 always cheerful, slightly chaotic and \u201ccrazy about cars\u201d, a man who loved to drive his Borgward Isabella far too fast. In the pharmacy where he worked for many years, a painkiller was sold based on his own recipe, mixed by the whole family at the kitchen table. It is said to have been called Contra-Pain. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the stuff romcoms are made of: beautiful young woman meets charming prince and, after a series of mild miscommunications, they live happily ever after. Well, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to go at least. Meghan Markle, the much put upon protagonist of this Nora Ephron-meets-Get Out fairytale, has gone off-script and attempted to create a different happy ending, and with good reason. Everything that could have predicted the pair\u2019s joint decision to step back as senior royals can be directly traced back through all the sensationalist and derogatory headlines written about Markle. She couldn\u2019t even enjoy avocados without being framed as a drought- and murder-fuelling traitor, set on bringing down the monarchy. Harry, to his credit, has been by her side every step of the way, challenging traditions by demanding an end to the tabloids\u2019 abuse of her, which sadly had little impact. If anything, it gave the news cycle more to talk about \u2013 but his actions were nonetheless commendable. Harry has never been comfortable with his position as royalty, and as the burden of one day becoming king was on his older brother, he was given the opportunity to be more open about his world. The death of Princess Diana was something her children never truly recovered from. Growing up, Harry definitely committed his fair share of disturbing faux pas, but this week it has been hard not to root for him as a husband and father trying to protect his family from falling victim to the trauma of his own childhood. When Markle stepped out of Hollywood and into the royal family, press coverage was awash with weak platitudes of progression: we were fed the idea that her move into the institution was a sign of \u201cmodern times\u201d, and that having a mixed-race woman in the royal family was a milestone in British history. Their wedding, just a year and a half ago, featured preacher Michael Curry and a black gospel choir; the media described it as a \u201cmodern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple\u201d \u2013 one that was \u201cnudging the British royal family into a new era\u201d. News outlets speculated on everything from whether the wedding would end prejudice against mixed-race relationships, to whether it would boost business for black female entrepreneurs. But it didn\u2019t take long for the tabloid onslaught, or for Markle\u2019s mere existence to become a tokenistic rhetorical device for those who claimed our country didn\u2019t have a problem with race. How could we possibly be racist if we have a black princess? As a successful, mixed-race woman from California, Markle became the media\u2019s new punchbag, and her family weren\u2019t spared media intrusions either. The contrast in treatment towards each of her divorced parents, however, was glaring: dog-whistles for her black mother, and sympathy for her white father. In her time in the public eye, Markle\u2019s mother Doria Ragland has been a picture of dignity, yet was still the constant victim of coded racism, in the form of inaccurate references to slavery and gang violence. Meghan\u2019s father, Thomas Markle, was gifted a little more empathy by the tabloids, often portrayed as a lovable rogue disowned by his \u201cheartless\u201d daughter, even though he repeatedly betrayed and embarrassed her on the international stage. All the while, this racist and sensationalist reporting stoked tensions on social media, and bigots and trolls felt vindicated in their racism. Reflecting on the unfortunate series of events that have unfolded around Markle, there is much we can learn about the current state of racism in this country. Critics have argued that Markle knew what she was signing up for, and should have been more prepared. But the onus should not be on people of colour to swallow racism \u2013 an assertion rooted in victim-blaming culture: where the minority on the receiving end of abuse is supposed to rise above everything in order to maintain decorum, while the abusers are free to spew whatever they wish. After seeing what they had to say, I can\u2019t help but wonder if Markle, a former successful actor who was largely palatable to an overwhelmingly white media, can be harassed into stepping away from the crown, then how might the public react to someone with less privilege than her? It seems that much of Britain desperately wants to be absolved its racist history without doing any work to combat racism \u2013 treating marginalisation and discrimination like imagined annoyances not worth confronting. But looking at the fate of a royal couple that was supposed to symbolise progression and a supposedly \u201cpost-racial\u201d British society, it seems clear that there is still much work to be done. \u2022 Amna Saleem is a Glasgow-based writer",

That warning was due to fire burning down from Goldie Spur into the valley. There were four other watch-and-act alerts out for that fire, as well as two watch and act alerts in East Gippsland, for the Cann River fire, and one covering the Corryong fire.</li> <li>On the NSW side of the border, there were watch and act alerts for fires in the Snowy Mountains and the south coast, in the Wadbilliga national park.</li> <li>Visitors have been told they can return to Kangaroo Island and urged to return to the NSW south coast, where most roads have reopened.

It did not move into private land yesterday (there is not much around that area) but did burn into freehold land near Carboor, on the western edge of the fire, earlier in the week.</p> <p>Starting tomorrow night, <strong>DELWP incident controller Paul Bates </strong>said, fire crews would begin back-burning around that Demon Ridge Track area to bring the edge of the fire out to an accessible point, so firefighters can reach it and black it out. </p> <p>They have, on current forecasts, about a week to do that work.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not, in the next seven days, based on the next seven-day forecast, looking for another spike day ... so we are hoping to start backburning, if conditions are safe, on Sunday evening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T06:08:00.079Z\">at 6.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1958258f08c39722648990\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T05:22:07.420Z\">5.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019ve just spoken to <strong>Paul Bates</strong>, who is the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning incident controller for the Ovens region today. That means he is in charge of the <strong>Abbeyard fire</strong> and protecting communities like <strong>Bright </strong>and <strong>Harrietville.</strong></p> <p>He explained how they were able to reduce that fire activity yesterday, so it did not reach burn into private land. Basically: it was the helicopters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During the day we had seven helicopters bombing or dropping water on the fire. That limited fire runs ... they can\u2019t put the fire out but they can slow it down and buy us time.</p> </blockquote> <p>The helicopters were dropping water scooped from nearby dams. One larger aircraft dropped fire retardant around the Mount Buffalo Chalet, to further protect that heritage building.</p> <p>The effect of all that water bombing, Bates said, was that when the wind change came through and sent very strong south-westerly winds through the fire ground between 5pm and 8pm, pushing flames in the direction of Bright, Harrietville and surrounds, the fire did not burn as far as predicted. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were fortunate yesterday in that the predictions that we had did not come about, because we were really well-resourced with aircraft and they worked really hard all day. </p> </blockquote> <p>Then, shortly after 8pm, it rained. Not a lot \u2013 between 2mm and 5mm across the fire ground \u2013 but it was enough to further quell fire activity. If something had changed \u2013 if that fire at Wodonga had started earlier in the day and required water-bombing helicopters to be diverted, if another new fire had been sparked by lightning and required an urgent response \u2013 the more serious predictions of fire agencies could have eventuated. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If something changed ... those fires are more likely to move.</p> </blockquote> <p>The fire predictions used to decide whether evacuation warnings should be sent out are based on what the fire could do without any suppression activity. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T06:08:31.267Z\">at 6.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1957ef8f087e8308e6c613\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-11T05:07:08.074Z\">5.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nic_Asher/status/1215852570981232641\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Great Alpine Road is a very sad sight.

      "bodyText": "We will leave our coverage of the ongoing bushfire crisis here for the night. A mercifully quiet day on firegrounds across the country. Here is where things stand: Warmer temperatures and elevated winds in the afternoon caused an increase in fire activity in Victoria and southern New South Wales, but fire activity remained much less significant than it was on Friday. A NSW man is receiving treatment in hospital for serious burns sustained defending his property at Tumbarumba. Parts of Victoria received a bit of rain last night \u2013between 1mm and 5mm fell on fires in the north-east and more than 10mm fell in parts of Gippsland \u2013 but the rain did not reach fires in southern NSW, and is not enough to stop them burning. As of 8pm there was an emergency warning current for Mount Buffalo and the Buckland Valley, which were on the northern side of the 60,000ha Abbeyard fire. That warning was due to fire burning down from Goldie Spur into the valley. There were four other watch-and-act alerts out for that fire, as well as two watch and act alerts in East Gippsland, for the Cann River fire, and one covering the Corryong fire. On the NSW side of the border, there were watch and act alerts for fires in the Snowy Mountains and the south coast, in the Wadbilliga national park. Visitors have been told they can return to Kangaroo Island and urged to return to the NSW south coast, where most roads have reopened. Roads remain closed throughout East Gippsland and communities, including the seaside tourist town of Mallacoota, remain cut off. The mayor of the Alpine shire, which is under threat from the Abbeyard fire, estimates the cost to tourism in his shire alone will be $90m. Thanks for your company today, and enjoy this temporary reprieve. We still have a long summer to go. And remember \u2013 February is historically the most dangerous fire month in south-east Australia. Stay safe. We have a bit more information about the man who was burned while defending his property near Tumbarumba in New South Wales yesterday. The man was an RFS volunteer, but he was not engaged in RFS work yesterday. Instead, Guardian Australia understands, he was driving a quad bike around his own property defending against spot fires when he received burns to his leg. He was with some RFS firefighters, who radioed for an ambulance. The pilot of a water-bombing helicopter heard the call and offered to pick the man up and fly him to an ambulance. He was transferred to the burns unit at Concord Hospital in Sydney on Saturday and is receiving treatment for severe burns to his hands, legs, and elbows. Three of the four RFS volunteers who did receive injuries while fighting fires yesterday have since returned to the fire ground, and RFS spokesman said. Media warned not to ignore road closures Speaking of roads closed in Victoria, Victoria Police issued a message to all media today warning that if journalists continued to \u201cblatantly\u201d ignore traffic management points in East Gippsland, they could face charges. It recent days we have received multiple reports of journalists blatantly ignoring traffic management points in place for the East Gippsland bushfires. Not only does this increase personal safety risks for those people entering these areas, it is hindering the efforts of emergency services, taking up valuable resources, and damaging the good working relationship in place. The statement continues: As this is becoming a reoccurring issue, any further reports or instances where media are not abiding by the law and ignoring traffic management points will be investigated by local police and may be prosecuted under Section 36 of the Emergency Management Act 1986. Media who are accredited and have current CFA media training are able to access some restricted roads, but not all. Victoria Police said it understood the importance of covering bushfires, but those roads were closed for reasons of safety. (It should be added that in many cases there is nothing physically closing the road, and not all road blocks are manned.) A list of all current road closures in Victoria is available here. Emergency Victoria has just issued an emergency warning for Mount Buffalo, Buckland, Buckland Junction and surrounds. This area had been at a watch and act level since last night. The cause of the warning is a fire in Goldie Spur, which has changed direction to burn in a north-east direction down the hill into the Buckland Valley. Leaving now is the safest option, before conditions become too dangerous. Residents can use the Buckland Valley Road to head toward Porepunkah. The New South Wales deputy fire commissioner, Rob Rogers, is urging tourists to return to the south coast. Areas of Shoalhaven and the south coast have been reopened for visitors following property and road assessments. For contrast, look to Mallacoota, on the Victorian side of the border and impacted by the same fire complex. The road into Mallacoota is still closed while emergency services check and clear trees, and locals reported being told it would remain closed until some signs could be replaced. Wombat interlude Snowy Mountains fires upgraded to watch and act The RFS has reported an increase in fire in the fires at Dunns Road and the Adaminaby fire complex. Both have been upgraded to watch and act level. For the Dunns Road fire (part of the new megafire, you\u2019ll recall from earlier) fire activity is increasing south of Tumbarumba. At Adaminaby, the risk is greatest between Yaouk and Lake Ecucumbene. The Abbeyard fire is joined with an existing smallish, 1,500ha fire that was already burning on Mount Buffalo yesterday. Together those fires raced up the horn, burning trees to the highest point of the mountain. At lower elevations, the fire moved about 4-5km north/northwest by burning toward the Demon Ridge Track, which is in state forest at the top of the Buckland Valley about 10km south of Wandiligong. The edge of the fire is now about 10km south of Bright, and the same distance southwest of Harrietville. It did not move into private land yesterday (there is not much around that area) but did burn into freehold land near Carboor, on the western edge of the fire, earlier in the week. Starting tomorrow night, DELWP incident controller Paul Bates said, fire crews would begin back-burning around that Demon Ridge Track area to bring the edge of the fire out to an accessible point, so firefighters can reach it and black it out. They have, on current forecasts, about a week to do that work. We are not, in the next seven days, based on the next seven-day forecast, looking for another spike day ... so we are hoping to start backburning, if conditions are safe, on Sunday evening. I\u2019ve just spoken to Paul Bates, who is the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning incident controller for the Ovens region today. That means he is in charge of the Abbeyard fire and protecting communities like Bright and Harrietville. He explained how they were able to reduce that fire activity yesterday, so it did not reach burn into private land. Basically: it was the helicopters. During the day we had seven helicopters bombing or dropping water on the fire. That limited fire runs ... they can\u2019t put the fire out but they can slow it down and buy us time. The helicopters were dropping water scooped from nearby dams. One larger aircraft dropped fire retardant around the Mount Buffalo Chalet, to further protect that heritage building. The effect of all that water bombing, Bates said, was that when the wind change came through and sent very strong south-westerly winds through the fire ground between 5pm and 8pm, pushing flames in the direction of Bright, Harrietville and surrounds, the fire did not burn as far as predicted. We were fortunate yesterday in that the predictions that we had did not come about, because we were really well-resourced with aircraft and they worked really hard all day. Then, shortly after 8pm, it rained. Not a lot \u2013 between 2mm and 5mm across the fire ground \u2013 but it was enough to further quell fire activity. If something had changed \u2013 if that fire at Wodonga had started earlier in the day and required water-bombing helicopters to be diverted, if another new fire had been sparked by lightning and required an urgent response \u2013 the more serious predictions of fire agencies could have eventuated. If something changed ... those fires are more likely to move. The fire predictions used to decide whether evacuation warnings should be sent out are based on what the fire could do without any suppression activity. Over in South Australia they are expecting none of the rainfall that parts of the east will get this week. But senior forecaster Jon Fischer said conditions would still be \u201cmore benign\u201d over the coming week. Temperatures will peak on Kangaroo Island, where fires are still burning, on Monday and in the southern parts of the state on Tuesday. The island also hasn\u2019t had much rain in the last change that went through. Cooler temperatures will reduce fire danger ratings throughout the state this week but there will still be \u201cmoderate to fresh winds\u201d that will influence fire activity. \u201cWith a bit of wind about this week at times, we certainly expect fires to continue,\u201d Fischer says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a dry week.\u201d Fire conditions will spike again in Victoria \u2013 but not for a few days Here is some more on the weather conditions ahead this week, this time in Victoria and South Australia. First to Victoria, the Bureau of Meteorology says while conditions are indeed milder today, winds are keeping the fire danger rating very high in the north of the state for both today and tomorrow. The south is faring better with only moderate fire danger. Temperatures have been a bit cooler on Saturday but that it is not expected to last. Warmer weather will return over the coming days, however the good news is the humidity will increase. \u201cWhile the increase in temperature does tend to make fire danger worse, the humidity counteracts that,\u201d senior meteorologist Richard Russell says. Thunderstorms are also likely for much of the state from Wednesday through to Saturday, with the exception of the south west and the Wimmera. And they will be wet thunderstorms this time and not the dry thunderstorms we\u2019ve had in recent times. Russell warns though that the rain over the past couple of days is \u201cnowhere near enough\u201d and the fires will continue and conditions will spike again at some point. \u201cIn the week ahead, it\u2019s that balancing act,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are no real strong winds either. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not as bad as we\u2019ve seen recently, we are still right in the middle of summer though.\u201d The chief officer of the SA Country Fire Service says tourists and residents are now free to travel to and from Kangaroo Island. The travel restrictions actually lifted on Friday, but chief officer Mark Jones issued a clarifying statement on Saturday saying there was still some confusion from visitors about accessing the island. There may have been confusion about travelling to the island. Under my powers as chief officer, I temporarily enacted restrictions on the island to ensure the priority of emergency services. The restrictions were removed on Friday and people are able to travel to and from the island. The CFS has warned that there will continue to be localised flare-ups in the fire ground, and visitors need to remain aware of fire warnings and the risks of travelling to recently-burned areas. The CFS thanks the community for their patience and understanding as emergency service personnel travelled as priority to attend the fireground. Many locals around Bright chose not to evacuate Roper says that people appeared less likely to take the advice of emergency services to evacuate ahead of yesterday\u2019s extreme fire activity. Even some who evacuated last Saturday, when the state of disaster powers were first invoked, chose to remain at home this time around. \u201cThe vast majority of people that evacuated the first time chose not to go the second time,\u201d Roper says. \u201cThey did not perceive the danger to be as great as possibly what it is.\u201d Roper says some people seem to think that the fire modelling was \u201cwrong\u201d if a risk that was predicted doesn\u2019t come to pass. But he says that the evacuation and \u201cleave now\u201d warnings were only ever intended to tell people how bad things might get on a given day, and how likely it was that the worst case scenario would occur. He says he still advises that people follow the advice to leave, if they can. If they stay and need firefighting assistance, that pulls resources from elsewhere. \u201cStaying if you are only going to look after yourself is actually quite a selfish thing to do,\u201d he says. Bushfires estimated to cost $90m in lost tourism It may have escaped the worst-case scenario yesterday, Alpine Shire mayor Peter Roper says, but the region will suffer a significant economic loss. It is now too late to salvage the tourist dollars lost these summer holidays, and not yet safe enough to encourage visitors to return before the end of January. \u201cWe estimate $90m in tourism losses for the Alpine Shire alone,\u201d Roper says. \u201cBusinesses with business interruption insurance, like accommodation providers that can show bookings which were cancelled, will be all right, but for shops or our retailers, you can\u2019t budget for that. \u201cI think we might lose some businesses. That\u2019s a possibility.\u201d So, what\u2019s happening around Bright today? It is a beautiful day in the Keiwa and Ovens valleys, the Alpine Shire mayor, Peter Roper, says. \u201cWe had bugger all rain [last night], I think about 1mm in the Keiwa Valley,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cBut today is a delightful day in northeast Victoria, which is mental. You wouldn\u2019t know there was a fire.\u201d Yesterday the Keiwa and Ovens Valleys were blanketed with smoke from the Abbeyard fire and concerned fire might even threaten Harrietville and Bright. You couldn\u2019t see more than a few hundred metres in front of you, Roper says. Everyone was anxious and uncomfortable. The southwesterly wind change put the Ovens Valley right in the path of the fire. But days of preparation by both firefighters and local residents prevailed, and the worst-case scenarios did not eventuate. \u201cYesterday was pretty horrible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a horrible sort of day.... You sit and wait in these sort of situations.\u201d About 5pm, CFA strike teams that had been sitting in wait for spot fires in the Ovens Valley were sent to put out a grassfire at Bandiana, on the outskirts of Wodonga. That fire also cut off one of the exits out of the Keiwa valley. \u201cEveryone started to get a bit twitchy about what was going on,\u201d Roper says. Then a fire started at Mount Beauty, and local crews \u201cjumped on it.\u201d And that was the worst of it. Apart from some damage to private land on the western edge of the fire, and ember attack in the Buckland Valley, the flames remained in state forest and national park. The next seven days in NSW Earlier today NSW RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said fire crews would use milder conditions this week to try \u201cget an upper hand on the fires\u201d. He said the forecast is for the best seven days they\u2019ve had in terms of fire danger ratings. The Bureau of Meteorology has some more detail on that. Temperatures across most of the state over the next couple of days will be cooler and wind gusts will not be of the kind seen on Friday when the southerly moved through. Senior climatologist Agata Imielska says areas including the Illawarra, Bega, the south coast and the Riverina could still experience gusts of 15-20 km/h, however, which \u201ccan still make things challenging on the fireground\u201d. Fire danger ratings will be low-moderate to high in most areas up until Tuesday, when temperatures will become slightly warmer again and very high fire danger is expected in areas including the southern ranges, the northern slopes and the ACT. There is also some rain forecast around NSW for later this week, but the BoM says it is too soon to tell how significant that will be. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of good news to see we\u2019ve got rain on the forecast but at the same time whether it will be significant enough in the context of the fires that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on,\u201d Imielska says. Rachel Baxendale, a reporter from The Australian, is at her parents\u2019 vineyard at Whitlands, which is under a watch and act warning for the Abbeyard fire. It looks beautiful there today, even if you can\u2019t see Mount Buffalo\u2019s horn. Some big names have joined #AuthorsForFireys. Nick Cave has donated a signed copy of The Sick Bag Song and one of his suits, which, amazing. Cave grew up around northeast Victoria, so it\u2019s not surprising that he is helping out. Also American author Cheryl Strayed has donated one of five limited-edition signed, leatherbound editions of her memoir, Wild. The top bid, as of 9am, was $2,000. Elise Hurst, the artist behind the special illustrated edition of Neil Gaiman\u2019s Ocean at the end of the lane, is also auctioning a copy of that book signed by both her and Gaiman. This was the scene at the Snowy Mountains town of Adaminaby last night. Economic impact on northeast Victoria will be \u2018massive\u2019 Helen Haines told ABC24 that the economic impact of these bushfires on her electorate would be \u201cmassive\u201d. Including, potentially, the loss of the entire 2020 vintage from some vineyards due to smoke taint. We are a wine region. We are concerned about ongoing smoke issues and smoke taint could destroy entire vintages. We are examining that issue particularly. These are just a few things but we are very, very concerned that this is going to take significant recovery but we\u2019re not even at the recovery point. We are still in the acute fire face. Worth noting that every major wine region in Australia is facing the threat of smoke taint. Tourism has also been affected. In the Alpine Shire alone, Haines said, losses from tourism were estimated to reach $90m. Agriculture is also struggling, with dairy farmers in the Upper Murray \u2014 one of the few dairy regions in Australia that was not on its knees due to drought \u2014 forced to tip milk down the drain because they can\u2019t get trucks through, or lost power to refrigerate it. Stock losses in the Upper Murray, from the Corryong fire, are estimated at 1,500 cattle. Indi MP: \u2018People are tired\u2019 Helen Haines is the independent MP for the federal electorate of Indi, which covers the areas burning in both the Corryong and Abbeyard fires. She spoke to ABC24 earlier, and said the fire risk remains high. Haines: [Some] people have elected to stay and people are tired from evacuating several times. We have months to go. At the moment, yes, [we have] some respite with lovely calm conditions. A lovely gentle breeze. But this is only early January, and our hottest period in this region is February. People are tired.\u201d Haines said she thinks locals are listening to the \u201cstrong warnings from our emergency services. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean everyone is evacuating when told, but that people take in the information provided and make their own \u201crisk assessment.\u201d The fire situation in Victoria is calmer today, after more than 50 new fires started yesterday and last night. There is still one emergency alert in place for the upper alpine villages around Mount Hotham \u2014 Hotham Heights, Dinner Plain, Flourbag and Davenport Village. That\u2019s wedged in between the Abbeyard fire and other fires burning around Bundara. Watch and act alerts are in place for the southern, western, and northern flanks of the Abbeyard fire, in the King Valley, Ovens Valley, and surrounds. There are also two watch and act alerts for the Corryong/Dunns Road megafire on the Victorian side of the border. The NSW side of the border is currently at an advice level. All other fires in the state, including the grassfire that was elevated to emergency warning level on the outskirts of Wodonga last night, and all of the Gippsland fires, are at advice level. Here\u2019s an aerial view of the Corryong fire, via ABC journo Erin Somerville. These before and after photos, taken by Ross Evans, are apocalyptic. The unchanged blue ocean makes things look even more jarring, because when we see these kind of images they\u2019re often overlaid by a weird Hollywood filter. But no, these are real photos of one of Australia\u2019s most important ecological reserves. The fire area on Kangaroo Island is 215,868ha, as of 4am today. That\u2019s 49% of the island\u2019s total landmass. About two-thirds of the island is currently under a watch and act alert, and there are specific warnings about the threat of falling trees in burned areas. What kind of action would satisfy the thousands of people who joined those climate protests, one reporter asked? Said Albanese: It would help if we had a government that actually acknowledged climate change was real and did not play around with it. It would help if we had a government that did not go to an international conference while these fires were burning and argue for less action on the international stage, not more. And argued for accounting tricks rather than reducing emissions. Climate change is real, we need to listen to the science and we need to respond to it. He goes on: There is also an overwhelming, clear view that the government, when it comes to its emissions policy \u2013 it does not have a credible climate change policy. It doesn\u2019t have an energy policy at all, and the government cannot continue to pretend that black is white, pretend that they are taking action at the same time as, essentially, people like Craig Kelly have been running the government\u2019s agenda. Scott Morrison rejected criticism of his government\u2019s climate change policies on Friday. You can read of what he said here. After that, Albanese was pressed on whether he supported the climate protests that took place around the country, and indeed around the world, last night. Thousands of people marched in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and London to call for the Australian government to introduce a strong policy to mitigate the climate emergency. Albanese says the protests were an expression of people\u2019s frustration around the lack of action on climate change but that it was important that they did so without disrupting anyone else. This seems, to me, to be besides the point, but I\u2019ll give you the full quote: We are a democratic society, one way people can express their views is by doing it publicly. That is an important thing. It\u2019s also important, can I say, that while people do that, that people not be disrupted going about their every day lives as well, because that would alienate support. But I think it is perfectly legitimate for people to express their views in that way, as they do in writing to parliamentarians, as they do through social media, as stated by ringing the local radio station and expressing their views. \u2018It is not really tenable to do anything else\u2019 Anthony Albanese spoke to reporters in Sydney a short time ago about his proposal to suspend the ordinary business of parliament on 4 February, the first sitting day of the year, for a motion of condolence for those killed in the summer bushfire crisis. At least 26 people have died since October. He says the motion of condolence should also acknowledge those who have lost everything \u2013 that\u2019s well over 1,000 families, going just by the number of homes destroyed \u2013 and thank firefighters for their \u201cextraordinary bravery\u201d. Albanese says he wrote to the prime minister to outline this proposal, and also assured him that Labor would facilitate the passage of any legislation required to facilitate reconstruction and recovery payments, so that can be done in the first week of parliament. He says: I have not as yet received a response from the prime minister, I would expect that that would be forthcoming. This was put forward as a constructive suggestion, so that preparations can be made. He continued: It just seems to me, and in the debate we have had in the shadow cabinet in Adelaide on Thursday, that it is not really tenable to do anything else on the first day back. Of course prior to parliament sitting there will be the usual church service that takes place in the morning as well and that will have a particular sombre note to it. This is Calla Wahlquist, taking over from environment reporter Lisa Cox, who was keeping you informed this morning. I\u2019ll bring you the comments from opposition leader Anthony Albanese\u2019s press conference shortly. A quick note on megablazes So, we now have two megablazes burning this fire season: the Gospers Mountain megablaze in the Blue Mountains and Wollemi national park, which is currently estimated to be 512,000ha in size; and the Dunns Road/Green Valley/Corryong fire, which joined overnight and is burning on both sides of the Murray River in the Snowy Mountains and upper Murray region. That fire is more than 700,000ha in size. It\u2019s a bit harder to get accurate figures, because it\u2019s being managed by different state agencies. The Gippsland fires, which merged over the extreme fire weather around 30 and 31 December with fires burning on the south coast of NSW, and cover an area that is even bigger than the huge Snowys/Upper Murray fire, have not been referred to as a megablaze. It\u2019s worth noting that the term has primarily been used by the NSW Rural Fire Service, and the bulk of that Gippsland fire is in Victoria. AAP has this report out of Queensland today. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has urged Donald Trump to reconsider US travel warnings placed on Australia: The US state department last week put out a new warning for Americans to consider postponing their travel to Australia as disastrous bushfires ravage the country. But the premier has passionately pleaded with the US leader to reconsider the warning, which could be damaging to the tourism industry at a delicate time. \u201cThe last thing we need is for international tourists to think that the entire country of Australia is not safe to visit,\u201d Ms Palaszczuk wrote on Friday. \u201cWe have large parts of our beautiful country that are not affected and would love to welcome American tourists here. \u201cI urge you to change the travel advice for American tourists looking to visit Australia.\u201d More from that press conference: Victoria\u2019s emergency services say they are trying to clarify what types of structures were destroyed overnight. They believe one is a home and the other a shed but crews will be sent to the locations to confirm that. The state of emergency will also end at midnight tonight, Lisa Neville, says, with 10 days of milder conditions now forecast. Crews will try to use that time to contain some of the fires that are still burning, but the state is not out of danger yet. Last night thousands turned out in Sydney and Melbourne calling for more action on climate change, with more than 10,000 gathering at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall. People around the world also turned out to protest climate change inaction and show support during Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis. Victoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, says there are no total fire bans in the state today but fire danger remains very high in the north and north-east. \u201cIt is a tale of two states at the moment, in terms of temperature and conditions. You get north of that divide and we have temperatures 30 plus, south of the divide is somewhat cooler and somewhat milder,\u201d he says. A fire near Mt Hotham remains at emergency warning level and there are 16 watch and act alerts from Mallacoota to Bairnsdale and up to the Corryong fire. He says with the potential in some areas for more rain and even storms, trees could pose a danger. While opening up the Princes Highway and other roads will be a priority, the focus right now is on safety. Crisp says another 140 firefighters and specialists will be brought into the state and will start arriving in about a week. More from that press conference: Victoria\u2019s emergency services minister, Lisa Neville, says there have been mixed conditions in other parts of the state. Rain has helped suppress fire conditions in East Gippsland today, which is \u201creally good news\u201d for some of those communities she says. But she says \u201ca lot of that rain was in that Bairnsdale area, and not all of it in the other fire areas\u201d. She says Bairnsdale received 18mm of rain, while Mallacoota had only 2mm. Neville also warns that thunderstorms could lead to flash flooding in parts of Victoria this week. Because of the scale of the bushfires, there is a risk of run-off. \u201cIt is also dangerous for our firefighters and emergency service workers and in the past we have seen deaths as a result of that, those sort of conditions,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it is something we will be monitoring both for communities but particularly for our workers.\u201d Victoria\u2019s emergency services minister, Lisa Neville, has been speaking. She says Friday night\u2019s \u201cfast moving, scary grassfire\u201d in Wodonga was indicative of the kinds of emergencies communities are facing. That fire was contained to the loss of \u201ctwo structures\u201d. Neville says there was very little rain in the north-east of the state yesterday and any that did occur would not have hit the fire ground at all. She warns that strong southerlies in that area today are \u201cgenerating some fire activity as we speak now\u201d. \u201cSo although we are milder than yesterday, certainly in the north-east we would be encouraging people to continue to heed the messages and look out for warnings because it is still active up there, you can see the smoke developing out of that fire activity,\u201d she says. The Sydney Opera House and Live Nation have also announced a comedy gala to raise funds for bushfire recovery. The event will be on March 16 on the Opera House Steps and forecourt and will feature artists and comedians including Arj Barker, Carl Barron, Urzila Carlson, Joel Creasey, Kitty Flanagan, Becky Lucas, Tim Minchin, Julia Morris, Harry Shearer and more to be announced. Tickets will go on sale on Wednesday 15 January at midday on the Sydney Opera House website. Proceeds from ticket sales will go towards the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery fund, the NSW Rural Fire Service, Wildlife Victoria and WIRES. The sails of the Sydney Opera House will be lit up tonight to show support for bushfire-affected communities and firefighters around the country. Sydney Opera House CEO Louise Herron AM said: \u201cWe are lighting the Opera House sails to show our collective support for everyone affected by these devastating fires and to express our deepest gratitude to the emergency services and volunteers for their incredible efforts and courage. As difficult circumstances continue, we want to send a message of hope and strength to the people of Australia.\u201d Liberal National MP Keith Pitt, the member for the Queensland electorate of Hinkler, has been speaking on the ABC. He\u2019s asked whether he thinks community sentiment about the government\u2019s climate policies and how we deal with bushfire is changing. Instead of responding to the question about climate policy, he says people across the country \u201cneed to be able to manage their own land\u201d. But he is asked again about whether the government\u2019s response to climate change is that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d is enough. \u201cWell, the government\u2019s response is that we are meeting our targets and we will meet the targets that have been set,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are doing exactly what we said we would and I think any individual which is out there that is saying that, you know, you could close a coal-fired power station and it wouldn\u2019t have saved a single life or property, well, that is absolute nonsense.\u201d A reminder here that the government is not on track to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target under the Paris agreement of 26% to 28% and it intends to use carryover from the Kyoto period to achieve this. Australia is the only country in the world planning to do this. The target is also much lower than was recommended by the Climate Change Authority to be consistent with the global goal of limiting warming to 2C or less. The Blue Mountains this morning, where there is a mix of heavy smoke and fog: If you are after some longer reading on the bushfire crisis, there is plenty in Guardian Australia today. James Bradley has written this piece about the horror day in NSW on New Year\u2019s eve and how it could come to be seen as the \u201cday everything changed\u201d for climate politics in Australia. We have another fact check - one of several this season - this time on claims that the \u201clocking up\u201d of national parks has contributed to the increased risk this fire season. And in case you missed it yesterday, an employee at News Corp has written an all-staff email accusing the company of \u201cmisinformation\u201d and diverting attention away from the climate crisis during the bushfire emergency. And this is the new watch and act alert for a fire near Port Stephens. Here is a summary of what the NSW RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons and the NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian had to say about the impact of those conditions on Friday and what is expected in the days ahead: There have been two reports of injuries on Friday. Members of a volunteer firefighting crew from the Central Coast working in the Shannon\u2019s Flat area were overrun by fire. There were some initial reports of burns and shortness of breath for three crew members. They were treated by ambulance and released. In the south of the state, a man has suffered serious burns defending his property. He was treated on scene and flown out of the area on a water bombing helicopter and will have surgery today at Concord Hospital. 147 fires are still burning in NSW and one new fire has started today near Port Stephens. Fitzsimmons says initial reports suggest no homes were lost overnight but there has been damage to other structures such as sheds. Crews want to use forecast milder conditions over the next to week to contain as much as they can before a return to warmer weather. The challenge is the enormous geographic spread of the fires. Fitzsimmons said advice from the Bureau of Meteorology was that while there was currently some rainfall through the state, much of it was showers that are \u201cevaporating before they hit the ground\u201d. \u201cHopefully, we will not see more thunderstorms and more dry thunderstorms and lightning strikes causing new fires,\u201d he says. More from that press conference: The NSW RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says early reports today suggest no homes were destroyed overnight \u201cbut we have got reports of some outbuildings and some sheds that were damaged or consumed by the fire\u201d. \u201cSo, as the premier said, no lives lost which is the priority,\u201d he says. He adds that they are expecting \u201ca run of better weather over the next week\u201d: \u201cIt would appear that we have got at least a week, it will probably be the best seven days we have had without a rise of very dangerous fire ratings coming towards us over the next seven days.\u201d \u201cSo, some reprieve. An opportunity for firefighters and affected communities to consolidate and allow us to try and get the upper hand on the fires.\u201d The NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is speaking. She says a person has been injured overnight while defending their property and was taken to Concord Hospital. She says while \u201cwe never want to be complacent and we shouldn\u2019t be under the current conditions\u201d they are relieved that a reprieve in weather conditions is expected over the next week. The NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons confirms that earlier figure that there are still 147 fires burning across the state. But he adds that a new fire has started this morning in the Port Stephens region, to the east of Anna Bay. \u201cThat\u2019s one that just popped up and has been elevated to watch and act just due to its proximity to people\u2019s homes,\u201d he says. We are expecting an update within the next hour from the NSW RFS and the NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian. In the meantime, the RFS has published its latest data on properties damaged and destroyed this season, up until January 10. It says these figures will increase. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the ongoing bushfire crisis. Firefighters in NSW and Victoria faced a difficult night after a southerly change brought gusty winds through both states. In NSW, more than 3,500 firefighters were deployed and wind gusts of up to 90km/h across some firegrounds created dangerous conditions. We will hear more about the impact of this later today. Three fires \u2013 the Dunns Road, the Green Valley Talmalmo, and the East Ournie Creek fire \u2013 have merged to create a new \u201cmegablaze\u201d that is burning across the NSW and Victorian borders. There is some better news, however, with, conditions having eased on Saturday morning and cooler conditions expected today. Most of NSW has a fire danger rating of high today. The southern slopes region has very high fire danger today. In NSW, no fires are currently at emergency warning level and one fire is at watch and act level. The RFS said that, at 6am, there were still 147 bush and grass fires burning across NSW, 65 of which are yet to be contained. In Victoria, a fire near Wodonga forced evacuations overnight. There is one emergency warning in place in Victoria near Mt Hotham.",

      "body": "<p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/28/william-gibson-neuromancer-cyberpunk-books\" title=\"\">William Gibson</a> was a third of the way through his new novel when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. \u201cI woke up the day after that and I looked at the manuscript and the world in which the novel was set \u2013 a contemporary novel set in San Francisco \u2013 and I realised that that world no longer existed. That the characters\u2019 emotional basis made no sense; that no one\u2019s behaviour made any sense. Something of this tremendous enormity had just happened and I felt really lost \u2013 and sort of mournful. I was losing this book.\u201d</p> <p>The great chronicler of the future had been overtaken by events. This had happened once before. Gibson had been 100 pages into<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/26/fiction.williamgibson\" title=\"\">Pattern Recognition</a></em> \u2013 the first of his novels set in a near contemporary version of reality \u2013 when the Twin Towers fell, forcing him to rewrite that novel\u2019s world and the backstories of its characters. His future had to catch up with the present.</p> <p>That said, Gibson\u2019s futures have always got a little tangled up with the present. Probably the most influential living writer of speculative fiction, his best known aphorism is \u201cthe future\u2019s already here \u2013 it\u2019s just not very evenly distributed\u201d. Two or three generations of readers have now seen the futures he envisaged in his three trilogies of novels coming dismayingly into being around them. Virtual digital spaces, artificial intelligence, corporations superseding nation states, extreme body modification, and the insane metastasis of the marketing and branding industries ... Gibson was on to all these things when <em>Black Mirror</em>\u2019s Charlie Brooker was still in short trousers. And his influence endures. Just last week, Dominic Cummings \u2013 a fan \u2013 referenced Gibson\u2019s character Hubertus Bigend in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\" title=\"\">Downing Street job advert</a>.</p> <p>This latest twist in reality \u2013 Trump\u2019s election \u2013 meant Gibson had to go to back to the drawing board with the new book, just as he had with <em>Pattern Recognition</em>. For a long time he didn\u2019t think the book that was to become <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/new-william-gibson-novel-world-where-hillary-clinton-won-agency\" title=\"\">Agency</a></em> could be salvaged. He went through \u201cat least two hard publishing deadlines\u201d as he tried to find a way of bringing it back to life. He had his heroine, Verity, and her encounter with Eunice \u2013 the AI entity around whom much of the novel\u2019s plot revolves. But how could he make them fit into a post-Trump world?</p> <p>\u201cI thought, you know, this is never going to happen. And it really threw me \u2013 for about six months. All I could do was read the news feed and feel worse about that. But eventually I realised that I wanted to believe I was living in a stub. That something had split off and that things weren\u2019t supposed to be this way. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be as dire. And having had that passing thought, I thought \u2013 wait a minute! Verity is in a stub. And suddenly it worked. I had a framework that was coming together.\u201d</p> <p>He retconned, in other words, what was originally intended to be a standalone work into something that is now more straightforwardly a sequel than anything else in his canon. <em>Agency</em> reprises the setup and many of the characters of his last book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/19/the-peripheral-william-gibson-ride-future\" title=\"\">The Peripheral</a></em>. That novel \u2013 which, fans of Gibson\u2019s strangely little-filmed canon will be pleased to hear, is about to be adapted for Amazon Prime by the team that made <em>Westworld</em> \u2013 is set between a London of the early 22nd century, after an unspecified apocalypse called the Jackpot has wiped out 80% of the population, and a near future town in rural America. As we discover, the latter is a \u201cstub\u201d: an alternative timeline in which technologists (and, more tellingly, hobbyists) of the future are able to meddle. <em>Agency</em> is set between that far future London and another stub \u2013 a present day San Francisco where Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election \u2013 and describes its protagonist Verity\u2019s relationship with the dizzyingly powerful Eunice as they attempt to avert that stub\u2019s version of the civilisation-ending Jackpot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone claiming to be from the future had shown me Boris Johnson I\u2019d have told him to fuck off</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy specific time travel gimmick in these books,\u201d Gibson says, \u201cis that it\u2019s impossible to physically visit the past, so you have to do it digitally. But immediately on contacting the past you create a stub, because that contact didn\u2019t happen in <em>your</em> past so you create an alternate history. And that spares me all of that tedious paradoxical stuff that bogs down time travel stories.\u201d He pinched a version of the idea, he\u2019s generous enough to acknowledge, from Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner\u2019s 1985 short story \u201cMozart in Mirrorshades\u201d.</p> <p>As a Canadian writer who initially marked his territory in a future Japan, what attracted him to setting his post-Jackpot world in London? He doesn\u2019t see it as so much of a jump. \u201cOn my first three or four visits to Japan I immediately thought that Tokyo had more in common with London than with any other city,\u201d he says. \u201cThese disproportionately large sites of former empires, huge concentrated populations, recent wartime trauma, lots of fatalities. They\u2019re capitals of island nations. But also cultural things: the fanatical attention paid to specific individual classes of objects. In London you could probably find a speciality shop for almost anything. And you certainly could in Tokyo. All these parallels. I\u2019m curious that I\u2019ve almost never seen it mentioned anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>In a way Gibson came to fiction late. Born in South Carolina, steeped in William Burroughs and Henry Miller, he dropped out of high school and spent his late teens and early 20s travelling and experimenting with drugs and the counterculture. When he \u201cwashed up\u201d in Canada in the 1960s \u2013 initially, he claimed to have been dodging the Vietnam draft \u2013 he ran Toronto\u2019s first \u201chead shop\u201d. In the mid 70s, having started a family, he went to university to study English literature \u2013 and what he learned there helped to rekindle his childhood interest in writing science fiction, which was properly kickstarted when he fell in with John Shirley, Shiner and Sterling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54ed9d6040db52ab89b57cbcfa5eba203d6a1675\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54ed9d6040db52ab89b57cbcfa5eba203d6a1675/0_0_4046_5136/788.jpg\" alt=\"American Gothic, 1930, by Grant Wood.\" width=\"788\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American Gothic, 1930, by Grant Wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grant Wood/Art Institute of Chicago/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a happy accident that, at 71, Gibson looks like a more benign version of the pitchfork-toting male figure in Grant Wood\u2019s painting <em>American Gothic</em>. His 1982 short story \u201cBurning Chrome\u201d is credited with popularising the term \u201ccyberspace\u201d (\u201cA consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts ... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding\u201d). His 1981 short story \u201cJohnny Mnemonic\u201d was made into a film starring Keanu Reeves in 1995, but Gibson\u2019s breakthrough only came with 1984\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/07/neuromancer-william-gibson-review-cyberpunk-classic-30-years-on\" title=\"\">Neuromancer</a></em>. He famously wrote this rip-roaring, noir-inflected fantasy of burned out hackers and technologically augmented ninjas \u2013 which gave birth to the whole \u201ccyberpunk\u201d genre \u2013<em> </em>on a manual typewriter, and he freely talks of himself as a late adopter. So maybe the poetic, rather than technological, turn in that description of cyberspace is the way to read him. He magpies futuristic sounding stuff.</p> <p>\u201cI was actually able to write <em>Neuromancer</em> because I didn\u2019t know anything about computers,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew literally nothing. What I did was deconstruct the poetics of the language of people who were already working in the field. I\u2019d stand in the hotel bar at the Seattle science fiction convention listening to these guys who were the first computer programmers I ever saw talk about their work. I had no idea what they were talking about, but that was the first time that I ever heard the word \u2018interface\u2019 used as a verb. And I swooned. Wow, that\u2019s a verb. Seriously, poetically that was wonderful.</p> <p>\u201cSo I was listening to it as an English honours student. I would take it back out, deconstruct it poetically, and build a world from those bricks. Consequently there are other things in <em>Neuromancer</em> that make no sense. When the going gets really tough in cyberspace, what does Case do? He sends out for a modem. He does! He says: \u2018Get me a modem! I\u2019m in deep shit!\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what one was, but I had just heard the word. And I thought: man, it\u2019s sexy. That really sounds like it could be bad news. And I didn\u2019t have anybody to read it and \u2026 I couldn\u2019t Google it.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, he acknowledges later, \u201cI think Google\u2019s changed my writing a bit. I now realise that anyone who\u2019s seriously into the text is going to be Googling everything as they go along \u2013 or anything that strikes their eye. It actually adds a different level of responsibility. I can\u2019t be quite as random now.\u201d He has to ensure that the made up stuff is definitely and securely made up, and that the real, Googleable stuffis accurate.</p> <p>Gibson is active on Twitter as @greatdismal, though joining it wasn\u2019t an obvious Gibson move. He initially expected to spend five minutes or so on the site, hence the odd handle: he happened to have been reading a history of the Great Dismal Swamp, near his childhood home in Virginia, when he created a temporary account.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sort of glad though that I didn\u2019t have @realwilliamgibson or something,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t get me what I\u2019m interested in. It\u2019s nice to see people react to one\u2019s work but what I want is information that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get anywhere else. Back when I was writing the early books I\u2019d go to this wonderful shop in Vancouver where I\u2019d buy $300-worth of foreign magazines \u2013 like Japanese fashion magazines \u2013 and cart it all home and pile it beside my desk. What I was paying all that money for was a stack of curated novelty from global sources. And as soon as I had Twitter I had more curated global novelty than I could ever access.</p> <p>\u201cPretty soon the newsstand closed \u2013 not because I wasn\u2019t supporting it, but that had something to do with it. When you had to buy an actual hard copy of Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible to find out about the Gothic Lolita subculture, it\u2019s really something. It felt really special because, you know, your next door neighbour wasn\u2019t going to find it on Twitter.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea0789eee5e28453aaf8bc88757f4e3611fc4277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea0789eee5e28453aaf8bc88757f4e3611fc4277/0_0_2988_1793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keanu Reeves and Dina Meyer in Johnny Mnemonic, directed by Robert Longo (1995).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keanu Reeves and Dina Meyer in <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em>, directed by Robert Longo (1995).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20 Century Fox/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gibson has said in the past that he\u2019s more interested in writing about the human reaction to technology than technology itself. And what started him writing SF as an adult was that missing human element: \u201cWhat the science fiction of my youth generally seemed to lack was \u2026 everything that made literary naturalism a radical proposition.\u201d In his early teens he\u2019d devoured mid-century American SF such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/23/robert-heinlein-hugo-winner\" title=\"\">Robert Heinlein</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/isaacasimov\" title=\"\">Isaac Asimov</a>. When he got older \u2013 in distaste for the reactionary politics and \u201cits assumption of a world that\u2019s basically entirely American, a whole universe that\u2019s entirely American\u201d \u2013 he turned his back on that, reading British new wave (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/04/jg-ballard-celebration-five-years-writers-books-reissued\" title=\"\">JG Ballard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/20/m-john-harrison-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">M John Harrison</a>) and getting his American \u201cscience fiction vitamins\u201d, as he puts it, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/may/08/thomas-pynchon-at-80-eight-reasons-to-celebrate-his-birthday\" title=\"\">Thomas Pynchon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/03/kurt-vonnegut-biography\" title=\"\">Kurt Vonnegut</a>.</p> <p>So when he returned to SF at college, \u201cIt was as though I had been present at the birth of Nashville swing and gone back looking for it and found the Nashville of the early 70s,\u201d he says. The disappointment was galvanising. \u201cIt helped to form the idea that, you know, maybe I could actually do that.\u201d</p> <p>Thus, as much as his books are populated with nanotech assemblers, haptic recon commandos, gunpacked ceramic Michikoids and all that sort of malarkey (he admits to being \u201cloosey goosey\u201d with the science), they aren\u2019t weightless fantasies. His characters eat, and have love lives and in some cases have kids and spend most of the novel looking after them. Wilf \u2013 a principal protagonist in the future London of <em>The Peripheral</em> \u2013 spends most of <em>Agency</em> babysitting: \u201cAs the narrative went on I realised that what he mostly needed to do was mind the baby \u2013 otherwise he\u2019s going to have to leave it with the nanotech pandas. And, you know, that\u2019s the naturalistic part of it. That\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>One character suffers something we\u2019ll all recognise \u2013 a \u201cmomentary pang of phonelessness\u201d. And, hilariously, <em>Agency</em> prominently features a kickass combat drone \u2013 like a sort of R2D2-size Swiss Army deathknife, but the heroes have to spend the whole time lugging its battery pack and charger around after it. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of my kit as well,\u201d says Gibson, patting the smartphone resting on a spare battery pack by his coffee. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to forget about the charger. You\u2019re lugging it around. You\u2019d be lost without it.\u201d</p> <p>The lazy shorthand with which he\u2019s sometimes described is as a prophet. How does he feel about that? An albatross around the neck, an encouraging compliment \u2013 or just part of the job? \u201cIt\u2019s actually ... It seems to be a thing. But I\u2019ve been discounting it actively throughout my entire career. I don\u2019t think you could find a single interview with me in which I don\u2019t make the point that I\u2019ve got it wrong easily as often as I\u2019ve got it sort of right.\u201d</p> <p>He certainly gets it right in one respect in <em>Agency</em>: the flashpoint crisis in the book\u2019s contemporary timeline concerns a Turkish invasion of northern Syria, complicated by Russian interference, after the US pulls out. The book would have been at the proof stage by the time Trump announced his withdrawal from the region last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every fiction about the future is like an ice-cream cone, melting as it moves into the future</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe person who designed that crisis,\u201d Gibson says, \u201cis someone with a job in government in the United States. He\u2019s been a very good friend for quite a while, and given his professional background, I knew that he could give me something. I didn\u2019t specify that part of the world. I just said I need a Cuban missile crisis-like event that could happen now. He came up with that one almost immediately. What\u2019s been very eerie for me is seeing the actual place names I used on the news. I wrote to him immediately. He said: \u2018Well why do you think I put it in there? If that sort of thing happens it\u2019s going to happen there.\u2019\u201d Subcontracting crisis design, it bears noticing, is an extremely William Gibson thing to do.</p> <p>Does it matter to try to get it right, though? \u201cEvery fiction about the future is like an ice-cream cone,\u201d he says, \u201cmelting as it moves into the future. It\u2019s acquiring archaism by the second. And I\u2019m sure that <em>Neuromancer</em>, for instance, will ultimately be read for what it tells the future about the past. That\u2019s ultimately all we can get from old science fiction. That\u2019s the fate of antique science fiction. All science fiction eventually becomes vintage \u2013 mine included. But I knew that. I knew that before I even started writing it. And I\u2019ve always found it delightful. It\u2019s a delightful thought, as I\u2019m working, that one day this will all just be completely archaic and hokey. But it\u2019s my job to make that take quite a while.\u201d A 13-year-old reader of <em>Neuromancer</em> now, he points out, might well guess: \u201cThis is about what happened to all the cellphones. This cyberspace thing exists because something happened to the cellphones.\u201d</p> <p>And, indeed, Gibson stopped setting his novels mainly in the far future around the turn of the millennium. He changed mode. \u201cSince <em>Pattern Recognition</em> I\u2019ve been writing novels of the recent past. They\u2019ve tended to be published in the year after they actually take place. After the publication of <em>All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties</em> [1999] I had a feeling that my game was sagging a bit. Not that there\u2019s anything particularly wrong with that book \u2013 but I felt that I was losing a sense of how weird the real world around me was. Because I was busy writing novels and whatever, and I\u2019d sort of glance out of the window at the day\u2019s reality and I\u2019d go: \u2018Whoah! That was really strange.\u2019 Then I\u2019d look back down at my page and realise that that was stranger than my page, and I began to feel \u2026 uneasy.\u201d</p> <p>So he cast around contemporary culture \u201cfor the elements of things that I had found sufficiently weird to feel that I was still doing what I had done before\u201d. When readers don\u2019t notice that these books are set in the present day, he says, \u201cThis is a good sign. This is what I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cThe really scary thing about actual futurity, for me, is the newsfeed of the present day. It\u2019s something I could never have imagined. If it had been pitched to a Hollywood producer a decade ago they\u2019d say: \u2018Get outta here, never darken my door. This is <em>ridiculous</em>!\u2019 If I had a little window into 2019 back in 1981, instead of saying, here\u2019s some made up future shit, but what they\u2019re actually showing me is all of this \u2013 I\u2019d say some of this is so stupid.

      "bodyText": "In 2016, William Gibson was a third of the way through his new novel when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. \u201cI woke up the day after that and I looked at the manuscript and the world in which the novel was set \u2013 a contemporary novel set in San Francisco \u2013 and I realised that that world no longer existed. That the characters\u2019 emotional basis made no sense; that no one\u2019s behaviour made any sense. Something of this tremendous enormity had just happened and I felt really lost \u2013 and sort of mournful. I was losing this book.\u201d The great chronicler of the future had been overtaken by events. This had happened once before. Gibson had been 100 pages into Pattern Recognition \u2013 the first of his novels set in a near contemporary version of reality \u2013 when the Twin Towers fell, forcing him to rewrite that novel\u2019s world and the backstories of its characters. His future had to catch up with the present. That said, Gibson\u2019s futures have always got a little tangled up with the present. Probably the most influential living writer of speculative fiction, his best known aphorism is \u201cthe future\u2019s already here \u2013 it\u2019s just not very evenly distributed\u201d. Two or three generations of readers have now seen the futures he envisaged in his three trilogies of novels coming dismayingly into being around them. Virtual digital spaces, artificial intelligence, corporations superseding nation states, extreme body modification, and the insane metastasis of the marketing and branding industries ... Gibson was on to all these things when Black Mirror\u2019s Charlie Brooker was still in short trousers. And his influence endures. Just last week, Dominic Cummings \u2013 a fan \u2013 referenced Gibson\u2019s character Hubertus Bigend in a Downing Street job advert. This latest twist in reality \u2013 Trump\u2019s election \u2013 meant Gibson had to go to back to the drawing board with the new book, just as he had with Pattern Recognition. For a long time he didn\u2019t think the book that was to become Agency could be salvaged. He went through \u201cat least two hard publishing deadlines\u201d as he tried to find a way of bringing it back to life. He had his heroine, Verity, and her encounter with Eunice \u2013 the AI entity around whom much of the novel\u2019s plot revolves. But how could he make them fit into a post-Trump world? \u201cI thought, you know, this is never going to happen. And it really threw me \u2013 for about six months. All I could do was read the news feed and feel worse about that. But eventually I realised that I wanted to believe I was living in a stub. That something had split off and that things weren\u2019t supposed to be this way. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be as dire. And having had that passing thought, I thought \u2013 wait a minute! Verity is in a stub. And suddenly it worked. I had a framework that was coming together.\u201d He retconned, in other words, what was originally intended to be a standalone work into something that is now more straightforwardly a sequel than anything else in his canon. Agency reprises the setup and many of the characters of his last book, The Peripheral. That novel \u2013 which, fans of Gibson\u2019s strangely little-filmed canon will be pleased to hear, is about to be adapted for Amazon Prime by the team that made Westworld \u2013 is set between a London of the early 22nd century, after an unspecified apocalypse called the Jackpot has wiped out 80% of the population, and a near future town in rural America. As we discover, the latter is a \u201cstub\u201d: an alternative timeline in which technologists (and, more tellingly, hobbyists) of the future are able to meddle. Agency is set between that far future London and another stub \u2013 a present day San Francisco where Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election \u2013 and describes its protagonist Verity\u2019s relationship with the dizzyingly powerful Eunice as they attempt to avert that stub\u2019s version of the civilisation-ending Jackpot. \u201cMy specific time travel gimmick in these books,\u201d Gibson says, \u201cis that it\u2019s impossible to physically visit the past, so you have to do it digitally. But immediately on contacting the past you create a stub, because that contact didn\u2019t happen in your past so you create an alternate history. And that spares me all of that tedious paradoxical stuff that bogs down time travel stories.\u201d He pinched a version of the idea, he\u2019s generous enough to acknowledge, from Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner\u2019s 1985 short story \u201cMozart in Mirrorshades\u201d. As a Canadian writer who initially marked his territory in a future Japan, what attracted him to setting his post-Jackpot world in London? He doesn\u2019t see it as so much of a jump. \u201cOn my first three or four visits to Japan I immediately thought that Tokyo had more in common with London than with any other city,\u201d he says. \u201cThese disproportionately large sites of former empires, huge concentrated populations, recent wartime trauma, lots of fatalities. They\u2019re capitals of island nations. But also cultural things: the fanatical attention paid to specific individual classes of objects. In London you could probably find a speciality shop for almost anything. And you certainly could in Tokyo. All these parallels. I\u2019m curious that I\u2019ve almost never seen it mentioned anywhere.\u201d In a way Gibson came to fiction late. Born in South Carolina, steeped in William Burroughs and Henry Miller, he dropped out of high school and spent his late teens and early 20s travelling and experimenting with drugs and the counterculture. When he \u201cwashed up\u201d in Canada in the 1960s \u2013 initially, he claimed to have been dodging the Vietnam draft \u2013 he ran Toronto\u2019s first \u201chead shop\u201d. In the mid 70s, having started a family, he went to university to study English literature \u2013 and what he learned there helped to rekindle his childhood interest in writing science fiction, which was properly kickstarted when he fell in with John Shirley, Shiner and Sterling. It\u2019s a happy accident that, at 71, Gibson looks like a more benign version of the pitchfork-toting male figure in Grant Wood\u2019s painting American Gothic. His 1982 short story \u201cBurning Chrome\u201d is credited with popularising the term \u201ccyberspace\u201d (\u201cA consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts ... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding\u201d). His 1981 short story \u201cJohnny Mnemonic\u201d was made into a film starring Keanu Reeves in 1995, but Gibson\u2019s breakthrough only came with 1984\u2019s Neuromancer. He famously wrote this rip-roaring, noir-inflected fantasy of burned out hackers and technologically augmented ninjas \u2013 which gave birth to the whole \u201ccyberpunk\u201d genre \u2013 on a manual typewriter, and he freely talks of himself as a late adopter. So maybe the poetic, rather than technological, turn in that description of cyberspace is the way to read him. He magpies futuristic sounding stuff. \u201cI was actually able to write Neuromancer because I didn\u2019t know anything about computers,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew literally nothing. What I did was deconstruct the poetics of the language of people who were already working in the field. I\u2019d stand in the hotel bar at the Seattle science fiction convention listening to these guys who were the first computer programmers I ever saw talk about their work. I had no idea what they were talking about, but that was the first time that I ever heard the word \u2018interface\u2019 used as a verb. And I swooned. Wow, that\u2019s a verb. Seriously, poetically that was wonderful. \u201cSo I was listening to it as an English honours student. I would take it back out, deconstruct it poetically, and build a world from those bricks. Consequently there are other things in Neuromancer that make no sense. When the going gets really tough in cyberspace, what does Case do? He sends out for a modem. He does! He says: \u2018Get me a modem! I\u2019m in deep shit!\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what one was, but I had just heard the word. And I thought: man, it\u2019s sexy. That really sounds like it could be bad news. And I didn\u2019t have anybody to read it and \u2026 I couldn\u2019t Google it.\u201d Actually, he acknowledges later, \u201cI think Google\u2019s changed my writing a bit. I now realise that anyone who\u2019s seriously into the text is going to be Googling everything as they go along \u2013 or anything that strikes their eye. It actually adds a different level of responsibility. I can\u2019t be quite as random now.\u201d He has to ensure that the made up stuff is definitely and securely made up, and that the real, Googleable stuffis accurate. Gibson is active on Twitter as @greatdismal, though joining it wasn\u2019t an obvious Gibson move. He initially expected to spend five minutes or so on the site, hence the odd handle: he happened to have been reading a history of the Great Dismal Swamp, near his childhood home in Virginia, when he created a temporary account. \u201cI\u2019m sort of glad though that I didn\u2019t have @realwilliamgibson or something,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t get me what I\u2019m interested in. It\u2019s nice to see people react to one\u2019s work but what I want is information that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get anywhere else. Back when I was writing the early books I\u2019d go to this wonderful shop in Vancouver where I\u2019d buy $300-worth of foreign magazines \u2013 like Japanese fashion magazines \u2013 and cart it all home and pile it beside my desk. What I was paying all that money for was a stack of curated novelty from global sources. And as soon as I had Twitter I had more curated global novelty than I could ever access. \u201cPretty soon the newsstand closed \u2013 not because I wasn\u2019t supporting it, but that had something to do with it. When you had to buy an actual hard copy of Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible to find out about the Gothic Lolita subculture, it\u2019s really something. It felt really special because, you know, your next door neighbour wasn\u2019t going to find it on Twitter.\u201d Gibson has said in the past that he\u2019s more interested in writing about the human reaction to technology than technology itself. And what started him writing SF as an adult was that missing human element: \u201cWhat the science fiction of my youth generally seemed to lack was \u2026 everything that made literary naturalism a radical proposition.\u201d In his early teens he\u2019d devoured mid-century American SF such as Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. When he got older \u2013 in distaste for the reactionary politics and \u201cits assumption of a world that\u2019s basically entirely American, a whole universe that\u2019s entirely American\u201d \u2013 he turned his back on that, reading British new wave (JG Ballard, M John Harrison) and getting his American \u201cscience fiction vitamins\u201d, as he puts it, from Thomas Pynchon and Kurt Vonnegut. So when he returned to SF at college, \u201cIt was as though I had been present at the birth of Nashville swing and gone back looking for it and found the Nashville of the early 70s,\u201d he says. The disappointment was galvanising. \u201cIt helped to form the idea that, you know, maybe I could actually do that.\u201d Thus, as much as his books are populated with nanotech assemblers, haptic recon commandos, gunpacked ceramic Michikoids and all that sort of malarkey (he admits to being \u201cloosey goosey\u201d with the science), they aren\u2019t weightless fantasies. His characters eat, and have love lives and in some cases have kids and spend most of the novel looking after them. Wilf \u2013 a principal protagonist in the future London of The Peripheral \u2013 spends most of Agency babysitting: \u201cAs the narrative went on I realised that what he mostly needed to do was mind the baby \u2013 otherwise he\u2019s going to have to leave it with the nanotech pandas. And, you know, that\u2019s the naturalistic part of it. That\u2019s life.\u201d One character suffers something we\u2019ll all recognise \u2013 a \u201cmomentary pang of phonelessness\u201d. And, hilariously, Agency prominently features a kickass combat drone \u2013 like a sort of R2D2-size Swiss Army deathknife, but the heroes have to spend the whole time lugging its battery pack and charger around after it. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of my kit as well,\u201d says Gibson, patting the smartphone resting on a spare battery pack by his coffee. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to forget about the charger. You\u2019re lugging it around. You\u2019d be lost without it.\u201d The lazy shorthand with which he\u2019s sometimes described is as a prophet. How does he feel about that? An albatross around the neck, an encouraging compliment \u2013 or just part of the job? \u201cIt\u2019s actually ... It seems to be a thing. But I\u2019ve been discounting it actively throughout my entire career. I don\u2019t think you could find a single interview with me in which I don\u2019t make the point that I\u2019ve got it wrong easily as often as I\u2019ve got it sort of right.\u201d He certainly gets it right in one respect in Agency: the flashpoint crisis in the book\u2019s contemporary timeline concerns a Turkish invasion of northern Syria, complicated by Russian interference, after the US pulls out. The book would have been at the proof stage by the time Trump announced his withdrawal from the region last year. \u201cThe person who designed that crisis,\u201d Gibson says, \u201cis someone with a job in government in the United States. He\u2019s been a very good friend for quite a while, and given his professional background, I knew that he could give me something. I didn\u2019t specify that part of the world. I just said I need a Cuban missile crisis-like event that could happen now. He came up with that one almost immediately. What\u2019s been very eerie for me is seeing the actual place names I used on the news. I wrote to him immediately. He said: \u2018Well why do you think I put it in there? If that sort of thing happens it\u2019s going to happen there.\u2019\u201d Subcontracting crisis design, it bears noticing, is an extremely William Gibson thing to do. Does it matter to try to get it right, though? \u201cEvery fiction about the future is like an ice-cream cone,\u201d he says, \u201cmelting as it moves into the future. It\u2019s acquiring archaism by the second. And I\u2019m sure that Neuromancer, for instance, will ultimately be read for what it tells the future about the past. That\u2019s ultimately all we can get from old science fiction. That\u2019s the fate of antique science fiction. All science fiction eventually becomes vintage \u2013 mine included. But I knew that. I knew that before I even started writing it. And I\u2019ve always found it delightful. It\u2019s a delightful thought, as I\u2019m working, that one day this will all just be completely archaic and hokey. But it\u2019s my job to make that take quite a while.\u201d A 13-year-old reader of Neuromancer now, he points out, might well guess: \u201cThis is about what happened to all the cellphones. This cyberspace thing exists because something happened to the cellphones.\u201d And, indeed, Gibson stopped setting his novels mainly in the far future around the turn of the millennium. He changed mode. \u201cSince Pattern Recognition I\u2019ve been writing novels of the recent past. They\u2019ve tended to be published in the year after they actually take place. After the publication of All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties [1999] I had a feeling that my game was sagging a bit. Not that there\u2019s anything particularly wrong with that book \u2013 but I felt that I was losing a sense of how weird the real world around me was. Because I was busy writing novels and whatever, and I\u2019d sort of glance out of the window at the day\u2019s reality and I\u2019d go: \u2018Whoah! That was really strange.\u2019 Then I\u2019d look back down at my page and realise that that was stranger than my page, and I began to feel \u2026 uneasy.\u201d So he cast around contemporary culture \u201cfor the elements of things that I had found sufficiently weird to feel that I was still doing what I had done before\u201d. When readers don\u2019t notice that these books are set in the present day, he says, \u201cThis is a good sign. This is what I wanted.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe really scary thing about actual futurity, for me, is the newsfeed of the present day. It\u2019s something I could never have imagined. If it had been pitched to a Hollywood producer a decade ago they\u2019d say: \u2018Get outta here, never darken my door. This is ridiculous!\u2019 If I had a little window into 2019 back in 1981, instead of saying, here\u2019s some made up future shit, but what they\u2019re actually showing me is all of this \u2013 I\u2019d say some of this is so stupid. I cannot use this clownish, ludicrous behaviour by these ridiculous politicians who are beyond parody. I mean, in 1984 if someone claiming to be from the future had shown me Boris Johnson I\u2019d have told him to fuck off and quit pretending to be from the future.\u201d The Peripheral and Agency, Gibson says, will definitely be joined by a third novel to form a trilogy. This mechanism for opening an infinite branching universe of possible \u201cstubs\u201d, after all, gives him maximal room for manoeuvre. \u201cI couldn\u2019t prove this, but this is my hunch,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this is what my creative unconscious was doing with Agency and part of why it took so long \u2013 to design a sort of universal flexible joint between The Peripheral and an even more actual sequel to it. \u201cAgency is a sort of connector.

With no immigration status, they are unable to live normal lives. They cannot register to vote, work, or gain access to higher education or basic services.</p> <p>For all the government\u2019s rhetoric about the importance of social integration, it continues to preside over an immigration system that isolates and stigmatises migrants who have no home other than the UK.

Because of the length of time they have spent in the UK, and their strong ties to the country, they will normally be eligible for limited leave to remain, a \u201ctemporary\u201d status which they must maintain for 10 years, before they can apply for permanent settlement. Since 2014, the cost of limited leave to remain has increased by 238% \u2013 up from \u00a3601 per person in 2014 to \u00a32,033 (including a \u00a31,000 health surcharge) in 2019. These punishingly high fees prevent many young people from regularising the status to which they are legally entitled.</p> <p>I was born in Jamaica, and migrated to the UK at the age of eight. I have lived here ever since.

      "bodyText": "If you required any more evidence that our broken immigration system urgently needs reform, the Greater London Authority has published a troubling study by the University of Wolverhampton. It estimates that more than 332,000 children and young people (defined as 18- to 25-year-olds), 133,000 of whom live in London, are growing up in the UK without any formal immigration status. These numbers include undocumented children born in the UK to parents who are themselves undocumented, as well as those who migrated to this country at a young age, and have spent the majority of their lives here. For all of these children, the UK is their home. I am the joint chief executive of We Belong \u2013 Young Migrants Standing Up, a charity campaigning for the rights of young migrants in the UK. Many of the 1,200 young people we work with were unaware of their undocumented status up until the age of 18, when they had to provide documentation for university. With no immigration status, they are unable to live normal lives. They cannot register to vote, work, or gain access to higher education or basic services. For all the government\u2019s rhetoric about the importance of social integration, it continues to preside over an immigration system that isolates and stigmatises migrants who have no home other than the UK. In response to the GLA\u2019s research, a Home Office spokesperson stated that \u201cthere are a range of routes and options available for people of all ages to regularise their status\u201d. Anyone with direct experience of the immigration process knows that such bland assurances bear no relation to the reality of a system that is lengthy and complex. Even when young migrants become aware of their lack of legal status, the Home Office\u2019s prohibitively high fees make this difficult to remedy. Because of the length of time they have spent in the UK, and their strong ties to the country, they will normally be eligible for limited leave to remain, a \u201ctemporary\u201d status which they must maintain for 10 years, before they can apply for permanent settlement. Since 2014, the cost of limited leave to remain has increased by 238% \u2013 up from \u00a3601 per person in 2014 to \u00a32,033 (including a \u00a31,000 health surcharge) in 2019. These punishingly high fees prevent many young people from regularising the status to which they are legally entitled. I was born in Jamaica, and migrated to the UK at the age of eight. I have lived here ever since. My family was proactive, and submitted all the necessary documents for settlement in 2007; five years later, the Home Office contacted us to say that it had lost all our paperwork. In 2013, when I was 18, I found out that I was undocumented after receiving a letter stating I was subject to removal. It took me six months before I could apply for some form of legal status, and even then I was able to apply only because my fees were paid by a good Samaritan. That was just the start of my battle to maintain my status, which involves having to decode complex immigration law, as lawyers are far too expensive and legal aid is not available for immigration advice. All the money I had been saving for a mortgage had to be handed over to the Home Office instead.

      "body": "<p>There is a particular time of the week I have come to dread more than any exercise class or dental appointment: Sunday morning, when my weekly screen report flashes up on my phone. This tells me how long, on average, I have spent looking at it every day \u2013 or, to put it another way, how many grains of sand of my life I have allowed to fall into the tiny screen that I keep so close to hand I expect one day my flesh will fuse with it, a self-induced Darwinian evolution.</p> <p>We all have our self-imposed limits and, when it comes to screen time, mine has become an unjustifiable three hours a day. Imagine if I exercised, or saw friends, or wrote books, or read books for three hours a day! Such a thought is laughably unlikely now. But staring at my phone for three hours has come to feel laudably restrained, and when my screen report tells me I\u2019ve stuck to this I feel like a master of modernity: look at me, truly a titan of technology. I enjoy my phone but I am not controlled by it. Anything above three hours and I am filled with despair. Here I am, blessed with life and health, and what am I doing with it? Chucking it away down my bloody phone.</p> <p>Not since my teens, when I obsessively counted calories, has one simple activity \u2013 eating then, looking at my phone now \u2013 had the power to provoke such wildly divergent feelings in me, from pride to self-loathing. And in many ways, screen time minutes are the new calories: overanxious parents limit their children\u2019s screen time the same way they restrict their sugar intake.

      "bodyText": "There is a particular time of the week I have come to dread more than any exercise class or dental appointment: Sunday morning, when my weekly screen report flashes up on my phone. This tells me how long, on average, I have spent looking at it every day \u2013 or, to put it another way, how many grains of sand of my life I have allowed to fall into the tiny screen that I keep so close to hand I expect one day my flesh will fuse with it, a self-induced Darwinian evolution. We all have our self-imposed limits and, when it comes to screen time, mine has become an unjustifiable three hours a day. Imagine if I exercised, or saw friends, or wrote books, or read books for three hours a day! Such a thought is laughably unlikely now. But staring at my phone for three hours has come to feel laudably restrained, and when my screen report tells me I\u2019ve stuck to this I feel like a master of modernity: look at me, truly a titan of technology. I enjoy my phone but I am not controlled by it. Anything above three hours and I am filled with despair. Here I am, blessed with life and health, and what am I doing with it? Chucking it away down my bloody phone. Not since my teens, when I obsessively counted calories, has one simple activity \u2013 eating then, looking at my phone now \u2013 had the power to provoke such wildly divergent feelings in me, from pride to self-loathing. And in many ways, screen time minutes are the new calories: overanxious parents limit their children\u2019s screen time the same way they restrict their sugar intake. Self-appointed wellness gurus advise taking a break from one\u2019s phone as keenly as they counsel intermittent fasting. Looking at my phone as soon as I get on the bus has become as instinctive as tucking into a pudding after a meal once was.

Wilson is a top Republican strategist with 30 years\u2019 experience. He has made myriad attack ads, notorious among them efforts in <a href=\"https://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2397-the-nasty-realities-political-attack-ad-industry.html\">support</a> of Rudy Giuliani in New York in 1998 and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2008/03/gop-sees-rev-wright-as-path-to-victory-009116\">against</a> Obama 10 years later.</p> <p>But Wilson\u2019s first book, a bestseller released in 2018, was called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/20/everything-trump-touches-dies-review-rick-wilson-republicans\">Everything Trump Touches Dies</a>. The sequel, out next week, is Running Against the Devil. The GOP enjoyed success after success but it has fallen under the sway of Trump. Wilson wants no more.</p> <p>\u201cWe control 38 state legislatures right now and there\u2019s a reason for that: it\u2019s because of guys like me,\u201d he says, on the phone from Florida. \u201cI helped to build some of the tools in the toolbox for how you go out and exploit the cultural divisions in the country, and the political divisions, to win for Republicans in blue and purple areas. On paper it looks hard but we worked hard and recognised that the way to win is sometimes to not tell people who you really are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fc230d6faac417eb62dedf97ffc4b94114ba030f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc230d6faac417eb62dedf97ffc4b94114ba030f/0_96_820_1204/681.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Wilson.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Wilson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Rick Wilson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wilson\u2019s new book is a guide to how he thinks Trump can be beaten. The chief way to do it, he says, is to make the election a referendum on the president. He thinks impeachment and the Iran crisis, which happened after he went to press, only help prove Trump isn\u2019t fit for office.</p> <p>He thinks Democrats are making a huge mistake in the campaign so far \u2013 by telling voters who they really are. The main candidates are veering too far left, he thinks, away from the disaffected Trump voters they will have to turn. Among progressives, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is praised for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/01/elizabeth-warren-healthcare-plan-taxes\">detailed policy plans</a>. But to Wilson, Democratic \u201cpolicy is the enemy\u201d, whether it concerns Medicare for All, gun control or women\u2019s right to choose.</p> <p>\u201cGuys like me who still work on the Trump side of the fence can always turn it into something that is a millstone around their neck. It\u2019s not even that hard. Elizabeth Warren produces a 600-page healthcare plan and my research geeks can\u2019t find, I don\u2019t know, 30 things in there that I can\u2019t demagogue the hell out of? Because <em>I can</em>. Or the guys that are me now can.\u201d</p> <p>Away from the coasts and the college towns, Wilson contends, America is still a conservative place. Accordingly, Running Against the Devil contains a lot of what its author calls \u201ctough love\u201d, telling harsh truths and demanding Democrats put party purity aside. After all, the general election against Trump is going to be dirty as hell.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats tend to believe the country is completely homogenous politically,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cNo matter how meritorious their position may be on gun control, for example, or not, it just kills them in rural areas. It just destroys them.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter how much they want to talk about choice and reproductive rights, when you go into Catholic communities it is still a burden on them and they don\u2019t have this ability to say, \u2018Maybe rural Michigan isn\u2019t the same thing as San Jose, California.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Prodding a sore, Wilson insists Trump\u2019s defeat in the popular vote in 2016 \u2013 by nearly 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton \u2013 didn\u2019t matter. Nor will it matter if Trump wins in the electoral college again. Them\u2019s the rules, they ain\u2019t changing soon and if a state doesn\u2019t help paint the college blue, no Democrat should visit it for anything other than dollars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019ve got to fight where the fight is, which is these 15 electoral college swing states</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to run where the game is played and fight where the fight is, which is these 15 electoral college swing states, and those states are not as woke and liberal as other parts of the country.\u201d</p> <p>He means places like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won, and Nevada and Colorado and his home state, Florida.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t rocket science. How did we Republicans elect guys in Wisconsin and Vermont and other places in recent years? We did it because we weren\u2019t running them as national Republican figures. We helped elect a Republican governor in Vermont, four times. And you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Wow, Vermont, super liberal, how did that happen?\u2019 Well, our guy was out there saying the Bush administration was wrong on climate change.</p> <p>\u201cTry a Democrat in rural Pennsylvania, say, who comes out and says, \u2018Yes, I want to seize all automatic weapons, I want to make third trimester abortions fully taxpayer funded. That may work, that may provoke <em>hosannas</em> in San Francisco or Los Angeles. But out there? Not as much. They\u2019re like \u2026 \u2018Wait, what?\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>From Buchanan to Bernie</strong></h2> <p>Wilson is as blunt and funny as he is on the page or Twitter, relentlessly irreverent and breathtakingly brutal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b486ab2583fdfe898e8180848d062d334eeb11a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b486ab2583fdfe898e8180848d062d334eeb11a8/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders endorses Hillary Clinton at an event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in July 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders endorses Hillary Clinton at an event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Saglio/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take Bernie Sanders. Wilson doesn\u2019t just say he thinks the democratic socialist from Vermont would be the opponent of Trump\u2019s dreams, \u201cthe easiest person in the world to turn into the comic opera villain Republicans love to hate, the Castro sympathiser, the socialist, the Marxist, the guy who wants to put the aristos in the tumbril as they cart them off to the guillotine\u201d.</p> <p>He also hits Sanders for echoing Trump in harking back to an America that never was \u2013 \u201conly with more unions\u201d \u2013 and pillories him for his reaction to defeat in 2016. In Wilson\u2019s view, Sanders damaged Clinton at the polls and then, after she \u201cbeat him fair and square, he took his ball and went home\u201d, failing to support her in November. Wilson contrasts that starkly with Republican support for Trump.</p> <p>The president has the \u201cawesome\u201d advantage of incumbency and money but also \u201ca completely unified party apparatus. There\u2019s no sniping in the background; there\u2019s no Bernie out there after the nomination is done, like in the old days with George HW Bush and Pat Buchanan.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s provocative to compare Sanders the socialist to the paleo-conservative proto-Trump who played spoiler in 92. But there\u2019s always the happy distraction of listening to Wilson turn his guns on Trump.</p> <p>Running Against the Devil is pugnacious and profane. Before a break so Wilson can take a call from a \u201ctech billionaire\u201d he\u2019s sadly reluctant to name, he calls the president \u201ca liar and a corrupt asshole and a scumbag\u201d. He marvels at Trump\u2019s graft, at the way a billionaire who claimed to be un-buyable turned out to be so cheap. He does seem to think Trump is the devil. But then, the devil gets the best lines and \u201cplenty of smart, evil guys\u201d are working on his re-election push.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Obama campaigns as only he can do in American political life, that would be a meaningful lift for the Democrats</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Asked which Democrat is best suited for the fight, Wilson admits to being impressed by Warren\u2019s willingness to work hard and how she champions the little guy. But he still goes for Joe Biden.</p> <p>\u201cI think it will be Biden because name ID is very powerful,\u201d he says of the former senator and vice-president. \u201cHe is the one candidate who has shown the most ability to contrast with Trump in terms of a broader, bigger picture that isn\u2019t just locked into what\u2019s the hot flavor of Democratic messaging this year.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s talking about that big American sense of unity and reconciliation and saying we\u2019ve got to work with Republicans too.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true you don\u2019t get much policy detail at a Biden rally, but you do see plenty of slightly hokey appeals to the better angels of America\u2019s nature.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in Joe Biden that scans as evil or dark or weird or out of touch,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cHe can be a little goofy but that\u2019s not bad, not the worst thing in the world right now.</p> <p>\u201cI think neither Warren nor Sanders and certainly not Pete Buttigieg have ever had a breakthrough with African American voters sufficient to eliminate Biden\u2019s advantage. And also, Biden\u2019s got the secret weapon.</p> <p>\u201cIf Barack Obama is free to get out there and do the campaigning that only he can do in American political life, I think that would be a meaningful lift for the Democrats.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ecfcae84ab9ac306de79ca100f2ee86d4f7ca03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ecfcae84ab9ac306de79ca100f2ee86d4f7ca03/0_45_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama waves to the crowd during a rally for Wisconsin Democratic candidates in Milwaukee in October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama waves to the crowd during a rally for Wisconsin Democratic candidates in Milwaukee in October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara Stathas/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018You sometimes need hard men\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Wilson may not favor Obama ideologically but Obama beat his man twice and his respect for the 44th president is clear.

In that sense, the name of his project is fitting. Lincoln saved the union and ended slavery with all the guile and will of the most ruthless, when necessary the most <em>dirty</em> politician.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at. We are people who unsentimentally love this country and who recognise that it is fabulously resilient and powerful as an idea and a nation but that it is also fragile, and can be taken away if we are not very careful.\u201d</p> <p>Given that, what would Wilson say to a Guardian reader who asked why she should listen to the guy who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2008/03/gop-sees-rev-wright-as-path-to-victory-009116\">attacked Jeremiah Wright, Obama\u2019s pastor</a>, or shamelessly but successfully linked <a href=\"https://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2397-the-nasty-realities-political-attack-ad-industry.html\">Max Cleland</a>, a popular senator who lost three limbs in Vietnam, to Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like me.

      "bodyText": "Democratic voters should read Rick Wilson\u2019s new book, he says, and heed his advice about how to beat Donald Trump. Why? \u201cUnless your candidate is a generational superstar like Barack Obama or Bill Clinton\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s not a push to say there is no such Democrat this year \u2013 \u201cwe know all the tricks to beating them and we\u2019ve used them over and over again.\u201d By \u201cwe\u201d he means the Republican party. Wilson is a top Republican strategist with 30 years\u2019 experience. He has made myriad attack ads, notorious among them efforts in support of Rudy Giuliani in New York in 1998 and against Obama 10 years later. But Wilson\u2019s first book, a bestseller released in 2018, was called Everything Trump Touches Dies. The sequel, out next week, is Running Against the Devil. The GOP enjoyed success after success but it has fallen under the sway of Trump. Wilson wants no more. \u201cWe control 38 state legislatures right now and there\u2019s a reason for that: it\u2019s because of guys like me,\u201d he says, on the phone from Florida. \u201cI helped to build some of the tools in the toolbox for how you go out and exploit the cultural divisions in the country, and the political divisions, to win for Republicans in blue and purple areas. On paper it looks hard but we worked hard and recognised that the way to win is sometimes to not tell people who you really are.\u201d Wilson\u2019s new book is a guide to how he thinks Trump can be beaten. The chief way to do it, he says, is to make the election a referendum on the president. He thinks impeachment and the Iran crisis, which happened after he went to press, only help prove Trump isn\u2019t fit for office. He thinks Democrats are making a huge mistake in the campaign so far \u2013 by telling voters who they really are. The main candidates are veering too far left, he thinks, away from the disaffected Trump voters they will have to turn. Among progressives, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is praised for her detailed policy plans. But to Wilson, Democratic \u201cpolicy is the enemy\u201d, whether it concerns Medicare for All, gun control or women\u2019s right to choose. \u201cGuys like me who still work on the Trump side of the fence can always turn it into something that is a millstone around their neck. It\u2019s not even that hard. Elizabeth Warren produces a 600-page healthcare plan and my research geeks can\u2019t find, I don\u2019t know, 30 things in there that I can\u2019t demagogue the hell out of? Because I can. Or the guys that are me now can.\u201d Away from the coasts and the college towns, Wilson contends, America is still a conservative place. Accordingly, Running Against the Devil contains a lot of what its author calls \u201ctough love\u201d, telling harsh truths and demanding Democrats put party purity aside. After all, the general election against Trump is going to be dirty as hell. \u201cDemocrats tend to believe the country is completely homogenous politically,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cNo matter how meritorious their position may be on gun control, for example, or not, it just kills them in rural areas. It just destroys them. \u201cNo matter how much they want to talk about choice and reproductive rights, when you go into Catholic communities it is still a burden on them and they don\u2019t have this ability to say, \u2018Maybe rural Michigan isn\u2019t the same thing as San Jose, California.\u2019\u201d Prodding a sore, Wilson insists Trump\u2019s defeat in the popular vote in 2016 \u2013 by nearly 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton \u2013 didn\u2019t matter. Nor will it matter if Trump wins in the electoral college again. Them\u2019s the rules, they ain\u2019t changing soon and if a state doesn\u2019t help paint the college blue, no Democrat should visit it for anything other than dollars. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to run where the game is played and fight where the fight is, which is these 15 electoral college swing states, and those states are not as woke and liberal as other parts of the country.\u201d He means places like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won, and Nevada and Colorado and his home state, Florida. \u201cThis isn\u2019t rocket science. How did we Republicans elect guys in Wisconsin and Vermont and other places in recent years? We did it because we weren\u2019t running them as national Republican figures. We helped elect a Republican governor in Vermont, four times. And you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Wow, Vermont, super liberal, how did that happen?\u2019 Well, our guy was out there saying the Bush administration was wrong on climate change. \u201cTry a Democrat in rural Pennsylvania, say, who comes out and says, \u2018Yes, I want to seize all automatic weapons, I want to make third trimester abortions fully taxpayer funded. That may work, that may provoke hosannas in San Francisco or Los Angeles. But out there? Not as much. They\u2019re like \u2026 \u2018Wait, what?\u2019\u201d From Buchanan to Bernie Wilson is as blunt and funny as he is on the page or Twitter, relentlessly irreverent and breathtakingly brutal. Take Bernie Sanders. Wilson doesn\u2019t just say he thinks the democratic socialist from Vermont would be the opponent of Trump\u2019s dreams, \u201cthe easiest person in the world to turn into the comic opera villain Republicans love to hate, the Castro sympathiser, the socialist, the Marxist, the guy who wants to put the aristos in the tumbril as they cart them off to the guillotine\u201d. He also hits Sanders for echoing Trump in harking back to an America that never was \u2013 \u201conly with more unions\u201d \u2013 and pillories him for his reaction to defeat in 2016. In Wilson\u2019s view, Sanders damaged Clinton at the polls and then, after she \u201cbeat him fair and square, he took his ball and went home\u201d, failing to support her in November. Wilson contrasts that starkly with Republican support for Trump. The president has the \u201cawesome\u201d advantage of incumbency and money but also \u201ca completely unified party apparatus. There\u2019s no sniping in the background; there\u2019s no Bernie out there after the nomination is done, like in the old days with George HW Bush and Pat Buchanan.\u201d It\u2019s provocative to compare Sanders the socialist to the paleo-conservative proto-Trump who played spoiler in 92. But there\u2019s always the happy distraction of listening to Wilson turn his guns on Trump. Running Against the Devil is pugnacious and profane. Before a break so Wilson can take a call from a \u201ctech billionaire\u201d he\u2019s sadly reluctant to name, he calls the president \u201ca liar and a corrupt asshole and a scumbag\u201d. He marvels at Trump\u2019s graft, at the way a billionaire who claimed to be un-buyable turned out to be so cheap. He does seem to think Trump is the devil. But then, the devil gets the best lines and \u201cplenty of smart, evil guys\u201d are working on his re-election push. Asked which Democrat is best suited for the fight, Wilson admits to being impressed by Warren\u2019s willingness to work hard and how she champions the little guy. But he still goes for Joe Biden. \u201cI think it will be Biden because name ID is very powerful,\u201d he says of the former senator and vice-president. \u201cHe is the one candidate who has shown the most ability to contrast with Trump in terms of a broader, bigger picture that isn\u2019t just locked into what\u2019s the hot flavor of Democratic messaging this year. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about that big American sense of unity and reconciliation and saying we\u2019ve got to work with Republicans too.\u201d It\u2019s true you don\u2019t get much policy detail at a Biden rally, but you do see plenty of slightly hokey appeals to the better angels of America\u2019s nature. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in Joe Biden that scans as evil or dark or weird or out of touch,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cHe can be a little goofy but that\u2019s not bad, not the worst thing in the world right now. \u201cI think neither Warren nor Sanders and certainly not Pete Buttigieg have ever had a breakthrough with African American voters sufficient to eliminate Biden\u2019s advantage. And also, Biden\u2019s got the secret weapon. \u201cIf Barack Obama is free to get out there and do the campaigning that only he can do in American political life, I think that would be a meaningful lift for the Democrats.\u201d \u2018You sometimes need hard men\u2019 Wilson may not favor Obama ideologically but Obama beat his man twice and his respect for the 44th president is clear. Even more so, No 16. Wilson is a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a Super Pac named for the party\u2019s greatest leader and meant to persuade loyalists away from a man many consider its worst. Steve Bannon, the Trump whisperer, has noted that if the project achieves even slight success in key electoral college states, it could prove fatal. Wilson, the proudly ruthless ad man, cheerfully admits turning the lethal amorality of his craft to a distinctly moral end. \u201cYou sometimes need hard men and hard women to do tough things,\u201d he says. In that sense, the name of his project is fitting. Lincoln saved the union and ended slavery with all the guile and will of the most ruthless, when necessary the most dirty politician. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at. We are people who unsentimentally love this country and who recognise that it is fabulously resilient and powerful as an idea and a nation but that it is also fragile, and can be taken away if we are not very careful.\u201d Given that, what would Wilson say to a Guardian reader who asked why she should listen to the guy who attacked Jeremiah Wright, Obama\u2019s pastor, or shamelessly but successfully linked Max Cleland, a popular senator who lost three limbs in Vietnam, to Osama bin Laden. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like me. You don\u2019t have to think I\u2019m the guy you want to have over for a beer. But when it comes to being somebody who will tell you where to go, how to do it, even if you have to hold your nose to do it, I\u2019ll tell you how to get there.\u201d He means it, his tone growing stern, the words rapped out. \u201cAnd this time I am putting my ideological priors and my preferences aside, because I think that Donald Trump is an existential threat to the Republic. I\u2019ll do anything I can to help ensure that he is not president for another four years.\u201d",

Bookish and gauche, Mary is the one who can be relied on to give an ill-judged performance on the pianoforte or deliver a sententious comment at exactly the wrong moment. By the end of the novel her circumstances have changed, but she has not; she\u2019s still just as plain and awkward as she ever was, but with her sisters variously settled elsewhere, she is at least \u201cno longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\u2019 beauty and her own\u201d.</p> <p>In <em>The Other Bennet Sister</em>, Mary begins very much as Austen depicted her \u2013 plain, awkward, overlooked \u2013 but she is now our protagonist. With this shift of focus, our sympathies shift too. We find ourselves flinching with and for, but no longer because of Mary. We come to understand what has made her the way she is. From girlhood, she has been mortified by her mother, who constantly evaluates her five daughters\u2019 looks, and finds only Mary\u2019s wanting. Her father, too, is a source of grief; she is desperate to be close to him, but he makes a pet of Lizzie, and only seems to speak to Mary \u2013 Hadlow is quoting Austen here \u2013 in put-downs. Her sisters exist in fixed pair-bonds: Jane-and-Lizzie, Kitty-and-Lydia; Mary is left to drift alone. Teased, belittled and criticised, it is no wonder she is so ill at ease; no wonder she blunders.</p> <p>Hadlow takes up a handful of textual clues in Austen\u2019s novel, and from them teases out Mary\u2019s story, through childhood and early adolescence, the events of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, and then beyond, to Mr Bennet\u2019s death, the Collinses\u2019 possession of Longbourn, and then Mary\u2019s straitened circumstances as a spinster sister, dependent on the uncertain hospitality of family and friends \u2013 the Bingleys, the Darcys, the Collinses, and her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner.</p> <p>Although not suffering materially, Mary is emotionally starved; she refuses, however, to accept that this is her fate. Like Jane Eyre \u2013 with whom she has perhaps more in common than Austen\u2019s own heroines \u2013 it turns out that her unassuming exterior contains a fierce, passionate soul, keen to find expression. Mary wants. She wants experience, friendship, love; like Jane Eyre, she will settle, if she must, for the life of the mind, but she won\u2019t compromise her heart.</p> <p>Hadlow\u2019s empathy for Mary throws into sharp relief the brisk dismissiveness with which she was originally treated; in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Austen pins her down with a couple of adjectives, invites the reader to find her ridiculous, and moves swiftly on. In <em>The Other Bennet Sister</em>, Mary herself seems almost aware of a change in dispensation as she emerges from the hermetically sealed environment of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, into the world beyond: \u201cThere was no one to judge her \u2026 she might change if she wished to.\u201d</p> <p>Kindness, when she encounters it, is transformative. She has had a few precious moments of it in her early life, but her first experience of solid, steady kindness is in the Gardiner household. It\u2019s a very different family dynamic from the one in which she grew up. Here, beauty is not the chief virtue in a woman; and a person\u2019s warmth is of at least equal value to their wit. Mary can let down her defences here; she can become comfortably herself.</p> <p>In <em>The Other Bennet Sister</em>, Hadlow builds an immersive and engaging new version of a familiar world; her approach feels at once true to the source material and to life. In Austen\u2019s Elizabeth Bennet, readers glimpse the person we might aspire to be \u2013 brilliant, beautiful, ending up with all the prizes \u2013 but in Hadlow\u2019s Mary we recognise a more familiar figure: self-sabotaging, low on self-esteem, struggling to get through the day while others seem to sail effortlessly by. Hadlow\u2019s great achievement is to shift our sympathies so completely that when happiness becomes a possibility for Mary, it\u2019s difficult not to race through those final pages, desperate to know if she will, after all, be allowed \u2013 will allow herself \u2013 a happy ending.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Jo Baker\u2019s latest novel is The Body Lies (Doubleday).

Mike Evans, an evangelical leader who was invited <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/American-Politics/Evans-speaks-to-Trump-at-White-House-faith-dinner-566092\">to speak</a> in front of Trump at a White House faith dinner, is also onboard with the Cyrus analogy. He explained the idea to the Christian Broadcasting Network <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-is-king-cyrus-and-why-is-netanyahu-comparing-him-to-trump/\">in 2017</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Cyrus] was used as an instrument of God for deliverance in the Bible, and God has used this imperfect vessel, this flawed human being like you or I, this imperfect vessel, and he\u2019s using him in an incredible, amazing way to fulfill his plans and purposes,\u201d Evans said.</p> <p>At a campaign rally in Florida last week to launch a push for evangelical support Trump was introduced on stage by the Miami megachurch pastor Guillermo Maldonado as Cyrus. \u201cFather, we give you the praise and honor and we ask you that he can be the Cyrus to bring reaffirmation, to bring change into this nation, and all the nations of the Earth will say America is the greatest nation of the Earth,\u201d Maldonado said.</p> <p>Rank-and-file evangelicals have also embraced the imperfect vessel concept, and Wallnau is now selling Trump-Cyrus \u201cprayer coins\u201d \u2013 the king is in the background, a brooding profile of Trump is in the foreground \u2013 for $45 a coin.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a faith community and you make a political deal with the president, and sell your soul, you stretch to come up with a theological justification, and this seems to be the go-to, this idea,\u201d Laser said.</p> <p>The concept has since gone international, with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, making the comparison in March 2018.</p> <p>Cheered on by these, and other, prominent figures \u2013 the televangelist Paula White, who <a href=\"https://www.au.org/blogs/wall-of-separation/prosperity-gospel-tv-preacher-paula-white-says-god-approves-of-president\">claims</a> Trump has been \u201craised up by God\u201d and was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/politics/paula-white-televangelist-white-house/index.html\">appointed</a> to lead Trump\u2019s Faith and Opportunity Initiative in November is among them \u2013 white evangelical Christians have continued to support Trump.</p> <p>In return, they have been rewarded with attacks on reproductive rights and the freedoms of LGBTQ+ people, and the appointment of scores of conservative judges.</p> <p>They have also watched people with the same evangelical beliefs appointed to key government positions, as Trump has stacked his cabinet with devout Christians, some of whom have been explicit about how their faith influences their approach to government.</p> <p>\u201cMany of Trump\u2019s political appointees have, as their primary qualification, the fact that they are committed to a very distinct, conservative religious agenda,\u201d said Katherine Stewart, author of an upcoming book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Worshippers-Dangerous-Religious-Nationalism/dp/1635573432\">The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAbsent the Trump administration, many of them would never have been seen near the halls of power, and so they owe everything to Trump and his people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dffbe2f09f8752442b58b0fdef06cd1ee880354a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dffbe2f09f8752442b58b0fdef06cd1ee880354a/0_46_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: The tomb of Cyrus the Great, a revered King of the Persian Empire, is seen at Pasargadae outside Shiraz, south of Tehran, September 24, 2007.

Wallnau, a business consultant who styles himself as a doctor \u2013 his LinkedIn page credits Phoenix University of Theology as his alma mater, but the university had its 501(c)(3) status revoked by the Internal Revenue Service in 2017 and its campus appears to be a PO box in Arizona \u2013 claims the \u201cthe Lord spoke\u201d to him during the election period. According to Wallnau God said, specifically: \u201cDonald Trump is a wrecking ball to the spirit of political correctness.\u201d Wallnau is not alone on this. Mike Evans, an evangelical leader who was invited to speak in front of Trump at a White House faith dinner, is also onboard with the Cyrus analogy. He explained the idea to the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2017. \u201c[Cyrus] was used as an instrument of God for deliverance in the Bible, and God has used this imperfect vessel, this flawed human being like you or I, this imperfect vessel, and he\u2019s using him in an incredible, amazing way to fulfill his plans and purposes,\u201d Evans said. At a campaign rally in Florida last week to launch a push for evangelical support Trump was introduced on stage by the Miami megachurch pastor Guillermo Maldonado as Cyrus. \u201cFather, we give you the praise and honor and we ask you that he can be the Cyrus to bring reaffirmation, to bring change into this nation, and all the nations of the Earth will say America is the greatest nation of the Earth,\u201d Maldonado said. Rank-and-file evangelicals have also embraced the imperfect vessel concept, and Wallnau is now selling Trump-Cyrus \u201cprayer coins\u201d \u2013 the king is in the background, a brooding profile of Trump is in the foreground \u2013 for $45 a coin. \u201cIf you\u2019re a faith community and you make a political deal with the president, and sell your soul, you stretch to come up with a theological justification, and this seems to be the go-to, this idea,\u201d Laser said. The concept has since gone international, with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, making the comparison in March 2018. Cheered on by these, and other, prominent figures \u2013 the televangelist Paula White, who claims Trump has been \u201craised up by God\u201d and was appointed to lead Trump\u2019s Faith and Opportunity Initiative in November is among them \u2013 white evangelical Christians have continued to support Trump. In return, they have been rewarded with attacks on reproductive rights and the freedoms of LGBTQ+ people, and the appointment of scores of conservative judges. They have also watched people with the same evangelical beliefs appointed to key government positions, as Trump has stacked his cabinet with devout Christians, some of whom have been explicit about how their faith influences their approach to government. \u201cMany of Trump\u2019s political appointees have, as their primary qualification, the fact that they are committed to a very distinct, conservative religious agenda,\u201d said Katherine Stewart, author of an upcoming book The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism. \u201cAbsent the Trump administration, many of them would never have been seen near the halls of power, and so they owe everything to Trump and his people.\u201d Among them is Mike Pompeo, Trump\u2019s secretary of state, who was criticized in October for promoting his own speech \u201cBeing a Christian Leader\u201d, where he opined on how he asks God for direction in his work, on the state department website. In 2015 Pompeo also confirmed he believes in the Rapture, the concept of an end of days event \u2013 usually some sort of catastrophe \u2013 whereby Jesus Christ will return to Earth and escort qualified believers into heaven. Other committed evangelicals include Vice-President Mike Pence, who as governor of Indiana signed a law which allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBTQ+ people, citing religious freedom. Some of the people Trump has appointed are already making a difference. Ben Carson, who has been in charge of housing and urban development since 2017. Under Carson\u2019s leadership, Laser pointed out, Hud has proposed legislation which would allow federally funded homeless shelters to discriminate against transgender people, on religious grounds. Meanwhile, the concept of Trump channelling God\u2019s will has gained credence at the highest levels of the US government. Rick Perry, another evangelical member of Trump\u2019s cabinet who serves as energy secretary, echoed the theory of an imperfect biblical figure in November \u2013 albeit choosing different examples from Cyrus. \u201cGod\u2019s used imperfect people all through history. King David wasn\u2019t perfect. Saul wasn\u2019t perfect. Solomon wasn\u2019t perfect,\u201d Perry told Fox News in November, during an interview which was nominally about the impeachment hearing. Perry added that God had chosen Trump for the presidency. There are signs that the alliance will continue to remain strong. In March 2019 Pew Research found that \u201cwhite evangelical Protestants\u201d continued to overwhelmingly support Trump, where most other religious groups were as divided as the American people as a whole. It is that support that Trump, the imperfect vessel, will be counting on in November 2020.",

It\u2019s certainly a point Brisbane will take against one of the better teams in the competition, but City will likely view this as an opportunity lost. And maybe Brisbane will, too.

Are you just loving the <strong>ATP Cup</strong>? If your answer is no, take the blue pill. If your answer is yes, take the red pill, stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep this tennis tournament goes. One semi-final is ongoing: Serbia are one rubber to the good against Russia but Daniil Medvedev is doing his level best against Novak Djokovic. More on that shortly. Tonight at Ken Rosewall Arena, Australia and Spain will face off for the right to meet the winner of Serbia-Russia in the final. And we will have all the action of that tasty little stoush covered in a separate liveblog. For now, though, let\u2019s sink our incisors into some <strong>A-League</strong> action. Across the ditch, the Phoenix are about halfway through their encounter with the Wanderers. Later this arvo, we\u2019ll find out if Brisbane\u2019s win over Western Sydney was a fluke or not when they host high-flying Melbourne City. As ever, plenty on.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s where Sportwatch ends this Saturday. We were treated to a beauty of a tennis match between Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev, and reminded how brilliant the former is as he propelled Serbia into the ATP Cup final. In the A-League, Wellington were too good for Western Sydney while Brisbane and Melbourne City played out an entertaining draw. But enough from me. We all need to mosey on over to our liveblog of the Australia-Spain ATP Cup semi-final. Our host with the most is Jonathan Howcroft. New balls, please! Inman has a great chance to score a hat-trick and win it for the Roar deep into injury time, but it\u2019s not to be and these teams can\u2019t be split. An entertaining game, but a funny one all the same, with City dominating large parts but twice having to come from behind to share the spoils. It\u2019s certainly a point Brisbane will take against one of the better teams in the competition, but City will likely view this as an opportunity lost. And maybe Brisbane will, too. They were pretty good. Yep, a funny game. 89 mins: Brisbane Roar 2-2 Melbourne City Jamieson has a pop from distance, to no avail but he gets marks for effort and intent. Five minutes of added time. The Fox commentators reckon it should be 7-8 minutes and that time keeping in the A-League needs to be looked at. There will be a further delay with Galloway rolling an ankle and leaving the field, meaning City will finish the game with 10 men. 83 mins: Brisbane Roar 2-2 Melbourne City City make their final change, with Berenguer making way for Abdulahi. There are some tired bodies out there. 79 mins: Brisbane Roar 2-2 Melbourne City Another change for City, Atkinson off for Galloway, and another yellow card, this time for Hingert after his challenge on Noone. But the biggest moment in these past few exchanges is Gillesphey\u2019s excellent piece of defending to deny Maclaren a very agreeable shot on goal well inside the box. Still all square. 74 mins: Brisbane Roar 2-2 Melbourne City More substitutions. Roar have now spent their pennies, with Amadi-Holloway off for O\u2019Donovan, while for City Wales makes way for Colakovski. The game looks mired in a cagey period, neither side wanting to hand over the advantage. Perhaps this is the calm before the storm. And now Aldred goes in the referee\u2019s book for blocking Maclaren\u2019s run. That yellow card, Aldred\u2019s fifth, means he will sit out next week. ATP Cup: Did I mention our liveblog of the Australia-Spain semi-final is happening, like, now? Well it is. Join Jonathan Howcroft, a man who\u2019s never foot faulted in his life, apart from every time he hits the dance floor. 66 mins: Brisbane Roar 2-2 Melbourne City Have I said how much I love drinks breaks in a game of football? Oh, I have? Well, I do, I just love them. It\u2019s time for drinks. 62 mins: Brisbane Roar 2-2 Melbourne City Mauk is off and gone down the right and that\u2019s enough for Jamieson to to wrap him in a bear hug and attract the game\u2019s first yellow card, the brandishing of which draws a smile, not an argument, from the City man. 57 mins: Brisbane Roar 2-2 Melbourne City The Roar make their second substitution of the match, Muratovic coming off for ex-City man, Mauk. Here\u2019s Atkinson\u2019s goal. What a belter. GOAL! Brisbane Roar 2-2 Melbourne City (Atkinson, 48\u2019) Don\u2019t go anywhere, folks, this is nailed on to be another goal-laden thriller. Guaranteed. Atkinson is gifted time and space on the left, so Brisbane invited the strike, but that shouldn\u2019t detract from its quality: hard, low, menacing, swerving, it beats the keeper from well outside the box. Nice way to register your first A-League goal. Game, well and truly, on. ATP Cup: our liveblog of the Australia-Spain semi-final is up and running. Our man with his eye on the line, grip on the racquet and mid-shot grunt ready to be bellowed is Jonathan Howcroft. HT: Brisbane Roar 2-1 Melbourne City A busy first half and by all metrics City should be in front, but the Roar took their chances while the visitors squandered most of theirs. The stage looks set for a second half that might rival the one in Redcliffe earlier this season. GOAL! Brisbane Roar 2-1 Melbourne City (Inman, 45\u2019 +3) City give the Roar a sniff, again, and again it\u2019s Inman who makes them pay. Amadi-Holloway holds the ball up long enough to pique the attention of defenders before releasing Inman, who shows great balance and composure to beat the keeper. 43 mins: Brisbane Roar 1-1 Melbourne City Great keeping from Young to deny City the lead. Maclaren slips out the back but is denied before Wales is kept out in a one-on-one that you would be sure would be won by the striker. GOAL! Brisbane Roar 1-1 Melbourne City (Noone, 39\u2019) A nice passage of play and dare I say it, but the Roar looked to be snoozing and perhaps still celebrating that goal from Inman. Jamieson is afforded too much time and space on the left and his cross finds Maclaren, who could\u2019ve had a pop at goal but instead headed down to Noone. And the rest is history. Slack from the hosts but a goal that was coming, and deserved, after City\u2019s graft and purpose in the first 30 minutes. GOAL! Brisbane Roar 1-0 Melbourne City (Inman, 34\u2019) It\u2019s a bit messy in the area but the ball falls to Inman, who takes a touch around a defender and strikes truly to make it 1-0 to the Roar. For the first half-hour it was all City, for no goals; Brisbane pick up the pace and gain almost instant reward. That, my friends, is football. 30 mins: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Melbourne City That\u2019s a fair crack from Inman, from distance, but as full blooded as it is it\u2019s also straight to the keeper. The Roar then win a corner as they finally find their attacking prowess. Soon after, Amadi-Holloway goes down in the box. No penalty is awarded but replays show his shirt was tugged by Atkinson. Isn\u2019t that enough for VAR to get involved? Isn\u2019t it? 23 mins: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Melbourne City I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, life moves pretty fast I\u2019ll never tire of saying/writing it\u2019s time for drinks in a game of football. But it is. It\u2019s time for drinks. Save Ferris. 16 mins: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Melbourne City The Roar are defending deep and have plenty of numbers protecting their goal. Given City\u2019s firepower, they might need it. Possession to this point is over two-thirds to the visiting team. ATP Cup: it\u2019s easy to say, after witnessing a game of extreme quality, to say it\u2019s one of the best you\u2019ve seen. But that semi-final between Djokovic and Medvedev must rate up there. Certainly, Djokovic looked relieved, and enraptured, and spent, after seeing off the Russian in three sets. Here\u2019s what he had to say: It was very exhausting. It was a big battle all the way to the last shot. Daniil Medvedev is one of the best players in the world and today he showed why. He\u2019s tough to break from the baseline and this was the toughest challenge I\u2019ve had (this tournament). 8 mins: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Melbourne City Lovely through ball from Brillante almost releases Maclaren but Gillesphey intervenes with a sliding challenge that could easily have gone wrong, but went right. 4 mins: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Melbourne City Let me start by saying the deck at Suncorp looks sensational, like a billiard table. It\u2019s been a sprightly start from both teams, with the best chance going to Wales, whose shot from close range forced a good save from the Roar keeper. A-League stat attack I: Jamie Maclaren has scored 20 goals in 27 A-League games at Suncorp Stadium, twice as many as he\u2019s scored at any other venue and the third most of any player there (Besart Berisha 35, Henrique 24). A-League stat attack II: Brisbane Roar have scored at least one goal in every one of their previous 15 A-League games against Melbourne City in Queensland, scoring an average of 2.1 goals per game in that period. A-League: we\u2019re barely minutes away from the Brisbane-Melbourne City clash. Remember the last time City played in Queensland? If we get close to that 4-3 thriller again here, I think we\u2019ll all be happy. Here\u2019s the teams. It\u2019s been great to see so many sportspeople get behind the bushfire relief effort. This tragedy, this disaster, really puts sport into perspective, doesn\u2019t it? Mat Ryan\u2019s one such professional to reach into his pockets. The Wanderers showed much in the second half but leave Sky Stadium empty handed. Western Sydney have now dropped seven of their past nine in the A-League and are in a world of pain. The Phoenix, conversely, haven\u2019t lost in their past nine outings and now sit third on the ladder. Well played, Wellington. A-League: GOAL! Wellington 2-0 Western Sydney (Cacace, 88\u2019) The Wanderers, to their credit, have been all out in search of an equaliser, dominating territory and possession in the second half, but Wellington catch them with a sucker punch as Cacace finds space and shoots truly to double their lead and drive a dagger into the heart of Western Sydney. I mentioned a rousing rally in the final game of the ATP Cup semi-final. After the match, Djokovic said he doesn\u2019t know how he managed to win the point. I\u2019m with him on that one, though this just proves that superstars are capable of the seemingly impossible. Here it is. Enjoy. Djokovic is taken to deuce (four times) and needs two match points but holds his serve all the same, meaning he beats Medvedev in three sets and Serbia hold an unassailable 2-0 lead to take the tie and qualify for the final. That last game had some incredible points: Medvedev hitting a deep-court winner at 30-0 down, Djokovic winning a lengthy rally contested largely at the net, Medvedev\u2019s down-the-line backhand winner on the first match point. And, ultimately, Djokovic wearing Medvedev down with searching ground strokes. And he wins. And that is why he is an all-time great. Two hours and forty-seven minutes after they started, these two gladiators are finished. And not a bead of sweat is left on the court. ATP Cup semi-final (2nd rubber): Novak Djokovic (SRB) 6-1, 5-7, 6-4 Daniil Medvedev (RUS) (Serbia lead 2-0. Doubles dead rubber to follow) ATP Cup semi-final (2nd rubber): Third set: Novak Djokovic (SRB) 6-1, 5-7, 5-4 Daniil Medvedev (RUS) (Serbia lead 1-0) Medvedev holds. To love. Djokovic had as much interest as my savings account in that game. His eyes are on his own service game. Coming (very) soon to a liveblog near you. Serbia are four points away from the ATP Cup final. ATP Cup semi-final (2nd rubber): Third set: Novak Djokovic (SRB) 6-1, 5-7, 5-3 Daniil Medvedev (RUS) (Serbia lead 1-0) Ridiculous. Arrogant. Classy. Ruthless. Apart from one dropped point, thanks to errors entirely of his own doing, Djokovic holds to take a 5-3 lead. One more game and this rubber is toast. ATP Cup semi-final (2nd rubber): Third set: Novak Djokovic (SRB) 6-1, 5-7, 4-3 Daniil Medvedev (RUS) (Serbia lead 1-0) Medvedev holds serve. Here\u2019s his chance to break Djokovic. If he doesn\u2019t, the next time the Serbian serves will be for the match. And the tie. ATP Cup semi-final (2nd rubber): Third set: Novak Djokovic (SRB) 6-1, 5-7, 4-2 Daniil Medvedev (RUS) (Serbia lead 1-0) Djokovic holds, and fairly easily at that, so the Serbian - and Serbia! - are in the box seat here with that service break in the previous game. Medvedev needs to dig deep here and break his opponent. Easy, right?! A-League: 50 mins: Wellington 1-0 Western Sydney They\u2019ve been hard nuts to crack this season, the Phoenix, and that is proving the case again this afternoon. A goal after 15 minutes to Ulises Davila separate the sides. ATP Cup semi-final (2nd rubber): Third set: Novak Djokovic (SRB) 6-1, 5-7, 3-2 Daniil Medvedev (RUS) (Serbia lead 1-0) So, here\u2019s where we\u2019re at. Djokovic fairly well steamrollered Medvedev in the first set but the Russian lifted his game to level affairs in the second set. The third set is happening right now and is engrossing. Djokovic has just broken Medvedev in an epic game, volleying into clear court to end a long rally and take a 3-2 lead. Earlier, Lajovic beat Khachanov in straight sets to hand Serbia the first rubber. Top of the afternoon, sports fans. Are you just loving the ATP Cup? If your answer is no, take the blue pill. If your answer is yes, take the red pill, stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep this tennis tournament goes. One semi-final is ongoing: Serbia are one rubber to the good against Russia but Daniil Medvedev is doing his level best against Novak Djokovic. More on that shortly. Tonight at Ken Rosewall Arena, Australia and Spain will face off for the right to meet the winner of Serbia-Russia in the final. And we will have all the action of that tasty little stoush covered in a separate liveblog. For now, though, let\u2019s sink our incisors into some A-League action. Across the ditch, the Phoenix are about halfway through their encounter with the Wanderers. Later this arvo, we\u2019ll find out if Brisbane\u2019s win over Western Sydney was a fluke or not when they host high-flying Melbourne City. As ever, plenty on. Please get in touch by email or Twitter. But remember, all I\u2019m offering is the truth, nothing more.",

      "body": "<h2>Bridget Christie as Charles II</h2> <p>As a child I was really into old things: vintage clothing, antique furniture, ruins, listed buildings. At weekends, mum and dad would take us kids out in our Bedford van (there were nine of us) to visit stately homes and castles. I can\u2019t recall where it was exactly, but on one of these trips I saw a portrait of Charles II and I remember thinking: that bloke looks like me. Did he have certain qualities that I aspired to? Yes \u2013 being king!</p> <p>Then, in 2007, I dressed up as him for my Edinburgh show The Court Of King Charles II. The conceit was that I\u2019d travelled forward in time to the present day to see how life had changed. My opening line was something like: \u201cWelcome to the Court of King Charles II! Come with me now, back through the years. Imagine, if you can, a time very different from today\u2026 a time when a good education was a privilege of the rich, when horrendous acts of terrorism were carried out in the name of religion, when we polluted our cities and drank to oblivion. The 17th century. A time, as I say, very different from your own!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9bcfdc0e30456236fb2c5936123231f777e6b184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bcfdc0e30456236fb2c5936123231f777e6b184/1753_593_1721_1975/871.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of standup comedian, actor and writer Bridget Christie\" width=\"871\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is it Bridget\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5a1d3ce71d4c95253c00c19ed1640eb8a9086276\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a1d3ce71d4c95253c00c19ed1640eb8a9086276/1764_579_1518_1571/966.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of King Charles II of England, 1653\" width=\"966\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2026or is it Charles?

They were running a story about a house for sale that he\u2019d once visited and they used me in costume to illustrate it. Hopefully, that will happen a lot more after this article comes out. My dream is to do Who Do You Think You Are? and find out that we\u2019re related. I also get told I look like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/21/how-get-ready-laurence-llewelyn-bowen\" title=\"\">La</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/21/how-get-ready-laurence-llewelyn-bowen\" title=\"\">urence Llewelyn-Bowen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/russell-brand\" title=\"\">Russell Brand</a> and a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond\" title=\"\">Alex Salmond</a>.</p> <p>I was thrilled to dress up as Charles again; the costume I\u2019d made for myself was rubbish. When I arrived at the shoot and saw the armour, I nearly wet myself with excitement \u2013 although holding that position while the (excellent) photographer got the right shot did my back in and I had to see a chiropractor the following week.</p> <p>As a teenager, I was very self-conscious about my looks. I hated my front teeth, which were crooked, but then I got mugged in Brixton when I was 23 and had them knocked in, so they\u2019re straight now. Looks-wise, I think my best years were 15 to 21, then 33 to 36. I exercise a lot, primarily for my early osteoarthritis, but a nice side-effect is all the endorphins and chemicals it releases into your brain; I think that\u2019s had a really positive effect on how I see myself.</p> <p>I\u2019m ageing slightly better than Charles II did, but that\u2019s probably because his job (king) was more stressful than mine (clown). When I was 18, I looked like he did at 18; now that I\u2019m 48, I look like he did at 32. He should\u2019ve done some jump squats.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/frank-skinner\" title=\"\">Frank Skinner</a> as Stan Laurel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d52d4249cf97de4445e3a5e009e03b03b9c8ffe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d52d4249cf97de4445e3a5e009e03b03b9c8ffe/0_514_3840_2924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Skinner dressed as Stan Laurel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Skinner: \u2018I was only 11 when my mum pointed out the resemblance.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I grew up on Laurel and Hardy. I\u2019m aware from my own experience that comedy has got quite a fierce sell-by date, but that doesn\u2019t seem to apply to them; they made films I can remember laughing at when I was five that I\u2019d still happily watch today. Scarily, I was only about 11 or 12 when my mum pointed out my resemblance to Stan Laurel. I know he\u2019s the ultimate loser, but I was happy to hear it. I think when anyone says you look like a famous person you fiercely deny it, and then go around hoping other people will say it, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1273aef184d9857c4a2bf9f41154c58548476e45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1273aef184d9857c4a2bf9f41154c58548476e45/856_165_351_378/351.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of comedian Frank Skinner\" width=\"351\" height=\"378\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is it Frank\u2026 Photograph: BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/AVALON/avalon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d610369f521312b409225a1a95dea69781af4988\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d610369f521312b409225a1a95dea69781af4988/386_38_2143_2216/967.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of comedian Stan Laurel\" width=\"967\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2026or is it Stan?

There\u2019s one particular portrait of her in a formal blue gown that I have to admit does look quite a lot like me. I think she\u2019s grown into me, more than I\u2019ve grown into her. She was quite attractive as a young woman, and \u2013 in the kindest possible way \u2013 has crumbled into me.</p> <p>I don\u2019t get many compliments on my looks. I used to care about my appearance, but now I don\u2019t. Some people have a period when they actually look quite good, and then it goes. Remember there was a year and a half when Prince William looked really hot? That\u2019s the cruellest \u2013 to give and then take away. I think I was always a 62-year-old man in waiting. Even as a child, I looked right in a cardigan. These days, I\u2019ve adopted the \u201cBolivian peasant woman on the cover of National Geographic\u201d look \u2013 really lived-in and lined. There\u2019s a Laurel and Hardy film called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbb0o3WwSJA\" title=\"\">Atoll K</a> where Laurel looks terrible, older and quite ill. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/david-baddiel\" title=\"\">David Baddiel</a> and I did photoshoots we used to say, \u201cWe look a bit Atoll K\u201d, so it\u2019s become a byword for ageing.</p> <p>I always had the sort of physique that meant I couldn\u2019t take my T-shirt off on the beach, but I think that\u2019s a virtue in comedy. You have to be an everyman, which is hard if you look like Johnny Depp. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/henrynormal\" title=\"\">Henry Normal</a> told me I had a face for comedy, because I look like I\u2019ve been kicked about.

When it happens to me, I sometimes just take credit for his work. I could never see the resemblance until <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM52hmBZgzw\" title=\"\">we both appeared on QI</a> and they dressed us identically and sat us next to each other. Then I had to admit it.</p> <p>I get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/07/anton-du-beke-strictly-dancer-interview\" title=\"\">Anton </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/07/anton-du-beke-strictly-dancer-interview\" title=\"\">du Beke</a> all the time, particularly when Strictly is on. I was once stopped outside a coffee shop by a woman who said, \u201cAnton, it\u2019s so great to see you, wasn\u2019t that an amazing wedding?\u201d I told her I hadn\u2019t been at any wedding, but Anton is a bit of a card, so I think she thought I \u2013 or he \u2013 was having her on. Then she got cross, and decided Anton had got a bit big for his boots. When I left, she was still convinced he had been incredibly rude.</p> <p>In my 20s, I thought about my appearance a lot. I lived in fear that I would start to lose my hair \u2013 it was the worst thing I could possibly imagine. The weird thing is, when I did start to lose it, I wasn\u2019t bothered. The neurosis must have been about something else. As an actor, you\u2019re constantly being given opinions about your appearance, and it actually makes you less self-conscious. You become inoculated against any sense that your body belongs to you.</p> <p>I\u2019m a lot less concerned with how I look these days. When you\u2019re growing up, there\u2019s still a chance you might manifest your dream appearance. Once you stop changing so much, you realise that\u2019s not going to happen. When you\u2019re 16, you might end up looking like George Clooney \u2013 who knows? But when you\u2019re 53, you know you look like Anton du Beke.</p> <p><em>Ben Miller\u2019s book The Boy Who Made The World Disappear is out now.</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/25/rylan-clark-neal-i-knew-i-had-to-be-the-gay-stereotype-i-played-the-game\" title=\"\">Rylan Clark-Neal</a> as Olivier Giroud</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c10a2297e98d6d425422794e36a22df7ed84d578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c10a2297e98d6d425422794e36a22df7ed84d578/0_1092_5640_6737/837.jpg\" alt=\"TV star Rylan Clark-Neal dressed as footballer Olivier Giroud\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rylan Clark-Neal: \u2018I know Chelsea\u2019s match schedule just from looking at my Twitter mentions.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Brooks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I used to get about a thousand tweets every time Arsenal played, saying, \u201cRylan\u2019s up front.\u201d I had no idea what everyone was on about.

He\u2019s probably thinking: who is Rylan?

That\u2019s stayed with me. Everyone thinks I\u2019m ultra-confident, but I\u2019d rather look like anyone but myself. I\u2019ve changed my face so much over the last 10 years: the structure, the colour. I\u2019ve had Botox and fillers, as well as a few other procedures, and I dye my hair and beard black. I\u2019ve also had my share of things that have gone wrong: my lip burst open and fell on the floor because I\u2019d had too much filler. I wish more people were open about what they\u2019ve had done. A friend of a friend asked a well-known woman where she\u2019d had her facelift done, because they wanted a recommendation, and she was really offended. Let\u2019s be fair: that hasn\u2019t happened using Nivea, has it?</p> <p>There was nothing wrong with my teeth, but I wanted veneers, and now they\u2019re more famous than me: I get told I look as if I could eat an apple through a letterbox. I want a six-pack, but who doesn\u2019t? Unfortunately, the only time I go into my home gym is to grab a Lucozade. I keep joking I\u2019ll get double-A implants to look like pecs, but I never would.</p> <p>Fame has made me even less comfortable with myself, because I\u2019m always being looked at and judged. People say so many things to me and I think: I\u2019m rich, I don\u2019t care. But the one thing that gets to me is when people say I\u2019m arrogant. In reality, I\u2019m my own biggest troll.

At school discos, everyone would be in cool clothes, and I\u2019d be there in a homemade fishtail gown with my hair brushed out, doing all her dance moves and mannerisms.

Maybe that\u2019s another reason why I latched on to Diana \u2013 she was the closest I could get to seeing myself represented. At school, I was bullied a lot about my colour. I became incredibly insecure, and was anorexic from 13 to 18. Going on the X Factor and being put into Little Mix helped me to recover.

We just laughed.</p> <p>Other scrutiny was harder. On one of our first photoshoots, the magazine Photoshopped my nose, which gave me such a complex. Suddenly I thought: is that how I\u2019m supposed to look? For years afterwards, I wanted a nose job, and then a boob job. I still have days where I have a breakout and I feel like shit, but I get over it. Now I\u2019m happy with my \u201cfashion\u201d tits; I\u2019m happy with my face.

Like me, a lot of drag queens are inspired by Diana: she\u2019s the ultimate diva, polished, glamorous and larger than life. When I used to sing in old people\u2019s homes or clubs and bars in the north-east, I\u2019d always try to embody her. Even now, when Little Mix sing ballads, I channel Diana Ross.

      "bodyText": "Bridget Christie as Charles II As a child I was really into old things: vintage clothing, antique furniture, ruins, listed buildings. At weekends, mum and dad would take us kids out in our Bedford van (there were nine of us) to visit stately homes and castles. I can\u2019t recall where it was exactly, but on one of these trips I saw a portrait of Charles II and I remember thinking: that bloke looks like me. Did he have certain qualities that I aspired to? Yes \u2013 being king! Then, in 2007, I dressed up as him for my Edinburgh show The Court Of King Charles II. The conceit was that I\u2019d travelled forward in time to the present day to see how life had changed. My opening line was something like: \u201cWelcome to the Court of King Charles II! Come with me now, back through the years. Imagine, if you can, a time very different from today\u2026 a time when a good education was a privilege of the rich, when horrendous acts of terrorism were carried out in the name of religion, when we polluted our cities and drank to oblivion. The 17th century. A time, as I say, very different from your own!\u201d After the show, the Daily Mail mistook a photograph of me dressed as Charles II for the actual Charles II. They were running a story about a house for sale that he\u2019d once visited and they used me in costume to illustrate it. Hopefully, that will happen a lot more after this article comes out. My dream is to do Who Do You Think You Are? and find out that we\u2019re related. I also get told I look like Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, Russell Brand and a young Alex Salmond. I was thrilled to dress up as Charles again; the costume I\u2019d made for myself was rubbish. When I arrived at the shoot and saw the armour, I nearly wet myself with excitement \u2013 although holding that position while the (excellent) photographer got the right shot did my back in and I had to see a chiropractor the following week. As a teenager, I was very self-conscious about my looks. I hated my front teeth, which were crooked, but then I got mugged in Brixton when I was 23 and had them knocked in, so they\u2019re straight now. Looks-wise, I think my best years were 15 to 21, then 33 to 36. I exercise a lot, primarily for my early osteoarthritis, but a nice side-effect is all the endorphins and chemicals it releases into your brain; I think that\u2019s had a really positive effect on how I see myself. I\u2019m ageing slightly better than Charles II did, but that\u2019s probably because his job (king) was more stressful than mine (clown). When I was 18, I looked like he did at 18; now that I\u2019m 48, I look like he did at 32. He should\u2019ve done some jump squats. Frank Skinner as Stan Laurel I grew up on Laurel and Hardy. I\u2019m aware from my own experience that comedy has got quite a fierce sell-by date, but that doesn\u2019t seem to apply to them; they made films I can remember laughing at when I was five that I\u2019d still happily watch today. Scarily, I was only about 11 or 12 when my mum pointed out my resemblance to Stan Laurel. I know he\u2019s the ultimate loser, but I was happy to hear it. I think when anyone says you look like a famous person you fiercely deny it, and then go around hoping other people will say it, too. The other person I often get mistaken for is Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. There\u2019s one particular portrait of her in a formal blue gown that I have to admit does look quite a lot like me. I think she\u2019s grown into me, more than I\u2019ve grown into her. She was quite attractive as a young woman, and \u2013 in the kindest possible way \u2013 has crumbled into me. I don\u2019t get many compliments on my looks. I used to care about my appearance, but now I don\u2019t. Some people have a period when they actually look quite good, and then it goes. Remember there was a year and a half when Prince William looked really hot? That\u2019s the cruellest \u2013 to give and then take away. I think I was always a 62-year-old man in waiting. Even as a child, I looked right in a cardigan. These days, I\u2019ve adopted the \u201cBolivian peasant woman on the cover of National Geographic\u201d look \u2013 really lived-in and lined. There\u2019s a Laurel and Hardy film called Atoll K where Laurel looks terrible, older and quite ill. When David Baddiel and I did photoshoots we used to say, \u201cWe look a bit Atoll K\u201d, so it\u2019s become a byword for ageing. I always had the sort of physique that meant I couldn\u2019t take my T-shirt off on the beach, but I think that\u2019s a virtue in comedy. You have to be an everyman, which is hard if you look like Johnny Depp. Henry Normal told me I had a face for comedy, because I look like I\u2019ve been kicked about. I\u2019m never sure if really good-looking people can be profoundly funny. Frank Skinner\u2019s Showbiz is at London\u2019s Garrick Theatre from 13 January to 15 February, nimaxtheatres.com. Ben Miller as Anton du Beke If looks were gears, I\u2019d be in neutral. I\u2019ve always had a face that people think belongs to someone else. When I was growing up in Nantwich I had a doppelganger I never met, and I would often bump into people who were convinced I was him. Once upon a time, I used to get told I looked like Daniel Day-Lewis. Unbelievably, I used to find that quite annoying, because I desperately wanted to make my own mark on the world. Daniel Day-Lewis quickly morphed into Griff Rhys Jones and now I quite enjoy looking like other people. My averageness is my greatest weapon as an actor. Rob Brydon and I get mistaken for each other a lot, and he sends me texts to update me on his encounters (\u201cMiddle-class man, ginger hair, loved Death In Paradise\u201d). When it happens to me, I sometimes just take credit for his work. I could never see the resemblance until we both appeared on QI and they dressed us identically and sat us next to each other. Then I had to admit it. I get Anton du Beke all the time, particularly when Strictly is on. I was once stopped outside a coffee shop by a woman who said, \u201cAnton, it\u2019s so great to see you, wasn\u2019t that an amazing wedding?\u201d I told her I hadn\u2019t been at any wedding, but Anton is a bit of a card, so I think she thought I \u2013 or he \u2013 was having her on. Then she got cross, and decided Anton had got a bit big for his boots. When I left, she was still convinced he had been incredibly rude. In my 20s, I thought about my appearance a lot. I lived in fear that I would start to lose my hair \u2013 it was the worst thing I could possibly imagine. The weird thing is, when I did start to lose it, I wasn\u2019t bothered. The neurosis must have been about something else. As an actor, you\u2019re constantly being given opinions about your appearance, and it actually makes you less self-conscious. You become inoculated against any sense that your body belongs to you. I\u2019m a lot less concerned with how I look these days. When you\u2019re growing up, there\u2019s still a chance you might manifest your dream appearance. Once you stop changing so much, you realise that\u2019s not going to happen. When you\u2019re 16, you might end up looking like George Clooney \u2013 who knows? But when you\u2019re 53, you know you look like Anton du Beke. Ben Miller\u2019s book The Boy Who Made The World Disappear is out now. Rylan Clark-Neal as Olivier Giroud I used to get about a thousand tweets every time Arsenal played, saying, \u201cRylan\u2019s up front.\u201d I had no idea what everyone was on about. Then, a year or two ago I was watching football and a friend pointed at Olivier Giroud and said, \u201cI thought that was you.\u201d That\u2019s when the penny dropped. Now, I know Chelsea\u2019s match schedule just from looking at my Twitter mentions. I feel sorry for Olivier if he\u2019s getting \u201cRylan!\u201d shouted at him when he\u2019s playing. He\u2019s probably thinking: who is Rylan? And when he finds out, he\u2019ll think: is that what I look like? I\u2019m extremely flattered by the comparison: he\u2019s a good-looking bloke \u2013 but I don\u2019t think I look anything like him. I wish I did. Maybe when my face is painted on there\u2019s a slight resemblance. I also get told I look like a young version of [TV presenter and former soldier] Ant Middleton, and Freddie Mercury, because of my teeth. A few people have said I look like Jesus. One woman stopped me in a petrol station and called me the Messiah, but maybe she wasn\u2019t on the best form that day. When I was growing up, I was chubby, ginger and gay \u2013 I only needed glasses to have the set. That\u2019s stayed with me. Everyone thinks I\u2019m ultra-confident, but I\u2019d rather look like anyone but myself. I\u2019ve changed my face so much over the last 10 years: the structure, the colour. I\u2019ve had Botox and fillers, as well as a few other procedures, and I dye my hair and beard black. I\u2019ve also had my share of things that have gone wrong: my lip burst open and fell on the floor because I\u2019d had too much filler. I wish more people were open about what they\u2019ve had done. A friend of a friend asked a well-known woman where she\u2019d had her facelift done, because they wanted a recommendation, and she was really offended. Let\u2019s be fair: that hasn\u2019t happened using Nivea, has it? There was nothing wrong with my teeth, but I wanted veneers, and now they\u2019re more famous than me: I get told I look as if I could eat an apple through a letterbox. I want a six-pack, but who doesn\u2019t? Unfortunately, the only time I go into my home gym is to grab a Lucozade. I keep joking I\u2019ll get double-A implants to look like pecs, but I never would. Fame has made me even less comfortable with myself, because I\u2019m always being looked at and judged. People say so many things to me and I think: I\u2019m rich, I don\u2019t care. But the one thing that gets to me is when people say I\u2019m arrogant. In reality, I\u2019m my own biggest troll. I wish those people could see the real me. Jade Thirlwall as Diana Ross When I was a kid, I thought my mam was Diana Ross. Everybody said she was the absolute double of her, and when she\u2019d go to the bingo, she\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m going out now, to do a concert.\u201d We always had Diana Ross playing in the house, and I was obsessed. At school discos, everyone would be in cool clothes, and I\u2019d be there in a homemade fishtail gown with my hair brushed out, doing all her dance moves and mannerisms. Every week I sent a tape of myself performing Chain Reaction to Stars In Their Eyes \u2013 until my mam realised it\u2019s actually quite a rude song. I\u2019m Arab, and when I was growing up there weren\u2019t many famous people who looked like me. Maybe that\u2019s another reason why I latched on to Diana \u2013 she was the closest I could get to seeing myself represented. At school, I was bullied a lot about my colour. I became incredibly insecure, and was anorexic from 13 to 18. Going on the X Factor and being put into Little Mix helped me to recover. I knew I\u2019d never be able to be a singer and live my dream if I stayed the way I was; having that goal was my light at the end of the tunnel. People think that girl band members are competitive, but my saving grace was being put in a group where we supported each other and gave each other confidence boosts. We were so young when we won, and very naive. Early on, the record company called us in for a meeting and told us that we had to stop walking around in onesies and Ugg boots because we were making them look bad. We just laughed. Other scrutiny was harder. On one of our first photoshoots, the magazine Photoshopped my nose, which gave me such a complex. Suddenly I thought: is that how I\u2019m supposed to look? For years afterwards, I wanted a nose job, and then a boob job. I still have days where I have a breakout and I feel like shit, but I get over it. Now I\u2019m happy with my \u201cfashion\u201d tits; I\u2019m happy with my face. I look in the mirror and I see someone I love. On stage, I tend to dress either like a boy or a drag queen \u2013 there\u2019s no in between. I\u2019ve loved drag ever since we used to go on family holidays to Benidorm and watch the shows there. Like me, a lot of drag queens are inspired by Diana: she\u2019s the ultimate diva, polished, glamorous and larger than life.

      "body": "<p>Federico Fellini celebrates his 100th birthday on 20 January \u2013 in an inactive sense, admittedly, given that he left us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/nov/01/federico-fellini-dies-film-italy\" title=\"\">back in 1993</a>. It\u2019s a centenary worth noting. Thirty years on from his last film, Fellini still feels like the first name in Italian cinema, the one laymen can remember even if they\u2019ve never seen a frame of his work, and the one whose imprint \u2013 or many imprints, given his wild directorial evolution from stark neorealism to baroque stylisation \u2013 is most visible in the contemporary work of compatriots from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/paolo-sorrentino-my-characters-struggles-are-the-struggles-i-have\" title=\"\">Paolo Sorrentino</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/31/alice-rohrwacher-italian-film-director-interview-happy-as-lazzaro\" title=\"\">Alice Rohrwacher</a>.</p> <p>The BFI is marking the milestone with a touring retrospective of Fellini\u2019s work, though the BFI Player has some choice fare for those who can\u2019t get to a cinema. The centrepiece of <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/search/subscription?q=fellini\" title=\"\">their selection</a>, unsurprisingly, is <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-la-dolce-vita-1960-online\" title=\"\">La Dolce Vita</a></strong>, itself celebrating a 60th anniversary this year, and still looking rather chic \u2013 thanks in part to a recent 4K facelift. Once an emblem of new-era hedonism, its roving, restlessly horny tour through Rome\u2019s beautiful celebrity set may not shock as it once did, but it retains its mesmerising whirligig energy. If the paparazzi-targeting satire seems a little less harsh these days too, that\u2019s largely because so much pop commentary has followed in its sleek-suited, skinny-tied image. And was Marcello Mastroianni ever so electric?</p> <p>The other essential title on offer is <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-8-12-1963-online\" title=\"\">8\u00bd</a></strong>, another exercise in darkly glamorous soul-searching, though its edge has perhaps stayed a little sharper over the decades. This, of course, is Fellini\u2019s moody, distorted self-portrait, with Mastroianni as a tortured, ambitious auteur losing himself amid fawning admirers, clashing desires and wildly spiralling artistic goals. It\u2019s still the most headily seductive and repulsive of all films about film-making: watch it in a double feature with Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s complementary <em>Pain and Glory</em> (see below).</p> <p>The BFI\u2019s other picks are slightly deeper cuts. Initially made for Italian TV, his 1970 documentary <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-i-clowns-1970-online\" title=\"\">I </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-i-clowns-1970-online\" title=\"\">Clowns</a></strong> delves into his fascination with those painted circus stalwarts, though it might help to share his enthusiasm. A curio he sandwiched between making <em>La Dolce Vita</em> and <em>8\u00bd</em>, the 1962 portmanteau film <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-boccaccio-70-1962-online\" title=\"\">Boccaccio \u2019</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-boccaccio-70-1962-online\" title=\"\">70</a></strong> assembles four short films by Fellini, Luchino Visconti, Vittorio De Sica and Mario Monicelli for a bawdy, roundabout view of romantic morals and mores in the then modern Italy, it\u2019s most interesting as a snapshot of each auteur\u2019s contrasting style and preoccupations at the time. Riffing lightly off<em> La Dolce Vita</em>, Fellini\u2019s contribution, <em>The Temptation of Dr Antonio</em> \u2013 about a self-appointed moral guardian haunted by visions of Anita Ekberg \u2013 is more amusing than major.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu31qX4MJ7w\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Iu31qX4MJ7w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu31qX4MJ7w\">Watch a trailer for the BFI\u2019s Fellini season.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>A more intriguing anthology film on the menu is <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-lamore-1948-online\" title=\"\">L\u2019Amore</a></strong>, a two-part project directed by Roberto Rossellini from separate scripts by Fellini and Jean Cocteau. In Fellini\u2019s section, he also stars as a handsome drifter taken for a saint by a naively devout peasant (Anna Magnani): once banned in the US, it\u2019s lithely provocative and sensuous.</p> <p>Those titles are all available to BFI Player subscribers; casual punters can stream <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-i-vitelloni-1953-online\" title=\"\">I Vitelloni</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-amarcord-1972-online\" title=\"\">Amarcord</a></strong> on a pay-per-view basis. Both are superb, with variously autobiographical elements: the former a lively, rough-and-ready study of young masculinity battling the strictures of postwar provincial life, the latter a riotously colourful but tender trawl through a fascist-era childhood, peppered with grotesques and eccentrics.</p> <p>If you want to continue your Fellini exploration beyond the BFI Player, meanwhile, other streaming options include <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B082DHJHS2?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=B082DHJHS2&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=just016-21\" title=\"\">Juliet of the Spirits</a></strong>, his glorious magical-realist tale of a neglected wife\u2019s psychological liberation, available for free to Amazon Prime subscribers, or <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45CcuiKwvmc\" title=\"\">La Strada</a></strong>, his heart-piercing and enduringly influential study of a young woman sold to a travelling carnival, available on YouTube.

      "bodyText": "Federico Fellini celebrates his 100th birthday on 20 January \u2013 in an inactive sense, admittedly, given that he left us back in 1993. It\u2019s a centenary worth noting. Thirty years on from his last film, Fellini still feels like the first name in Italian cinema, the one laymen can remember even if they\u2019ve never seen a frame of his work, and the one whose imprint \u2013 or many imprints, given his wild directorial evolution from stark neorealism to baroque stylisation \u2013 is most visible in the contemporary work of compatriots from Paolo Sorrentino to Alice Rohrwacher. The BFI is marking the milestone with a touring retrospective of Fellini\u2019s work, though the BFI Player has some choice fare for those who can\u2019t get to a cinema. The centrepiece of their selection, unsurprisingly, is La Dolce Vita, itself celebrating a 60th anniversary this year, and still looking rather chic \u2013 thanks in part to a recent 4K facelift. Once an emblem of new-era hedonism, its roving, restlessly horny tour through Rome\u2019s beautiful celebrity set may not shock as it once did, but it retains its mesmerising whirligig energy. If the paparazzi-targeting satire seems a little less harsh these days too, that\u2019s largely because so much pop commentary has followed in its sleek-suited, skinny-tied image. And was Marcello Mastroianni ever so electric? The other essential title on offer is 8\u00bd, another exercise in darkly glamorous soul-searching, though its edge has perhaps stayed a little sharper over the decades. This, of course, is Fellini\u2019s moody, distorted self-portrait, with Mastroianni as a tortured, ambitious auteur losing himself amid fawning admirers, clashing desires and wildly spiralling artistic goals. It\u2019s still the most headily seductive and repulsive of all films about film-making: watch it in a double feature with Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s complementary Pain and Glory (see below). The BFI\u2019s other picks are slightly deeper cuts. Initially made for Italian TV, his 1970 documentary I Clowns delves into his fascination with those painted circus stalwarts, though it might help to share his enthusiasm. A curio he sandwiched between making La Dolce Vita and 8\u00bd, the 1962 portmanteau film Boccaccio \u201970 assembles four short films by Fellini, Luchino Visconti, Vittorio De Sica and Mario Monicelli for a bawdy, roundabout view of romantic morals and mores in the then modern Italy, it\u2019s most interesting as a snapshot of each auteur\u2019s contrasting style and preoccupations at the time. Riffing lightly off La Dolce Vita, Fellini\u2019s contribution, The Temptation of Dr Antonio \u2013 about a self-appointed moral guardian haunted by visions of Anita Ekberg \u2013 is more amusing than major. A more intriguing anthology film on the menu is L\u2019Amore, a two-part project directed by Roberto Rossellini from separate scripts by Fellini and Jean Cocteau. In Fellini\u2019s section, he also stars as a handsome drifter taken for a saint by a naively devout peasant (Anna Magnani): once banned in the US, it\u2019s lithely provocative and sensuous. Those titles are all available to BFI Player subscribers; casual punters can stream I Vitelloni and Amarcord on a pay-per-view basis. Both are superb, with variously autobiographical elements: the former a lively, rough-and-ready study of young masculinity battling the strictures of postwar provincial life, the latter a riotously colourful but tender trawl through a fascist-era childhood, peppered with grotesques and eccentrics. If you want to continue your Fellini exploration beyond the BFI Player, meanwhile, other streaming options include Juliet of the Spirits, his glorious magical-realist tale of a neglected wife\u2019s psychological liberation, available for free to Amazon Prime subscribers, or La Strada, his heart-piercing and enduringly influential study of a young woman sold to a travelling carnival, available on YouTube. Finally, in a happy confluence, Fellini\u2019s rarely seen directorial debut, The White Sheik \u2013 a spry, playful romantic comedy matching earthy realism with flighty farce \u2013 is on Mubi\u2019s streaming menu for the next three weeks. In all, a welcome shot of Italian warmth in the new year drear. New to streaming and DVD this week Pain and Glory (Path\u00e9, 15) Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s latest continues in the more melancholic, autumnal vein of 2016\u2019s Julieta, but this time with a more personal spin. Reunited with him after nearly 30 years, Antonio Banderas is on career-best form as the director\u2019s aching alter ego. Rojo (Drakes Avenue, 15) If you missed this Argentine stunner on its small cinema release, catch up with it now. A queasily atmospheric thriller set on the brink of the 1975 coup d\u2019etat, Benjamin Naishtat\u2019s film prickles with political rage and social malaise. It Chapter 2 (Warner Bros, 15) The Stephen King chestnut of your childhood nightmares lumbers on in the starrier second half of Andy Muschietti\u2019s adaptation. It\u2019s polished and duly spooky on a scene-to-scene basis, but why on earth is it three hours long? Holiday (Sony, U) Still stuck in the January doldrums? Here\u2019s all you need: given a sparkly Criterion treatment, George Cukor\u2019s 1938 cross-class romance is among the most perfect of all Hollywood romcoms, played with fleet joy by Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant.",

      "body": "<p>The Voyager mission has not lacked for highlights, having beamed back the first glimpses of methane oceans, erupting volcanos on a Jovian moon and a thunderstorm on Saturn. But Prof Ed Stone, who has been at Voyager\u2019s scientific helm since 1972, says there is one place above all that he longs to visit again.</p> <p>The veteran space scientist is calling for a return mission to Saturn\u2019s icy moon, Enceladus, whose underground oceans are widely viewed as the most promising place in the solar system in which to hunt for extraterrestrial life.</p> <p>\u201cWe really need to get back and look at that moon,\u201d said Stone, 83, a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology. \u201cWe know there\u2019s water ice evaporating \u2013 geysering \u2013 from its south pole.

But Prof Ed Stone, who has been at Voyager\u2019s scientific helm since 1972, says there is one place above all that he longs to visit again. The veteran space scientist is calling for a return mission to Saturn\u2019s icy moon, Enceladus, whose underground oceans are widely viewed as the most promising place in the solar system in which to hunt for extraterrestrial life. \u201cWe really need to get back and look at that moon,\u201d said Stone, 83, a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology. \u201cWe know there\u2019s water ice evaporating \u2013 geysering \u2013 from its south pole.

A political party and militant organisation, it emerged as a fighting force in the early 1980s, during the country\u2019s civil war, but now operates on an international stage.</p> <p>Iran supplied the group with weapons during its 2006 war against Israel; more recently it has been mobilised as one of the most effective groups fighting for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. It gets up to $700m (\u00a3535m) in annual support from Iran, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/ad333db280bd4d72baa064ba8cde4d0c/Taking-aim-at-Iran,-US-hits-Hezbollah-with-new-sanctions\">the US government has estimated.</a></p> <h2>IRAQ</h2> <p>Iraq is perhaps the regional power most directly under Tehran\u2019s influence. Suleimani shaped governments for years and last year the scale of Iranian political and military control helped spur a broad protest movement for reform.</p> <p>It is the base for a range of proxy groups and militias. Perhaps the oldest is the Badr corps (later Badr organisation), originally formed as a force of Iraqi exiles fighting for Tehran in the Iran-Iraq war nearly 40 years ago.</p> <p>They moved back into Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein and were joined by other Iran-linked groups such as the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr\u2019s Mahdi army, which targeted the US using roadside bombs, rockets and other attacks.</p> <p>The rise of Islamic State shifted the dynamic in Iraq again, even prompting some unofficial cooperation with the US on the battlefield against a shared enemy.</p> <p>But it also spawned the rise of the PMF (Popular Mobilisation Force) militias, recruited to fight Isis but more recently involved in anti-US action. They include Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, which led <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/us-embassy-stormed-in-baghdad\">attacks on the US embassy in Baghdad</a> over the New Year festivities, and whose leader was killed with Suleimani.</p> <h2>SYRIA</h2> <p>Iran has been involved in Syria\u2019s civil war almost since its start; in 2012 opposition forces captured 48 Iranian \u201cmilitary pilgrims\u201d claiming to visit a shrine, although they were important enough to be swapped for thousands of captives.</p> <p>When Iran first admitted it had \u201cvolunteers\u201d on the ground, it claimed they were there to protect holy sites. But as Assad\u2019s hold on his country crumbled, they became more visible. Hezbollah joined the fight, and dozens of small Shia militias were formed to fight for Assad around the country.</p> <p>Some drew recruits from abroad, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. Others were made up of Syrian fighters, but received funding and weapons from Tehran. Together with Russian airpower and other military support, they turned the tide of the war in Assad\u2019s favour and helped maintain control over newly recaptured areas.</p> <h2>YEMEN</h2> <p>Tehran is backing rebel Houthi forces in the country\u2019s civil war, which began in 2015, providing them with advisers, cash and hi-tech weaponry, including drones that can operate in the air and water.</p> <p>Born out of the Arab Spring, the conflict has effectively become a brutal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/iran-saudi-proxy-war-yemen-crisis\">proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia</a>, fighting on broad sectarian lines, although the Houthis mostly follow a different branch of Shia Islam.</p> <p>Last September, Houthi rebels claimed an attack on Saudi Arabian oil installations, which caused a dramatic cut in output. Western powers later blamed Iran, either for managing the operation or carrying it out using Houthis as cover. The US said there was no evidence the assault originated in Yemen.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/yemen-peace-talks-un-says-hodeidah-should-be-under-joint-control\">Peace talks late last year</a> have raised questions about the durability of Iranian influence there however, should the conflict end.</p> <h2>PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES</h2> <p>Iran has an alliance of convenience with the extremist Palestinian group Hamas, a Sunni organisation which is happy to take Iran\u2019s money and arms while their interests are aligned in challenging Israel.</p> <p>\u201cHamas does not expect direct and sustained Iranian assistance during a conflict, nor does it assume that Tehran would subordinate its interests to Hamas\u2019s as part of regional brinkmanship or dealmaking,\u201d according to the <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/iran-dossier/iran-19-03-ch-1-tehrans-strategic-intent\">International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).</a></p> <h2>AFGHANISTAN</h2> <p>Last year, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-talks-iran/iran-says-taliban-must-have-afghan-role-but-cant-dominate-idUSKCN1P311Z\">acknowledged</a> that Iran had some cooperation with the Taliban and added it was impossible to imagine Afghanistan\u2019s future \u201cwithout any role for the Taliban\u201d.</p> <p>There is little ideological or religious affinity with the Taliban, who are Sunni extremists, but Iran has always been pragmatic about its alliances. The two countries share a border, and Tehran and the militants share an enemy in the US.</p> <p>Afghanistan, and neighbouring Pakistan, have also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/recruited-by-iran-to-fight-for-syrian-regime-young-afghans-bring-home-cash-and-scars/2018/07/29/ecf9e34c-64e0-11e8-81ca-bb14593acaa6_story.html\">proved a fertile recruiting ground </a>for young men to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-pakistan-iran/iran-recruits-pakistani-shiites-for-combat-in-syria-idUSKBN0TT22S20151210\">fight in militias backing Assad</a> in Syria.</p> <h2>BAHRAIN, KUWAIT, SAUDI ARABIA</h2> <p>Iran has sought influence among Shia communities in these countries, but because they are all wealthy with strong security forces, its efforts have faced far more obstacles than in other parts of the Middle East.</p> <p>They have offered support for militant grounds, including reportedly training for Bahraini fighters with pro-Iran groups in Iraq, the IISS says. But this is \u201cprimarily meant to irritate and pressure their governments, and impose a political cost for their partnership with the US\u201d, rather than have military impact.</p> <h2>IRAN\u2019S OWN MILITARY CAPABILITIES</h2> <p>Iran has an active military over half a million strong, and another 350,000 reservists. Its military spending was estimated at $13bn in 2018 by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), a figure dwarfed by the US military budget for that year of $648.8bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/missile_range/giv-3902oymmoiFlBm2h/\" data-alt=\"missile ranges\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/missile_range/giv-3902oymmoiFlBm2h/\">missile ranges</a> </figure>  <p>It has developed drone and missile capacity, with an arsenal that the US describes as the largest in the Middle East.

Born out of the Arab Spring, the conflict has effectively become a brutal proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, fighting on broad sectarian lines, although the Houthis mostly follow a different branch of Shia Islam. Last September, Houthi rebels claimed an attack on Saudi Arabian oil installations, which caused a dramatic cut in output. Western powers later blamed Iran, either for managing the operation or carrying it out using Houthis as cover. The US said there was no evidence the assault originated in Yemen. Peace talks late last year have raised questions about the durability of Iranian influence there however, should the conflict end. PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES Iran has an alliance of convenience with the extremist Palestinian group Hamas, a Sunni organisation which is happy to take Iran\u2019s money and arms while their interests are aligned in challenging Israel. \u201cHamas does not expect direct and sustained Iranian assistance during a conflict, nor does it assume that Tehran would subordinate its interests to Hamas\u2019s as part of regional brinkmanship or dealmaking,\u201d according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). AFGHANISTAN Last year, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, acknowledged that Iran had some cooperation with the Taliban and added it was impossible to imagine Afghanistan\u2019s future \u201cwithout any role for the Taliban\u201d. There is little ideological or religious affinity with the Taliban, who are Sunni extremists, but Iran has always been pragmatic about its alliances. The two countries share a border, and Tehran and the militants share an enemy in the US. Afghanistan, and neighbouring Pakistan, have also proved a fertile recruiting ground for young men to fight in militias backing Assad in Syria. BAHRAIN, KUWAIT, SAUDI ARABIA Iran has sought influence among Shia communities in these countries, but because they are all wealthy with strong security forces, its efforts have faced far more obstacles than in other parts of the Middle East. They have offered support for militant grounds, including reportedly training for Bahraini fighters with pro-Iran groups in Iraq, the IISS says. But this is \u201cprimarily meant to irritate and pressure their governments, and impose a political cost for their partnership with the US\u201d, rather than have military impact. IRAN\u2019S OWN MILITARY CAPABILITIES Iran has an active military over half a million strong, and another 350,000 reservists. Its military spending was estimated at $13bn in 2018 by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), a figure dwarfed by the US military budget for that year of $648.8bn. It has developed drone and missile capacity, with an arsenal that the US describes as the largest in the Middle East. It is thought to have thousands of missiles of over a dozen different types, the most powerful with ranges towards over 2,000 km. It is also thought to have its own cyber-command, and after Suleimani\u2019s death, the US warned of possible retaliation online.",

They accuse the government of making practically no progress in the six months since it announced a \u201cfresh and honest evaluation\u201d of the benefit system would ensure it was more responsive to the needs of patients nearing the end of their life. Campaigners had demanded law changes after thousands of people who had just months to live were unable to access benefits, often finding their claims bogged down in bureaucracy and unnecessary health assessments.

Derailleur employs about 70 people, many of whom have physical and intellectual disabilities. They are given on-the-job training and perform tasks ranging from brewing, labelling, sales and delivery, as well as serving food and drink at the brewery\u2019s three pubs \u2013 two in Osaka and one in the central city of Nagoya. Mr Yamagami \u2013 known affectionately as Yama-chan \u2013 spent his youth drinking illicitly produced alcohol and getting into fights, but decided to apply for a job at the brewery after he lost his sight. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to be able to work alongside my friends,\u201d says Yama-chan, a 47-year-old former fishmonger. \u201cHandling the bottles by touch alone is the sort of work I can do without any problem. I need help getting around, but apart from that I can do my job freely. I really enjoy it.\u201d Full-time employees work a four-day week, and casual workers can devise their own work schedule depending on their disability and frame of mind. \u201cThe biggest single group are drug addicts who overdosed and now have to deal with physical and mental conditions caused by their addiction,\u201d says Yamazaki. \u201cBefore they worked here they spent all of their time at home, doing nothing. \u201cSome are unable to concentrate for long so work for, say, 30 minutes a day,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d be able to find work anywhere else.\u201d Mr Nishizawa \u2013 known to his friends as Sho-chan \u2013 found work at Derailleur after his excessive drinking made him ill and he was forced to quit his job as a rubbish collector. The 55-year-old, who once made his own hooch, does several jobs, including packing bottles, milling grain and selling the end product. \u201cWhen I first arrived in Nishinari there were men sleeping in the streets, and there are still people here who drink from the morning, deal in stimulant drugs and gamble illegally. But this is a place that accepts outsiders, and it\u2019s cheap so you can survive even if you\u2019re on benefits. \u201cMy previous life was tough but it\u2019s much brighter now and I\u2019ve started to look forward to every new day. I\u2019m able to live alone and I no longer owe money to loan sharks. The most surprising thing is that I don\u2019t drink much these days. I don\u2019t want to go to work with a hangover.\u201d Derailleur has produced 30 varieties of beer over the past two years, including a limited-edition stout, a mixed-juice IPA and Riot Ale, its most popular type. Its beer is sold mainly in Osaka, where it supplies restaurants, bars and supermarkets, but its market has expanded to include Tokyo and Kyoto \u2013 where it will open its fourth pub in April. The reception from beer drinkers has been universally positive. Derailleur\u2019s beers won seven prizes at last year\u2019s Japan Great Beer Awards and two silver medals at the 2018 International Beer Cup. It now has plans to quadruple its production capacity when it opens a brewery in Osaka in June, along with on-site accommodation for some of its 40 new employees. \u201cNishinari is undergoing a kind of gentrification, but the day labourers aren\u2019t being forced out,\u201d says Yamazaki. \u201cThey\u2019re being encouraged to stay and work for new companies opening up in the area. There\u2019s no other place like it in Japan.\u201d",

I was amazed by her rudeness. A month or so later, I sat near the Indian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/rahul-gandhi-quits-as-india-opposition-leader-after-elections-defeat\" title=\"\">politician Rahul Gandhi </a>in a restaurant. He was with a glamorous woman but they weren\u2019t speaking; instead they spent the whole evening looking at their phones. I found their behaviour fascinating and peculiar. Fifteen years later, the preference for phones over humans no longer seems in the least remarkable.</p> <p>This is among the subjects Kate Murphy analyses in <em>You\u2019re Not Listening</em>. She sets out the problem in painstaking, depressing detail. \u201cAt cafes, restaurants and family dinner tables, rather than talking to one another, people look at their phones. Or if they are talking to one another, the phone is on the table as ifa part of the place setting, taken up at intervals as casually as a knife or fork, implicitly signalling that the present company is not sufficiently engaging.\u201d There was a time when, during idle or anxious moments, people reached for a cigarette, she writes. Now \u201cpeople just as reflexively reach for their phones. Like smokers and cigarettes, people get jittery without their phones.\u201d</p> <p>Does this matter? Murphy argues that it does, profoundly, and draws together a barrage of statistics and research to persuade us that we have unthinkingly descended into a dystopian reality. Over the past century, she asserts, the average amount of time people have devoted to listening to one another during their waking hours has gone down by almost half, from 42% to 24%. In a 2018 survey of 20,000 Americans, almost half said they did not have meaningful in-person social interactions; meanwhile American life expectancy is declining due to suicide, opioid addiction, alcoholism and other so-called diseases of distress often associated with loneliness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/20/loneliness-britains-silent-plague-hurts-young-people-most\" title=\"\">Feeling lonely affects your health</a> as much as being an alcoholic or smoking 14 cigarettes a day, she notes. Thirteen-year-olds who are heavy users of social media increase their risk of clinical depression by 27% and are 56% more likely to say they are unhappy than their peers who spend less time on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. A study conducted by Microsoft found that since the year 2000, the average attention span dropped from 12 to eight seconds.</p> <p>The dubious precision of much of this research is slightly irritating and makes you question the methodology, but clearly something has changed, and no one can really dispute the argument that our affection for our phones is eating into the time that we might previously have spent listening to the people to whom we are closest. Murphy\u2019s descriptions of modern life are acute. \u201cIf anyone tells a story longer than 30 seconds, heads bow not in contemplation but to read texts, check sports scores or see what\u2019s trending online.\u201d Even toddlers understand this, she points out, describing a friend\u2019s child who has repeatedly thrown his parents\u2019 mobiles into the toilet. \u201cNo other objects, just the cell phones.

Instead, you should ask open and honest questions to communicate: \u201cI\u2019m interested in hearing more.\u201d \u201cIf you jump in to fix, advise, correct or distract, you are communicating that the other person doesn\u2019t have the ability to handle the situation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We like to think social media has broadened our horizons, but the way we engage with these voices is very superficial</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is also sage advice on how and when to listen to our internal monologues.

As leader of global football\u2019s 100-strong staff Marwood stipulates that all its clubs play the same style as CFG\u2019s flagship: Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/12/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-title\" title=\"\">Premier League champions</a> for the past two years, who last season completed a historic domestic clean sweep.</p> \n<p>The global football department is the brainchild of its chief executive, Ferran Soriano. \u201cIn 2013 we had this concept of a global approach and looked at other clubs that would join City Football Group,\u201d explains Marwood. \u201cThe majority of my staff are within scouting and recruitment. We try and apply consistency to all our clubs, use central methodology resources to work with the football directors, providing information, knowledge and reference points regarding what would be good choices for them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Of how Marinos, and the rest, replicate the style of Guardiola\u2019s side, Marwood says: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because 11 years ago when I first came here it was very hard to recruit [coaching, scouting] talent. They saw us as another foreign-owned club that would go through a crazy period of uncertainty. But now, we\u2019re regarded as a stable club that\u2019s got great owners, an extremely supportive board.\u201d</p> \n<p>Marwood laughs. \u201cPeople say: \u2018Can I get a coaching job with you? I play like Pep.\u2019 \u2018OK, tell me.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s 4-3-3.\u2019 \u2018No, it\u2019s a little bit more than that,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very detailed, if you look at our style, it\u2019s about rotation. Playing through the lines. Building from the back. Combinations. Possession-based that has to have an outcome.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were amazingly fortunate to get Pep. He has been incredible but we also have somebody in Yokohama, in Ange Postecoglou, who is very passionate about the style. After we [City] played Yokohama in pre-season, Pep was impressed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Postecoglou is a Greece-born former Australia defender whose coaching jobs have included Brisbane Roar, Melbourne Victory and Australia. He managed the last of these for four years until resigning after qualifying for Russia 2018.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d already been coaching for 20 years so there was a fair bit of evidence of how I like to play,\u201d Postecoglou says. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can put a coach in and tell him how to play. You could, but I just don\u2019t see success. There\u2019s got to be some alignment before you start.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1fb043881283737c6026bb1f253c7d208deba6d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1fb043881283737c6026bb1f253c7d208deba6d/0_102_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yokohama F.

CFG owns 20% of the team from Japan\u2019s second largest city, with Nissan holding the other 80%.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about developing trust,\u201d says Marwood. \u201cThey are fantastic people and have been very receptive to the help we can give. At the same time, they have a very experienced sporting director [Tsutomu Ogura], who\u2019s worked for the JFA and at club level, as has the assistant [manager, Peter Cklamovski]. They come across here maybe two times a year and we go there two or three times a year. We speak every week with them \u2013 we\u2019re always on Skype or conference calls.\u201d</p> \n<p>Beyond on-field success, the global football department\u2019s remit is to develop players and provide a school for coaches, sport scientists and potential future managers of CFG clubs. One day this could include filling the biggest job of all: managing Manchester City. </p> \n<p>Marwood has a mental picture of the ideal candidate. \u201cThe stats tell you one thing but the other aspect is: what is the person like? The person\u2019s culture? We\u2019re very keen to promote good values, behaviours, people that fit with our group. You don\u2019t always get that but you should try.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo understand the person is another element. If you have somebody in your house as a child and you develop them, you pretty much know after five, six, seven years what type of person they are. Then the ambition is that hopefully we can [allow] a great progression for them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The latest example is Nick Cushing, the women\u2019s team manager who was this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/09/nick-cushing-leaves-manchester-city-women-to-join-new-york-city-fc\" title=\"\">announced as New York City\u2019s assistant manager</a>. Marwood cites a further example in Patrick Vieira\u2019s trajectory from a junior role to New York City manager in 2016 before he left to take over at Nice. \u201cHe was under-23 coach [of City] and went to senior level. He therefore had experience of different pressure, an understanding of what\u2019s required of the first team versus the development of young players,\u201d says Marwood.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8197373e63dc3dfdac9d129fc4a37fb7a03c327\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8197373e63dc3dfdac9d129fc4a37fb7a03c327/0_0_3280_4928/666.jpg\" alt=\"The City Football Group CEO, Ferran Soriano, at an event after Mumbai City joined its list of clubs.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The City Football Group CEO, Ferran Soriano, at an event after Mumbai City joined its list of clubs.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Marwood is unequivocal when asked if a woman could manage one of CFG\u2019s men\u2019s teams, including Manchester City. \u201cIn a Premier League team the game would have to change its philosophy a bit in terms of accepting that but I think why not,\u201d he says. \u201cEmma [Hayes] is doing a brilliant job at Chelsea with a women\u2019s team.

      "bodyText": "Brian Marwood\u2019s office, City football academy, 7 December 2019. It is 5am and the managing director of global football, a department of City Football Group, the owners of Manchester City, is squeezed around a widescreen TV with a number of his staff watching Yokohama F. Marinos kick off against FC Tokyo in Japan\u2019s J-League title decider. CFG has 2,000-plus employees who oversee more than 1,500 footballers who play 2,500 games a year for its eight clubs across Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australasia. Marwood is responsible for all of these apart from Manchester City, who are led by Txiki Begiristain, the sporting director. Unless Tokyo win by the unlikely margin of eight goals, Marinos will be champions. Ange Postecoglou\u2019s Marinos are, indeed, crowned in style: a 3-0 win courtesy of goals from Theerathon Bunmathan, Erik Lima and Keita Endo. Strikes from a Thai, Brazilian and Japanese offer an apt microcosm of Marwood\u2019s multinational project. His department can celebrate a first domestic title triumph since formation in 2013. CFG\u2019s other teams are New York City, Melbourne City, Girona, Uruguay\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico Torque, China\u2019s Sichuan Jiuniu and India\u2019s Mumbai City. As leader of global football\u2019s 100-strong staff Marwood stipulates that all its clubs play the same style as CFG\u2019s flagship: Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City, Premier League champions for the past two years, who last season completed a historic domestic clean sweep.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019d like to take credit for the brilliant notion of travelling by train to our summer holiday in Italy, but it was my wife who came up with the idea. By family consensus, our two best holidays ever have involved either overnight trains (Moscow to St Petersburg and back) or cycling (along the Danube) and she had found a way to combine the two.</p> <p>The kernel of the holiday was six days\u2019 cycling along the Adige River in the South Tirol. At this point, I need to stress that we\u2019re not keen cyclists at all. I, my wife and our children, who are 13 and 11, cycle slowly and complainingly and mostly dismount if there\u2019s a hint of an upward slope. But on that previous trip along the Danube, we\u2019d been won over by the sense of collective adventure. There was something wonderful about inching our way to Vienna under our own steam \u2013 staying at different hotels each night \u2013 and the unpredictable encounters along the way. What I loved above all were the days that were free of devices, but full of shared incidents, schnitzel and cake.</p> <p>For the Italy trip, the tour company (<a href=\"https://flexitreks.com/cycling-holidays/bolzano-to-verona-cycling-break/\" title=\"\">Flexitreks</a>) would provide bikes and transfer our bags to each night\u2019s hotel, but we had to make our own way to and from the start and finish of the route. The simplest way of doing this would have been to fly to Verona, but travelling from London by train worked out slightly cheaper \u2013 and was entirely magical.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need me to tell you that British airports in August are stressful, crowded and estranging. The only advantage of flying is that it gets you a long way in a short time; no part of it is pleasurable. But at the moment the Thameslink train from south London passed through Blackfriars station, which spans the Thames, the view from the windows of the river on both sides made me feel like my holiday had begun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5edcd370cb01b4aed0ac7acc861bf1f391979385\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5edcd370cb01b4aed0ac7acc861bf1f391979385/0_152_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Pancras Station exterior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Pancras Station \u2013 the nicest way to leave the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there\u2019s a nicer way to leave the country than by rail from St Pancras, I\u2019d like to know about it. Twelve years after it was opened as the London terminus of the Eurostar, it still feels like a revelation, with its gothic brickwork, public pianos, bookshops and sky-blue vaulted iron ceilings. We got on the train around midmorning while, in a parallel reality, another version of me was stuck in the aisle of a plane, wishing he\u2019d stumped up for speedy boarding so he didn\u2019t have to be engaged in a Hobbesian struggle for space in the overhead locker while holding up his still belt-less trousers.</p> <p>In Paris, we transferred from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon on the RER green line and then found ourselves with a few hours to wait, listening to the haunting SNCF jingle that\u2019s one of the comforting idiosyncrasies of rail travel in France. It was raining and we didn\u2019t quite have the time or energy to explore the city. Instead, I rustled up some essentials for the overnight trip \u2014 water, batteries, snacks \u2014 while my wife and the kids went to <a href=\"https://www.le-train-bleu.com/en/le-train-bleu-restaurant-and-bar.html\" title=\"\">Le Train Bleu</a>, the magnificent gourmet restaurant inside the station. The interior, renovated in 2014, is all gold, wood, crystal and artworks that evoke the belle \u00e9poque. My family was so overcome by the opulence of the decor that they blew the day\u2019s food budget on strawberry daiquiris, juices, ham, salami and extraordinarily photogenic macaroons.</p> <p>The indispensable resource for all long-distance train journeys \u2013 and the source of our knowledge about Le Train Bleu \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.seat61.com/\" title=\"\">the Man in Seat 61</a>. Over the years, I\u2019ve found him a quirky and inspiring mentor. I even used his website to figure out how to book and print out e-tickets for the Moscow-St Petersburg overnight train, which still seems like a faintly miraculous achievement. I\u2019ll happily just browse the site, fantasising about ambitious railway journeys. The Man\u2019s advice is to reserve the France-Italy leg early as they sell out of couchettes in summer, so we booked them in April for travel in August.</p> <p>At 7pm, we boarded the red and white Thello overnight train that terminates in Venice. It\u2019s a no-frills sleeper, not a heritage experience for people who want to hark back to the golden age of rail travel, and the price reflects that. At the height of summer, we paid \u20ac150 one-way for each adult from Paris to Verona, and \u20ac100 for each child. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9153ac14906d11b442a55ab6c9cae40c8db32890\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9153ac14906d11b442a55ab6c9cae40c8db32890/0_44_1400_840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children in bed in a couchette compartment on the Thello train from Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">And so to bed \u2026 a couchette compartment on the Thello train from Paris</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandre MOSTRAS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This bought us bedding, towels, some water and snacks, and a four-berth couchette compartment to ourselves. There were loos and washrooms at each end of the carriage. One of the washrooms ran out of water on the way down, but we\u2019d been forewarned about this and bought extra water in Paris. It wasn\u2019t an issue on the way back. More expensive berths come with their own sinks.</p> <p>We arranged ourselves in the tiny space, with the kids taking the top bunks. I hadn\u2019t eaten at all and had a sense (correct, as it turned out) that the dining car would get full very quickly, so I went down with my son and bagged a spot. We ended up sharing a table and having a nice chat with a father and daughter from Chester who were on their way to Venice. I ate pasta and drank a tiny bottle of nice Italian red, my son had risotto, and we stumbled back to the refuge of our compartment as the sun set outside the windows.</p> <p>The kids listened to music on their headphones while I read and then drifted off to sleep, soothed by the cadence of the train. At some point in the night, the guard came to collect our passports, but I have only a dim recollection of it \u2013 and of his returning them around 5am. In the morning, we bought coffee and fresh pastries from the trilingual staff in the dining car before arriving in Verona just before 8am, with plenty of time to catch a local train to Bolzano. It had taken close to 24 hours from leaving our house in London to arriving at our hotel. You\u2019d certainly get there faster by plane, but this was an incomparably richer and more memorable experience.</p> <p>The cycling part of the trip also exceeded expectations. The following morning, we were collected by van from our hotel in Bolzano with our bicycles and driven to the start of the route, which is almost entirely downhill. We spent the first few days descending through apple orchards beside the rushing, clear waters of the Adige River, through pretty, predominantly German-speaking towns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c5c0bdd7cedd46f6a63106d76c76bc044343b890\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5c0bdd7cedd46f6a63106d76c76bc044343b890/0_176_3525_2115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillsides and vines near Bolzano.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tirolean charm \u2026 hillsides and vines near Bolzano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I knew nothing about the South Tirol before I went. It turned out it was part of the Habsburg empire until 1918, and still feels culturally and linguistically as though it could be in Austria. About halfway through the route, German gave way to Italian as we crossed into the Trentino region, and vineyards replaced the orchards until we made the final descent to Lake Garda.</p> <p>Every part of the journey was a pleasure, with two exceptions. On the first day, my daughter spectacularly went over her handlebars after slipping on a stretch of loose gravel. Umberto and Silvia, cyclists from Milan, immediately stopped to help, as did a German-speaking Tirolean farmer with cows embossed on his leather belt. Umberto insisted on giving us his first aid kit, but my daughter, though shaken, was miraculously unscathed. The other downer was the sunburn that tormented my son almost to the point of him being willing to put on sunscreen.</p> <p>A high point for me was the <a href=\"http://www.iceman.it/en/\" title=\"\">South T</a><a href=\"http://www.iceman.it/en/\" title=\"\">irol Museum of Archaeology</a> in Bolzano. This is where \u00d6tzi the Iceman lies, 5,300 or so years after he was murdered up in the mountains. More astonishing than his leathery remains is the extraordinary array of equipment and clothing found alongside him: his straw cape, an elegant copper axe and a beautiful fur hat.</p> <p>The rest of my family were indifferent to \u00d6tzi: they took one look at the queue and decided ice-cream was better than an ice man. I was dismayed by their lack of curiosity, but in fairness the queue was a blockbuster and it was raining. (My tip is to book online the day before and skip the queue.) We finished up with three days by Lake Garda, mooching around, swimming, going out on pedalos and trying stand-up paddleboading on the lake early in the morning before the wind made it too difficult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f8ec47a4d51e6207e23a8fe1cd3a415951bf8c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f8ec47a4d51e6207e23a8fe1cd3a415951bf8c6/0_275_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a reconstruction of \u00d6tzi in Bolzano\u2019s museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How the ice man looketh \u2026 a reconstruction of \u00d6tzi in Bolzano\u2019s museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Sabbadini/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The long railway journeys that bookended our holiday sometimes tested our patience, but precious moments of togetherness, the eerie sense of the journey\u2019s continuity from the Italian Alps to Tooting, and the interactions with other travellers more than outweighed the longueurs and alleged snoring.</p> <p>My children claim to be up for an even longer journey next time, so I\u2019ve been scouting routes on the Man in Seat 61 in preparation. He has a map showing that it\u2019s possible in principle to go from London to Singapore by train \u2013 and even to Japan, if you\u2019re willing to catch a boat.</p> <p>Whether my family\u2019s enthusiasm for this will survive to next summer is another question. \u201cI\u2019m in my teenage years,\u201d said my 11-year-old, recently, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be associated with our family.\u201d I\u2019m not certain our family harmony would survive that long a journey intact.

We ended up sharing a table and having a nice chat with a father and daughter from Chester who were on their way to Venice. I ate pasta and drank a tiny bottle of nice Italian red, my son had risotto, and we stumbled back to the refuge of our compartment as the sun set outside the windows. The kids listened to music on their headphones while I read and then drifted off to sleep, soothed by the cadence of the train. At some point in the night, the guard came to collect our passports, but I have only a dim recollection of it \u2013 and of his returning them around 5am. In the morning, we bought coffee and fresh pastries from the trilingual staff in the dining car before arriving in Verona just before 8am, with plenty of time to catch a local train to Bolzano. It had taken close to 24 hours from leaving our house in London to arriving at our hotel. You\u2019d certainly get there faster by plane, but this was an incomparably richer and more memorable experience. The cycling part of the trip also exceeded expectations. The following morning, we were collected by van from our hotel in Bolzano with our bicycles and driven to the start of the route, which is almost entirely downhill. We spent the first few days descending through apple orchards beside the rushing, clear waters of the Adige River, through pretty, predominantly German-speaking towns. I knew nothing about the South Tirol before I went. It turned out it was part of the Habsburg empire until 1918, and still feels culturally and linguistically as though it could be in Austria. About halfway through the route, German gave way to Italian as we crossed into the Trentino region, and vineyards replaced the orchards until we made the final descent to Lake Garda. Every part of the journey was a pleasure, with two exceptions. On the first day, my daughter spectacularly went over her handlebars after slipping on a stretch of loose gravel. Umberto and Silvia, cyclists from Milan, immediately stopped to help, as did a German-speaking Tirolean farmer with cows embossed on his leather belt. Umberto insisted on giving us his first aid kit, but my daughter, though shaken, was miraculously unscathed. The other downer was the sunburn that tormented my son almost to the point of him being willing to put on sunscreen. A high point for me was the South Tirol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano. This is where \u00d6tzi the Iceman lies, 5,300 or so years after he was murdered up in the mountains. More astonishing than his leathery remains is the extraordinary array of equipment and clothing found alongside him: his straw cape, an elegant copper axe and a beautiful fur hat. The rest of my family were indifferent to \u00d6tzi: they took one look at the queue and decided ice-cream was better than an ice man. I was dismayed by their lack of curiosity, but in fairness the queue was a blockbuster and it was raining. (My tip is to book online the day before and skip the queue.) We finished up with three days by Lake Garda, mooching around, swimming, going out on pedalos and trying stand-up paddleboading on the lake early in the morning before the wind made it too difficult. The long railway journeys that bookended our holiday sometimes tested our patience, but precious moments of togetherness, the eerie sense of the journey\u2019s continuity from the Italian Alps to Tooting, and the interactions with other travellers more than outweighed the longueurs and alleged snoring. My children claim to be up for an even longer journey next time, so I\u2019ve been scouting routes on the Man in Seat 61 in preparation. He has a map showing that it\u2019s possible in principle to go from London to Singapore by train \u2013 and even to Japan, if you\u2019re willing to catch a boat. Whether my family\u2019s enthusiasm for this will survive to next summer is another question. \u201cI\u2019m in my teenage years,\u201d said my 11-year-old, recently, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be associated with our family.\u201d I\u2019m not certain our family harmony would survive that long a journey intact. But I\u2019d be up for giving it a try. \u2022 Flexitreks\u2019 Bolzano to Verona cycling break costs from \u00a3545pp (30% discount for under-10s, 50% for 3-to-6-year-olds), including six nights\u2019 B&amp;B accommodation, luggage transfers and route information but not bike hire or train travel Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "Thousands of independence supporters have begun marching through the streets of Glasgow. The march is the first of eight planned for 2020 by the grassroots organisation All Under One Banner (AUOB) in what is likely to be a crucial year for the Scottish independence movement. It comes the day after the former Labour cabinet minister and MP Ben Bradshaw declared he was \u201c100% certain\u201d that Scotland would choose to leave the UK in the event of a second referendum on independence, which the first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, is pushing for later this year. Bradshaw told the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel: \u201cThe political class in England \u2013 and this includes my own party \u2013 must very quickly recognise the Scots\u2019 right to self-determination.\u201d His remarks were tweeted approvingly by Sturgeon. AUOB, which says it is not aligned with any political party, will organise events across the country, in Peebles, Elgin, Kirkcaldy, Stirling, Edinburgh and again in Glasgow, with the next march planned for Arbroath in April to mark the 700th anniversary of the signing of Scotland\u2019s declaration of independence. The march departed from Kelvingrove Park at 11.30am, and is heading to Glasgow Green, where it will end. On Thursday, organisers were forced to cancel a rally planned for the Green after forecasts of high winds resulted in safety concerns. The AUOB organiser Gary Kelly said that, before the weather warnings were in place, he had applied to Glasgow city council with an estimate that about 100,000 would attend the march.

Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, wrote to the prime minister at the end of last year requesting the transfer of the necessary section 30 powers to hold a second referendum, and also called for the Scottish parliament to be given permanent powers to hold subsequent referendums on independence from the UK. Describing the SNP\u2019s success in the general election as an \u201cunarguable mandate by any normal standard of democracy\u201d, Sturgeon also published a 38-page document titled Scotland\u2019s Right to Choose, to which Johnson has said he will give \u201ccareful consideration\u201d.

      "body": "<p>I am not in 23 Meteor Street, circa 1999. In fact, I\u2019m in the BFI office in central London at the fag end of 2019. But by God, it\u2019s easy to forget that, sitting opposite Nick Frost, Jessica Hynes and Simon Pegg, as they talk about their seminal sitcom Spaced, and each so jarringly reminiscent of their characters it verges on unnerving. Set on the fictional street in north London, Spaced told the deceptively simple story of two flatmates: aspiring-if-she-could-just-be-arsed writer Daisy Steiner and thwarted comic-book artist Tim Bisley. Accompanying them on their deeply prosaic adventures (a paintball tournament one week, a club night the next), which somehow achieved the heights of mythic glory, were their downstairs neighbour, tortured artist Brian (Mark Heap), his girlfriend Twist (Katy Carmichael), who worked \u201cin fashion\u201d, by which she meant a dry cleaners, Tim\u2019s childhood friend Mike (Frost) and their landlady Marsha (Julia Deakin). </p> <p>When the show aired, its meta humour, and jokes that were both silly and utterly brilliant, made cult stars of all the show\u2019s major players, including its then-unknown director, Edgar Wright. </p> <p>Today, Daisy-I-mean-Hynes, who as well as starring in the show co-wrote it with Pegg, fills the air with talk in galloping sentences that you have to cling on tight to in order to follow the logic. (\u201cI didn\u2019t want Daisy to be self-conscious, I wanted her to be spontaneous without angst. On the show Simon and I represent the middle, and Twist and Mike were more extreme, like the feminine and the masculine \u2026 \u201d) Meanwhile, Tim-I-mean-Pegg makes charming witticisms from the sofa and occasional light digs at his co-stars. (\u201cNone of us had done anything before Spaced. Well, except Jess, who was in [the little-loved 1993 Nazi big-band drama] Swing Kids, of course\u201d; \u201cYeah, cheers for bringing that up.\u201d)</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Frost, working his way through a bacon sandwich and maintaining a silent detachment. He is the first of the trio to arrive, whereupon he announces he knows neither what publication this interview is for nor what it\u2019s supposed to be about. When I explain it\u2019s for Spaced he immediately replies: \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about the past. But,\u201d he says, with a head tilt towards Pegg and Hynes\u2019s as-yet unoccupied seats, \u201cthey\u2019ll absolutely love it.\u201d</p> <p>If he hadn\u2019t long ago stopped playing Mike Watt \u2013 Spaced\u2019s army enthusiast who tunes into a slightly different frequency from the rest of humanity \u2013 I\u2019d assume Frost was an unlikely proponent of method acting. He only rouses himself when Hynes says she \u201cstill can\u2019t just enjoy Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with it?\u201d he says, as if squaring up for a fight. \u201cWe haven\u2019t time for that now, OK?\u201d Hynes replies, with an exaggerated eyeroll. Like I said, it\u2019s hard to believe this isn\u2019t Meteor Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5894eb9d21d9ad557d73c504957d418c5a8cc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5894eb9d21d9ad557d73c504957d418c5a8cc4/0_118_1009_605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson with Mark Heap in Spaced.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson with Mark Heap in Spaced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: E4 PICTURE PUBLICITY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This weekend, the cast will reunite for an all-day event as the show \u2013 somewhat shockingly \u2013 is turning 21 this year. This is less shocking for the cast who, as Hynes puts it, \u201chave packed in quite a lot since then\u201d. After making Spaced as unknown twentysomethings, Hynes \u2013 n\u00e9e Stevenson \u2013 became one of Britain\u2019s best-loved TV stars, winning Baftas for her performances in W1A and There She Goes, while Pegg, who these days has the carved cheekbones of a man who hasn\u2019t been near a carb in years, went on to endearingly improbable Hollywood glory, starring in Star Trek and alongside Tom Cruise in the Mission: Impossible franchise. He also made the Cornetto Trilogy \u2013 Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World\u2019s End \u2013 which starred Frost and were co-written and directed by Wright.</p> <p>Wright was an unknown 24-year-old when he directed Spaced. Today, he is so successful he genuinely doesn\u2019t have time to come to the interview. Instead, I catch up with him on the phone the next day at an absurdly early hour, the only minutes he can spare these days between editing his latest film. Yet despite everything they have achieved since, they all \u2013 Frost excepted \u2013 love talking about Spaced. \u201cI\u2019ve worked since 1978, but Spaced is the most enjoyable thing I ever did,\u201d Julia Deakin, who played the wise if often completely drunk Marsha, later tells me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every job where you get to hang out socially with the actors, but we all really did hang out,\u201d Wright says. \u201cIt was that time before people had kids, so the show spilled into real life and back in a very nice way.\u201d</p> <p>Even the actors who were barely more than extras on it went on to become comedy stars. David Walliams, Mark Gatiss, Kevin Eldon, Peter Serafinowicz and Reece Shearsmith, all appeared, as did Ricky Gervais, who featured as a smarmy office worker called Dave.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d seen the pilot for The Office before it was aired and we thought: \u2018Shit, this guy\u2019s gonna be huge, we have to get him for the show,\u2019 says Pegg. \u201cSo we got him to basically play Brent for us. That was us being cynical.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a0f1842d90d320d510aff5d112996d286eeda74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a0f1842d90d320d510aff5d112996d286eeda74/624_148_657_821/400.jpg\" alt=\"The Spaced house in Tufnell Park\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Spaced house in Tufnell Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TMD properties</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This Office/Spaced crossover now seems prescient: whereas The Office\u2019s faux-documentary set-up made it the most influential show of the early 21st century in terms of format, Spaced coined the comedic tone for the next two decades in terms of style and writing. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather have that than it being just a format you can replicate in other territories,\u201d says Pegg a bit pointedly. (Memories of a production company\u2019s shortlived attempt to replicate Spaced in the US make Pegg and Hynes honk with laughter.) </p> <p>All those absurdist film homages (Daisy spotting Mike\u2019s gun in the kitchen, Pulp Fiction-style), all that playing with film and TV conventions (the slow-mo fights) and the mundanity of reality played against the grandeur of fantasy (Tim playing Resident Evil and suddenly his living room filling with zombies) have become part of the lexicon of modern comedy. Without Spaced, it\u2019s hard to imagine Green Wing or Peep Show. \u201cI love 30 Rock and Arrested Development and I sometimes think: \u2018Ooh, those look quite Spaced-y!\u2019\u201d laughs Wright.</p> <p>Just as Tarantino did in the movies a few years earlier, Spaced was the show that captured a new generation\u2019s obsession with pop culture, playing with genre and self-referentiality. \u201cIt was supposed to look like how they would describe their lives to their friends: \u2018I went to the DSS and it was like The Conversation,\u2019\u201d says Pegg.

      "bodyText": "I am not in 23 Meteor Street, circa 1999. In fact, I\u2019m in the BFI office in central London at the fag end of 2019. But by God, it\u2019s easy to forget that, sitting opposite Nick Frost, Jessica Hynes and Simon Pegg, as they talk about their seminal sitcom Spaced, and each so jarringly reminiscent of their characters it verges on unnerving. Set on the fictional street in north London, Spaced told the deceptively simple story of two flatmates: aspiring-if-she-could-just-be-arsed writer Daisy Steiner and thwarted comic-book artist Tim Bisley. Accompanying them on their deeply prosaic adventures (a paintball tournament one week, a club night the next), which somehow achieved the heights of mythic glory, were their downstairs neighbour, tortured artist Brian (Mark Heap), his girlfriend Twist (Katy Carmichael), who worked \u201cin fashion\u201d, by which she meant a dry cleaners, Tim\u2019s childhood friend Mike (Frost) and their landlady Marsha (Julia Deakin). When the show aired, its meta humour, and jokes that were both silly and utterly brilliant, made cult stars of all the show\u2019s major players, including its then-unknown director, Edgar Wright. Today, Daisy-I-mean-Hynes, who as well as starring in the show co-wrote it with Pegg, fills the air with talk in galloping sentences that you have to cling on tight to in order to follow the logic. (\u201cI didn\u2019t want Daisy to be self-conscious, I wanted her to be spontaneous without angst. On the show Simon and I represent the middle, and Twist and Mike were more extreme, like the feminine and the masculine \u2026 \u201d) Meanwhile, Tim-I-mean-Pegg makes charming witticisms from the sofa and occasional light digs at his co-stars. (\u201cNone of us had done anything before Spaced. Well, except Jess, who was in [the little-loved 1993 Nazi big-band drama] Swing Kids, of course\u201d; \u201cYeah, cheers for bringing that up.\u201d) And then there\u2019s Frost, working his way through a bacon sandwich and maintaining a silent detachment. He is the first of the trio to arrive, whereupon he announces he knows neither what publication this interview is for nor what it\u2019s supposed to be about. When I explain it\u2019s for Spaced he immediately replies: \u201cI don\u2019t like talking about the past. But,\u201d he says, with a head tilt towards Pegg and Hynes\u2019s as-yet unoccupied seats, \u201cthey\u2019ll absolutely love it.\u201d If he hadn\u2019t long ago stopped playing Mike Watt \u2013 Spaced\u2019s army enthusiast who tunes into a slightly different frequency from the rest of humanity \u2013 I\u2019d assume Frost was an unlikely proponent of method acting. He only rouses himself when Hynes says she \u201cstill can\u2019t just enjoy Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with it?\u201d he says, as if squaring up for a fight. \u201cWe haven\u2019t time for that now, OK?\u201d Hynes replies, with an exaggerated eyeroll. Like I said, it\u2019s hard to believe this isn\u2019t Meteor Street. This weekend, the cast will reunite for an all-day event as the show \u2013 somewhat shockingly \u2013 is turning 21 this year. This is less shocking for the cast who, as Hynes puts it, \u201chave packed in quite a lot since then\u201d. After making Spaced as unknown twentysomethings, Hynes \u2013 n\u00e9e Stevenson \u2013 became one of Britain\u2019s best-loved TV stars, winning Baftas for her performances in W1A and There She Goes, while Pegg, who these days has the carved cheekbones of a man who hasn\u2019t been near a carb in years, went on to endearingly improbable Hollywood glory, starring in Star Trek and alongside Tom Cruise in the Mission: Impossible franchise. He also made the Cornetto Trilogy \u2013 Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World\u2019s End \u2013 which starred Frost and were co-written and directed by Wright. Wright was an unknown 24-year-old when he directed Spaced. Today, he is so successful he genuinely doesn\u2019t have time to come to the interview. Instead, I catch up with him on the phone the next day at an absurdly early hour, the only minutes he can spare these days between editing his latest film. Yet despite everything they have achieved since, they all \u2013 Frost excepted \u2013 love talking about Spaced. \u201cI\u2019ve worked since 1978, but Spaced is the most enjoyable thing I ever did,\u201d Julia Deakin, who played the wise if often completely drunk Marsha, later tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s not every job where you get to hang out socially with the actors, but we all really did hang out,\u201d Wright says. \u201cIt was that time before people had kids, so the show spilled into real life and back in a very nice way.\u201d Even the actors who were barely more than extras on it went on to become comedy stars. David Walliams, Mark Gatiss, Kevin Eldon, Peter Serafinowicz and Reece Shearsmith, all appeared, as did Ricky Gervais, who featured as a smarmy office worker called Dave. \u201cWe\u2019d seen the pilot for The Office before it was aired and we thought: \u2018Shit, this guy\u2019s gonna be huge, we have to get him for the show,\u2019 says Pegg. \u201cSo we got him to basically play Brent for us. That was us being cynical.\u201d This Office/Spaced crossover now seems prescient: whereas The Office\u2019s faux-documentary set-up made it the most influential show of the early 21st century in terms of format, Spaced coined the comedic tone for the next two decades in terms of style and writing. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather have that than it being just a format you can replicate in other territories,\u201d says Pegg a bit pointedly. (Memories of a production company\u2019s shortlived attempt to replicate Spaced in the US make Pegg and Hynes honk with laughter.) All those absurdist film homages (Daisy spotting Mike\u2019s gun in the kitchen, Pulp Fiction-style), all that playing with film and TV conventions (the slow-mo fights) and the mundanity of reality played against the grandeur of fantasy (Tim playing Resident Evil and suddenly his living room filling with zombies) have become part of the lexicon of modern comedy. Without Spaced, it\u2019s hard to imagine Green Wing or Peep Show. \u201cI love 30 Rock and Arrested Development and I sometimes think: \u2018Ooh, those look quite Spaced-y!\u2019\u201d laughs Wright. Just as Tarantino did in the movies a few years earlier, Spaced was the show that captured a new generation\u2019s obsession with pop culture, playing with genre and self-referentiality. \u201cIt was supposed to look like how they would describe their lives to their friends: \u2018I went to the DSS and it was like The Conversation,\u2019\u201d says Pegg. Not everyone got the references. \u201cI had no idea what they were on about half the time!\u201d laughs Deakin. \u201cI\u2019d think: Why am I saying \u2018I love it when a plan comes together\u2019 to a door? But it\u2019s like Dad\u2019s Army: even if you don\u2019t entirely get what they\u2019re talking about, funny is funny.\u201d Spaced was born from a reaction against how young people\u2019s lives were depicted in the age of what Wright snickeringly refers to as \u201cyoof TV.\u201d \u201cAll the shows that were supposed to appeal to us, like Babes in the Wood and Game On, just had nothing to do with us, because they were written by older people,\u201d says Pegg. \u201cChannel 4 wanted something authentic.\u201d He and Hynes had met at an audition for a sketch show and clicked. They then met Wright while working on the brief-lived comedy Asylum, and the three were given free rein to create a primetime sitcom. Hynes and Pegg pillaged their own lives \u2013 even Tim\u2019s nemesis, Duane Benzie (Serafinowicz), was based on someone who, Pegg swears, \u201chad basically that name\u201d. \u201cI also really wanted to create a show where there was equality,\u201d says Hynes of her much-beloved character Daisy. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how few female characters have ambition and hold their own.\u201d Even more groundbreakingly, Daisy\u2019s gender neither defines her nor holds her back: her role on the show is neither to snog Tim nor act as the springboard for his jokes.

      "bodyText": "The Australian federal police has received a complaint via the office of the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, that accuses the acclaimed author and historian Bruce Pascoe of benefiting financially from incorrectly claiming to be Indigenous. The allegation was made in a letter to Dutton by Aboriginal businesswoman Josephine Cashman, a critic of Pascoe who wants the government to set up a formal register to assess people\u2019s Aboriginality. A federal police spokeswoman said it received the allegation on Christmas Eve and was assessing it in accordance with standard protocols. It has not launched a formal investigation. The allegation became public after being published on page one of News Corp\u2019s the Weekend Australian. A spokesman for Dutton said it was standard practice for the minister\u2019s office to forward allegations to relevant authorities to assess, and it was not a reflection of his or his staff\u2019s views on the issue. Pascoe is best known for his groundbreaking 2014 bestseller, Dark Emu, which drew on evidence from historical records to show Aboriginal people farmed and prospered in large villages, upending previous assumptions about Indigenous Australia. Dark Emu won a string of awards, inspired a range of projects and has been adapted into a dance performance, a children\u2019s book and an upcoming ABC TV series. It was named book of the year and won the Indigenous writers\u2019 prize at the 2016 New South Wales premier\u2019s literary awards, and Pascoe received the Australia Council award for lifetime achievement in literature in 2018. Following his success, Pascoe and his work have been targeted by rightwing cultural campaigners, including News Corp\u2019s Andrew Bolt.

      "body": "<p>\u201cHe was one of the goofiest-looking guys I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Geddy Lee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/24/geddy-lee-on-rush-greatest-songs\">told me</a> in November 2018. Rush\u2019s singer and bass player was talking about his first encounter with Neil Peart, his bandmate from 29 July 1974 until their final gig in 2015, almost exactly 41 years later.</p> <p>\u201cHe was very tall, lanky,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAnd he had short hair. All of us had major hair. He had spent two years living in England before that. We didn\u2019t know this. But he had just moved back home and given up his dream of playing in a rock band. And he was working for his dad\u2019s farm equipment store. He drove up in this little sports car, drums were hanging out from every corner. He comes in, this big goofy guy with a small drum kit with 18-inch bass drums. Alex [Lifeson] and I were chuckling \u2013 we thought he was a hick from the country. And then he sat down behind this kit and pummelled the drums, and us. I\u2019d never heard a drummer like that, someone with that power and dexterity. As far as I was concerned, he was hired from the minute he started playing.\u201d</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/10/rush-neil-peart-dead-67\">Neil Peart</a> was rather more than a drummer (and Rush\u2019s lyricist). He was extremely reticent and not prone to shouting his mouth off in interviews. He was not one for the life of the rock star: rather than reclining in tour buses, he would travel between Rush shows on his bicycle, then later his motorbike, stopping unrecognised at roadside diners for his lunch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"582e8d80d5e16d13fdfb810e39e5bbd4226866e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/582e8d80d5e16d13fdfb810e39e5bbd4226866e3/0_32_2583_1550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart, and Geddy Lee pose in the press room at the 28th Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart and Geddy Lee pose in the press room at the 28th Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Merritt#TERM/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was a family man who lost his daughter in a road traffic accident and his wife to cancer within 10 months of each other, in 1997 and 1998, and whose response to those tragedies was to teach himself to cook, first to care for his wife, then for himself (touchingly, in his memoir Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road, he offered \u201cthanks to the food hall in the Marks and Spencer in Oxford Street, which offered cooking instructions with every item, even fresh fish and vegetables\u201d.)</p> <p>More than a drummer, Neil Peart was loved.</p> <p>He was loved by Lee and Lifeson, which was evident in the delightful documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage. And he was loved by pretty much everyone who ever took the slightest interest in Rush, because he was so clearly not a rock star, but a bookish, shy chap, who happened to possess extraordinary dexterity on drums.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/10/rush-neil-peart-dead-67\">Rush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart dies at 67</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You could get a sense of this from his lyrics, which, for all the focus on his young love of Ayn Rand, often had an air of loneliness and separation, never more clearly than on Subdivisions, the song the Smiths might have written had they been a Canadian prog power trio: \u201cIn the high school halls / In the shopping malls / Conform or be cast out / Subdivisions / In the basement bars / In the backs of cars / Be cool or be cast out.\u201d</p> <p>His lyrics, whether or not you liked them, were written with a plain-spoken and full-hearted honesty that meant they were sometimes extraordinarily on the nose, but could equally hit home with force. Rush\u2019s biggest UK hit single, The Spirit of Radio (No 13, 1980), managed to be simultaneously a hymn to the old-fashioned notion of hearing a song on the radio that might transport you (\u201cEmotional feedback / On a timeless wavelength / Bearing a gift beyond price\u201d), a defence of musical technology against the Luddites who insist on the old way of doing things (\u201cAll this machinery / Making modern music / Can still be open-hearted\u201d) and a tirade against those who would corrupt art with money (\u201cFor the words of the prophets / Were written on the studio wall / Concert hall / And echoes with the sounds of salesmen\u201d). The key thing, Peart insisted in the song, was that \u201cit\u2019s really just a question of your honesty\u201d.</p> <p>Like a lot of other people, I fell hard for Rush in my early teens, when what I thought was significant about them was that they had songs based on Coleridge poems, or that they had tracks that occupied entire sides of albums and had overtures. Only later did I realise that what really mattered was that three men could navigate all the vicissitudes of a career in the music industry and remain true to what they wanted to do, entirely uncompromised, and still be friends.</p> <p>But back then, in the early 80s, I used to sit with my friend Ian Watts in his bedroom in Windsor listening to Rush albums \u2013 A Farewell to Kings, 2112, Hemispheres, All the World\u2019s a Stage \u2013 and marvelling, above all, at Peart\u2019s drumming.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHe was one of the goofiest-looking guys I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Geddy Lee told me in November 2018. Rush\u2019s singer and bass player was talking about his first encounter with Neil Peart, his bandmate from 29 July 1974 until their final gig in 2015, almost exactly 41 years later. \u201cHe was very tall, lanky,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAnd he had short hair. All of us had major hair. He had spent two years living in England before that. We didn\u2019t know this. But he had just moved back home and given up his dream of playing in a rock band. And he was working for his dad\u2019s farm equipment store. He drove up in this little sports car, drums were hanging out from every corner. He comes in, this big goofy guy with a small drum kit with 18-inch bass drums. Alex [Lifeson] and I were chuckling \u2013 we thought he was a hick from the country. And then he sat down behind this kit and pummelled the drums, and us. I\u2019d never heard a drummer like that, someone with that power and dexterity. As far as I was concerned, he was hired from the minute he started playing.\u201d But Neil Peart was rather more than a drummer (and Rush\u2019s lyricist). He was extremely reticent and not prone to shouting his mouth off in interviews. He was not one for the life of the rock star: rather than reclining in tour buses, he would travel between Rush shows on his bicycle, then later his motorbike, stopping unrecognised at roadside diners for his lunch. He was a family man who lost his daughter in a road traffic accident and his wife to cancer within 10 months of each other, in 1997 and 1998, and whose response to those tragedies was to teach himself to cook, first to care for his wife, then for himself (touchingly, in his memoir Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road, he offered \u201cthanks to the food hall in the Marks and Spencer in Oxford Street, which offered cooking instructions with every item, even fresh fish and vegetables\u201d.) More than a drummer, Neil Peart was loved. He was loved by Lee and Lifeson, which was evident in the delightful documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage. And he was loved by pretty much everyone who ever took the slightest interest in Rush, because he was so clearly not a rock star, but a bookish, shy chap, who happened to possess extraordinary dexterity on drums. You could get a sense of this from his lyrics, which, for all the focus on his young love of Ayn Rand, often had an air of loneliness and separation, never more clearly than on Subdivisions, the song the Smiths might have written had they been a Canadian prog power trio: \u201cIn the high school halls / In the shopping malls / Conform or be cast out / Subdivisions / In the basement bars / In the backs of cars / Be cool or be cast out.\u201d His lyrics, whether or not you liked them, were written with a plain-spoken and full-hearted honesty that meant they were sometimes extraordinarily on the nose, but could equally hit home with force. Rush\u2019s biggest UK hit single, The Spirit of Radio (No 13, 1980), managed to be simultaneously a hymn to the old-fashioned notion of hearing a song on the radio that might transport you (\u201cEmotional feedback / On a timeless wavelength / Bearing a gift beyond price\u201d), a defence of musical technology against the Luddites who insist on the old way of doing things (\u201cAll this machinery / Making modern music / Can still be open-hearted\u201d) and a tirade against those who would corrupt art with money (\u201cFor the words of the prophets / Were written on the studio wall / Concert hall / And echoes with the sounds of salesmen\u201d). The key thing, Peart insisted in the song, was that \u201cit\u2019s really just a question of your honesty\u201d. Like a lot of other people, I fell hard for Rush in my early teens, when what I thought was significant about them was that they had songs based on Coleridge poems, or that they had tracks that occupied entire sides of albums and had overtures. Only later did I realise that what really mattered was that three men could navigate all the vicissitudes of a career in the music industry and remain true to what they wanted to do, entirely uncompromised, and still be friends. But back then, in the early 80s, I used to sit with my friend Ian Watts in his bedroom in Windsor listening to Rush albums \u2013 A Farewell to Kings, 2112, Hemispheres, All the World\u2019s a Stage \u2013 and marvelling, above all, at Peart\u2019s drumming. At the way he seemed to make his way from one side of his enormous kit to the other in micro-seconds, touching every bit of it \u2013 toms, tubular bells, gongs, cowbells, wind chimes, cymbals of every kind. At the way he sounded like thunder. His kits themselves looked less like musical instruments than pieces of an industrial plant (of course there is a website that details each kit from every stage of his career). There has, in fact, probably never been a band that so embodied the mindset of a particular kind of teenage boy (I know women liked them, too, but early Rush were a boy\u2019s band. Really) as Rush did with their run of albums of the late 1970s. But they grew up, and Peart did, too. That was apparent throughout the 1980s, and especially on Vapor Trails, from 2002, the first album Rush recorded after the death of Peart\u2019s daughter and wife. His tragedy and his recovery from it haunts the album. In Ghost Rider, he is \u201cJust an escape artist / Racing against the night\u201d; in Vapor Trail he sings of \u201cMemory written on the wind / Washed away like footprints in the rain\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t lachrymose. The album\u2019s opening track, One Little Victory, was about the fact that he had been able to return to music and to his friends after years away, spent riding alone around North America confronting his grief: \u201cCelebrate the moment / As it turns into one more / Another chance at victory / Another chance to score\u201d.

The last thing I asked Geddy Lee when I met him just over a year ago was whether he and Lifeson and Peart were still friends, now they no longer had Rush to hold them together. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cAlex and I just flew down to see Neil two weeks ago and hung out for three days.

When Jeremy Corbyn became the MP for its scruffier northern portion in 1983, his constituency was largely white and working class. Labour had held it since the 1930s, but often only with a modest majority, which had shrunk to under 5,000 in 1979.

As Islington North gentrified, it attracted waves of incomers, from bankers to migrant businessmen to refugees \u2013 few of them \u201ctraditional\u201d Labour voters, and Corbyn got to know them and was often influenced by them.

Between 1981 and 2011, all of them experienced huge decreases in the proportion of their young residents, and similar increases in the proportion of retired people. In County Durham, Bishop Auckland\u2019s 18- to 24-year-olds went down by 25%, and its over-65s went up by almost 35%. Last month, it was taken by the Tories after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Auckland_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\" title=\"\">more than 80 years</a> of Labour control.</p> <p>Since the early 1980s, the narrowing of economic opportunities in much of the north and their widening in the south has transformed the electorate in many northern seats: effectively shifting it to the right, given the strong Labour and Tory biases, respectively, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/21/age-not-class-is-what-divides-british-voters-most\" title=\"\">of the young and old</a>. The loss of many of these seats last month ought not to have been such a surprise; it was decades in the making.</p> <p>Back in the 90s, New Labour understood that the party\u2019s old heartlands were weakening. In 2007, Tony Blair\u2019s electoral strategist <a href=\"https://leftfootforward.org/2011/11/suburbia-key-battleground-london-mayoral-general-election/\" title=\"\">Philip Gould wrote</a> that Blairism had been, and should continue to be, \u201crooted not in Labour\u2019s traditional industrial heartlands but in the sprawling suburbs of an emerging middle class\u201d.</p> <p>For a while, New Labour skilfully kept both parts of the country happy, generously distributing cabinet jobs and public works to northern constituencies, while tailoring its economic and tax policies to the needs of more prosperous southerners. Yet, underneath, New Labour operated on the assumption that the party\u2019s \u201ctraditional\u201d voters had \u201cnowhere else to go\u201d, as Blair\u2019s spin doctors often put it with a certain smugness. That assumption was mistaken; but fortunately for Blair, instead of voting Tory, as many of them did last month, during the Blair years they mainly just didn\u2019t vote (between his first election victory in 1997 and his final one in 2005, Labour lost four million voters).</p> <p>It won\u2019t be easy for Labour to find a politics that satisfies both homeowning pensioners living in depopulating towns and villages, and precariously employed young renters living in overcrowded cities. In their assets, in their attitudes, in their economic experiences, their lives are ever more different. Meanwhile, under Boris Johnson the Tories seem more interested than they have been for decades in listening to the Britain beyond their own heartlands in southern England.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/05/how-labour-can-make-itself-electable-again\">How Labour can make itself electable again | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/17/boris-johnson-betray-north-labour-strongholds-brexit\" title=\"\">wait for that relationship to go wrong</a>.

In 2007, Tony Blair\u2019s electoral strategist Philip Gould wrote that Blairism had been, and should continue to be, \u201crooted not in Labour\u2019s traditional industrial heartlands but in the sprawling suburbs of an emerging middle class\u201d. For a while, New Labour skilfully kept both parts of the country happy, generously distributing cabinet jobs and public works to northern constituencies, while tailoring its economic and tax policies to the needs of more prosperous southerners. Yet, underneath, New Labour operated on the assumption that the party\u2019s \u201ctraditional\u201d voters had \u201cnowhere else to go\u201d, as Blair\u2019s spin doctors often put it with a certain smugness. That assumption was mistaken; but fortunately for Blair, instead of voting Tory, as many of them did last month, during the Blair years they mainly just didn\u2019t vote (between his first election victory in 1997 and his final one in 2005, Labour lost four million voters). It won\u2019t be easy for Labour to find a politics that satisfies both homeowning pensioners living in depopulating towns and villages, and precariously employed young renters living in overcrowded cities. In their assets, in their attitudes, in their economic experiences, their lives are ever more different. Meanwhile, under Boris Johnson the Tories seem more interested than they have been for decades in listening to the Britain beyond their own heartlands in southern England. Labour could wait for that relationship to go wrong. But there is no guarantee that voters will then return to Labour. The Brexit party, or some other, yet-to-be-formed vehicle for nationalism, or regional pride, or nostalgia, may appeal to an ageing electorate more. Labour will probably have to accept that some of its old \u201cheartlands\u201d are gone for good. In the cities, and in growing southern towns such as Swindon, which New Labour won and the party has since lost, Labour will have to build new ones. \u2022 Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist",

In his first week in office, Trump implemented his signature anti-immigrant campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/trump-administration-travel-ban-president\">promise</a>, a travel ban against several Muslim-majority countries. The policy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/26/trump-supreme-court-upholds-travel-ban\">upheld by the US supreme court</a>, created harsh restrictions blocking travelers from the targeted countries that require people in the US to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/trump-travel-ban-visa-waiver-muslim\">apply for waivers</a> and argue it would cause \u201cundue hardship\u201d if they were denied and that it\u2019s in the \u201cnational interest\u201d of the US to let them in. That process has been marked by long delays, and Iranians are the largest group affected.</p> <p>More than 30,000 Iranians seeking visitor and permanent visas to the US have been denied since 2017. Roughly 10,000 of them are now stuck in an indefinite administrative process, still hoping waivers will grant them visas. That means Iranians with spouses, children, parents and other relatives in the US cannot live their lives in America as they had planned, many forced to live thousands of miles apart with no opportunity for a visit. The US is home to an estimated 1 million Iranian Americans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e53f86b54244abce68f74884bc8e297c45fb266b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e53f86b54244abce68f74884bc8e297c45fb266b/0_87_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters denounce the president\u2019s travel ban outside of the Los Angeles International Airport in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters denounce the president\u2019s travel ban outside of the Los Angeles international airport in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Garcia/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this any more,\u201d said Kia Nasseri, a 61-year-old engineer who lives in Rancho Santa Margarita in southern California, a region home to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/los-angeles-iranians-little-persia-trump-travel-ban\">largest Iranian population outside of Iran</a>.</p> <p>Nasseri was born in Iran and has lived in the US for 40 years.

      "bodyText": "Sorena Amirkhani has spent half his life struggling to understand why his father must live in a country on the other side of the world. This week, the 11-year-old\u2019s questions about his dad took on new urgency: he wanted to know if he would lose him in a third world war. Amirkhani lives in Lexington, Kentucky, with his mother and sister, while his father lives in Tehran, Iran\u2019s capital, and has been barred from the United States for years under Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. While the renewed conflict between Iran and the US this week has spread anxiety among Iranian Americans across the United States, the international crisis has created particular uncertainty for families torn apart by Trump\u2019s immigration policies, with rising fears about a potential war permanently separating loved ones. \u201cMy kids cry so much,\u201d said Fatemeh Karimi Alamdari, Sorena\u2019s mother. She said she struggled to respond when her panicked son asked her: \u201c\u2018World War III has started. What will happen to daddy? Does he have to go to war?\u2019\u201d \u201cI try to calm them down \u2026 but they are stressed. It\u2019s a really hard time,\u201d she said. The US assassination of the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani on the third day of the new year sparked rapidly intensifying tensions in the Middle East. Five days later, Iran retaliated, launching more than a dozen missiles at Iraqi bases hosting US troops. After there were no reports of casualties, Trump announced he would back away from further strikes. A day later, Trump made Suleimani\u2019s death a theme at his first re-election rally of 2020. Persian communities across America read the dizzying headlines with a sense of dread, some reliving painful memories of war, others growing afraid of a new wave of discrimination in the US, and many concerned about the safety of loved ones in Iran. Families ripped apart: \u2018I can\u2019t take this any more\u2019 Some Iranian American families have been caught in an agonizing waiting game for three years. In his first week in office, Trump implemented his signature anti-immigrant campaign promise, a travel ban against several Muslim-majority countries. The policy, upheld by the US supreme court, created harsh restrictions blocking travelers from the targeted countries that require people in the US to apply for waivers and argue it would cause \u201cundue hardship\u201d if they were denied and that it\u2019s in the \u201cnational interest\u201d of the US to let them in. That process has been marked by long delays, and Iranians are the largest group affected. More than 30,000 Iranians seeking visitor and permanent visas to the US have been denied since 2017. Roughly 10,000 of them are now stuck in an indefinite administrative process, still hoping waivers will grant them visas. That means Iranians with spouses, children, parents and other relatives in the US cannot live their lives in America as they had planned, many forced to live thousands of miles apart with no opportunity for a visit. The US is home to an estimated 1 million Iranian Americans. \u201cI can\u2019t take this any more,\u201d said Kia Nasseri, a 61-year-old engineer who lives in Rancho Santa Margarita in southern California, a region home to the largest Iranian population outside of Iran. Nasseri was born in Iran and has lived in the US for 40 years. He married his wife, an Iranian woman, in 2016, and she secured a green card to live here. But the couple has been unable to get approval for her teenage daughter to join them. They applied in June 2017, when she was 17 years old. The daughter, now 19, has left Iran and is stuck traveling between Turkey, Armenia and Ecuador to not overstay visas. Her mother joins her when she can. \u201cI\u2019m a US citizen. Why are you doing this to your own citizens?\u201d said Nasseri this week, noting that his wife and stepdaughter both suffer from depression and anxiety. America is the home he has known most of his life, and he loves California, but with news of potential war in recent days, Nasseri said at times he felt like he wanted to give up: \u201cThis is not the America I used to know \u2026 I told my wife, \u2018If this is going to be war, should I put the house up for sale, stop everything, and we move to another country?\u2019\u201d Seyed Amin Sam Motaghedi, a 33-year-old specialist at a biotech laboratory in Belmont, in northern California, said he often wakes up in the middle of the night plagued by anxiety about the safety of his fiancee, Roya Ghobadi.

No relief in sight, no sympathy from the US government Curtis Morrison, a California attorney representing Nasseri, Motaghedi and other families in ongoing lawsuits against the US state department, said the threats of war could make the travel ban cases even harder.

      "body": "<p>Ruth Linton, my mum, is an eternally overdressed, perennially late, sixtysomething (don\u2019t ask, because she\u2019ll always deduct two years), divorced, Jewish grandmother. She is also, it turns out, an aspiring standup comedian.</p> <p>Her smile is the first thing people notice. But, behind it, confidence used to elude her. Then, in August 2014, she was diagnosed with a meningioma (a slow-growing tumour that can go undetected for decades), at the same time as dealing with the loss of both her parents and the breakdown of her marriage, to my dad.</p> <p>She was admitted to hospital, placed on a huge dose of steroids to stem the tumour that had caused months of crushing headaches, and then operated on 48 hours later. \u201cI woke up from the op in floods of tears,\u201d Mum reflects, five years on. \u201cIt lasted a couple of hours, and from then on everything was hilarious to me.\u201d</p> <p>The steroids triggered a major chemical imbalance. Mum spent more than a month in hospital, displaying behaviour so out of character \u2013 such as whispering to a crucifix in the Christian chapel, and casting a film of her life \u2013 that it was excruciating for my brother and me to watch. It turned out that this was also her comedic awakening. \u201cI can only think that it was a coping mechanism. The shock of going from normality to near death was too much to process,\u201d she says. Visiting Mum when her behaviour bore no resemblance to the parent I knew was frightening, but what followed was worse. Discharged from hospital, she plummeted to new lows. We watched, ashen, as she went from high as a kite to the lowest low. \u201cI would sit in my flat, hour after hour, watching time pass and not knowing who I was,\u201d she says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to stand up or sit down. I felt like a ghost. I couldn\u2019t think, I had no hope. For the only time in my life, I thought I\u2019d be better off dead.\u201d</p> <p>Her confidence was nonexistent. We suggested that she join a choir or get a dog, but she wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cMy oncologist knew I was never going to recover by sitting in coffee mornings,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Instead she relied on a \u201ccircle of trust\u201d (close friends, family, doctors), rebuilt her social life, and eventually went back to work on a perfume counter. \u201cI laughed again but my confidence was still shattered,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I feared it would be that way for the rest of her life but, 18 months ago, something changed. \u201cDarling, I\u2019m going on a little course,\u201d Mum rang to tell me. She had seen the first series of the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/\" title=\"\">The Marvel</a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/\" title=\"\">ous Mrs Maisel</a>, and was inspired. In the first episode of the Amazon Prime television show, Miriam \u201cMidge\u201d Maisel, a picture-perfect 1950s Manhattan housewife, arrives drunk and rain-drenched, in her nightgown, at the Gaslight comedy club, where she has spent months dutifully taking notes for her boring husband as he bombs at standup.</p> <p>Reeling from the revelation that he has been having an affair, Midge strides on stage, seizes the microphone and owns the room.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I used to care what people thought of me. But coming through my illness has taught me everyone sees things differently</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was transfixed. I related to her,\u201d Mum says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in rooms with people who think they are funny and secretly thought that I\u2019m funnier, but kept quiet. I thought, I want to do that.\u201d</p> <p>With uncharacteristic decisiveness, my mother booked herself on to a standup course at the King\u2019s Arms pub in Salford. It\u2019s a popular spot on the amateur circuit, but also the kind of place where she won\u2019t use the sole toilet because it\u2019s not clean enough. Three years earlier, she had been unable to summon the confidence to get up from a chair, but here she was now, seizing life. I could see the boost that standup was giving her, but hated the thought of her exposing herself to ridicule when she was vulnerable. \u201cI used to care what people thought of me because I was worried they misunderstood me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut coming through my illness has taught me that everyone sees things differently. In my first comedy lesson, they put each of us in the middle of the room. People fired questions at you, and you had to say whatever came into your head. That was such a relief. I didn\u2019t have to filter myself. It was just me and I didn\u2019t have to worry about pissing anyone off.\u201d</p> <p>Her first gig, in front of the King\u2019s Arms\u2019 Sunday regulars, was a hit.</p> <p>For a year, she wouldn\u2019t allow anyone who knew her (myself included) to watch, but continued performing with newfound confidence. Then she took the somewhat irrational decision to fill the upstairs room of a local pub with 60 people she knew, and gave herself top billing.</p> <p>On the night, she was visibly nervous, but her jokes were funny. I hated the idea that people would pass judgment on something she derived joy from, and found myself sliding down in my chair as my friend passed me a gin. I did laugh out loud (even at the one about dad filming her act \u201cbut not like he used to\u201d).</p> <p>But my overriding thought was, God, she\u2019s brave. She looked strong, healthy, glamorous. \u201cPeople say it takes guts,\u201d Mum says. \u201cTo me, it takes more guts to rein it in. I find that much harder.\u201d</p> <p>As with Mrs Maisel, mum\u2019s act is a two-fingers up to society\u2019s expectations. And she has some sharp gags: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve experienced dating in my 60s, I\u2019ve been thinking about a Love Island programme for the more mature,\u201d Mum says. \u201cCompanion Island: everyone gets up for a wee in the middle of the night and date nights start at 5pm.\u201d</p> <p>Mum tells me afterwards: \u201cIt\u2019s honest and it\u2019s sweary and, yes, probably not what people expect from me.\u201d</p> <p>Now, even the messages the family get from her read like lines she is testing out: \u201cThe guy who is deciding whether I need to go to a memory clinic\u2026 I just sent him a recipe by mistake. I imagine he may get me a quick referral now.\u201d She also has a WhatsApp group of comedy pals, called Live At The Apollo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/29/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-women-comedy\">The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and the difficulty of being a female comic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I asked her what the draw was. \u201cI don\u2019t consciously want people\u2019s adulation, but when they laugh, I think, great \u2013 because I\u2019ve made them happy,\u201d she says. \u201cThat gives me a feeling of worth. It doesn\u2019t give me a rush \u2013 it just feels as if I\u2019ve found something that\u2019s right for me.\u201d</p> <p>Mum admits that she worried my brother and I would think her foolish. \u201cYou\u2019re the only people I care about bombing in front of. Other than that, I\u2019m just sharing my unstraightforward life.\u201d</p> <p>And she\u2019s pretty sure what unleashed this later-life comic potential. \u201cI know, without a doubt, that my brain tumour was the catalyst. Maybe it was the trauma, maybe it was the drugs, maybe it was in me all along. I truly believe there is a capacity for good things coming out of bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

Mum spent more than a month in hospital, displaying behaviour so out of character \u2013 such as whispering to a crucifix in the Christian chapel, and casting a film of her life \u2013 that it was excruciating for my brother and me to watch. It turned out that this was also her comedic awakening. \u201cI can only think that it was a coping mechanism. The shock of going from normality to near death was too much to process,\u201d she says. Visiting Mum when her behaviour bore no resemblance to the parent I knew was frightening, but what followed was worse. Discharged from hospital, she plummeted to new lows. We watched, ashen, as she went from high as a kite to the lowest low. \u201cI would sit in my flat, hour after hour, watching time pass and not knowing who I was,\u201d she says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to stand up or sit down. I felt like a ghost. I couldn\u2019t think, I had no hope. For the only time in my life, I thought I\u2019d be better off dead.\u201d Her confidence was nonexistent. We suggested that she join a choir or get a dog, but she wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cMy oncologist knew I was never going to recover by sitting in coffee mornings,\u201d she says. Instead she relied on a \u201ccircle of trust\u201d (close friends, family, doctors), rebuilt her social life, and eventually went back to work on a perfume counter. \u201cI laughed again but my confidence was still shattered,\u201d she says. I feared it would be that way for the rest of her life but, 18 months ago, something changed. \u201cDarling, I\u2019m going on a little course,\u201d Mum rang to tell me. She had seen the first series of the The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, and was inspired. In the first episode of the Amazon Prime television show, Miriam \u201cMidge\u201d Maisel, a picture-perfect 1950s Manhattan housewife, arrives drunk and rain-drenched, in her nightgown, at the Gaslight comedy club, where she has spent months dutifully taking notes for her boring husband as he bombs at standup. Reeling from the revelation that he has been having an affair, Midge strides on stage, seizes the microphone and owns the room. \u201cI was transfixed. I related to her,\u201d Mum says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in rooms with people who think they are funny and secretly thought that I\u2019m funnier, but kept quiet. I thought, I want to do that.\u201d With uncharacteristic decisiveness, my mother booked herself on to a standup course at the King\u2019s Arms pub in Salford. It\u2019s a popular spot on the amateur circuit, but also the kind of place where she won\u2019t use the sole toilet because it\u2019s not clean enough. Three years earlier, she had been unable to summon the confidence to get up from a chair, but here she was now, seizing life. I could see the boost that standup was giving her, but hated the thought of her exposing herself to ridicule when she was vulnerable. \u201cI used to care what people thought of me because I was worried they misunderstood me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut coming through my illness has taught me that everyone sees things differently. In my first comedy lesson, they put each of us in the middle of the room. People fired questions at you, and you had to say whatever came into your head. That was such a relief. I didn\u2019t have to filter myself. It was just me and I didn\u2019t have to worry about pissing anyone off.\u201d Her first gig, in front of the King\u2019s Arms\u2019 Sunday regulars, was a hit. For a year, she wouldn\u2019t allow anyone who knew her (myself included) to watch, but continued performing with newfound confidence. Then she took the somewhat irrational decision to fill the upstairs room of a local pub with 60 people she knew, and gave herself top billing. On the night, she was visibly nervous, but her jokes were funny. I hated the idea that people would pass judgment on something she derived joy from, and found myself sliding down in my chair as my friend passed me a gin. I did laugh out loud (even at the one about dad filming her act \u201cbut not like he used to\u201d). But my overriding thought was, God, she\u2019s brave. She looked strong, healthy, glamorous. \u201cPeople say it takes guts,\u201d Mum says. \u201cTo me, it takes more guts to rein it in. I find that much harder.\u201d As with Mrs Maisel, mum\u2019s act is a two-fingers up to society\u2019s expectations. And she has some sharp gags: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve experienced dating in my 60s, I\u2019ve been thinking about a Love Island programme for the more mature,\u201d Mum says. \u201cCompanion Island: everyone gets up for a wee in the middle of the night and date nights start at 5pm.\u201d Mum tells me afterwards: \u201cIt\u2019s honest and it\u2019s sweary and, yes, probably not what people expect from me.\u201d Now, even the messages the family get from her read like lines she is testing out: \u201cThe guy who is deciding whether I need to go to a memory clinic\u2026 I just sent him a recipe by mistake. I imagine he may get me a quick referral now.\u201d She also has a WhatsApp group of comedy pals, called Live At The Apollo. I asked her what the draw was. \u201cI don\u2019t consciously want people\u2019s adulation, but when they laugh, I think, great \u2013 because I\u2019ve made them happy,\u201d she says. \u201cThat gives me a feeling of worth. It doesn\u2019t give me a rush \u2013 it just feels as if I\u2019ve found something that\u2019s right for me.\u201d Mum admits that she worried my brother and I would think her foolish. \u201cYou\u2019re the only people I care about bombing in front of. Other than that, I\u2019m just sharing my unstraightforward life.\u201d And she\u2019s pretty sure what unleashed this later-life comic potential. \u201cI know, without a doubt, that my brain tumour was the catalyst. Maybe it was the trauma, maybe it was the drugs, maybe it was in me all along. I truly believe there is a capacity for good things coming out of bad.\u201d \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

And then there are the small gestures: a coffee shop in Fiji donated all of its sales on Monday \u2013 F$3,000 (A$2,000) \u2013 to bushfire relief; a group of Red Cross volunteers in Vanuatu walked down the street collecting donations, carrying a sign reading: \u201cGive hope to Australian bush fire survivors\u201d. Giro Imbu, 35, organised a similar donation drive in Lae, Papua New Guinea\u2019s second-largest city, after seeing images of the bushfires on television. Imbu led a group of young people who walked through the city\u2019s settlements on Thursday and Friday collecting donations. On their first day they received 1,000 kina. \u201cWe see the environment was really devastated, we see the plants being destroyed, we see a lot of the countrymen losing their lives in the fire,\u201d Imbu said. \u201cWe\u2019re not very educated, but it has given us a drive \u2026 we want to help.\u201d To put all of this in context, in 2017 Vanuatu\u2019s GDP per capita was just under US$3,000, Papua New Guinea\u2019s was about US$2,500, Australia\u2019s was close to US$55,000. The minimum wage in PNG is 3.50 kina (A$1.50) an hour. As Morrison noted at his press conference \u2013 speaking about Vanuatu\u2019s pledge of $250,000 \u2013 \u201cit might not sound like a lot in terms of the tremendous assistance provided by many other countries, but from them, that was a gift from the heart\u201d. The heartfelt response of Pacific nations to Australia during this time is in part a reciprocation of the assistance Pacific countries receive from Australia when crises befall them. As James Marape, the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, noted in his statement about the fires: \u201cAustralia is the closest friend of PNG and is always the first in PNG in our times of adversities.\u201d After Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu in 2015, Australia committed $50m in support for early and long-term recovery. After Cyclone Winston caused damage in Fiji amounting to about 30% of its GDP in 2016, Australia stepped in with $35m for recovery efforts. Morrison also reminded the world of Australia\u2019s generosity as he was thanking Pacific countries for theirs, saying: \u201c[Pacific leaders] know how Australia has been faithful to them in their hours of need, and they just in their own way are trying to extend that in the best way they possibly can.\u201d But Australia\u2019s generosity also puts Pacific countries in a tight spot. Pacific leaders have to walk a difficult line: keeping Australia and its financial support on side, particularly as they face the prospect of increased climate-related natural disasters in their countries, while wanting to challenge Australia on its climate policies. Pacific leaders are among the most outspoken and effective climate leaders the world has. We know they are angry at Australia\u2019s refusal to transition away from coal, as well as Australia\u2019s use of carryover credits to meet Paris targets. We know, in the words of the former prime minister of Tuvalu, , Enele Sopoaga, that they see Australia as trying to save its economy, while they are working to save their people. We know that they knowAustralia is not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis \u2013 the same climate crisis that is seeing their islands suffer rising sea levels, increasingly frequent devastating cyclones, salinity of the water table, erosion of their islands; that same climate crisis that threatens to make Australia\u2019s current devastating fire season the norm for our future. And yet, still, they are there to offer us help. When asked whether he thought it was odd for people in a much poorer country like Papua New Guinea to be raising money for people in a wealthier one, Imbu, who organised the Lae fundraiser, said: \u201cWe live in an environment where the richest are getting richer and the poorest getting poorer, but as human beings we have this hardware, we try to help.\u201d Pacific nations deserve all the thanks Morrison has given them, but to survive, they need much more from him.",

But on the rare occasion when a briefing does occur, they tend to take on a distinctly Trumpian quality. Today was such an occasion, our Washington Bureau chief, David Smith, reports from the James S Brady Press Briefing Room.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was standing room only on Friday for the appearance of <strong>Mike Pompeo</strong>, the secretary of state, and <strong>Steven Mnuchin</strong>, the treasury secretary, announcing a fresh round of sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>One reporter asked Pompeo the very good question about why, after Donald Trump has spent the past three years denigrating and attacking the US intelligence community and disputing its findings, he (and we) should suddenly take their word that a Qasem Suleimani-inspired attack on US interests had been \u201cimminent\u201d.</p> <p>The secretary replied: \u201cAs the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, I watched him rely on the capable men and women who are delivering exquisite information to the executive branch. I watched the president have confidence in that information.</p> <p>\u201cWe all challenge their work. We have to make sure we get it right. The intelligence community is not flawless. We get it wrong. In this case, the intelligence community got it fundamentally right.\u201d</p> <p>For his part, Mnuchin repeated the Trumpian talking point that the Iran nuclear deal provided Iran with $150 billion in funds it then used to fund terrorism. The advocacy group National Security Action has described this as \u201ca despicable lie\u201d, pointing out that US and its partners provided sanctions relief to Iran and the vast majority of its unfrozen funds went to domestic needs including debt servicing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e18ab808f087e8308e6c256\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T16:53:02.779Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pelosi to deliver articles of impeachment to Senate next week</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>House Speaker <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a></strong> has announced that the next step of the <strong>impeachment</strong> of Donald Trump will take place next week.</p> <p>She will deliver the articles of impeachment against the president to the US Senate some time next week, which should trigger Trump\u2019s trial there.</p> <p>\u201cI have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate,\u201d Pelosi said in a letter to House Democrats.</p> <p>In the letter, she outlined the \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that has emerged since the House voted to impeach the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. </p> <p>According to Pelosi, that evidence includes a report that a top Office of Management and Budget aide asked the Department of Defense to \u201chold off\u201d on sending military aid to Ukraine less than two hours after Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president and the announcement from former National Security Advisor John Bolton that he would comply with a subpoena compelling his testimony. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T17:00:57.437Z\">at 5.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e18a9178f085eda5c115bf9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T16:50:36.260Z\">4.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Sanctions to hit Iranian metal and mining industries</h2> <p>The US\u2019s additional sanctions on Iran, just announced, in retaliation for its missile attack on US forces in Iraq this week are intended further to tighten the screws on the Iranian economy if Tehran continues to engage in what America regards as terrorist acts.</p> <p>The targets include Iran\u2019s manufacturing, mining and textile sectors as well as senior Iranian officials whom Washington said were involved in the January 8 attack on military bases in Iraq housing US troops, Reuters writes.

      "bodyText": "Kari Paul here, logging off for the weekend! Here is a summary of the key events of the last few hours: In a court filing on Friday, the Trump administration said it does not want the Supreme Court to hear its appeal of the Affordable Care Act any time soon, to give lower courts time to make rulings on it. Bernie Sanders is leading the latest polls in Iowa, with 20% of the vote. Warren follows close behind at 17%. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her decision on Friday not to pay dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). Two parents who were separated from their children as a result of zero-tolerance immigration policies have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration alleging child abuse over family separations. Two parents whose children were separated from them as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policies are suing the federal government for $12m, claiming the children were subject to abuse and neglect while in federal custody. \u201cThe United States government tore these families apart pursuant to a cruel and unconstitutional policy: The government intended to inflict terror and harm on these small children and their fathers, as a means of deterring others from seeking to enter the United States\u201d, said the lawsuit, which was filed Friday in U.S. District Court of Arizona. The families bringing the lawsuit said they were fleeing violence in Guatemala when they were detained in 2018 after crossing into the US border from Mexico. From the Hill: According to the lawsuit, the fathers were separated from their children for more than two months, and the federal government gave little, if any, information regarding the location and safety of the children. The families \u201csuffered, and continue to suffer, physical, mental, and emotional harm,\u201d the lawsuit states. More than a year after they were reunited, the lawsuit says the children exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. One of the plaintiffs, who is referred to in the lawsuit by the pseudonym Abel, described his ordeal in a statement released by the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cWe came looking for safety, and instead, we were caged like animals. [My son] was taken from me and I had no idea what was happening to him. When I learned that he was abused by other boys, I was sick with grief. No one deserves this cruelty,\u201d Abel said. Hollywood stars including activist and actor Jane Fonda and Joaquin Phoenix gathered at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington on Friday to demand action on climate change alongside other protesters. \u201cThe climate crisis makes our nation and all nations less secure,\u201d said Fonda. She referenced fires in Australia, which have ravaged tens of thousands of square miles of bushland and caused at least 27 deaths. The action Friday is part of Fonda\u2019s ongoing climate crisis protest series in DC, which is in its 14th week and have been attended by everyone from Ted Danson to Iain Armitage. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her decision on Friday not to pay dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), saying she donates \u201cquite a bit\u201d to fellow democrats in other ways. \u201cDCCC made clear that they will blacklist any org that helps progressive candidates like me\u201d, the New York representative wrote on Twitter. \u201cI can choose not to fund that kind of exclusion\u201d. Fox News reported Ocasio-Cortez was withholding $250,000 in dues from the DCCC. The group reported it raised $14.4m in Decemberto elect Democratic candidates. The number of Canadian passengers killed in the Ukrainian Airlines crash in Iran has been revised from 63 to 57, the Canada foreign minister announced on Friday. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday, killing 176 people total. Security officials believe it was shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile on accident. Bernie Sanders is now in the lead candidate in Iowa as the Feb. 3 caucus vote there quickly approaches. New numbers out on Friday from Selzer &amp; Co. showed the Vermont senator in the lead for the first time in the state, surging up five points to 20%. Meanwhile, 17% of likely Democratic caucus voters cited Senator Elizabeth Warren as their first choice, 16% cited Pete Buttigieg, and 15% chose Joe Biden. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that this is a good poll for Bernie Sanders\u201d, pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer &amp; Co., which conducted the poll said according to the Des Moines Register. \u201cHe leads, but it\u2019s not an uncontested lead. He\u2019s got a firmer grip on his supporters than the rest of his compatriots.\u201d In a court filing on Friday, the Trump administration said it does not want the Supreme Court to hear its appeal of the Affordable Care Act any time soon. That\u2019s because the key issue at the heart of the case - how much of the law should remain in effect - is still being litigated, CNN reports. \u201cAs the case comes to this Court, no lower-court ruling exists on severability or the appropriate remedy. Far from being urgently needed, this Court\u2019s review thus would be premature,\u201d the filing stated. The Supreme Court generally does not hear cases unless they have made their way through lower courts first, but if a majority votes it can be expedited. Singer Mandy Moore will join Pete Buttigieg at an Ames, Iowa town hall event on January 13, the campaign announced on Friday. Moore is perhaps best known for her 1999 hit Candy and is reigniting her career in recent months after coming forward with sexual harassment allegations against her ex husband Ryan Adams, whom she said prevented her from recording music. The pop star said in November she backs Buttigieg, saying \u201che is overwhelmingly qualified\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s my boy\u201d, she said of the former South Bend mayor. Buttigieg is making a number of appearances in the state ahead of the caucuses there on Feb. 3. Hello, Kari Paul on the West Coast here, taking over the blog for the next few hours. Stay tuned for updates. It\u2019s been a steady news day in Washington dominated by the \u201ctwo Is\u201d \u2013 impeachment and Iran. But there was plenty else to follow, even some Megxit news. Pelosi announced she would hold a vote to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate next week after nearly a month-long standoff between the chambers over next steps. The White House announced a fresh wave of sanctions against Iran, targeting key sectors \u2013 construction, manufacturing, textiles and mining \u2013 and eight top officials. The administration says the sanctions will \u201ccut off billions of support to the Iranian regime.\u201d Author and spiritual guru Marianne Williamson ended her campaign for president, conceding that she did not have enough support to win the Democratic nomination. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo backed Trump\u2019s assertion that the US was justified in killing Suleimani because of an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to American embassies and interests. Republican senator Susan Collins says she is quietly working with colleagues to pave the way for witnesses in the chamber\u2019s impeachment trial, which could begin as early as next week. Trump is reportedly considering expanding his controversial travel ban to include additional countries, the Associated Press reports. Happy Friday. Texas governor Greg Abbott, a staunch ally of the president, said the state will no participate in the federal refugee resettlement program citing security concerns. Texas is the first state to reject refugees under the president\u2019s new executive order requiring written consent before refugees are resettled in the state. In a letter to Pompeo released on Friday, Abbott wrote that Texas \u201chas been left by Congress to deal with disproportionate migration issues resulting from a broken federal immigration system.\u201d The state has long led the nation in refugee resettlement, a fact Abbott cites in the letter. Texas, he wrote, has done \u201cmore than its share.\u201d Texas congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat, called the move \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and accused Abbot of \u201cbigotry and xenophobia\u201d. Trump apparently covered a prolific number of topics in his sit down interview with Ingraham, which is due to air tonight. Among them, he was asked to weigh in on the \u201crouge royals\u201d \u2013 namely, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle \u2013 whose decision to step away from House Windsor stunned Buckingham Palace and divided the country, nay, the world. In the interview, Trump appears torn. But his thoughts are with the Queen. \u201cI think it\u2019s sad. I do. She\u2019s a great woman. She\u2019s never made a mistake, if you look. She\u2019s had, like, a flawless time,\u201d he said. \u201cI just have such respect for the Queen. I don\u2019t think this should be happening to her.\u201d The New York Times is reporting that the US failed an attempt to strike a top Iranian military official on the same day it killed Suleimani. Citing American officials, the Times writes: The unsuccessful airstrike in Yemen was aimed at Abdul Reza Shahlai, an official with Iran\u2019s Quds Force, a potent paramilitary organization. He was known as a key financier for Iran\u2019s proxy wars. President Trump approved the strike against Mr. Shahlai at the same time as he authorized the strike against General Suleimani, although it is unclear if the American attack in Yemen occurred at precisely the same time. The report is yet another indication that the public\u2019s understanding of a military strike that brought the US to the edge of war with Iran is far from complete. The administration is facing mounting questions about its justification for carrying out the drone strike, which triggered a retaliatory attack from Iran earlier this week. Read the whole story here. The White House is considering expanding the travel ban to additional countries, according to new reporting by the Associated Press. It is unclear which countries the White House is considering because the names are blacked out in a document outlining the proposal, the AP reports, citing four adminstration officials involved in the deliberations. The ban, which restricts travel from five majority-Muslim nations, is one of Trump\u2019s most controversial immigration policies. Its introduction caused chaos at US airports and sparked nationwide protests during his first days as president. The suggested changes are not finalized. The ban has gone through various iterations amid rounds of contentious legal battles. In June 2018, the Supreme Court upheld a pared-down version of the ban by a 5-4 vote that ruled the proclamation was \u201csquarely within the scope of Presidential authority.\u201d Read the full story here. It\u2019s become something of a tradition for Democrats to shower their formal rivals with well wishes and compliments as they exit the race. But for all the love Williamson shared during her campaign, almost none of the presidential candidates have marked her departure. Except for congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a veteran running for the White House on an antiwar platform. She thanked Williamson for her friendship and wished her \u201caloha\u201d. The Trump administration is known for many things. Accuracy is not one of them. In the latest example of a White House official bending history to defend the president\u2019s actions, spokesman Hogan Gidley accused the Obama administration of killing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In fact, he was killed by Libyan rebels in 2011. Also, Obama consulted Congress before killing Osama bin Laden. And here\u2019s a former National Security Council spokesman under Obama, Tommy Vietor, with a fact check. In a forthcoming interview with conservative Fox host Laura Ingraham, Trump \u201creveals\u201d that Suleimani was plotting to bomb \u201cfour embassies\u201d probably including the US\u2019 embassy in Baghdad. Trump also tells Ingraham that he will likely invoke executive privilege to prevent his former national security adviser from testifying in a Senate impeachment trial. US senator Susan Collins, who is facing a tough re-election race in Maine this cycle, is working with a \u201cfairly small group\u201d of Republican senators to allow witnesses to be called in the chamber\u2019s impeachment trial against Donald Trump, according to the Bangor Daily News. The trial could start as early as next week, after Nancy Pelosi announced that she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate in the coming days. Collins has said she would be open to calling witnesses even though Mitch McConnell is against it. But the Republicans have a slim majority, and just four defections and full Democratic support could compel witness testimony. The issue is a key sticking point in the impasse between the House and the Senate, with Pelosi demanding commitments from McConnell that he will pursue new evidence that has emerged since the House impeached Trump. McConnell has balked at the House\u2019s request and refused to make any such concessions. McConnell, meanwhile, said he has enough votes to pass a framework for the trial that would leave questions about witnesses and requesting documents until the end. McConnell has pledged \u201ctotal cooperation\u201d with the White House, and he and safe Republican senators have already vowed to acquit Trump. \u201cThis is not going to end well.\u201d Those words spoken by a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey official in the summer of 2013 could hardly have been more prophetic. The plot to create gridlock near the busy George Washington Bridge, which connects upper Manhattan with New Jersey, that September in order to punish a mayor for not endorsing Republican then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie left a trail of wreckage in its wake, The Associated Press writes. The scandal, dubbed \u201cBridgegate,\u201d derailed Christie\u2019s 2016 presidential bid and led to criminal convictions for two of his top aides. Now, the US Supreme Court will decide if prosecutors misapplied the law at the outset. The court will hear arguments next week on whether to throw out the fraud and conspiracy convictions of Bridget Kelly, Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a top Christie appointee to the Port Authority, the operator of New York-area bridges, tunnels, airports and ports. The court\u2019s decision, expected this spring, could have a far-reaching impact on how public corruption investigations are handled, similar to rulings in recent years involving former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling and former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. Those decisions restricted the government\u2019s latitude in bringing corruption cases. Both Bridgegate defendants are free on bail. Kelly was weeks from beginning a 13-month sentence last year when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Baroni had begun serving his 18-month sentence but was released from prison after the court granted certification. Kelly, author of the infamous \u201ctime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\u201d email, has contended she was a scapegoat for people higher up in the Christie administration. Christie wasn\u2019t charged and denied knowing about the plan. Kelly and Baroni contradicted this in court Three dedicated toll lanes from Fort Lee in New Jersey to the bridge, a major artery, were reduced to one on several mornings, causing massive traffic jams. Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, who has been at a standstill with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the articles of impeachment, had this to say in response to the news that she will send them next week: \u201cAbout time.\u201d New decade, same Russian interference in US presidential elections? Bloomberg is reporting today that US intelligence and law enforcement officials are \u201cassessing whether Russia is trying to undermine Joe Biden in its ongoing disinformation efforts with the former vice president still the front-runner in the race to challenge President Donald Trump.\u201d US officials have already sounded the alarm on Russia\u2019s continued meddling in US elections and warned that their operations this year will likely be more sophisticated than in 2016 or 2018. According to Bloomberg, which cites two officials familiar with the matter: \u201cPart of the inquiry is to determine whether Russia is trying to weaken Biden by promoting controversy over his past involvement in U.S. policy toward Ukraine while his son worked for an energy company there.\u201d The House impeached Trump last year on charges of abuse of power over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to open politically-motivated investigations into Biden and his family. The Kremlin strategy, if proven, would be similar to its operation carried out against Hillary Clinton in 2016, which US intelligence services determined to be a sophisticated meddling campaign designed to help elect Trump. Read the full story here. The stars never aligned for bestselling author and spiritual guru Marianne Williamson, who ran for president on a platform that preached the politics of love (appropriately the title of her latest book). \u201cI ran for president to help forge another direction for our country,\u201d Williamson wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cI wanted to discuss things i felt needed to be discussed that otherwise were not. I feel that we have done that.\u201d Williamson said the political reality was such that her campaign would \u201cnot be able to garner enough votes in the election to elevate our conversation any more than it is now\u201d and she did not want to stand in the way of a progressive candidate winning the nomination. Her dark horse presidential campaign championed reparations and a Department of Peace. She once vowed to \u201charness love for political purposes\u201d to cast away the fear that Donald Trump has unleashed on an America roiled by violence, addiction and pain. But Williamson languished at less than 1% in polls and had not qualified for a debate since July. The development had been expected after she laid off her entire 2020 campaign staff two weeks ago due to financial concerns. Williamson had a few standout moments during the first Democratic debate, quirky performances that both inspired an influx of campaign donations and countless parodies and online memes. \u201cA politics of conscience is still yet possible,\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201cAnd yes\u2026.love will prevail.\u201d Republican Congressman Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has apologized for accusing Democrats of being \u201cin love\u201d with terrorists. \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI do not believe Democrats are in love with terrorists, and I apologize for what I said earlier this week.\u201d The comments were sharply condemned by Democrats, including US senator Tammy Duckworth, who lost both of her legs fighting in the Iraq war. \u201cI\u2019m not going to dignify that with a response. I left parts of my body in Iraq fighting terrorists,\u201d Duckworth said on CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t need to justify myself to anyone.\u201d More than 300 days have passed since the last formal briefing from the White House press secretary. But on the rare occasion when a briefing does occur, they tend to take on a distinctly Trumpian quality. Today was such an occasion, our Washington Bureau chief, David Smith, reports from the James S Brady Press Briefing Room. There was standing room only on Friday for the appearance of Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, announcing a fresh round of sanctions on Iran. One reporter asked Pompeo the very good question about why, after Donald Trump has spent the past three years denigrating and attacking the US intelligence community and disputing its findings, he (and we) should suddenly take their word that a Qasem Suleimani-inspired attack on US interests had been \u201cimminent\u201d. The secretary replied: \u201cAs the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, I watched him rely on the capable men and women who are delivering exquisite information to the executive branch. I watched the president have confidence in that information. \u201cWe all challenge their work. We have to make sure we get it right. The intelligence community is not flawless. We get it wrong. In this case, the intelligence community got it fundamentally right.\u201d For his part, Mnuchin repeated the Trumpian talking point that the Iran nuclear deal provided Iran with $150 billion in funds it then used to fund terrorism. The advocacy group National Security Action has described this as \u201ca despicable lie\u201d, pointing out that US and its partners provided sanctions relief to Iran and the vast majority of its unfrozen funds went to domestic needs including debt servicing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that the next step of the impeachment of Donald Trump will take place next week. She will deliver the articles of impeachment against the president to the US Senate some time next week, which should trigger Trump\u2019s trial there. \u201cI have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate,\u201d Pelosi said in a letter to House Democrats. In the letter, she outlined the \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that has emerged since the House voted to impeach the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. According to Pelosi, that evidence includes a report that a top Office of Management and Budget aide asked the Department of Defense to \u201chold off\u201d on sending military aid to Ukraine less than two hours after Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president and the announcement from former National Security Advisor John Bolton that he would comply with a subpoena compelling his testimony. Sanctions to hit Iranian metal and mining industries The US\u2019s additional sanctions on Iran, just announced, in retaliation for its missile attack on US forces in Iraq this week are intended further to tighten the screws on the Iranian economy if Tehran continues to engage in what America regards as terrorist acts. The targets include Iran\u2019s manufacturing, mining and textile sectors as well as senior Iranian officials whom Washington said were involved in the January 8 attack on military bases in Iraq housing US troops, Reuters writes. On a list are 17 Iranian metals producers and mining companies and a network of Iranian industrial entities located in China and the Seychelles, and a vessel used to moved Iranian metal. The Iranian missiles fired into Iraq earlier this week (which also allegedly and possibly accidentally, brought down a Ukrainian flight leaving Tehran) followed the assassination by the US of top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani last week, in Iraq, as he was being driven from the airport in Baghdad. That was the most dramatic action in a tit-for-tat US-Iran crisis that blew up at the close of 2019. Reaction so far is mixed. And details are not yet comprehensive. \u201cWe are announcing additional sanctions against the Iranian regime,\u201d Mnuchin said at a White House news conference on Friday. The fresh wave of economic sanctions is in response to Iran\u2019s launch of missiles against US troops in Iraq this week, which was in response to a drone strike that killed the top Iranian commander. The sanctions were widely anticipated after Trump vowed to hit Iran with them in a speech earlier this week. They will target senior government officials and key sectors of Iran\u2019s economy. \u201cWe had specific information on an imminent threat, and that threat included US embassies. Period. Full stop,\u201d secretary of state Mike Pompeo said at a White House press briefing with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cWe would have been culpably negligent if we had not recommended\u201d the strike against Suleimani, he added. Pompeo said this analysis was \u201ccompletely consistent\u201d with his earlier comments that the US did not know precisely \u201cwhen\u201d or \u201cwhere\u201d the \u201cimminent\u201d attacks were planned. He also insisted that these new details about a possible threat to US embassies, which Trump first disclosed at a rally on Thursday night, were shared with lawmakers during a classified briefing earlier this week. He also said Iraq\u2019s prime minster mischaracterized their conversation on US troop withdrawal from the region. \u201cWe are happy to continue the conversations with the Iraqis on what the rights structure is,\u201d he said. Pompeo also endorsed mounting evidence that the Ukrainian passenger jet was accidentally shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile. Mnuchin said the US was prepared to issue waivers for Americans to be allowed to assist with the investigation of a plane crash in Tehran. The Trump administration has spurned a request by the Iraqi prime minister to begin planning for the withdrawl of American troops from the country. Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi asked US secretary of state Mike Pompeo to begin putting together an exit stratgey on a call Thursday night, according to the prime minister\u2019s office. He also told Pompeo that recent US strikes in Iraq were an unacceptable breach of Iraqi sovereignty and in violation of the bilateral agreements,\u201d according to the statement. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus called the US a \u201cforce for good\u201d in Iraq and ruled out any discussion of a troop withdrawl in a statement. \u201cAt this time, any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership\u2014not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,\u201d she said. \u201cAmerica is a force for good in the Middle East,\u201d Ortagus said. \u201cOur military presence in Iraq is to continue the fight against ISIS and as the Secretary has said, we are committed to protecting Americans, Iraqis, and our coalition partners.\u201d Iraq\u2019s parliament passed a resolution Sunday to remove US troops after the death of Suleimani, who was killed alongside senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad\u2019s airport. Meanwhile, Pompeo has been on Fox News defending the strike that killed Suleimani. \u201cThere is no doubt that there were a series of imminent attacks being plotted by Qassem Suleimani,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know precisely when and we don\u2019t know precisely where, but it was real.\u201d Trump has been on something of a spree retweeting and sharing flattering commentary about the state of the economy, the strike on Suleimani and his newly-confirmed administrator for the Small Business Administration. He has also conspicuously retweeted posts from vulnerable Republican senators \u2013 and occassional critics of the president \u2013 who are facing pressure from constituents to support his impeachment, including Susan Collins and Cory Gardner. Nancy Pelosi has said she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate when she is ready. She is apparently not ready. NBC News is reporting that Democratic presidential hopeful and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg will bequeath his impressive campaign apparatus, including an \u201carmy of some 500 staffers\u201d, to the eventual 2020 nominee, whether that person is him or not. The effort reflects the billionaire\u2019s commitment to defeating Donald Trump even if he is not the one to do it. \u201cBloomberg\u2019s vast tech operation will also be redirected to help the eventual nominee, as Democrats struggle to compete with the vaunted digital operation built by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. Hawkfish, a digital company started by Bloomberg that\u2019s carrying out his $100 million online ad campaign, will be retained through Election Day to help defeat President Donald Trump, the [campaign officials] said. Awaiting another nominee would be a shadow field operation across the country that\u2019s currently unparalleled in size by any of the other candidates in the presidential race. The roughly 500 staff Bloomberg has committed to paying through November include those in battleground states like Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as in Arizona. Read more about the plan here. Bernie Sanders met his doppelg\u00e4nger, the comedian Larry David, on the set of NBC\u2019s Today show this morning. David complained that a Sanders victory in 2020 would be \u201cgreat for the country, terrible for me\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m getting you a good job for four years and you\u2019re complaining,\u201d Sanders quipped. In a nearly nine-minute interview, Sanders cast doubt on Trump\u2019s claim that Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, who was killed last week in a targeted air strike, was planning to bomb US embassies. \u201cI sat in [an] intelligence briefing \u2013 a classified briefing \u2013 the day before and not one word of that was mentioned. Is it true? I don\u2019t know ... The difficulty that we have \u2013 and I don\u2019t meant to be rude here \u2013 is that we have a president who is a pathological liar. Could be true? I guess it could be. Is it likely to be true? Probably not.\u201d Good morning, US politics watchers, it\u2019s another tense day in Washington as all on Capitol Hill hold their breath over the impeachment process. And the 2020 race is heating up. Stay tuned. For news on the US jobs figures, please follow our business blog, here, and for minute-by-minute developments in the US-Iran crisis, we have a blog out of our London HQ, here. Here\u2019s what\u2019s we\u2019re watching in US politics today: It\u2019s almost a month since the House voted on the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump - and Nancy Pelosi immediately put the next step on hold and has refused to deliver the articles (AKA congressional charges) to the US Senate, which triggers the trial of the president. She says \u201csoon\u201d, but when is soon? We\u2019re on the lookout. A new national Reuters/Ipsos poll has Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders out ahead of the rest in the field for the 2020 Democratic party nomination to take on Donald Trump in the November election. Elizabeth Warren is third, but some way back. It\u2019s the last Democratic debate before the first voting for the nominee, with candidates taking the stage in Des Moines, Iowa, next Tuesday just a few short weeks before the Iowa caucuses on 3 February. Shockingly, billionaire outsider Tom Steyer last night made the cut for the debate.",

      "bodyText": "Marianne Williamson announced the end of her 2020 presidential campaign on the day of the wolf moon eclipse, as the year\u2019s first full moon moved into the Earth\u2019s outer shadow. The self-help author and spiritual adviser to Oprah, who as a presidential candidate charmed and confused Americans with her \u201cpolitics of love\u201d, told supporters that though her path had diverged from the campaign trail, \u201ca politics of conscience is still yet possible\u201d. Even before she announced in January 2018 that she was jumping in the race to unseat Donald Trump, she floated a mysterious job listing for a social media director to join a presidential bid that was \u201cpart campaign\u201d but also \u201cpart startup, part spiritual movement\u201d. If the 2020 Democratic presidential field was broad, Williamson\u2019s campaign was so out there she may as well have been on another astral plane. On the one hand, Williamson, 67, was the only candidate to strongly advocate for reparations for African Americans. She advocated for stronger environmental protections, in discussing the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. In part due to Donald Trump\u2019s rollback of environmental protections, \u201cwe have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country, who are suffering from environmental injustice\u201d, she said during the first Democratic primary debate in July. Her contributions were unexpectedly lucid at times, though she often distracted from the otherwise strictly structured debate. Williamson discussed Trump\u2019s legacy as a \u201cdark psychic force of collectivized hatred\u201d. She referred to \u201ctoxicity\u201d and \u201cemotional turbulence\u201d that required \u201chealing\u201d. She flouted norms by referring to the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, as \u201cgirlfriend\u201d. While Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden presented policy proposals, Williamson dismissed such discourse as \u201cwonkiness\u201d.

Momentum\u2019s coordinating committee is expected to meet on Saturday to decide which candidates it will support for the leadership and deputy leadership. Long-Bailey is highly likely to be their choice for leader, not least because the group\u2019s founder Jon Lansman is advising her \u2013 but it is unclear which candidate the powerful group will back for deputy. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Long-Bailey calls for Momentum to throw its formidable campaigning machinery behind Rayner \u2013 instead of supporting Corbynite favourite Richard Burgon. Burgon, secretary of the Campaign Group of socialist MPs, is backed by Long-Bailey\u2019s longtime mentor, John McDonnell, as well as staunch Corbyn loyalists including Diane Abbott, Ian Lavery and the recently defeated MP for Durham North West, Laura Pidcock.

A bloc of younger, leftwing MPs, including Lloyd Russell Moyle, Dan Carden and Alex Sobel have yet to declare, however.

But, if you make every step a forward one, going uphill and improving in some way or another in life, then you\u2019re doing just fine and wherever you end up is where you end up. But try not to think about where you do end up. Just keep climbing; that\u2019s what I live by.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is a philosophy that has served Frost well in the five years since riding her first winner, in a lowly hunter chase at Musselburgh in February 2015, but some of the forward steps, inevitably, are more significant than others.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/11/bryony-frost-frodon-gold-cup-kempton-silviniaco-conti-chase\">Bryony Frost and \u2018brilliant\u2019 Frodon on Gold Cup trail after Kempton success</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Victory in the Foxhunters\u2019 Chase at the 2017 Cheltenham Festival prompted the switch from amateur to professional status. Within a year she had her first Grade One winner, at Kempton on Boxing Day, and in March 2019 her second, as Frodon\u2019s heroic success in the Ryanair Chase made Frost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/14/bryony-frost-first-woman-ride-grade-one-winner-jumps-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing\" title=\"\">the first female rider to win a Grade One at the Cheltenham Festival</a>. She ended last season as the champion conditional, having ridden out her claim with her 75th winner in November 2018.</p> \n<p>The going has been a little tougher in recent months, as it so often is for the best conditionals in their first season without a claim. A 20% strike-rate in the first three months of 2019 dropped to 12% for the remainder of the year, and a shoulder injury forced her to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/mar/21/talking-horses-bryony-frost-to-miss-grand-national-over-bone-break\" title=\"\">miss the whole of the Grand National meeting at Aintree</a>.</p> \n<p>But her zest for the jump jockey\u2019s life remains undimmed and never more so than when a reunion with Frodon is in her immediate future. It is rare to find a horse and rider with such a visible connection and, while their first two outings this season have yet to yield a victory, the Grade Two Silviniaco Conti Chase at Kempton on Saturday offers an ideal platform to rediscover their winning habit with a return to Cheltenham now only two months away.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14065a9c20f5453519302fce62426eb5ed4d0c25\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14065a9c20f5453519302fce62426eb5ed4d0c25/0_184_4512_2708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryony Frost celebrates victory on Frodon in the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryony Frost celebrates victory on Frodon in the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs a jockey our job is to better our horses\u2019 careers,\u201d Frost says. \u201cEvery time you go out, you have to think, what can I do better, how can I make it smoother, where can I find his rhythm, does he like his own space or to be in the crowd with the hustle and bustle?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about learning their map, and which is the best road to take to get you there as quick as possible. But when you start to develop a connection with your horse and learn his character and the way he likes to do things, and then you click, it\u2019s a magic place to be when you\u2019re out on that track.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the races you win will probably be the ones with the least problems. It\u2019s races when you finish third or fourth or mid-div that are hard to ride, because you\u2019re always racking your head and thinking, where could I have found him half a length and could I have cut the corner a bit more there.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you win a race, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Well, that was smooth, how cool was that?\u2019, because everything\u2019s gone right, and Cheltenham was like riding a wave. We cruised along, found a rhythm and never came out of it.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/14/bryony-frost-first-woman-ride-grade-one-winner-jumps-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing\">Bryony Frost makes history with Frodon in Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Friday was a rare afternoon off for Frost after trips to Exeter, Wincanton, Chepstow, Lingfield, Plumpton and then Catterick in the first few days of 2020. Rare, and not entirely welcome for a rider who lives for the heat of competition, although the inevitable injuries that are part of every jump jockey\u2019s life have helped to adjust her outlook.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s taught me patience and to focus,\u201d she says. \u201cYou dedicate your life to racing and your horses and analysing races for your horse so you can have the best chance possible. When you take that out of your life, you\u2019re twiddling your thumbs and a bit lost and not sure quite where to go.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have to dedicate your head to getting your body back, because that\u2019s your career. It taught me how to try to swap my dedication on to myself. I took myself out of my own head and saw my body as my career, and took my emotion away from it all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even in the little spare time she has, Frost keeps climbing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do a bit of bouldering,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s good for your body and also, you\u2019re only ever thinking about the next move.

      "bodyText": "If there is a gene for positivity, Bryony Frost has it twice. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way off if you look at the top of the mountain sometimes,\u201d she said this week, on the road home from Catterick after finishing fourth and then last on her only rides. \u201cIt can be daunting; hence why I never set any goals. But, if you make every step a forward one, going uphill and improving in some way or another in life, then you\u2019re doing just fine and wherever you end up is where you end up. But try not to think about where you do end up. Just keep climbing; that\u2019s what I live by.\u201d It is a philosophy that has served Frost well in the five years since riding her first winner, in a lowly hunter chase at Musselburgh in February 2015, but some of the forward steps, inevitably, are more significant than others. Victory in the Foxhunters\u2019 Chase at the 2017 Cheltenham Festival prompted the switch from amateur to professional status. Within a year she had her first Grade One winner, at Kempton on Boxing Day, and in March 2019 her second, as Frodon\u2019s heroic success in the Ryanair Chase made Frost the first female rider to win a Grade One at the Cheltenham Festival. She ended last season as the champion conditional, having ridden out her claim with her 75th winner in November 2018. The going has been a little tougher in recent months, as it so often is for the best conditionals in their first season without a claim. A 20% strike-rate in the first three months of 2019 dropped to 12% for the remainder of the year, and a shoulder injury forced her to miss the whole of the Grand National meeting at Aintree. But her zest for the jump jockey\u2019s life remains undimmed and never more so than when a reunion with Frodon is in her immediate future. It is rare to find a horse and rider with such a visible connection and, while their first two outings this season have yet to yield a victory, the Grade Two Silviniaco Conti Chase at Kempton on Saturday offers an ideal platform to rediscover their winning habit with a return to Cheltenham now only two months away. \u201cAs a jockey our job is to better our horses\u2019 careers,\u201d Frost says. \u201cEvery time you go out, you have to think, what can I do better, how can I make it smoother, where can I find his rhythm, does he like his own space or to be in the crowd with the hustle and bustle? \u201cIt\u2019s all about learning their map, and which is the best road to take to get you there as quick as possible. But when you start to develop a connection with your horse and learn his character and the way he likes to do things, and then you click, it\u2019s a magic place to be when you\u2019re out on that track. \u201cBut the races you win will probably be the ones with the least problems. It\u2019s races when you finish third or fourth or mid-div that are hard to ride, because you\u2019re always racking your head and thinking, where could I have found him half a length and could I have cut the corner a bit more there. \u201cWhen you win a race, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Well, that was smooth, how cool was that?\u2019, because everything\u2019s gone right, and Cheltenham was like riding a wave. We cruised along, found a rhythm and never came out of it.\u201d Friday was a rare afternoon off for Frost after trips to Exeter, Wincanton, Chepstow, Lingfield, Plumpton and then Catterick in the first few days of 2020. Rare, and not entirely welcome for a rider who lives for the heat of competition, although the inevitable injuries that are part of every jump jockey\u2019s life have helped to adjust her outlook. \u201cIt\u2019s taught me patience and to focus,\u201d she says. \u201cYou dedicate your life to racing and your horses and analysing races for your horse so you can have the best chance possible. When you take that out of your life, you\u2019re twiddling your thumbs and a bit lost and not sure quite where to go. \u201cYou have to dedicate your head to getting your body back, because that\u2019s your career. It taught me how to try to swap my dedication on to myself. I took myself out of my own head and saw my body as my career, and took my emotion away from it all.\u201d Even in the little spare time she has, Frost keeps climbing. \u201cI do a bit of bouldering,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s good for your body and also, you\u2019re only ever thinking about the next move. You can\u2019t think about anything else, just climbing your wall. \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy to switch off completely, because it\u2019s what makes your heart beat and what you live for. When you get a hurdle or a fence right, it\u2019s a mega-moment. You just don\u2019t get moments like that in day-to-day life. I wouldn\u2019t want to get up in the morning if I didn\u2019t have a horse involved in my day.\u201d Chris Cook\u2019s TV races guide This could be a big Saturday for the colours of JP McManus, which may come to the fore in both of the main betting races, notably Warwick\u2019s Classic Chase.

      "body": "<p>\u201cA lot of the time, when I swim, I close my eyes because it is definitely lonely,\u201d Ellie Simmonds says as she considers the emotional, physical and psychological demands she endures in the pool year after year. Simmonds has won eight medals, and five of them are gold, at three Paralympic Games but she should be praised most for her honesty in addressing the brutal rituals of swimming and the sometimes damaging environment of elite sport.</p> <p>She should be commended for the fact that, in a Paralympic and Olympic year, she stands up for herself and her teammates in an often isolating atmosphere that has pushed her to the brink of retirement and which, even now in this interview, can make her eyes fill with tears.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/30/olympics-world-cups-and-more-tom-jenkins-pictures-of-the-decade\">Olympics, World Cups and more: Tom Jenkins' pictures of the decade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Simmonds was born with achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that means she is only four feet tall, but her presence is striking as soon as we meet in north London. \u201cSwimming takes so much out of you,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m up at half four in the morning and I try to be in bed by half nine. Those are not social hours and trying to be a normal 25\u2011year\u2011old is really tough. Your friends and family know you\u2019re a professional swimmer, but they don\u2019t always understand the demands. It\u2019s not just about the two-hour sessions in the pool. It\u2019s also about what you eat, your sleep, rest, recovery, physio. All of it is time-consuming.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m currently training nine times a week in the water and that\u2019s excluding the gym work and yoga. On a typical Monday I swim from six until 8am. I go from there to the gym and do a session from nine until half 10. I get home about 11ish. Take a nap and have lunch. Swim from half three to half five. I get home at half six. Have dinner. Monday to Fridays I\u2019m practically an athlete every hour of the day. I try and socialise a little on the weekends. Of course each training session in the pool changes. This morning it was threshold tests so it\u2019s about working for a long time at high intensity. Last night was sprint-based.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/10/tokyo-receive-unprecedented-demand-2020-paralympics-tickets-athletics\" title=\"\">The 2020 Paralympic Games</a> begin in Tokyo on 25 August and so, less than eight months from competition, Simmonds summarises her typical day in cheerful detail. She is happy to work hard in pursuit of a sixth gold medal \u2013 but it is far more difficult when the training environment is sour. Simmonds stresses how content she is now, reunited with her old coach Billy Pye. But four years ago, before and then during the Rio Games, Simmonds hit her lowest point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66ab4a69077289df09bcb349a2f8def15bdc9302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66ab4a69077289df09bcb349a2f8def15bdc9302/0_511_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simmonds in action at Rio 2016. \u2018I spoke to my parents and my agent a year before.

That\u2019s why I had a year out afterwards because I needed to get away from swimming.\u201d</p> <p>Simmonds had already come close to quitting. \u201cI spoke to my parents and my agent a year before Rio.

Performing in front of a big crowd gives you that extra oomph.\u201d</p> <p>Does the adversity preceding Rio make her gold medal in the 200m individual medley feel more special? Simmonds shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t really remember much. I don\u2019t watch my Rio races back. I\u2019ll look at my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwGJtBFpSCM\" title=\"\">London 2012 races</a> a lot. But not Rio.\u201d</p> <p>Why did those Paralympics hurt her so much? \u201cIt was the staff,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were some not very nice people in the [coaching] team.\u201d</p> <p>Simmonds is so upset she begins to cry. We stop the interview and, while we talk off the record, I understand how corrosive the atmosphere must have been. It is also understandable that Simmonds does not want to divulge details now, as her focus must be on Tokyo, but it is clear she will eventually speak on the record so no future Paralympic coaches will cause such distress to their athletes.</p> <p>After Simmonds composes herself, I ask if, as one of the senior figures in the last Paralympic cycle, she had been able to challenge her former coaches? \u201cIt\u2019s hard. When you\u2019re in a team you\u2019ve got hierarchies \u2013 staff who put you down \u2013 and it is hard to have a voice. I\u2019m lucky my teammates were so supportive.

If someone\u2019s positive, it gets me happy and positive and I perform so much better.\u201d</p> <p>When she had such a tough time in 2015 and 2016, while Pye was working in China, did they speak often? \u201cI did and he was always there for me. It was hard him being in China and hard for me to fully open up. I also think when you\u2019re in the moment you try to toughen up. All of us [swimmers] were putting our shields up and not expressing how bad it actually was. When you\u2019re in it, you just think it\u2019s normal.\u201d</p> <p>Happiness is the new normal for Simmonds and on Monday she flew with the GB squad to Japan for three weeks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the same place where our holding camp will be before the Tokyo Games.

April is trials for Tokyo. In May I\u2019ve got the Europeans in Madeira.\u201d</p> <p>Simmonds made her winning Paralympic debut at the age of 13 in Beijing. She has been swimming at this elite level ever since \u2013 apart from when she took a year-long break in 2017. She spent most of her time away travelling in South Africa, Australia, America and China. \u201cI had been so used to my life being only about swimming.

I was ready then, at 21, to figure out what else I was in life.</p> <p>\u201cIt was about my whole identity and it changed me hugely. Travelling gives you confidence and opens you up to the real world. When I was younger I would want the next designer bag.

      "bodyText": "\u201cA lot of the time, when I swim, I close my eyes because it is definitely lonely,\u201d Ellie Simmonds says as she considers the emotional, physical and psychological demands she endures in the pool year after year. Simmonds has won eight medals, and five of them are gold, at three Paralympic Games but she should be praised most for her honesty in addressing the brutal rituals of swimming and the sometimes damaging environment of elite sport. She should be commended for the fact that, in a Paralympic and Olympic year, she stands up for herself and her teammates in an often isolating atmosphere that has pushed her to the brink of retirement and which, even now in this interview, can make her eyes fill with tears. Simmonds was born with achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that means she is only four feet tall, but her presence is striking as soon as we meet in north London. \u201cSwimming takes so much out of you,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m up at half four in the morning and I try to be in bed by half nine. Those are not social hours and trying to be a normal 25\u2011year\u2011old is really tough. Your friends and family know you\u2019re a professional swimmer, but they don\u2019t always understand the demands. It\u2019s not just about the two-hour sessions in the pool. It\u2019s also about what you eat, your sleep, rest, recovery, physio. All of it is time-consuming. \u201cI\u2019m currently training nine times a week in the water and that\u2019s excluding the gym work and yoga. On a typical Monday I swim from six until 8am. I go from there to the gym and do a session from nine until half 10. I get home about 11ish. Take a nap and have lunch. Swim from half three to half five. I get home at half six. Have dinner. Monday to Fridays I\u2019m practically an athlete every hour of the day. I try and socialise a little on the weekends. Of course each training session in the pool changes. This morning it was threshold tests so it\u2019s about working for a long time at high intensity. Last night was sprint-based.\u201d The 2020 Paralympic Games begin in Tokyo on 25 August and so, less than eight months from competition, Simmonds summarises her typical day in cheerful detail. She is happy to work hard in pursuit of a sixth gold medal \u2013 but it is far more difficult when the training environment is sour. Simmonds stresses how content she is now, reunited with her old coach Billy Pye. But four years ago, before and then during the Rio Games, Simmonds hit her lowest point. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy Rio. My teammates were great but some of the staff made it a really negative place. It\u2019s hard when you go to an environment and you don\u2019t want to be there. That\u2019s why I had a year out afterwards because I needed to get away from swimming.\u201d Simmonds had already come close to quitting. \u201cI spoke to my parents and my agent a year before Rio. I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this. I want to get away.\u2019 They said: \u2018Just grit your teeth for a year. Then you can have your break. And if you want to retire, you can retire then.\u2019 I was in tears. I just hated it.\u201d It says a lot about Simmonds that she still won gold and bronze in 2016. \u201cThat was just grim determination,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the Paralympics is something else. Performing in front of a big crowd gives you that extra oomph.\u201d Does the adversity preceding Rio make her gold medal in the 200m individual medley feel more special? Simmonds shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t really remember much. I don\u2019t watch my Rio races back. I\u2019ll look at my London 2012 races a lot. But not Rio.\u201d Why did those Paralympics hurt her so much? \u201cIt was the staff,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were some not very nice people in the [coaching] team.\u201d Simmonds is so upset she begins to cry. We stop the interview and, while we talk off the record, I understand how corrosive the atmosphere must have been. It is also understandable that Simmonds does not want to divulge details now, as her focus must be on Tokyo, but it is clear she will eventually speak on the record so no future Paralympic coaches will cause such distress to their athletes. After Simmonds composes herself, I ask if, as one of the senior figures in the last Paralympic cycle, she had been able to challenge her former coaches? \u201cIt\u2019s hard. When you\u2019re in a team you\u2019ve got hierarchies \u2013 staff who put you down \u2013 and it is hard to have a voice. I\u2019m lucky my teammates were so supportive. We were all in it together and we supported each other.\u201d It sounds as if the Paralympians were bullied before 2016? \u201cOh, for sure. We were professional athletes. The youngest in our group was 17.\u201d The atmosphere surrounding the GB Paralympic swimmers now seems positive and healthy and Simmonds lights up when talking about Pye as her coach again. She has also joined Team Speedo, alongside British swimmers including Siobhan-Marie O\u2019Connor, Duncan Scott, Ollie Hynd and Freya Anderson, in an arrangement where there are training and sponsorship advantages. \u201cWe\u2019ve got really good athletes both on the Paralympic and the Olympic side. I\u2019ve worn Speedo since I was a kid and when they asked me to join I was delighted. From Monday to Wednesday I train with [Team Speedo] in Camden. Thursday, Friday, Saturday I\u2019m at the aquatic centre with Billy. I get the best of both worlds.\u201d Pye has transformed Simmonds\u2019 mood. \u201cOne-to-one training with Billy is really good because he knows me so well. He coached me [to four gold medals] in Beijing and London and, like Billy says, a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer. It sounds deep but we\u2019ve only got one life, and you\u2019ve got to enjoy what you do. That\u2019s really important \u2013 especially in swimming as it\u2019s so demanding. If you don\u2019t want to do it, what\u2019s the point? I love what I do now and I\u2019ve got a great team around me. I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ve been able to take control, as an older athlete, and pick who I work with. \u201cBilly was a miner before he was a coach. He\u2019s the happiest guy ever. He\u2019s never grumpy because when he wakes up he doesn\u2019t think coaching is his job. He loves it. Having that kind of person around makes you happy. I radiate that. If someone\u2019s positive, it gets me happy and positive and I perform so much better.\u201d When she had such a tough time in 2015 and 2016, while Pye was working in China, did they speak often? \u201cI did and he was always there for me.
