But Patricia says she has seen no details about this move: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing from China; there\u2019s nothing from Solomon Islands.\u201d</p> <p>Most students are fearful about moving to universities located in cities they\u2019d never heard of and few have complied. Patricia now faces using her small savings, money her husband left her when he died last year, to pay for her daughter\u2019s tuition.</p> <h2>\u2018You cannot yoke a cat with an elephant\u2019</h2> <p>The people of the island of Malaita, an independently-minded and pro-Taiwan part of the country, are angry not only at the Sogavare Government\u2019s decision, but the way it was made.</p> <p>In the wake of the news, Sogavare dispatched Malaitan MPs within his government back to their constituencies to explain the government\u2019s position. Video circulating on social media shows the degree of public anger faced by the MPs, who were met with vocal condemnation as they travelled the province.</p> <p>\u201cI think Prime Minister Sogavare should go and tell people in [the] community and after he declared that he [can] make change,\u201d says David, 32, who sells betel nut at a wooden stand in central Auki.</p> <p>Weeks earlier, David was one of an estimated 500 Malaitans who protested against the switch.

But their presence has long caused tension and in 2006, Chinese businesses in Honiara were infamously ransacked following accusations of Beijing\u2019s influence in that year\u2019s election.</p> <p>There is concern that the anti-China sentiment is not just driven by pro-democracy sentiment but also by anti-China racism.</p> <p>One of the rioters that day was Richard Olita, the bearded, burly 35-year-old secretary of Malaita for Democracy, an anti-Beijing Malaitan independence movement.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot yoke a cat with an elephant. China is too big for us\u201d, says Olita. \u201cGiven the weak economy, and the weak country, even the institutions of this country, it\u2019s not strong, so we cannot work with China. They will just overpower us.\u201d</p> <p>Malaita for Democracy doesn\u2019t just want to stop Malaita forming a relationship with Beijing, they want existing Chinese businesses in Auki expelled from the province and are using their influence to try and get the provincial government to do this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b354334e254705c3929a8c864bab07c5efc88cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b354334e254705c3929a8c864bab07c5efc88cd/167_0_3277_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children swim in water off Savo island, which islanders fear could be leased by a Chinese company.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children swim in water off Savo island, which islanders fear could be leased by a Chinese company.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Cavanough/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Already, Sudaini\u2019s provincial government has pledged to prohibit businesses \u201cdirectly or indirectly linked to the Chinese Communist Party\u201d from obtaining Malaitan business licenses and closed at least one Chinese-owned store.</p> <p>Despite Honiara severing ties with Taiwan, some hope Auki can still cobble together some form of relationship with Taipei.</p> <p>Taiwan has not ruled out such an arrangement.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as relations are built on a foundation of equality and mutual assistance for mutual benefit, we do not rule out any possibilities,\u201d says Ou.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, we do not have any plans for future cooperation at this time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/dec/2019-12-05T04:48:03.html\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/dec/2019-12-05T04:48:03.html\">Map</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fears Savo could be leased to China</strong></h2> <p>A small volcanic clump 35km off the coast of the Honiara, Savo has a population of just 4,000 people, who maintain their own language, Savo Savo, and culture entirely distinct from neighbouring islands.</p> <p>Islanders travel by foot from village to village. There are no motorised vehicles or television on the island. Children spend their afternoons paddling dugout canoes and fishing in turquoise waters, while adults still re-construct thatched-roofed, bamboo framed huts that were decimated by Tropical Cyclone Mona in January.</p> <p>But over the last few months the islanders have been worried that their way of life is under threat from China. Shortly after the diplomatic switch, the premier of Central Province Stanley Maniteva signed an agreement with a Chinese company called SAM Group, to lease the provincial capital of Tulagi and \u201csurrounding islands\u201d, without specifying which ones were in China\u2019s sights.</p> <p>Local business owner Bernard Kamekaza is worried that \u201csurrounding islands\u201d could mean Savo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a74c03fe787735344e974f0c467b9d49cbbcc943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a74c03fe787735344e974f0c467b9d49cbbcc943/0_203_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset on Savo island, which locals fear could be leased to a Chinese company along with neighbouring Tulagi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunset on Savo island, which locals fear could be leased to a Chinese company along with neighbouring Tulagi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Cavanough/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While it made international headlines, the lease agreement was dead on arrival. It failed to consider the existing rights of traditional land owners, and was struck down by Solomon Islands\u2019 attorney general John Muria Junior.</p> <p>But there is a deep anxiety that this is not the end of the matter and in early December Kamekaza made the 90-minute banana boat journey from Savo to Tulagi later this month, and delivered a petition alongside other prominent Central Province landholders to Premier Maniteva, demanding an explanation for his handling the lease attempt.</p> <p>Multiple interview requests by the Guardian to Prime Minister Sogavare\u2019s office were denied.</p> <p>Since the switch, the prime minister has rarely commented on it in public. During a week-long visit to Australia in November, Sogavare did not make himself available to Australian media.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sad state of affairs for a democratic country like the Solomons [for the leader] to not be able to front up to a decision,\u201d says deputy opposition leader Peter Kenilorea Junior. \u201cJust to say nothing at all is a concern.\u201d</p>",

Stalls are coloured by tropical fruits and the floral dresses of Solomon Islands women who have arrived from villages to sell their produce. Some of the best produce found in the market, which is located in the capital of the island of Malaita in the Solomon Islands, comes from Adaliua Taiwanese Farm, situated three kilometres away. There, plump pawpaw and watermelon grow, surrounded by coconut palms. When the Guardian visits, one man uses his machete to slice a pineapple, using banana leaves as a plate to share the fruit. But the future of the farm and the jobs it creates was thrown into doubt overnight in September when Manasseh Sogavare, the prime minister of the Solomon Islands announced Honiara would end its 36-year relationship with Taiwan, and officially recognise Beijing. A few weeks later Sogavare received a warm welcome in Beijing, returning to the Solomons having signed five memoranda of understanding, including an agreement for China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and having secured a promise from China to build a multi-million dollar stadium in the country. Chinese companies were also granted the right to build infrastructure, roads, bridges and power in order to revive Gold Ridge, once Solomon Islands\u2019 most lucrative goldmine; and a Chinese company attempted to lease the entire Solomons\u2019 island of Tulagi. The decision to switch allegiances to China sent ripples around the world. It incensed US senators, outraged the Taiwanese, influenced Kiribati to also abandon Taiwan less than two weeks later, and caused headaches for Australia at a time when Beijing\u2019s influence in the Pacific appears to be expanding. Now, just 15 countries recognise Taiwan. Professor Matthew Clarke of Deakin University says the Solomon Islands\u2019 recognition of Beijing is an important step for China in completing its Belt &amp; Road Initiative (BRI), a multi-trillion dollar initiative that aims to direct global trade through mainland China. \u201cThe Pacific is an important region in terms of maritime movements \u2026 being able to utilise ports for both commercial and presumedly military purposes is important to China,\u201d he says. But the decision has not unfolded smoothly. In the weeks following, four cabinet members who didn\u2019t back the move were sacked and one more resigned. A Christian nation of 600,000 people that lies 1,800km east of northern Australia, many Solomon Islanders fear China\u2019s oppression of religious minorities is incongruous with their way of life.

Others lament the exit of Taiwan, a friend which stuck with Solomon Islands, even during its civil war. For many, the impact of the change is direct and personal. John Oka sells botera, a local yellow-skinned fruit, from a modest stall in Auki. \u201cThe new generation \u2026 they don\u2019t want China, they want Taiwan,\u201d he says. Misak, the shirtless manager of Adaliua, has not heard from the Solomon Islands\u2019 government about the future of his farm. \u201cWe will not agree with our government with the shift to China.

Young, eloquent and the son of Solomon Islands\u2019 first prime minister, Kenilorea \u2013 or Junior as he is affectionately known \u2013 is the deputy leader of the opposition and calls the government\u2019s move a \u201cslap in the face of the parliamentary process\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s an open secret that there\u2019s always money involved in these things.

In a statement, China\u2019s foreign ministry said the establishment of diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands had been an \u201copen and above board\u201d process. \u201cNo rumour or slander will affect the development of friendly relations between China and the Solomon Islands,\u201d it said. A 2017 report by Transparency International found Solomon Islands to be \u201cvery corrupt\u201d, having \u201cweak accountability and integrity institutions\u201d. Titus Fika, a government MP who led the taskforce that ended up recommending Honiara make the switch, said any claims of corruption from the Beijing camp were not true. He said the group \u2013 made up of three government MPs, three opposition MPs and one independent MP \u2013 based their decision on the facts and by looking around at other Pacific nations that have relationships with China, which are more economically advanced than the Solomon Islands. But Fika alleges he was approached by Taiwan with a bribe. \u201cTaiwan wanted to bribe [me]. They wanted to give us $1m to sign for Taiwan then after we sign for Taiwan we will receive another [$1m] into our account,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t work, because we don\u2019t sign for it, because we want to do the right thing, not to for our own interest but for the country\u2019s interest and our constituency interests.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, Taiwan rejected Fika\u2019s accusation. \u201cUnder no circumstances will Taiwan resort to an ugly dollar diplomacy bidding war with China, much less line the pockets of corrupt politicians,\u201d said Joanne Ou, a spokesperson for Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \u2018I didn\u2019t sleep since the switch\u2019 The impact of the decision by the government was immediate and angry. Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen issued a statement saying \u201cWe sincerely regret and strongly condemn their government\u2019s decision to establish diplomatic relations with China. \u201cIt is indeed regrettable that their unfinished cooperative projects must come to an end, and it is a loss for Solomon Islands people. However, this is the choice that Solomon Islands\u2019 government has made, leaving us with no other option but to respond in this way,\u201d she said. For Georgia Luilamo, the result was devastating. The 23-year-old is one of more than 100 Solomon Islander students who had been given prestigious scholarships to study at Taiwanese universities. After the break with Taiwan, all the scholarships were terminated, something they found out about by reading the newspaper. The students, enrolled in everything from medicine to politics to business to biotech were given until January to leave Taiwan. \u201cI didn\u2019t even sleep \u2026 since the switch,\u201d says Patricia Luilamo, Georgia\u2019s mother in Honiara. Patricia says her daughter and other Solomons\u2019 students have been offered spots at mainland Chinese universities, with the government saying their scholarships would continue to be paid. But Patricia says she has seen no details about this move: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing from China; there\u2019s nothing from Solomon Islands.\u201d Most students are fearful about moving to universities located in cities they\u2019d never heard of and few have complied. Patricia now faces using her small savings, money her husband left her when he died last year, to pay for her daughter\u2019s tuition. \u2018You cannot yoke a cat with an elephant\u2019 The people of the island of Malaita, an independently-minded and pro-Taiwan part of the country, are angry not only at the Sogavare Government\u2019s decision, but the way it was made. In the wake of the news, Sogavare dispatched Malaitan MPs within his government back to their constituencies to explain the government\u2019s position. Video circulating on social media shows the degree of public anger faced by the MPs, who were met with vocal condemnation as they travelled the province. \u201cI think Prime Minister Sogavare should go and tell people in [the] community and after he declared that he [can] make change,\u201d says David, 32, who sells betel nut at a wooden stand in central Auki. Weeks earlier, David was one of an estimated 500 Malaitans who protested against the switch. Next to his betel nuts, he still proudly displays his hand-made sign he carried to the rally: \u201cNo Need China.\u201d As in Honiara, a majority of small businesses in Auki are owned and operated by ethnic-Chinese, many first and second generation immigrants to Solomon Islands. But their presence has long caused tension and in 2006, Chinese businesses in Honiara were infamously ransacked following accusations of Beijing\u2019s influence in that year\u2019s election. There is concern that the anti-China sentiment is not just driven by pro-democracy sentiment but also by anti-China racism. One of the rioters that day was Richard Olita, the bearded, burly 35-year-old secretary of Malaita for Democracy, an anti-Beijing Malaitan independence movement. \u201cYou cannot yoke a cat with an elephant. China is too big for us\u201d, says Olita. \u201cGiven the weak economy, and the weak country, even the institutions of this country, it\u2019s not strong, so we cannot work with China. They will just overpower us.\u201d Malaita for Democracy doesn\u2019t just want to stop Malaita forming a relationship with Beijing, they want existing Chinese businesses in Auki expelled from the province and are using their influence to try and get the provincial government to do this. Already, Sudaini\u2019s provincial government has pledged to prohibit businesses \u201cdirectly or indirectly linked to the Chinese Communist Party\u201d from obtaining Malaitan business licenses and closed at least one Chinese-owned store. Despite Honiara severing ties with Taiwan, some hope Auki can still cobble together some form of relationship with Taipei. Taiwan has not ruled out such an arrangement. \u201cAs long as relations are built on a foundation of equality and mutual assistance for mutual benefit, we do not rule out any possibilities,\u201d says Ou. \u201cHowever, we do not have any plans for future cooperation at this time.\u201d Fears Savo could be leased to China A small volcanic clump 35km off the coast of the Honiara, Savo has a population of just 4,000 people, who maintain their own language, Savo Savo, and culture entirely distinct from neighbouring islands. Islanders travel by foot from village to village. There are no motorised vehicles or television on the island. Children spend their afternoons paddling dugout canoes and fishing in turquoise waters, while adults still re-construct thatched-roofed, bamboo framed huts that were decimated by Tropical Cyclone Mona in January. But over the last few months the islanders have been worried that their way of life is under threat from China. Shortly after the diplomatic switch, the premier of Central Province Stanley Maniteva signed an agreement with a Chinese company called SAM Group, to lease the provincial capital of Tulagi and \u201csurrounding islands\u201d, without specifying which ones were in China\u2019s sights. Local business owner Bernard Kamekaza is worried that \u201csurrounding islands\u201d could mean Savo. While it made international headlines, the lease agreement was dead on arrival. It failed to consider the existing rights of traditional land owners, and was struck down by Solomon Islands\u2019 attorney general John Muria Junior. But there is a deep anxiety that this is not the end of the matter and in early December Kamekaza made the 90-minute banana boat journey from Savo to Tulagi later this month, and delivered a petition alongside other prominent Central Province landholders to Premier Maniteva, demanding an explanation for his handling the lease attempt. Multiple interview requests by the Guardian to Prime Minister Sogavare\u2019s office were denied. Since the switch, the prime minister has rarely commented on it in public. During a week-long visit to Australia in November, Sogavare did not make himself available to Australian media. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad state of affairs for a democratic country like the Solomons [for the leader] to not be able to front up to a decision,\u201d says deputy opposition leader Peter Kenilorea Junior. \u201cJust to say nothing at all is a concern.\u201d",

That said, Joshua looks the more sprightly of the two.

(And that\u2019s putting aside the <em>four</em> fighters on the card with a history of testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.)</p> \n  <p>Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of campaigns, made his organisation\u2019s feelings on the fight - and its venue \u2013 clear. \u201cThe fight is pure sportswashing and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to challenge the Saudi propaganda machine and its increased use of sport to gloss over its abysmal human rights record,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Joshua, who\u2019s absorbed a fair share of criticism for saying Saudi Arabia is \u201ctrying to do a good job politically\u201d and that everyone in the country seems to be having a good time, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/05/anthony-joshua-sauda-arabia-amnesty-international-andy-ruiz-jr\">dismissed suggestions</a> that his legacy as a role model will be tarnished for his role in the affair.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I\u2019ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Joshua also appeared to not know what Amnesty International was when told the human rights organisation wanted him to research and speak out about problems in the country.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Joshua replied in an interview with the BBC. \u201cI haven\u2019t known much about Amnesty because I\u2019ve spent most of my time in Finchley just training. But as an individual I try to bring positivity and light everywhere I go. I\u2019m just seeing it from my eyes alone but for sure the country in itself is trying to do a good job politically.</p> \n   <p>\u201cFor the sporting side of things, I just feel I\u2019ve got a fight to focus on. For the future maybe I can bear a different kind of flag but at the minute it\u2019s just the world championship flag I\u2019m trying to bear.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Joshua is expected to earn upward $50m for Saturday\u2019s rematch in Saudi Arabia, compared to around $9m for his opponent. However Joshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn has insisted money is secondary to reclaiming his belts.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he has wanted it so bad before,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cWhen he lost he wasn\u2019t in a great place for weeks after.

Joshua or Ruiz?</strong> Here\u2019s a look at how 14 fighters see tonight\u2019s main event. Send along your predictions to our Tom Lutz, who will be taking over from here, via <a href=\"mailto:tom.lutz@theguardian.com\">email</a> or Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_lutz?lang=en\">@tom_lutz</a>. </p> \n  <p><strong>Deontay Wilder (WBC heavyweight champion):<em> Ruiz</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI see Ruiz coming back in, doing the exact same thing he did the first time. In rematches, when you get two guys in there sharing each other\u2019s energy, you sort of know what they\u2019re going to do. Although you can go back into the gym, strategize and get new ideas, like Mike Tyson said: \u2018Everyone has a plan until they get hit.\u2019 And sometimes when you get hit, you go back to what you know. Ruiz still has nothing to lose. The pressure is still on Joshua to show it\u2019s a fluke, to show it was a bad night in the office. I\u2019m not saying Joshua can\u2019t win. He can put it together and get the victory, but my pick is Ruiz.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Dominic Breazeale (world heavyweight title challenger):</strong><strong><em> Joshua by TKO 10</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cAnthony Joshua wins. I believe that Joshua learns from his mistakes and boxes the first three rounds until he sees an opening. In the fourth round Joshua will take advantage of it. The seventh round is the most exciting round of the fight with both fighters being knocked down. In the end, however, I see Joshua coming out on top via 10th-round TKO, referee\u2019s stoppage.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Adam Kownacki (undefeated heavyweight contender):<em> Ruiz by KO 9</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the Andy Ruiz-Anthony Joshua fight is too close to call. Both fighters are very well prepared and it\u2019s the heavyweight division where one punch could end everything. I feel that the winner will be who wants it more. Does Andy want to be know as a heavyweight champ and to prove that the first fight was not just won by luck? Or will Anthony do everything to get his title back? I\u2019m not convinced Anthony wants the title back. I have Andy winning again.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Luis Ortiz (two-time world heavyweight title challenger):<em> Joshua on points</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cIn my heart, I truly want for Andy Ruiz to pull off another victory over Anthony Joshua once again. But I believe that Joshua has learned a valuable lesson from losing the first fight. So I believe that Joshua will stay at a distance and that he will outbox Ruiz on the way to winning a decision.\u201d </p> \n  <p><strong>Gerald Washington (world heavyweight title challenger):<em> Ruiz</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI am in camp with Andy Ruiz, and I\u2019m witnessing, first-hand, that everything I have heard about his fast hands and his skills is true. Anthony Joshua is a great fighter and he was a tremendous champion, but Andy beat him the first time and I believe that he has the confidence to do it again.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Joseph Parker (former WBO heavyweight champion):<em> Joshua</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cNot too sure but if I had to pick someone I think AJ will win if he uses his reach and height and moves around. Andy is one damn tough guy though and his pressure and counterpunching is spot-on.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Claressa Shields (undisputed middleweight champion):<em> Joshua by late-rounds KO</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI have AJ winning the rematch. Why? Because that loss forced him to change up many things. He is slimmer now, using angles and knows what he is up against. I believe Ruiz will come with the smoke he had in the first fight but people forget that Joshua dropped Ruiz first! So I see a late KO by Anthony Joshua if he sticks a hard fast jab in Ruiz\u2019s face and get the combinations going.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Amanda Serrano (seven-division world champion):<em> Ruiz by mid-to-late rounds TKO</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think that Ruiz will win again. I think mentally he has the edge and Anthony, although a good fighters, doesn\u2019t look real confident. I predict Ruiz stops him in the mid-to-late rounds.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Demetrius Andrade (WBA middleweight champion): <em>Undecided</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cHistory shows that the person who won the first time is going to win the next time. If Ruiz gets inside and uses his faster hands then it\u2019s probably going to go the same way. But Joshua is a great fighter and if he adjusts and uses his reach to keep Ruiz on the outside then Joshua can pull of the win and get his belts back. Either way, I expect a great fight and may the best man win.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Jaime Mungu\u00eda (WBO light middleweight champion): <em>Ruiz</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think that Andy Ruiz will come stronger. He has more confidence in himself. Now the pressure is on Joshua\u2019s side. Sincerely, I feel that Andy Ruiz will walk away with his hand raised.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rom\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez (four-division world champion):<em> Ruiz by KO</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI believe that Ruiz has less pressure to win this time. Not much about his mindset has changed since winning the first fight and entering the rematch, I think that Joshua\u2019s mindset is insecure. There are so many people trying to tell him what he should do in order to beat Ruiz.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Tevin Farmer (IBF super featherweight champion):<em> Joshua by KO</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI honestly think it\u2019s a 50-50 fight but Joshua\u2019s going to knock him out. I don\u2019t know what round but he\u2019s going to knock Ruiz out.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Carl Frampton (former two-division world champion):<em> Joshua on points</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI go with Joshua, but someone is getting knocked out. Mentally, Joshua needs to be strong to regain the titles.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Andy Lee (former WBO middleweight champion): <em>Undecided</em></strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe only thing I am certain of is that I don\u2019t know who is going to win. It\u2019s the hardest fight I can remember in a long time. There\u2019s ways that both men can win obviously. It\u2019s about their mentality now. Has it damaged Joshua? Will Ruiz be as hungry now? He has the money, the fame and the belts now. I can see Joshua boxing disciplined and winning on points, or Ruiz breaking him down again. A lot might depend on the night and who can handle the occasion. But I think the first round is most important. Whoever wins the first round sets the tone.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5deb27768f08bacaf000bc2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-07T18:34:48.101Z\">6.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The big news of the last 24 hours, no pun intended, centers on Andy Ruiz\u2019s weight.</strong> The champion tipped the scales at 283lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in, 15lbs more than June\u2019s first installment, prompting widespread criticism.

Six months after Ruiz turned boxing\u2019s bellwether division on its ear with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/01/anthony-joshua-andy-ruiz-jr-boxing-heavyweight-title-fight\">seismic upset of the then-unbeaten Joshua</a> at Madison Square Garden, they\u2019re running it back in the middle of the desert \u2013 where Joshua will attempt to become only fourth deposed heavyweight champion to win an immediate rematch after Floyd Patterson (against Ingemar Johansson in 1960), Muhammad Ali (against Leon Spinks in 1978) and Lennox Lewis (against Hasim Rahman in 2001).<br></p> \n  <p>The story of the moment is the oppressive rainfall positively lashing down on the 15,000-seat arena in the middle of the Arabian Desert because of course.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for the evening, I\u2019ll sign off now. Thank you for your emails, and here\u2019s Sean Ingle\u2019s fight report: Joshua is asked about arranging a fight with the other big names in the heavyweight boxing: \u201cWhen Wilder and Fury and Ortiz are really, really ready they\u2019ll make the call ... If you want to create history they know where we are.\u201d He seems more keen on a third fight with Ruiz though. Our official report is up and running now: Joshua says this fight was his second favourite in his career. His victory over Klitschko was his No1 due to his respect for his opponent. Joshua makes a point of thanking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and members of the royalty after his victory, which will not go down well with those who see this fight as little more than an exercise in sportswashing. Ruiz grabs the mic and says: \u201cWho wants to see a third fight?\u201d Joshua replies: \u201cIf you\u2019ve heard, you\u2019ll see a third.\u201d I take that as a confirmation they\u2019ll go again. Ruiz admits he was too heavy for the fight. \u201cI was chasing him too much, hesitating too much,\u201d he says. Joshua speaks: First of all, I want to thank God. I want to say, man, the first time was so nice, I had to do it twice. A man like me don\u2019t make no excuses, I\u2019m used to knocking out guys. I said to myself I was going to correct myself. The sweet science of this sport is hitting and not getting caught. I\u2019m hungry and I\u2019m humble. Thank you to Andrew Ruiz and his family. What a disciplined performance from Joshua, who kept his opponent at distance and was barely troubled by Ruiz. He shed 11lbs for the fight, looking for agility and speed over power. And it was that lightness on his feet that won the day. Joshua wins by unanimous decision! The judges had it 118-110, 118-110 and 119-109. The two men hug in the centre of the ring, it\u2019s clear they have tremendous respect for each other as Joshua chats to Ruiz for 30 seconds or so. From my viewpoint, Joshua just needs to survive this round. Ruiz gets in close and lands a few blows to Joshua\u2019s body but Joshua counters seconds later with a big, big right. But he knows he doesn\u2019t need the KO and the Briton dances away. Ruiz smiles to himself as he swings away in the final few seconds but they don\u2019t threaten Joshua. He is an all probability, the champion again. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 118-110 Ruiz) Joshua snaps another jab into Ruiz, if he regains the title that jab will be a huge part of his victory. He\u2019s held off his dangerous, shorter opponent so well all night. Ruiz, who is behind on points, has done very little in these last few rounds to go for a finish. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 108-101 Ruiz) There\u2019s been plenty of talk about Ruiz\u2019s conditioning but he looks far from punched out after 10 grueling rounds. That said, Joshua looks the more sprightly of the two. A pretty cagey round, with neither man opening themselves up - possibly saving their best for the final two. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 98-92 Ruiz) How does Joshua react after being shaken for the first time? Will he retain his discipline? He probably has this fight if he can continue to keep his man at distance. Joshua lands two good blows and dances out again before Ruiz can counter. He\u2019s learned lessons from the first fight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 88-83 Ruiz) A few more rounds of this and Ruiz will need a KO to retain his title. It\u2019s been clever, disciplined boxing from Joshua so far. No mean feat, when you\u2019re thirsting for revenge and there\u2019s the nagging desire to go in and finish the fight quickly. Ruiz looks frustrated and finally does some damage, landing a blow on the top of Joshua\u2019s head. That\u2019s the most damage he\u2019s done to his opponent tonight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 9-10 Ruiz (Joshua 78-74 Ruiz) Compubox says that 93% of the fight has been fought at distance, a clear advantage to the taller Joshua. I can barely remember a clinch so far. Joshua gets in a few hooks and for a moment breaks from the plan and darts in to do damage from close range. But he springs back before Ruiz can do damage. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 69-64 Ruiz) Ruiz predicted that he\u2019d let Joshua dance and jab for the first rounds before going in and causing damage, but the Briton hasn\u2019t let him inside all fight ... so far. Joshua gets in close and delivers a blow to Ruiz\u2019s body. It does damage but Ruiz will have no problem with the challenger getting in where he can do damage to him. Ruiz looks slow, and who knows how that extra 15lbs he\u2019s put on since June will tell as the fight wears on. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 59-55 Ruiz) That cut has reopened above Ruiz\u2019s left eye. Joshua still in control but he\u2019s not going into Ruiz\u2019s body, and is maybe a little one-dimensional. He smiles to himself as he lands a couple of hard jabs to Ruiz\u2019s head. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 49-46 Ruiz) Joshua is in control, but Ruiz \u2013 at 280lbs \u2013 is so dangerous if he gets a big blow in, the challenger can\u2019t afford to let his concentration slip. Joshua has consistently attacked Ruiz at the end of these rounds, and he does so against in the fourth. But Ruiz gets a punch in in the clinch and rocks Joshua for the first time. I\u2019m giving that round to Ruiz, just. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 9-10 Ruiz (Joshua 39-37 Ruiz) Ruiz has said he expects Joshua to go for it in the opening rounds, so I wouldn\u2019t take too much from the Briton edging the first two. \u201cI think he will box around nicely for four or five rounds until I take the pressure to him, start hitting his body and mixing it up,\u201d said Ruiz this week. The stats say, Joshua has landed 18 punches to Ruiz\u2019s nine. Joshua looks almost skinny and he\u2019s able to leap back from Ruiz\u2019s jabs. Joshua gets a hook to Ruiz\u2019s body at the end of the round. Not as emphatic from the Briton, but he edged that round. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 30-27 Ruiz) The vaseline goes on Ruiz\u2019s cut. He doesn\u2019t look too worried, but even though Joshua won that first round, the Briton was a lot more cautious than he was in the first fight when his aggression got him in trouble. Two nice jabs from Ruiz, his best shots of the fight. Joshua focusing on that area with the cut and it\u2019s reopened early in the round. And then a right from Joshua from close range, but Joshua is bleeding now too. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 20-18 Ruiz) Ruiz is in gold trunks and Joshua in white. The crowd has warmed up a little. As predicted Joshua is keeping his opponent at a distance, controlling the centre of the ring. Joshua gets in the first significant blow of the fight - a right to Ruiz\u2019s temple. There\u2019s already blood above Ruiz\u2019s left eye. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Joshua 10-9 Ruiz (Joshua 10-9 Ruiz) Ruiz is giving away four inches in height and eight inches in reach to Joshua (although admittedly he is around 50lbs heavier) but that doesn\u2019t bother him. In fact, he\u2019s been fighting taller men his entire career, and is ready to use the height difference against his opponent, getting inside Joshua and causing damage close up. \u201cThat is exactly what we have been training on,\u201d said Ruiz earlier this week. \u201cBeing small, being more slick, applying pressure, throwing combinations and being first to the punch. I know he is going to try to box me around, that is why he lost some weight, he will try to keep me away with the jab. But that\u2019s what we have been practising for.\u201d I have to say the crowd is pretty flat - nowhere near the bear pit atmosphere you get at a usual title fight. Blame the lack of beer. We get three anthems for the price of two! After the British and US ones, we get a special rendition of the Mexican anthem, in tribute to Ruiz\u2019s Mexican roots. Here\u2019s a look at how Ruiz and Joshua match up ahead of tonight\u2019s main event. Ruiz tipped the scales at 283lbs at the weigh-in, 15lbs more than in their first encounter in June. Only Russia\u2019s Nikolai Valuev (who was seven feet tall) has ever weighed more for a world heavyweight title fight. Joshua came in at 237lbs, 10lbs down from six months ago and his lightest weight in more than five years. Ruiz comes in with a golden robe with a nice fur trim. Maybe not ideal wear for the desert, but it\u2019s been raining so maybe he knew something we didn\u2019t. Joshua is first out as the challenger in a white robe. No entourage for the Briton - he strolls in on his own like it\u2019s his day off. Maybe an early sign to the audience that tonight is about the fight, and not the sideshow - a criticism levelled at him after the last fight. The elephant in the room, of course, is the setting of tonight\u2019s event. Tonight\u2019s card is taking place amid mounting criticism from Amnesty International that taking around $80m from a kingdom that has an \u201cabysmal\u201d human rights record, including jailing and executing opponents, is morally bankrupt. (And that\u2019s putting aside the four fighters on the card with a history of testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.) Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of campaigns, made his organisation\u2019s feelings on the fight - and its venue \u2013 clear. \u201cThe fight is pure sportswashing and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to challenge the Saudi propaganda machine and its increased use of sport to gloss over its abysmal human rights record,\u201d he said. Joshua, who\u2019s absorbed a fair share of criticism for saying Saudi Arabia is \u201ctrying to do a good job politically\u201d and that everyone in the country seems to be having a good time, has dismissed suggestions that his legacy as a role model will be tarnished for his role in the affair. \u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I\u2019ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.\u201d Joshua also appeared to not know what Amnesty International was when told the human rights organisation wanted him to research and speak out about problems in the country. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Joshua replied in an interview with the BBC. \u201cI haven\u2019t known much about Amnesty because I\u2019ve spent most of my time in Finchley just training. But as an individual I try to bring positivity and light everywhere I go. I\u2019m just seeing it from my eyes alone but for sure the country in itself is trying to do a good job politically. \u201cFor the sporting side of things, I just feel I\u2019ve got a fight to focus on. For the future maybe I can bear a different kind of flag but at the minute it\u2019s just the world championship flag I\u2019m trying to bear.\u201d Joshua is expected to earn upward $50m for Saturday\u2019s rematch in Saudi Arabia, compared to around $9m for his opponent. However Joshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn has insisted money is secondary to reclaiming his belts. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he has wanted it so bad before,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cWhen he lost he wasn\u2019t in a great place for weeks after. But he\u2019s really got his head screwed on. It\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ve got to win this fight\u2019 not just \u2018It\u2019s a lot of money and I\u2019ve got to take it\u2019.\u201d. Andy Ruiz is interviewed in the dressing room. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good, feeling ready, we\u2019re going to do the same thing as we did in June. The rain has started again but Ruiz is not worried. \u201cI\u2019m alright as long as we stick to the gameplan, the rain the weather doesn\u2019t really matter He\u2019s asked about Joshua\u2019s tactics: \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to box me around, if he tries to headhunt that will go in my favour.\u201d Our first prediction of the evening, from Kevin Kukhta. \u201cBeing ten pounds lighter than previously shows his strategy, as its likely he\u2019s not going to stand and trade with Ruiz, instead circling and jabbing his head off with that reach until Ruiz is gassed, then going in for the kill. AJ lost because he was overconfident, but with this humility and strategy, he\u2019ll probably win. Ruiz is still incredibly dangerous.\u201d Pacheco has knocked out Saidi in the first round of their fight, and the Tanzanian is still receiving medical attention but should be OK. He went down hard though. The 18-year-old Diego Pacheco, who has won all seven of his pro fights, is the one to watch in our penultimate fight of the evening. He\u2019s very tall for a super middleweight \u2013 6ft 4in \u2013 and will surely move up the weight classes as he ages and bulks up. Selemani Saidi of Tanzania is his opponent. Michael Hunter landed bigger blows \u2013 particularly in the later rounds \u2013 in this fight but Povetkin may have won more rounds. Let\u2019s see how the judges scores it. And it\u2019s ... a split draw. Hunter landed more shots, but Povetkin edged the power punches. So, we have one more fight on the undercard before the main events. They had initially said Ruiz and Joshua would be making their ringwalks in the next 10 minutes, but that will obviously be delayed for another 45 minutes or so. They think that around 4,000 British fans have travelled to Saudi Arabia to support Joshua, and the DAZN commentators make a reasonable point: will the absence of alcohol in the arena make a difference to the atmosphere. There\u2019s a decent noise at the moment as Hunter rocks Povetkin in the 11th \u2013 his best round of the fight so far. A little update on the evening\u2019s schedule. Diego Pacheco (USA) v Selemani Saidi (Tanzania) has been added to the card. It\u2019s over six rounds, but means Joshua and Ruiz won\u2019t be making their ringwalks for another 90 minutes or so. Weather update: the rain has stopped completely now, so any fears the fight would be postponed are pretty much over. Having said that, a mysterious smoke floats across the ring - maybe some escaped dry ice? - as Hunter and Povetkin trade big blows at the end of the seventh. Povetkin has come back into this fight and crashes Hunter into the ropes with two big lefts. We\u2019re about to enter the sixth, and the Russian is edging it. According to my emails so far - admittedly seven people may not be a statistically significant sample \u2013 the public think Joshua has got tonight\u2019s fight wrapped up. DAZN gives us a shot of Andy Ruiz\u2019s cousin\u2019s house, where the family have gathered to watch the fight. For a little look at Ruiz\u2019s background and rise to the heavyweight championship, feel free to read Bryan Graham\u2019s missive from Imperial, California, his hometown. The camera cuts to Joshua being taped up in the dressing room, looking calm and serious. We then get a shot of Ruiz, already taped up, who looks pretty relaxed, loosening up with a few swings of those huge arms. Canelo Alvarez has arrived, and gets to enjoy a night out at the fights with the added bonus of not getting punched in the face. Meanwhile, Hunter has started off strong against Povetkin, landing a flurry of blows on his opponent, who looks shaken. A quick betting update [LEGAL NOTE: The Guardian does not encourage gambling]. The bookies have Joshua as the favourite at 4-9, with the champion Ruiz at 2-1 and the draw at 28-1. Ruiz\u2019s dad, Andy Sr, may like those odds - he won $50,000 betting on his son in the first fight, although the odds were a little longer for that one. Michael Hunter enters the ring for the final undercard dressed as The Predator. His nickname isn\u2019t even The Predator - it\u2019s The Bounty. Although coming in as a coconut-themed chocolate bar may not be that intimidating. Dillian Whyte\u2019s fight against Mariusz Wach is over. The Englishman was pushed all the way by his 6ft 8in Polish opponent, who took him to 10 rounds. Whyte takes it by unanimous decision, and we have one more fight \u2013 the WBA heavyweight eliminator between Alexander Povetkin (Russia) and Michael Hunter (USA) before \u2013 before the main event. It\u2019s been a good week for the Whyte family after Dillian\u2019s brother, Dean, tackled a troublesome passenger on the flight over. Ruiz or Joshua? Joshua or Ruiz? Here\u2019s a look at how 14 fighters see tonight\u2019s main event. Send along your predictions to our Tom Lutz, who will be taking over from here, via email or Twitter at @tom_lutz. Deontay Wilder (WBC heavyweight champion): Ruiz \u201cI see Ruiz coming back in, doing the exact same thing he did the first time. In rematches, when you get two guys in there sharing each other\u2019s energy, you sort of know what they\u2019re going to do. Although you can go back into the gym, strategize and get new ideas, like Mike Tyson said: \u2018Everyone has a plan until they get hit.\u2019 And sometimes when you get hit, you go back to what you know. Ruiz still has nothing to lose. The pressure is still on Joshua to show it\u2019s a fluke, to show it was a bad night in the office. I\u2019m not saying Joshua can\u2019t win. He can put it together and get the victory, but my pick is Ruiz.\u201d Dominic Breazeale (world heavyweight title challenger): Joshua by TKO 10 \u201cAnthony Joshua wins. I believe that Joshua learns from his mistakes and boxes the first three rounds until he sees an opening. In the fourth round Joshua will take advantage of it. The seventh round is the most exciting round of the fight with both fighters being knocked down. In the end, however, I see Joshua coming out on top via 10th-round TKO, referee\u2019s stoppage.\u201d Adam Kownacki (undefeated heavyweight contender): Ruiz by KO 9 \u201cI think the Andy Ruiz-Anthony Joshua fight is too close to call. Both fighters are very well prepared and it\u2019s the heavyweight division where one punch could end everything. I feel that the winner will be who wants it more. Does Andy want to be know as a heavyweight champ and to prove that the first fight was not just won by luck? Or will Anthony do everything to get his title back? I\u2019m not convinced Anthony wants the title back. I have Andy winning again.\u201d Luis Ortiz (two-time world heavyweight title challenger): Joshua on points \u201cIn my heart, I truly want for Andy Ruiz to pull off another victory over Anthony Joshua once again. But I believe that Joshua has learned a valuable lesson from losing the first fight. So I believe that Joshua will stay at a distance and that he will outbox Ruiz on the way to winning a decision.\u201d Gerald Washington (world heavyweight title challenger): Ruiz \u201cI am in camp with Andy Ruiz, and I\u2019m witnessing, first-hand, that everything I have heard about his fast hands and his skills is true. Anthony Joshua is a great fighter and he was a tremendous champion, but Andy beat him the first time and I believe that he has the confidence to do it again.\u201d Joseph Parker (former WBO heavyweight champion): Joshua \u201cNot too sure but if I had to pick someone I think AJ will win if he uses his reach and height and moves around. Andy is one damn tough guy though and his pressure and counterpunching is spot-on.\u201d Claressa Shields (undisputed middleweight champion): Joshua by late-rounds KO \u201cI have AJ winning the rematch. Why? Because that loss forced him to change up many things. He is slimmer now, using angles and knows what he is up against. I believe Ruiz will come with the smoke he had in the first fight but people forget that Joshua dropped Ruiz first! So I see a late KO by Anthony Joshua if he sticks a hard fast jab in Ruiz\u2019s face and get the combinations going.\u201d Amanda Serrano (seven-division world champion): Ruiz by mid-to-late rounds TKO \u201cI think that Ruiz will win again. I think mentally he has the edge and Anthony, although a good fighters, doesn\u2019t look real confident. I predict Ruiz stops him in the mid-to-late rounds.\u201d Demetrius Andrade (WBA middleweight champion): Undecided \u201cHistory shows that the person who won the first time is going to win the next time. If Ruiz gets inside and uses his faster hands then it\u2019s probably going to go the same way. But Joshua is a great fighter and if he adjusts and uses his reach to keep Ruiz on the outside then Joshua can pull of the win and get his belts back. Either way, I expect a great fight and may the best man win.\u201d Jaime Mungu\u00eda (WBO light middleweight champion): Ruiz \u201cI think that Andy Ruiz will come stronger. He has more confidence in himself. Now the pressure is on Joshua\u2019s side. Sincerely, I feel that Andy Ruiz will walk away with his hand raised.\u201d Rom\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez (four-division world champion): Ruiz by KO \u201cI believe that Ruiz has less pressure to win this time. Not much about his mindset has changed since winning the first fight and entering the rematch, I think that Joshua\u2019s mindset is insecure. There are so many people trying to tell him what he should do in order to beat Ruiz.\u201d Tevin Farmer (IBF super featherweight champion): Joshua by KO \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s a 50-50 fight but Joshua\u2019s going to knock him out. I don\u2019t know what round but he\u2019s going to knock Ruiz out.\u201d Carl Frampton (former two-division world champion): Joshua on points \u201cI go with Joshua, but someone is getting knocked out. Mentally, Joshua needs to be strong to regain the titles.\u201d Andy Lee (former WBO middleweight champion): Undecided \u201cThe only thing I am certain of is that I don\u2019t know who is going to win. It\u2019s the hardest fight I can remember in a long time. There\u2019s ways that both men can win obviously. It\u2019s about their mentality now. Has it damaged Joshua? Will Ruiz be as hungry now? He has the money, the fame and the belts now. I can see Joshua boxing disciplined and winning on points, or Ruiz breaking him down again. A lot might depend on the night and who can handle the occasion. But I think the first round is most important. Whoever wins the first round sets the tone.\u201d The big news of the last 24 hours, no pun intended, centers on Andy Ruiz\u2019s weight. The champion tipped the scales at 283lbs at yesterday\u2019s weigh-in, 15lbs more than June\u2019s first installment, prompting widespread criticism. In perhaps an ominous historical parallel, that\u2019s the same weight gain Buster Douglas made between his famous upset of Mike Tyson (231lbs) and his doomed first title defense against Evander Holyfield (246lbs). But Ruiz insisted his true weight is far lower, telling the Athletic he would have come in closer to 270lbs if the weigh-in had been held earlier in the day. \u201cThey made us wait until 4:30, almost 5pm here,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cI already had ate breakfast, lunch and dinner, I had on a sombrero and all my clothes. A lot of people are saying that I came overweight or this and that but we had to wait so long. I probably put on 10 pounds just eating and drinking normally today. I would\u2019ve been at like 268 without all that stuff and haven\u2019t had eaten. If we weighed in at 11am, I definitely would have been less.\u201d Ruiz\u2019s trainer, Manny Robles, chalked up the eye-popping figure to the conversion rate (?) and his fighter\u2019s decision to take the scale fully clothes. \u201cHe is well prepared, like always,\u201d Robles told ESPN Deportes. \u201cIt was because of the conversion from kilos to pounds, you also have to bear in mind the increase with his clothes.\u201d The rain is coming down in sheets outside (and inside) the open-air arena built for tonight\u2019s event. Meanwhile, Croatian prospect Filip Hrgovic has stopped Eric Molina in the third round of their scheduled 12-round scrap, spared from the deluge by the small canopy hanging over the ring. The BBC\u2019s Dan Roan reports that organizers have said there\u2019s no prospect of delay or cancellation despite the watery conditions, but the problems are mounting as the card moves forward. A few of the TV broadcasters on press row have enlisted assistants to shield them from the rain by holding umbrellas over their set-ups, but the umbrellas are obstructing the sightlines of several spectators in the high-rent district, who are understandably kicking off over it. Here\u2019s a look at tonight\u2019s bout sheet. Also, a reminder that Saudi Arabia has world\u2019s third lowest rainfall with 59mm annually, according to the Press Association\u2019s Mark Staniforth. Ruiz and Joshua are expected to make their entrances at a quarter to midnight local time or a little over three hours from now. First bell (3.30pm \u2013 all times GMT) Majid Al Naqbi (UAE) v Ilia Beruashvili (Georgia), four rounds, lightweights World feed on air (4pm) Zuhayr Al Qahtani (Saudi Arabia) v Omar Dusary (Kuwait), eight rounds, lightweights Live on Sky Sports Box Office and DAZN (5pm) Mahammadrasul Majidov (Azerbaijan) v Tom Little (England), eight rounds, heavyweights Filip Hrgovic (Croatia) v Eric Molina (USA), 12 rounds, heavyweights Dillian Whyte (England) v Mariusz Wach (Poland), 10 rounds, heavyweights Alexander Povetkin (Russia) v Michael Hunter (USA), 12 rounds, WBA heavyweight eliminator Main event (8.45pm) Andy Ruiz Jr (Mexico) v Anthony Joshua (England), rematch, 12 rounds, for Ruiz\u2019s IBF/WBO/WBA heavyweight title Swing bouts Hopey Price (England) v Swedi Mohamed (Tanzania), four rounds, junior featherweights Diego Pacheco (USA) v Selemani Saidi (Tanzania), six rounds, super middleweights Hello and welcome to Riyadh for tonight\u2019s hotly anticipated rematch between Andy Ruiz Jr and Anthony Joshua. We\u2019re ringside at the purpose-built Diriyah Arena on the north-west outskirts of the Saudi capital for what\u2019s surely the most controversial world heavyweight title fight in more than 40 years. Six months after Ruiz turned boxing\u2019s bellwether division on its ear with a seismic upset of the then-unbeaten Joshua at Madison Square Garden, they\u2019re running it back in the middle of the desert \u2013 where Joshua will attempt to become only fourth deposed heavyweight champion to win an immediate rematch after Floyd Patterson (against Ingemar Johansson in 1960), Muhammad Ali (against Leon Spinks in 1978) and Lennox Lewis (against Hasim Rahman in 2001). The story of the moment is the oppressive rainfall positively lashing down on the 15,000-seat arena in the middle of the Arabian Desert because of course. Pockets of spectators wearing plastic ponchos are scattered through the mostly empty stands as with many more taking shelter in the tight concourses as England\u2019s Tom Little is blasted out in two at the hands of Azerbaijan\u2019s Mahammadrasul Majidov in the night\u2019s first pay-per-view fight. Peak Britain, really. We\u2019ll be back with tonight\u2019s schedule, and perhaps a wee look at the forecast, after seeking cover ourselves. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Sean Ingle\u2019s lookahead to tonight\u2019s main event.",

In 2017, during pre-season in Austria, the manager, Emma Hayes, told her she would be going out on loan. She \u201cburst out crying\u201d, the self-doubt setting in. \u201cI doubted I would come back,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, yeah, I did. Every other player that\u2019s gone on loan from Chelsea hasn\u2019t come back. I\u2019m the only player that\u2019s managed to go away and get a recall.\u201d</p> <p>Two seasons at Liverpool followed and although it took some time to find her rhythm, it helped her find her natural position. \u201cWhen I was here before I played a bit of wing, a bit of forward, then a wing\u2011back, and I couldn\u2019t really find my feet,\u201d she says. \u201cGoing to Liverpool gave me the opportunity to just work on a set position, get minutes in the bank and prove what I can do. So, as much as I hated it at the time, it was the best decision, I think, for me and my career. It was more of a test of whether I would sink or swim up there and thankfully I chose to swim.\u201d</p> <p>Did it strengthen her relationship with Hayes, given the loan move paid off? \u201cI guess you could say that,\u201d England says with a laugh. \u201cBut in the same breath I\u2019m the one that had to go and prove it. I\u2019m not going to sit here and slate her because it happened and it has worked out for the best, but it was a bad time for me and it took me quite a while to get out of that mindset of thinking I was not good enough.\u201d</p> <p>That mindset is still there, in the background, but she has \u201cmanaged to loosen the reins a little on making mistakes and getting on with it and not letting things eat me up inside\u201d, she reflects. \u201cI was always a player that was really too much of a perfectionist and very self-critical.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/06/sam-kerr-sees-off-competition-to-be-voted-best-female-footballer-in-the-world\">Sam Kerr sees off competition to be voted best female footballer in the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her delight at being named among the<em> Guardian</em>\u2019s top 100 female footballers for 2019, in at 89, reflects a player that always worked hard but never dared to dream big. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think that a lass from Barnsley is now deemed one of the best in the world for football. It\u2019s a bit surreal really,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Three years ago, England was working night shifts in a fish and chip shop and Christmas temping in M&amp;S. \u201cI was part-time at Donny [Doncaster Belles] and at college you\u2019ve got to pay your way,\u201d she says. \u201cI did night shifts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 10pm to 6am, at the chippy. So there would be times when I would have two or three hours\u2019 sleep before I\u2019m getting on the coach for an away game.</p> <p>\u201cOr, say, if we went to play a team like Yeovil, we\u2019d get back at like 9pm, quick shower, get my tea and then straight back out to work and do a night shift. I actually used to do the Christmas orders at M&amp;S so I would spend three night shifts in the freezer. On top of that, juggling A-levels was quite difficult.\u201d</p> <p>A powerful, strong forward with great technical ability, England shows a fight and drive that is clearly a product of that work ethic. \u201cI\u2019ve got an assignment to write. Just 3,000 words on parliamentary sovereignty\u201d for the law degree she is halfway through, part-time with the Open University and with the support of the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association.</p> <p>Once the essay is out of the way, there is the not insignificant matter of a crucial match in the title race when Chelsea welcome Manchester City to Kingsmeadow on Sunday. \u201cThe league has got tougher and it is still getting harder and harder each year to play against even the top teams, there is no whitewashing that.\u201d</p> <p>A goal would be nice too, though? \u201cTo score against the bigger clubs always tends to mean a bit more. I\u2019ve had a few against Arsenal and they mean a lot to me. The last time I scored against City was at Liverpool, a header, so it would be pretty sweet to put one away just before Christmas and help the team. But I just want three points.\u201d</p>",

I\u2019m not going to sit here and slate her because it happened and it has worked out for the best, but it was a bad time for me and it took me quite a while to get out of that mindset of thinking I was not good enough.\u201d That mindset is still there, in the background, but she has \u201cmanaged to loosen the reins a little on making mistakes and getting on with it and not letting things eat me up inside\u201d, she reflects. \u201cI was always a player that was really too much of a perfectionist and very self-critical.\u201d Her delight at being named among the Guardian\u2019s top 100 female footballers for 2019, in at 89, reflects a player that always worked hard but never dared to dream big. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think that a lass from Barnsley is now deemed one of the best in the world for football. It\u2019s a bit surreal really,\u201d she says. Three years ago, England was working night shifts in a fish and chip shop and Christmas temping in M&amp;S. \u201cI was part-time at Donny [Doncaster Belles] and at college you\u2019ve got to pay your way,\u201d she says. \u201cI did night shifts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, 10pm to 6am, at the chippy. So there would be times when I would have two or three hours\u2019 sleep before I\u2019m getting on the coach for an away game. \u201cOr, say, if we went to play a team like Yeovil, we\u2019d get back at like 9pm, quick shower, get my tea and then straight back out to work and do a night shift. I actually used to do the Christmas orders at M&amp;S so I would spend three night shifts in the freezer. On top of that, juggling A-levels was quite difficult.\u201d A powerful, strong forward with great technical ability, England shows a fight and drive that is clearly a product of that work ethic. \u201cI\u2019ve got an assignment to write. Just 3,000 words on parliamentary sovereignty\u201d for the law degree she is halfway through, part-time with the Open University and with the support of the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association. Once the essay is out of the way, there is the not insignificant matter of a crucial match in the title race when Chelsea welcome Manchester City to Kingsmeadow on Sunday. \u201cThe league has got tougher and it is still getting harder and harder each year to play against even the top teams, there is no whitewashing that.\u201d A goal would be nice too, though? \u201cTo score against the bigger clubs always tends to mean a bit more. I\u2019ve had a few against Arsenal and they mean a lot to me. The last time I scored against City was at Liverpool, a header, so it would be pretty sweet to put one away just before Christmas and help the team. But I just want three points.\u201d",

But Joshua\u2019s cute transformation from gunslinger to boxer was effective enough to befuddle and neutralise Ruiz. Two judges had it 118-110, which felt about right, with a third scoring it 119-109.</p> \n<p>It means that Joshua becomes only the fourth man in the 127-year history of the world heavyweight title to successfully regain their title in a direct rematch, from the 10 fighters who attempted it: Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali and Lennox Lewis are the others. That is the company the Briton now keeps \u2013 although he will have to kick on smartly to get anywhere near Ali and Lewis in the pantheon.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can box, I can really box but I like to fight,\u201d Joshua said afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m a warrior at heart. When you are used to knocking a man out, sometimes it may happen to you. I knew I would correct my wrongs. I\u2019m a man who learns from his mistakes.\u201d</p> \n<p>He certainly did. When Ruiz ripped the belts from Joshua\u2019s grasp in New York in June he disrupted one of boxing\u2019s most indomitable laws \u2013that a good big fighter usually beats a good smaller one \u2013 by stopping Joshua in seven. This time around the natural order reasserted itself as the Briton used an eight-inch reach advantage and better side-to-side movement to keep his opponent off balance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMan, the first time was so nice, I had to do it twice!\u201d added Joshua. \u201cA man like me makes no excuses. This is about boxing. I\u2019m used to knocking guys out. I got caught last time, no excuses, I gave him the credit. I respect Andy and his trainer so much. I wanted to show the sweet science of this lovely sport.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was hard to dispute any of that. But he was certainly helped by Ruiz, his belly sagging over his shorts, being every bit as ponderous as his 20st weight had advertised. As the final bell rang he beat his chest angrily and said \u201cfight me\u201d. But deep down he knew he had been outfoxed \u2013 and out-prepared.</p> \n<p>As the Mexican-American admitted afterwards: \u201cI don\u2019t think I prepared as good as I should have. The three months of partying affected me. I should have trained harder. I gained too much weight and I wasn\u2019t able to throw my combinations.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to give no excuses. I believe I hurt him a few times but he was boxing his life out. He won, he boxed me around but, if we do the third, [you] best believe I will come in the best fucking shape of my life.\u201d</p> \n<p>When asked why he didn\u2019t train harder, Ruiz admitted: \u201cThere was a lot on my plate.\u201d Food, no doubt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6548355277cd309dfc7e72bc19f5985d26dd531\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6548355277cd309dfc7e72bc19f5985d26dd531/250_154_2793_1675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Joshua was disciplined throughout and restricted Andy Ruiz Jr\u2019s opportunities to break through his defence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Joshua was disciplined throughout and restricted Andy Ruiz Jr\u2019s opportunities to break through his defence.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For much of the night the skies above Diriyah, on the outskirts of the Saudi capital Riyadh, were soot black as rain soaked the 15,000 spectators to the bone. The city usually gets less than 10cm of rainfall a year. Much of it seemed to come in one sustained burst.</p> \n<p>At one point, as the wind whipped around the open air arena and wobbled the giant screens above the ring, there were even some concerns that the fight might be in jeopardy. Fortunately the threat of electrical storms had dissipated by the time Joshua and Ruiz faced off, just after midnight here.</p> \n<p>Both men had shown plenty of respect for each other in the protracted buildup and the fight started cautiously, with Ruiz stalking his prey and the Briton on the back foot. But shortly before the end of the opening round a nasty right hand from Joshua suddenly bloodied his opponent above his left eye.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/dec/07/anthony-joshua-v-andy-ruiz-world-heavyweight-boxing-rematch-live\">Anthony Joshua v Andy Ruiz: world heavyweight boxing rematch \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The old Joshua might have scented blood and immediately gone for the kill. This time, however, he had clearly loosened his addiction to chaos. Instead he was content to dance on the outside and allow his jab attempt to dominate \u2013 although he did pick up a small cut himself over his right eye at the end of the second round.</p> \n<p>The pattern had been set. The Briton kept jabbing and moving from side to side. In truth it sometimes looked mechanical, like someone dancing in public for the first time, but with Ruiz so slow it kept working.</p> \n<p>Joshua usually prepares for a fight by spending hours each week pumping iron, developing a body with muscles that could turn heads on Venice beach. This time he came in at under 17st \u2013 his lightest weight for five years \u2013 in a bid to counter Ruiz\u2019s speed.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, though there was a sense that the Briton was allowing Ruiz\u2019s roughhouse tactics to get to him \u2013 and that he wanted to trade too much. In the eighth he paid the price as the Mexican-American landed with a good left hook followed by a right hand. But it was Ruiz, with his granite chin, who was still taking more big punches as the fight went into the championship rounds.</p> \n<p>The crowd, who had paid between \u00a3105 and \u00a310,000 for tickets, certainly enjoyed it. And so, clearly, did Joshua. Earlier in the week he had been warned that he was being duped by a Saudi regime that was \u201csportswashing\u201d its reputation. He will continue to face criticism from human rights groups. But with so much in the bank, and with three world titles back around his waist, he will hardly care.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a night when a storm raged across the Saudi Arabian desert Anthony Joshua becalmed the Mexican tempest in front of him to make history \u2013 and a whole lot of money \u2013 by regaining his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles. But after his wide points victory over Andy Ruiz Jr, Joshua risked more controversy after being criticised by human rights groups last week by using the word \u201cdecapitate\u201d when talking to the US broadcaster DAZN in a post-fight press conference. \u201cI know that my fans like to see me knock people out and I can do that but sometimes with certain fighters you have to box smarter,\u201d said Joshua. \u201cI understand what Andy brought to the table so I had to decapitate him in a different way.\u201d The fight itself was far from a classic. But Joshua\u2019s cute transformation from gunslinger to boxer was effective enough to befuddle and neutralise Ruiz. Two judges had it 118-110, which felt about right, with a third scoring it 119-109. It means that Joshua becomes only the fourth man in the 127-year history of the world heavyweight title to successfully regain their title in a direct rematch, from the 10 fighters who attempted it: Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali and Lennox Lewis are the others. That is the company the Briton now keeps \u2013 although he will have to kick on smartly to get anywhere near Ali and Lewis in the pantheon. \u201cI can box, I can really box but I like to fight,\u201d Joshua said afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m a warrior at heart. When you are used to knocking a man out, sometimes it may happen to you. I knew I would correct my wrongs. I\u2019m a man who learns from his mistakes.\u201d He certainly did. When Ruiz ripped the belts from Joshua\u2019s grasp in New York in June he disrupted one of boxing\u2019s most indomitable laws \u2013that a good big fighter usually beats a good smaller one \u2013 by stopping Joshua in seven. This time around the natural order reasserted itself as the Briton used an eight-inch reach advantage and better side-to-side movement to keep his opponent off balance. \u201cMan, the first time was so nice, I had to do it twice!\u201d added Joshua. \u201cA man like me makes no excuses. This is about boxing. I\u2019m used to knocking guys out. I got caught last time, no excuses, I gave him the credit. I respect Andy and his trainer so much. I wanted to show the sweet science of this lovely sport.\u201d It was hard to dispute any of that. But he was certainly helped by Ruiz, his belly sagging over his shorts, being every bit as ponderous as his 20st weight had advertised. As the final bell rang he beat his chest angrily and said \u201cfight me\u201d. But deep down he knew he had been outfoxed \u2013 and out-prepared. As the Mexican-American admitted afterwards: \u201cI don\u2019t think I prepared as good as I should have. The three months of partying affected me. I should have trained harder. I gained too much weight and I wasn\u2019t able to throw my combinations. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to give no excuses. I believe I hurt him a few times but he was boxing his life out. He won, he boxed me around but, if we do the third, [you] best believe I will come in the best fucking shape of my life.\u201d When asked why he didn\u2019t train harder, Ruiz admitted: \u201cThere was a lot on my plate.\u201d Food, no doubt. For much of the night the skies above Diriyah, on the outskirts of the Saudi capital Riyadh, were soot black as rain soaked the 15,000 spectators to the bone. The city usually gets less than 10cm of rainfall a year. Much of it seemed to come in one sustained burst. At one point, as the wind whipped around the open air arena and wobbled the giant screens above the ring, there were even some concerns that the fight might be in jeopardy. Fortunately the threat of electrical storms had dissipated by the time Joshua and Ruiz faced off, just after midnight here. Both men had shown plenty of respect for each other in the protracted buildup and the fight started cautiously, with Ruiz stalking his prey and the Briton on the back foot. But shortly before the end of the opening round a nasty right hand from Joshua suddenly bloodied his opponent above his left eye. The old Joshua might have scented blood and immediately gone for the kill. This time, however, he had clearly loosened his addiction to chaos. Instead he was content to dance on the outside and allow his jab attempt to dominate \u2013 although he did pick up a small cut himself over his right eye at the end of the second round. The pattern had been set. The Briton kept jabbing and moving from side to side. In truth it sometimes looked mechanical, like someone dancing in public for the first time, but with Ruiz so slow it kept working. Joshua usually prepares for a fight by spending hours each week pumping iron, developing a body with muscles that could turn heads on Venice beach. This time he came in at under 17st \u2013 his lightest weight for five years \u2013 in a bid to counter Ruiz\u2019s speed. Sometimes, though there was a sense that the Briton was allowing Ruiz\u2019s roughhouse tactics to get to him \u2013 and that he wanted to trade too much. In the eighth he paid the price as the Mexican-American landed with a good left hook followed by a right hand. But it was Ruiz, with his granite chin, who was still taking more big punches as the fight went into the championship rounds. The crowd, who had paid between \u00a3105 and \u00a310,000 for tickets, certainly enjoyed it. And so, clearly, did Joshua. Earlier in the week he had been warned that he was being duped by a Saudi regime that was \u201csportswashing\u201d its reputation. He will continue to face criticism from human rights groups. But with so much in the bank, and with three world titles back around his waist, he will hardly care.",

      "bodyText": "In a cavernous space off one of Madrid\u2019s main boulevards, a dying Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca slumps like an unstrung puppet, a refugee cellist stares down Robert Capa\u2019s lens, and the eyes of a young woman Pablo Picasso sketched 71 years ago meet the public\u2019s gaze for the very first time. The images, carefully arranged among hundreds of photographs, books, flags, paintings and audio archives, herald a belated homecoming. Eighty years after about 500,000 republican Spaniards crossed the border into France to escape Franco\u2019s forces in the final months of the civil war, the socialist government is marking the anniversary with a huge exhibition intended \u2013 as the justice minister, Dolores Delgado, puts it \u2013 to \u201csettle our overdue moral debt by rescuing truth from the pit of forgetfulness\u201d. Some of the exiles joined the French resistance, ending up in Nazi death camps; some helped liberate Paris; some fought with the Red Army \u2013 even taking on a division of the Spanish troops Franco dispatched to help the Germans; and some began new lives in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, the Caribbean, the USSR, the US and the UK. Divided into three parts, the exhibition chronicles the initial exile in France, life in the internment camps there, and the subsequent scattering of the republican diaspora. Long lines of men, women and children file through Capa\u2019s photographs and the paintings that record La Retirada (the Retreat), while the boats that carried the exiles across the Atlantic appear in snapshots, miniatures and in the newssheets put together by their passengers. The suffering of the 7,000 Spaniards who were sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria is documented in the pictures taken there by Francesc Boix \u2013 photos that would later be used as evidence at Nuremberg. There is a portrait of the poet Antonio Machado, who died in the French Pyrenees three weeks after fleeing Spain, and first editions of the works of Arturo Barea, the exiled republican journalist who settled in England and worked for the BBC, where he gained a reputation as a kind of Spanish Alistair Cooke. \u201cSe\u00f1or Barea,\u201d George Orwell once noted, \u201cis one of the most valuable of the literary acquisitions that England has made as a result of Fascist persecution.\u201d More famous and more present throughout the exhibition, which opened last week at La Arquer\u00eda de Nuevos Ministerios, are the works of Picasso. Thirty-three contemporary photographs record the arrival in Spain in 1981 of perhaps the country\u2019s best known exile \u2013 Guernica \u2013 which was flown over from New York in the hold of an Iberia jumbo jet. Equally significant is a photograph, taken three years earlier at the Spanish embassy in Mexico City, in which King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof\u00eda clasp the hands of Dolores Rivas Cherif, the widow of Manuel Aza\u00f1a, the last president of the second republic. Juan Manuel Bonet, the curator of the main exhibition, sees the show as \u201can exercise in memory\u201d and a chance to reflect on all that was lost when half a million people escaped over the border. \u201cWhat had been lost by Spain was won by these other countries that took in the exiles,\u201d he says. \u201cI think democratic Spain owes a debt to that exiled Spain because the culture that was lost enriched other cultures \u2013 especially in countries like Mexico, where the exiles were so warmly welcomed. In Mexico, Spanish artists, writers, scientists and intellectuals integrated and imparted their knowledge.\u201d Bonet, a writer and critic who has served as director of both the Reina Sof\u00eda museum and the Instituto Cervantes, says the exhibition is also intended to pay tribute to the spirit of \u201cdemocratic justice\u201d that ushered in the post-Franco era. Four decades after the dictator\u2019s death, however, Spain\u2019s politics are deeply fragmented; the far-right now holds 52 seats in congress. \u201cWe always have a duty to remember what happened, especially at such a tense time in Spain,\u201d says Bonet. Were he forced to choose his favourite pieces from the more than 300 on show, the curator would opt for the miniature study of a fallen warrior that now adorns the memorial to Spanish members of the French resistance in the town of Annecy. And then there is Picasso\u2019s sketch of Mercedes S\u00e1nchez Cruz-L\u00f3pez, daughter of Manuel S\u00e1nchez Arcas, an exiled member of the republican government. The portrait, made in Warsaw in 1948, has never been shown in public. \u201cI suppose I have a certain weakness for it because it\u2019s not every day that you can exhibit a Picasso that\u2019s never been seen before,\u201d says Bonet. The exhibition ends with a group of works which explore the mythic appeal and legacy of some of the icons of Spanish literature. Among them is a sculpture of Don Quixote breathing his last, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Tella\u2019s The Death of Garc\u00eda Lorca, painted in 1953, and a statue and an oil painting of the poet Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, who died of tuberculosis in a Spanish prison in 1942. \u201cI\u2019ve finished the exhibition with a look back at the way they thought about the Quixote and Lorca and Hern\u00e1ndez,\u201d says Bonet. \u201cThose are just three of many, but the exiles took Spain with them in their minds wherever they went. And when they came back, they showed \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 that a part of Spanish culture had been produced outside Spain, and that should never have to happen again.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On the walls across Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, a stencilled image can be found. Depicting a figure in a Napoleonic-era cocked hat and military frock coat, it first emerged amid the country\u2019s long-running political and security crisis that began last year.</p> <p>The man portrayed is Jean-Jacques Dessalines \u2013 Emperor Jacques I of Haiti \u2013 the rebel general who defeated French forces at the battle of Verti\u00e8res to found the state of Haiti in 1804. And it is not only in graffiti that Dessalines\u2019s two centuries-old legacy has been seen in the recent months of political turmoil that has gripped the country.</p> <p>At the mass street protests that have flared intermittently throughout this year against the government of president Jovenel Mo\u00efse, roiled by allegations of a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal, Haitians have appeared in the streets dressed as Dessalines \u2013 not least during the huge demonstrations on 17 October that coincided with the national day marking the anniversary of his assassination in 1806.</p> <p>That commemoration saw Mo\u00efse forced to mark the usually public events at the National Pantheon Museum in private as hundreds of armed police officers closed down the surrounding area. Protesters demanding his resignation were gathered nearby.</p> <p>But above all, it is in the national conversation around the continuing crisis that the spirit of Dessalines has been most starkly in evidence.</p> <p>In the almost endless and sometimes heated exchanges on the country\u2019s news and talk radio stations, discussion will inevitably turn to the <em>mod\u00e8le Dessalines</em> \u2013 the ideal Dessalines model \u2013 a nostalgic idea of the different path Haiti might have taken but for his assassination.</p> <p>The reality is that the current evocation of Dessalines is one that speaks to Haiti\u2019s myriad social woes and is a powerful critique of the failure of its political system over generations and centuries through dictatorship, chronic inequality and grinding poverty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0491fda16690e8c436083b460a28616104bb77a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0491fda16690e8c436083b460a28616104bb77a3/0_55_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse at a ceremony marking the death of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, in Port-au-Prince earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse at a ceremony marking the death of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, in Port-au-Prince earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andr\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez Casares/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the intractability of Haiti\u2019s current crisis \u2013 which has rumbled on since Mo\u00efse\u2019s contested election two years ago \u2013 appears custom-made for an appeal to an almost mythological figure amid widespread popular distrust of the political elite.</p> <p>Implicated in the loss of about $2bn to corruption in a controversial scheme to buy cheap energy on credit from Venezuela, a deal that would free up funds for social development, the security forces in Mo\u00efse\u2019s government have responded by firing on demonstrators, even as he has refused repeatedly to resign.</p> <p>Opposition figures, too, have been implicated in political violence, often involving the arming of criminal gangs, some touched by the same scandal as Mo\u00efse. All of this has elevated the status of a figure from the distant past who appears untainted by the current failure of Haiti\u2019s political system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/haiti-zip/giv-3902JnM84ReQawZa/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/haiti-zip/giv-3902JnM84ReQawZa/\">.</a> </figure>  <p>Sitting on the lawn of a cultural centre in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Delmas neighbourhood, Lyonel Trouillot, one of Haiti\u2019s most celebrated novelists, considers the importance of Dessalines \u2013 not least in comparison with Toussaint Louverture, the anti-colonial leader who is far better known elsewhere in the world through his depiction in CLR James\u2019s 1938 account of rebellion in Haiti, <em>The Black Jacobins</em>.</p> <p>\u201cFor Haitians, Dessalines is practically the only figure in our history who has attained this mystical status,\u201d he says. As he points out, Dessalines\u2019 standing is such that he is the only figure to have been incorporated into the vodou pantheon as Ogou Desalin, a warrior associated with defending liberty.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a slave from the fields originally. And he was the leader who founded the state. He wanted a society that was based on equality and a common sphere of citizenship.\u201d</p> <p>Central to all this is the radical constitution of 1805, signed by Dessalines, which held up the equality of both the newly emancipated <em>nouveaux libres</em>, slaves of direct African heritage, and the <em>anciens libres</em> caste of mixed heritage [called mulattos] who would come to dominate Haiti\u2019s political and economic system.</p> <p>\u201cThe <em>mod\u00e8le Dessalines </em>was the idea of a country for all of us, based on a common destiny in which everyone had the same chance. The murder of Dessalines in 1806 put an end to that process,\u201d says Trouillot.</p> <p>\u201cSince then,\u201d he adds, \u201cthere has been an informal alliance between the mulatto bourgeoisie and those occupying political power.</p> <p>\u201cThe meaning of Dessalines in the current context is the desire in Haitian society for a new beginning. That\u2019s what people in the streets are fighting for. It is a response to domination, exploitation and exclusion.\u201d</p> <p>And Dessalines has meant very different things at different times.</p> <p>He was written out of Haiti\u2019s history for four decades after his murder amid the country\u2019s early diplomatic isolation. For its centenary in 1904, however, an anthem commemorating him was commissioned, <em>La Dessalinienne,</em> popularised during the two decades of US occupation that began in 1915.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10db992c47b4d0d4b4946d6eebd75f3cb8532927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10db992c47b4d0d4b4946d6eebd75f3cb8532927/0_0_5694_3891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activists with a portrait of Dessalines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists with a portrait of Dessalines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The close association with the Duvaliers\u2019 rule (1957-1986) was followed by another period when Dessalines and his red-and-black flag became seen as difficult. Anyone flying the flag was suspected of supporting the former dictatorship. And Dessalines, the historical figure, as historians point out, is not without problems. He ordered the massacre of between 1,000 and 5,000 French citizens, including women and children in the \u201cHaiti massacre\u201d \u2013 prompted by fears of a French plot against the new republic \u2013 although he notably protected other non-French white people living in Haiti.</p> <p>And while Dessalines abolished slavery, he supported a restrictive labour system that tied workers to plantations even if they were paid for their efforts.</p> <p>Julia Gaffield, an academic at Georgia State University who is writing a book on Dessalines, sees appeals to his memory in Haitian politics as a reaction to both anxiety over the country\u2019s sovereignty, faced with perceptions of foreign interference including from the US, and in appeals to a fairer society.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the memory and legacy of Dessalines is called upon it is to serve contemporary needs, often when a very radical shift happens. When a revolution needs to happen.

      "bodyText": "On the walls across Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, a stencilled image can be found. Depicting a figure in a Napoleonic-era cocked hat and military frock coat, it first emerged amid the country\u2019s long-running political and security crisis that began last year. The man portrayed is Jean-Jacques Dessalines \u2013 Emperor Jacques I of Haiti \u2013 the rebel general who defeated French forces at the battle of Verti\u00e8res to found the state of Haiti in 1804. And it is not only in graffiti that Dessalines\u2019s two centuries-old legacy has been seen in the recent months of political turmoil that has gripped the country. At the mass street protests that have flared intermittently throughout this year against the government of president Jovenel Mo\u00efse, roiled by allegations of a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal, Haitians have appeared in the streets dressed as Dessalines \u2013 not least during the huge demonstrations on 17 October that coincided with the national day marking the anniversary of his assassination in 1806. That commemoration saw Mo\u00efse forced to mark the usually public events at the National Pantheon Museum in private as hundreds of armed police officers closed down the surrounding area. Protesters demanding his resignation were gathered nearby. But above all, it is in the national conversation around the continuing crisis that the spirit of Dessalines has been most starkly in evidence. In the almost endless and sometimes heated exchanges on the country\u2019s news and talk radio stations, discussion will inevitably turn to the mod\u00e8le Dessalines \u2013 the ideal Dessalines model \u2013 a nostalgic idea of the different path Haiti might have taken but for his assassination. The reality is that the current evocation of Dessalines is one that speaks to Haiti\u2019s myriad social woes and is a powerful critique of the failure of its political system over generations and centuries through dictatorship, chronic inequality and grinding poverty. And the intractability of Haiti\u2019s current crisis \u2013 which has rumbled on since Mo\u00efse\u2019s contested election two years ago \u2013 appears custom-made for an appeal to an almost mythological figure amid widespread popular distrust of the political elite. Implicated in the loss of about $2bn to corruption in a controversial scheme to buy cheap energy on credit from Venezuela, a deal that would free up funds for social development, the security forces in Mo\u00efse\u2019s government have responded by firing on demonstrators, even as he has refused repeatedly to resign. Opposition figures, too, have been implicated in political violence, often involving the arming of criminal gangs, some touched by the same scandal as Mo\u00efse. All of this has elevated the status of a figure from the distant past who appears untainted by the current failure of Haiti\u2019s political system. Sitting on the lawn of a cultural centre in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Delmas neighbourhood, Lyonel Trouillot, one of Haiti\u2019s most celebrated novelists, considers the importance of Dessalines \u2013 not least in comparison with Toussaint Louverture, the anti-colonial leader who is far better known elsewhere in the world through his depiction in CLR James\u2019s 1938 account of rebellion in Haiti, The Black Jacobins. \u201cFor Haitians, Dessalines is practically the only figure in our history who has attained this mystical status,\u201d he says. As he points out, Dessalines\u2019 standing is such that he is the only figure to have been incorporated into the vodou pantheon as Ogou Desalin, a warrior associated with defending liberty. \u201cHe was a slave from the fields originally. And he was the leader who founded the state. He wanted a society that was based on equality and a common sphere of citizenship.\u201d Central to all this is the radical constitution of 1805, signed by Dessalines, which held up the equality of both the newly emancipated nouveaux libres, slaves of direct African heritage, and the anciens libres caste of mixed heritage [called mulattos] who would come to dominate Haiti\u2019s political and economic system. \u201cThe mod\u00e8le Dessalines was the idea of a country for all of us, based on a common destiny in which everyone had the same chance. The murder of Dessalines in 1806 put an end to that process,\u201d says Trouillot. \u201cSince then,\u201d he adds, \u201cthere has been an informal alliance between the mulatto bourgeoisie and those occupying political power. \u201cThe meaning of Dessalines in the current context is the desire in Haitian society for a new beginning. That\u2019s what people in the streets are fighting for. It is a response to domination, exploitation and exclusion.\u201d And Dessalines has meant very different things at different times. He was written out of Haiti\u2019s history for four decades after his murder amid the country\u2019s early diplomatic isolation. For its centenary in 1904, however, an anthem commemorating him was commissioned, La Dessalinienne, popularised during the two decades of US occupation that began in 1915. The close association with the Duvaliers\u2019 rule (1957-1986) was followed by another period when Dessalines and his red-and-black flag became seen as difficult. Anyone flying the flag was suspected of supporting the former dictatorship. And Dessalines, the historical figure, as historians point out, is not without problems. He ordered the massacre of between 1,000 and 5,000 French citizens, including women and children in the \u201cHaiti massacre\u201d \u2013 prompted by fears of a French plot against the new republic \u2013 although he notably protected other non-French white people living in Haiti. And while Dessalines abolished slavery, he supported a restrictive labour system that tied workers to plantations even if they were paid for their efforts. Julia Gaffield, an academic at Georgia State University who is writing a book on Dessalines, sees appeals to his memory in Haitian politics as a reaction to both anxiety over the country\u2019s sovereignty, faced with perceptions of foreign interference including from the US, and in appeals to a fairer society. \u201cWhen the memory and legacy of Dessalines is called upon it is to serve contemporary needs, often when a very radical shift happens. When a revolution needs to happen. When there needs to be a complete overhaul of the system.\u201d In his home, high in the hills above Port-au-Prince, the Haitian historian Pierre Buteau cautions against elevating the myth of Dessalines above the reality of a complex historical figure. \u201cEvery time we have difficulties,\u201d he explains, \u201cHaitians think of Dessalines. During the period of the US occupation. During the Aristides era. Now in the 21st century that emotion is becoming stronger and more intense amid all the political battles. \u201cI think what is surprising for us as historians is how the myth has become mixed with the truth.\u201d He adds that the problem confronting Jovenel Mo\u00efse is that he cannot talk about or ally himself with the historical figure because he is viewed as having abandoned many of the things Dessalines stood for. But perhaps the last word should go to F\u00e9lix Morisseau-Leroy, whose 1979 Creole poem M\u00e8si Papa Desalin [\u201cThank you Father Dessalines\u201d] long prefigured the current mood, not least his almost messianic assertion of the founding father\u2019s legacy and transformative return . \u201cThe day will come when Dessalines will rise [again],\u201d wrote Morisseau-Leroy. \u201cThat day everyone will know.\u201d",

He said he would probably return on Monday to continue talks. On Friday evening, he had said many issues still needed to be resolved. One point of contention is over steel, after the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, made a last-minute demand for a revised definition of what would constitute North American steel under automotive rules of origin. Mexico approved the USMCA this year but US ratification has been held up by Democrats who have voiced concerns over the enforcement of labor and environmental provisions. \u201cHard to believe,\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday, \u201cbut if Nancy Pelosi had put our great Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada, USMCA, up for a vote long ago, our economy would be even better.

They\u2019re on a current streak of three wins in a row at Old Trafford. They\u2019ve recently dished out some memorable pastings: a 3-0, a 4-1, <em>that</em> 6-1. Tough times for United, traditionally the bosses of this rivalry, with 73 wins on the tally to City\u2019s 53.</p> \n  <p><strong>You\u2019d expect title-chasing City to prevail again this evening. </strong>Especially as they\u2019re coming off the back of that fine confidence-restoring performance at Burnley. United by comparison have only won nine of 22 matches in all competitions, and are still struggling for an identity under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p> \n  <p><strong>But nothing\u2019s ever that simple. </strong>For all their brilliance, City have been uncharacteristically inconsistent so far this season. Before the Burnley game, they\u2019d only won one of their previous five matches. They\u2019ve been beaten by struggling Norwich City. And they\u2019ve already lost at home to Wolves.</p> \n  <p><strong>United will take succour from that last result especially. </strong>Like Wolves, they can be devastating on the counter against teams who come at them, as Chelsea, Liverpool and Sheffield United can testify. City, we can confirm in some exclusive breaking news, will attack today. That may leave their makeshift defence vulnerable. Also, United won\u2019t need reminding twice about the Paul Pogba game of April 2018, when United denied City the chance to finish their title procession with derby victory on home turf, coming back from two down at half-time to frustrate their hosts 3-2. There\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t taste victory on enemy soil again.</p> \n  <p><strong>Then again, United\u2019s defence isn\u2019t up to much either, and City could run riot. </strong>We\u2019ll find out soon enough what it\u2019s to be. Can United follow up their fine result against Tottenham by putting a serious dent in City\u2019s three-peat title hopes? Or will City continue their recent derby form and pick up three points that may prove crucial in the hunting down of Liverpool and Leicester? It\u2019s going to be fun finding out. It\u2019s the 179th Manchester derby. It\u2019s on!</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>5.30pm.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-07T14:56:21.896Z\">at 2.56pm GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "City are investigating ... Not a great day for Pep Guardiola. Barney Ronay on Marcus Rashford. David Hytner was our man at the Etihad. Here\u2019s his take on a mesmerising match. Click and enjoy! And thanks for reading this MBM. A sullen but defiant Pep Guardiola talks. \u201cThey were clinical. I am more than happy with our performance. We created chances. In general, I am delighted and happy with the performance we play. The approach, and the way we play, I am delighted. No regrets. We play a good game. I like to watch my team play. I know who we are as a team. I am delighted to work with these guys. It\u2019s unrealistic to think we can catch up, but we will continue. We are a fantastic team, we played so good.\u201d And as for the racist abuse: \u201cI support the club, we are going to work to avoid it happening again.\u201d A thrilled Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks! \u201cThe start of the game we were exceptional. We should have been five up really. We played so well. We were playing the best team in the world, for me, and the best coach. Players were coming in every angle and we defended so well. We were brilliant in the first half hour. Some great, quick, attacking football. And we kept it well at times. So pleased with the boys, they deserved it. We got tired but they dug in and the mentality is strong. We believe in what we are doing. Results will turn doubters into believers.\u201d He then describes the racist fool in the crowd as a \u201cnot so intelligent fellow\u201d ... \u201cI hope City and the authorities will deal with it, because he shouldn\u2019t be watching football again, not live anyway. We have to stamp it out. It\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d Manchester City have released a statement. The club say they are \u201caware of a video circulating on social media which appears to show a supporter making racial gestures\u201d during the match and are \u201cworking with Greater Manchester Police in order to help them identify any individuals concerned\u201d. The full statement can be read here. Back to that miserable lighter-throwing episode. There are reports that some members of the crowd also made racist gestures towards a United player, and both clubs have been made aware of the incident. Such a depressing state of affairs. Kick It Out have issued a statement: \u201cWe have been inundated with reports of alleged racist abuse from a number of individuals during this evening\u2019s Manchester derby. We will be contacting both clubs to offer our support and hope swift action is taken to identify the offenders.\u201d Pep puts on his best gameface and congratulates Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, then the United players. But he\u2019ll be churning inside. This is a huge blow to Manchester City\u2019s title hopes, which are now hanging by a thread. They\u2019re 14 points behind the leaders Liverpool. Leicester City have got three points on them as well, with a game in hand. But this isn\u2019t just about the title race, because that was a statement of intent by Manchester United. They could easily have won by a couple more. They were devastating in attack in the first half; resolute in defence in the second. They\u2019re not back yet ... but this performance is a sign that their under-fire manager may have what it takes to turn their situation around after all. They\u2019re fifth, now just five points off fourth-placed Chelsea. United hang on! They win the derby and possibly put an end to City\u2019s hopes of a third title in a row! 90 min +4: Walker is booked for a wild scythe on Young. A free kick, which United take their sweet time over. 90 min +3: United launch it back up the other end. The tension in the Etihad is palpable. 90 min +2: Pereira shields the ball by the corner flag awhile. He\u2019s eventually bundled off it, and City can launch it upfield. 90 min +1: James rips upfield and, with City light at the back, slips Pereira clear down the left. Pereira shoots. It\u2019s deflected. Corner. 90 min: United have clearly decided to dig in. It\u2019s going to be a long additional five minutes for them. 89 min: Ashley Young comes on for Luke Shaw, who is completely spent. And then another change in short order, as Axel Tuanzebe replaces Jesse Lingard. 87 min: It was a strong hand by De Gea, as Mahrez curled towards the bottom left. Additionally, Silva was an inch away from diverting the ball past the keeper with his toenail. United\u2019s lead is suddenly hanging by a thread! 86 min: Mahrez drives into the United box from the right. His low shot is parried wonderfully by De Gea. Suddenly United are rocking, and City sense blood! De Bruyne hooks on from the left. Shaw, under no pressure, panics and hacks out for a corner. The ball\u2019s swung into a crowded box. Otamendi rises highest, powering through to blast a header home from close range. City\u2019s comeback is on! 83 min: Pereira makes off down the left, cuts back, then loops a clever ball into the City box. Lingard, rushing in, tries a first-time poke towards the bottom corner, but can\u2019t quite get enough steer on the ball and it\u2019s an easy gather for Ederson. 81 min: Mahrez diddles Shaw down the right, but his stand-up for Sterling, in the middle, floats over his team-mate\u2019s head. A lower ball, and that\u2019d have been an easy tap-in. On the touchline, a dejected, frustrated Pep holds his head in his hands. 80 min: Now Jesus clips McTominay, who is in the wars. He\u2019ll be fine to continue, but takes the opportunity to roll around for a bit before the restart, eating up precious seconds. 79 min: Walker lunges into the back of Fred, then De Bruyne is booked for a lunge on McTominay. City are still well in this game, with plenty of time still on the clock; they can\u2019t afford to lose their composure. 78 min: Rodri dribbles his way into the United box down the left ... then under pressure from Wan-Bissaka dances straight out of play. 77 min: ... Maguire nearly tees up Jesus for a simple goal. His poor header falls to the striker, ten yards out, just to the left of goal. But Jesus, perhaps confused by the nearby Mahrez, dithers and can\u2019t get a shot away. 76 min: Angelino comes in from the left and has a whack. It\u2019s wild, but blocked out for a corner by Wan-Bissaka. That corner leads to another corner, from which ... 74 min: United make their first change, replacing Anthony Martial with Andreas Pereira. The midfielder is immediately in the action, first nearly releasing Lingard down the left, then cynically kicking Sterling\u2019s heels as the City winger made off up the other end. Sterling springs up, looking for a rumble, but the ref gets in between the players and books Pereira. 73 min: From the resulting corner, Silva tries to bundle home at the near post, but can only send the ball harmlessly wide right. 72 min: City pin United back. They probe this way and that. Suddenly Mahrez bursts down the right and crosses. The ball clanks off Shaw\u2019s arm and out for a corner, but again it\u2019s no penalty, Shaw turning his back at close range, his arm right by his side. 70 min: Sterling chases a De Bruyne pass down the right and topples over, with Maguire in hot pursuit. He wants a penalty, but there\u2019s no contact and he\u2019s not getting it. And to be fair, while VAR double-checks, Sterling trots back upfield, having perhaps thought twice about the claim. 68 min: The corner can\u2019t be taken, because a minority of City-supporting eejits launch a few cigarette lighters towards the United players preparing to take. One hits Fred on the back of the head. Ugly scenes. Fred looks like he\u2019ll be fine, but really, what\u2019s wrong with people? 66 min: On the other hand, a successful United break would put this game to bed. James skitters towards the City box, straight down the middle, and slips the ball wide for Lingard, who hesitates before shooting. His eventual effort is parried round the post for a corner. 65 min: Before the corner, Riyad Mahrez comes on for Bernardo Silva. The set piece ends up at the feet of Sterling, out on the left. He loops long for Mahrez at the far post. Mahrez can only guide the ball wide with a telescopic leg. City are getting closer to a goal that would change the mood utterly. 64 min: A little time and space for Rodri on the edge of the United D. He takes a touch and launches one towards the top right. It\u2019s a fine effort, matched for quality by De Gea\u2019s save. The keeper fingertips the ball over the bar. 63 min: James rips the ball off a snoozing Angelino, and tears towards the City box. He looks for Rashford and Martial with a square pass. The ball pinballs around and into Ederson\u2019s arms, just as it looked as though Martial might toe-poke home. 61 min: Sterling cuts in from the left, past a dithering Lindelof, and works himself some space to shoot. But he hesitates a little, allowing Wan-Bissaka to hassle him from behind. As Sterling sashays left to right without shooting, Wan-Bissaka toe-pokes the ball away from Sterling\u2019s toe and out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 59 min: Stones gets up and hobbles off. He\u2019s replaced by Nicolas Otamendi. This really hasn\u2019t been City\u2019s night so far. 58 min: Fred hoists the free kick into the mixer. City clear for a throw. Before United can take it, attention must be paid to Stones, who is sat on the turf looking glum. This is the last thing City need. 57 min: One corner leads to another, and suddenly Lingard is romping upfield on the counter. He\u2019s making good down the left, and is upended by Walker. A free kick, and a chance for United to load the box. 55 min: Wan-Bissaka and Fred faff about on the edge of their own box and gift De Bruyne possession. He bursts into the box down the inside-right channel, and looks odds on to score. But Lindelof slides in to deflect his shot over the bar. Corner. 54 min: De Gea is booked for taking an absurd amount of time over a goal kick. 53 min: Martial sprints upfield on the counter. It\u2019s four on two! He\u2019s got James in acres to his right, but opts to play in Rashford on the left instead. Rashford is up against Walker, who gets to the ball first then draws a foul. What a chance to extend United\u2019s lead, and it\u2019s been spurned. 52 min: Here\u2019s a stat and a half, courtesy of Sky. In the Premier League era, Manchester United have never lost after leading by two or more goals at half-time. Out of 170 games, they\u2019ve gone on to win 167 of them and draw the other three. They\u2019ll not want to lose this record to City. 50 min: Rashford tries to get United going again, but it\u2019s a one-man sortie down the left and he eventually runs out of road. 48 min: This is much better from Angelino, who cuts back marvellously from a tight spot on the left, taking the three United players he\u2019d drawn towards him out of the game. In the pocket of space that\u2019s left, David Silva takes a touch and aims for the top right, but doesn\u2019t get the required bend. Already this is much better from the champions. 47 min: City pick up where they left off, pushing United deep. De Bruyne wastes little time in winning a corner down the right. All good and well, but when the ball finds its way to Angelino, 30 yards out, his overly ambitious larrup, sailing high into the stand, betrays City\u2019s anxiety. City get the ball rolling for the second half. There have been no half-time changes. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any change in Guardiola\u2019s mood, either, as he\u2019s still bending the fourth official\u2019s ear. A very animated discussion. Let\u2019s hope they can iron out their differences. Half-time reading. Just to put City\u2019s current plight into proper context. For the first half hour, that was the best display of counter-attacking by Manchester United since the days of Andrei Kanchelskis. The last 15 minutes or so were all City\u2019s, though, and that\u2019ll give United pause. This is far from over. 45 min +2: Walker cuts one back from the touchline, to the right of goal. Fred slides in and blocks out for a corner. City want a penalty, but Fred\u2019s arm wasn\u2019t in an unnatural position, and neither referee nor VAR is interested. Pep is once again livid. 45 min: De Bruyne crosses from the right. David Silva nearly bundles in at the far post, but can\u2019t hook the ball goalwards, and De Gea was on point anyway. 44 min: City are completely on top. United can\u2019t get out, and after 30 minutes of freewheeling around like they own the place, will now be desperate to hear the half-time whistle. Strange old game. 43 min: David Silva wafts a dismal effort towards the top right. It\u2019s weak, and easy pickings for De Gea. 42 min: City are beginning to ask some questions. They\u2019ve spent 50 percent of the last ten minutes in United\u2019s final third. Lingard knocks Rodri to the ground, and it\u2019s another free kick in a dangerous position. 40 min: Sterling glides in from the left and is clumsily brought down by Wan-Bissaka, just outside the box. De Bruyne takes the free kick, and lofts it uncharacteristically over the bar, never troubling De Gea. 38 min: City carve out their first gilt-edged chance of the match. De Bruyne, just to the right of the D, pitching wedges a delightful cross towards Jesus, who dives to meet it with his head on the penalty spot. He should at least get his header on target, but it sails harmlessly wide left. What a ball by De Bruyne, though, and a reminder that, for all their early sass, United haven\u2019t got the win locked down yet. 36 min: James rolls a cross along the corridor of uncertainty from the right. Had Martial really stretched for that, he\u2019d have poked home. But as it is, the ball sails off out of play on the left. Another huge chance for United, who are ripping City\u2019s back line apart with ease. Will they live to rue all these missed opportunities? 35 min: De Bruyne finds Walker with a lovely sliderule pass down the right wing. Walker fizzes a low cross into the box but there\u2019s nobody in blue taking a chance, and it\u2019s an easy claim for De Gea. 34 min: A bit of space for David Silva, 30 yards from goal. He\u2019s inexplicably allowed to make it to the edge of the box, where he lashes a shot goalwards. Fortunately for United, it\u2019s straight at De Gea. 33 min: Bernardo Silva cuts in from the right and has a dig from the edge of the box. His effort slaps McTominay in the chest. United clear. Sterling comes back at the visitors down the left, but he can\u2019t get past Wan-Bissaka. Frowns on City faces right now. 31 min: On the touchline, Pep Guardiola looks utterly stunned. And no wonder, his team are being ripped to shreds here. United could easily be five or six up! Higher up in the stand, a certain knight of the realm allows a warm smile of satisfaction to play across his face. And the United fans are extremely vocal in their support of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. James and Martial combine at speed down the right. Martial spins on the edge of the area, just to the right of the D, and threads a shot into the bottom right, past the outstretched fingers of Ederson. To repeat: this is no more than United deserve. City need to wake up and quick. 28 min: This is a quite sensational United performance. They look dangerous every time they cross the halfway line. City are a ragged rabble! 27 min: United should be three or four goals up here. James makes good down the right and cuts back for Rashford, who tries to guide a curler into the top right. The ball clips the top of the bar with Ederson beaten all ends up. 25 min: Martial is sent wheeching down the right. He knocks the ball towards Rashford, just inside the box, coming in from the left. Rashford has time to take a touch, but with Ederson off his line, attempts a first-touch curler around the keeper and into the bottom right. His effort is well wide. 24 min: Guardiola has a full and frank exchange of views with the fourth official. Meanwhile, Bernardo Silva tries to repair the damage by dribbling down the right and entering the box. His shot is deflected out for a corner, from which nothing occurs. Rashford stutters, sends Ederson one way, then passes the ball into the bottom right. This goal had been coming. United deserve their lead. 22 min: Bernardo Silva is also livid at the decision, and talks his way into the book. 21 min: VAR intervenes, and it\u2019s a penalty to United! Pep Guardiola is furious, but that was as clear a penalty as you\u2019ll get. I have no idea why the referee said no in the first place. 20 min: Rashford squeezes between Bernardo Silva and Stones, into the box down the inside left. He goes over. It looks like a penalty, Silva coming across Rashford, sticking out a leg, clipping his knee. But the referee\u2019s not interested! 18 min: Sterling wins a corner for City down the left. Nothing much happens, the ball sent sailing over everyone in the box. I suppose that qualifies as a lull, in the context of what\u2019s gone before. This is non-stop fun. 16 min: City are shipping a large number of good chances. James is sent scampering down the right by Rashford, and pulls back for Martial, who shoots towards the bottom right. Ederson saves well. He\u2019s earned his money today already. 14 min: United spring upfield from the Lindelof incident and nearly break clear. Fernandinho does well to intercept just as it looks like Martial will zip free down the right. 13 min: Bernardo Silva is sprung down the inside right channel and cuts the ball back. There\u2019s a scramble on the spot, Jesus sliding in, and the ball hits Lindelof\u2019s arm. But the referee says it\u2019s accidental, and VAR agrees. It looks like the correct decision, there was little Lindelof could do, the ball kicked up to his arm from close range as he challenged. 11 min: \u201cThey will have to break out the oxygen tanks if this pace keeps up,\u201d suggests Mary Waltz. \u201cElectric.\u201d It\u2019s that, all right. City attempt to calm things down a little bit by passing and probing, probing and passing. They shift the ball this way and that, but United hold their shape and stay patient. Eventually the move peters out. 9 min: This match is absurdly entertaining. Rashford slips a ball down the inside left for Lingard, who shoots at Ederson from a tight angle. Ederson kicks away brilliantly in the style popularised by the man between the sticks up the other end. 8 min: Shaw swings a dangerous ball in from the left. Martial manages to handle with both hands in his attempt to chest down and turn on the penalty spot. 7 min: More space for James down the right. His cutback flies behind Rashford and Martial. City counter, Sterling dribbling at great speed down the left and cutting back for David Silva, who squirts a low shot across the face of goal and wide right. 6 min: Space for James out on the right. He chips a fine pass over the City back line in the hope of sending Martial clean through. Walker does exceptionally well to turn on the jets himself and get his body in between Martial and the ball. Danger over. 4 min: David Silva nearly releases Sterling down the inside left. McTominay intercepts sensationally, springing up after sliding to trap, then hooking clear. City want a penalty but the ball hit the midfielder\u2019s chest as he slid. 3 min: City go straight up the other end and nearly score themselves, David Silva shooting from a tight angle on the left. His effort is blocked. This is very open. It certainly doesn\u2019t look like a 0-0 in the making. 2 min: But it\u2019s United who have the first chance of the game, and they probably should have scored. Martial romps into City territory and then Fred slips James free on the right. James is in an absurd amount of space, but shoots straight at Ederson. 1 min: A first touch for Harry Maguire, who having chosen red over blue this summer, gets pantomime pelters. And United struggle to get out of their final third in the opening exchanges, City stringing plenty of passes together as they briskly probe this way and that. A quick blast of Blue Moon ... and then we\u2019re off! United get the ball rolling. \u201cCall this a sheer gut shot, but I really like United\u2019s chances in this match,\u201d opines Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cFrom a distance, I admire what Ole\u2019s doing in building a squad with youth and I just think they\u2019ll have a willingness to bleed on the pitch more than City who probably are more focused on Big Cup. I\u2019m calling it 4-2 United. Onwards!\u201d The teams are out! The greatest thing about derbies? Both sets of teams get to wear the colours that made them famous. You don\u2019t need me to tell you, but just for the sake of completion: City are in sky blue, United in red. In the tunnel beforehand, David de Gea and David Silva enjoyed a nice friendly catch-up. All smiles. So much for the two teams being sworn enemies. A pow-wow that won\u2019t shift the dial on the Roy Keane-o-meter very far. Anyway, there\u2019s a derby-day atmosphere inside the Etihad, and it\u2019ll only get louder when we kick off in a minute. Pep talks. \u201cThey have pace up front. So fast. They have a lot of quality, one against one. We know what they are going to try to do, so we have to try to control it. We will try to be clinical. It is special for our fans, but we have to be focused on what we are trying to do, we cannot be emotional. The battle will be with the players on the pitch, but of course our supporters will make it extra.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskjaer talks to Sky. \u201cYou want as many good players on the pitch as possible, especially when you play a fantastic team like Man City. We know we will have to play our best to have the chance of a result. Luke Shaw is ready. He\u2019s trained really well, and hopefully we will see the best of him. We would like to keep the ball. If you let City have it too much, they can out-football any team, they can football you to death. We will have to be good in our pressing and our defensive shape, but we want to keep the ball as well. We want to attack quickly. We must be confident but also humble. We are playing a fantastic side on their own ground.\u201d If the Manchester derby wasn\u2019t big enough anyway, on its own merits, Liverpool have just won 3-0 at Bournemouth. The result puts them on 46 points, 11 clear of second-placed Leicester City, who go to midlands rivals Aston Villa tomorrow ... and 14 clear of defending champions Manchester City in third place. City need a result tonight. But then United have their own agenda, and three points would take them into fifth spot, a little closer to the Champions League places after Chelsea\u2019s 3-1 defeat at Everton. Plenty up for grabs. A festive feel at the Etihad. \ud834\udd62 Blue Christmas, that\u2019s the way you see it when you\u2019re feeling blue Blue Xmas, when you\u2019re blue at Christmastime you see right through All the waste, all the sham, all the haste And plain old bad taste \ud834\udd62\ud834\udd62 City make one change to the team that ran out easy winners at Burnley on Tuesday night. John Stones takes the place of Nicolas Otamendi. United make two changes to the side who saw off Tottenham Hotspur and Jose Mourinho on Wednesday. Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw replace Mason Greenwood and Ashley Young. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Fernandinho, Jose Angelino, De Bruyne, Rodri, Silva, Bernardo Silva, Gabriel Jesus, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Gundogan, Mendy, Mahrez, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Foden. Manchester United: de Gea, Wan Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, McTominay, Fred, James, Lingard, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Mata, Andreas Pereira, Young, Romero, Greenwood, Tuanzebe, Williams. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). City have had the upper hand in the Manchester derby in recent years, there\u2019s no denying it. They did the double over United in last year\u2019s treble season. They\u2019re on a current streak of three wins in a row at Old Trafford. They\u2019ve recently dished out some memorable pastings: a 3-0, a 4-1, that 6-1. Tough times for United, traditionally the bosses of this rivalry, with 73 wins on the tally to City\u2019s 53. You\u2019d expect title-chasing City to prevail again this evening. Especially as they\u2019re coming off the back of that fine confidence-restoring performance at Burnley. United by comparison have only won nine of 22 matches in all competitions, and are still struggling for an identity under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. But nothing\u2019s ever that simple. For all their brilliance, City have been uncharacteristically inconsistent so far this season. Before the Burnley game, they\u2019d only won one of their previous five matches. They\u2019ve been beaten by struggling Norwich City. And they\u2019ve already lost at home to Wolves. United will take succour from that last result especially. Like Wolves, they can be devastating on the counter against teams who come at them, as Chelsea, Liverpool and Sheffield United can testify. City, we can confirm in some exclusive breaking news, will attack today. That may leave their makeshift defence vulnerable. Also, United won\u2019t need reminding twice about the Paul Pogba game of April 2018, when United denied City the chance to finish their title procession with derby victory on home turf, coming back from two down at half-time to frustrate their hosts 3-2. There\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t taste victory on enemy soil again. Then again, United\u2019s defence isn\u2019t up to much either, and City could run riot. We\u2019ll find out soon enough what it\u2019s to be. Can United follow up their fine result against Tottenham by putting a serious dent in City\u2019s three-peat title hopes? Or will City continue their recent derby form and pick up three points that may prove crucial in the hunting down of Liverpool and Leicester? It\u2019s going to be fun finding out. It\u2019s the 179th Manchester derby. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm.",

That could take weeks or even months, as multiple feuding factions try to broker a compromise. Mahdi\u2019s own appointment last year only came after five months of wrangling, and an intervention by Iranian officials. Any attempt by Tehran to intervene again could be explosive; protesters have already attacked and burned the country\u2019s consulate in the southern city of Najaf.

Winning at Villa Park will not be easy because Dean Smith\u2019s team are better than their position in the Premier League table suggests. But then, so are Brendan Rodgers\u2019s team. Leicester started the weekend as Liverpool\u2019s closest pursuers but still not widely considered to be genuine challengers. Ridiculous.</p> <p>Granted, if the title race remains a sprint, not a marathon, then no one will catch Liverpool this season. But if they slow down or stumble, which is entirely conceivable, then it is not only Manchester City who could overtake them. Leicester are serious runners and could close the gap substantially this month, especially with Liverpool due at the King Power on Boxing Day straight after returning from the World Club Championship in Qatar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/06/brendan-rodgers-leicester-new-contract-2025-arsenal\">Brendan Rodgers commits future to Leicester with new contract to 2025</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is almost absurd what Leicester are doing, attempting to put a perky twist on Samuel Beckett\u2019s most famous quote. Win again. Win better. Three years ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/leicester-city-win-the-premier-league-title-after-fairytale-season\" title=\"\">they became the most sensational champions of the Premier League era </a>and now here they are again with a chance of following up that feat, against superior opponents and with more pizzazz.</p> <p>Consider, too, that it is just five years since the only previous time Leicester won eight league games in a row. That was in the Championship. Leicester have become a club who advance at pace. They reached their eight-in-a-row milestone last time by winning in Birmingham, and the scorer of the decisive goal was Jamie Vardy.</p> <p>He and Kasper Schmeichel are the two Leicester players who featured in that match and are likely to start at Villa Park. Wes Morgan is still an important squad member, too. The enduring influence of those players, plus extras such as Marc Albrighton and Christian Fuchs, could be critical if Leicester are still in contention in the closing weeks of the season.</p> <p>They, after all, have experience of winning the title. Unlike Liverpool, who will come under almost unbearable pressure as the prospect of ending 30 years of purgatory draws nearer. Rodgers knows that better than most.</p> <p>His role in all this should not be underplayed. He has had some lucky breaks at Leicester and not in the way word of a release clause in his contract got out just when Arsenal started sniffing around, which hardly hurt him before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/06/brendan-rodgers-leicester-new-contract-2025-arsenal\" title=\"\">he agreed a nice new deal </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/06/brendan-rodgers-leicester-new-contract-2025-arsenal\" title=\"\">on Friday</a>.</p> <p>There is also the fact Harry Maguire, whose departure to Manchester United in August was seen as a blow, is serving as a useful case study to any Leicester players who may be courted during the January transfer window, a parable showing that while there may be more money at other sides, the grass is not always greener. Most significantly, though, Rodgers inherited an excellent squad.</p> <p>But he has done excellent work with that squad. It seems unthinkable that with these players Leicester lost more matches than they won last season. The most striking difference between now and then is the rise in their intensity. Rodgers has made them tighter, sharper and smarter.</p> <p>Claude Puel began their transition from a counterattacking team to possession-based unit but did not understand his players well enough to see it through, leaving Leicester ponderous and prone to lapses in concentration. Vardy told <em>L\u2019\u00c9quipe</em> in September that the team did not feel properly wired. \u201cI felt the rhythm [of training] was too slow,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much so that it was difficult for us to be fast and aggressive in matches.

      "bodyText": "If Leicester beat Aston Villa on Sunday, it will be the first time they have won eight consecutive matches in the top flight. Winning at Villa Park will not be easy because Dean Smith\u2019s team are better than their position in the Premier League table suggests. But then, so are Brendan Rodgers\u2019s team. Leicester started the weekend as Liverpool\u2019s closest pursuers but still not widely considered to be genuine challengers. Ridiculous. Granted, if the title race remains a sprint, not a marathon, then no one will catch Liverpool this season. But if they slow down or stumble, which is entirely conceivable, then it is not only Manchester City who could overtake them. Leicester are serious runners and could close the gap substantially this month, especially with Liverpool due at the King Power on Boxing Day straight after returning from the World Club Championship in Qatar. It is almost absurd what Leicester are doing, attempting to put a perky twist on Samuel Beckett\u2019s most famous quote. Win again. Win better. Three years ago they became the most sensational champions of the Premier League era and now here they are again with a chance of following up that feat, against superior opponents and with more pizzazz. Consider, too, that it is just five years since the only previous time Leicester won eight league games in a row. That was in the Championship. Leicester have become a club who advance at pace. They reached their eight-in-a-row milestone last time by winning in Birmingham, and the scorer of the decisive goal was Jamie Vardy. He and Kasper Schmeichel are the two Leicester players who featured in that match and are likely to start at Villa Park. Wes Morgan is still an important squad member, too. The enduring influence of those players, plus extras such as Marc Albrighton and Christian Fuchs, could be critical if Leicester are still in contention in the closing weeks of the season. They, after all, have experience of winning the title. Unlike Liverpool, who will come under almost unbearable pressure as the prospect of ending 30 years of purgatory draws nearer. Rodgers knows that better than most. His role in all this should not be underplayed. He has had some lucky breaks at Leicester and not in the way word of a release clause in his contract got out just when Arsenal started sniffing around, which hardly hurt him before he agreed a nice new deal on Friday. There is also the fact Harry Maguire, whose departure to Manchester United in August was seen as a blow, is serving as a useful case study to any Leicester players who may be courted during the January transfer window, a parable showing that while there may be more money at other sides, the grass is not always greener. Most significantly, though, Rodgers inherited an excellent squad. But he has done excellent work with that squad. It seems unthinkable that with these players Leicester lost more matches than they won last season. The most striking difference between now and then is the rise in their intensity. Rodgers has made them tighter, sharper and smarter. Claude Puel began their transition from a counterattacking team to possession-based unit but did not understand his players well enough to see it through, leaving Leicester ponderous and prone to lapses in concentration. Vardy told L\u2019\u00c9quipe in September that the team did not feel properly wired. \u201cI felt the rhythm [of training] was too slow,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much so that it was difficult for us to be fast and aggressive in matches. Everyone who plays sport knows that if you train one way, you cannot change radically when the competition starts. We tried our best but it wasn\u2019t working, it was frustrating.\u201d No more. Leicester pass and move with purpose now and, when out of possession, chase the ball voraciously. They have won more tackles than any other top-10 team in the league this season. Wilfred Ndidi, Caglar Soyuncu and Ricardo Pereira, in addition to being nifty with the ball, yearn for physical duels. But the movements are all coordinated, which is why Leicester have conceded fewer goals this season than any team in England\u2019s top four divisions. And they are the only side not to concede a single goal from a set piece. They have scored more late goals than anyone else, testament to their stamina, spirit and Rodgers\u2019s ability to make effective tactical or personnel changes during games. It is telling that in their past two matches Leicester have won without being at their best, with key contributions from substitutes. Kelechi Iheanacho struck in stoppage-time against Everton and James Maddison (not a substitute) scored late against Watford thanks to a burst by James Justin, who had replaced Harvey Barnes. Fuchs also performed well after stepping in for the injured Ben Chilwell. Dennis Praet and Demarai Gray were similarly influential after being introduced at Brighton three weeks ago. Leicester have greater strength in depth than many suppose and the capacity to reinforce in January. There are critical matches to come before then, though.

      "bodyText": "Barry Island\u2019s sports and social club is filled to capacity when Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s red bus rolls up the hill, just before midday on Saturday. A dozen hardcore supporters wait outside in the cold for the prospect of a chat or a selfie. Unable to get in, one woman asks a harried local party member, incongruously dressed in a suit and a Santa hat, if he\u2019ll pass on a gift \u201cfor Jeremy \u2013 please\u201d. Whooping breaks out inside as Corbyn enters the room to what is now his public soundtrack, several giddy choruses of \u201cOoohh Jeremy Corbyn\u201d, as one man yells: \u201cYou\u2019re a legend!\u201d Richard, a retired local architect, stands in the road and sticks two fingers up at the Labour leader as the coach passes him. \u201cIt feels good to do that to him,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m giving him the finger because I don\u2019t like the chap. To me, he\u2019s a throwback to Michael Foot and Tony Benn. He\u2019s a dinosaur.\u201d Richard, who declines to give his surname, says he usually votes Conservative but was unsure what to do now as his local MP, Alun Cairns, had \u201cgot himself in a bit of a mess and shot himself in the foot\u201d. Cairns resigned as Welsh secretary last month following a row over how much he knew and when about his former aide\u2019s role in the alleged sabotage of a rape trial. Despite a palpable loss of support, Cairns is standing once again to represent the Vale of Glamorgan, a seat he held under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. But Labour senses an opportunity, and so there is little surprise to find Corbyn on the final Saturday before election day in a zero-waste coffee shop in Barry, where he swaps a jar of blackberry and apple jam from his allotment for Dragon\u2019s Breath jam from Penylan Preservesin Cardiff and has a stab at making a cappuccino. National concerns are ever present: Corbyn, for instance, is asked about the source of documents he brandished earlier in the campaign, which the website Reddit said on Friday night were linked to a Russian interference campaign. Corbyn declined to disclose the source of the papers, which he had argued showed that the US was seeking \u201ctotal market access\u201d after the UK left the EU and therefore undermined Boris Johnson\u2019s claims that the NHS would not be part of any trade talks. There is no suggestion the papers were fake. \u201cWe obtained those documents,\u201d the Labour leader insists in Barry. \u201cWe believed those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday denied the correctness of those documents. The issue is there should be no interference in British politics by anybody else.\u201d Over at the social club, supporters were given a rallying call that ran through the injustices bestowed by the Tories, hammering home statistics on poverty, homelessness and deepening inequality. For people like Christine Linley, a lifelong socialist and retired special needs worker, his message is compelling. About Cairns, she is scathing: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything for Barry.\u201d Linley has lived in the town for 16 years with her partner and is canvassing for the first time, targeting homes around The Triangle where the majority of voters are over 45. \u201cEquality has disappeared,\u201d she says. \u201cThe difference between the very rich areas [in the constituency] and the ordinary has just become ridiculous. People really need a job and a bit of security here; Corbyn is the only hope for us.\u201d This Labour seaside town west of Cardiff is the third largest in Wales and a century ago was the largest coal-exporting port in the world. \u201cNow, forget the high street \u2013 even our charity shops are closing down,\u201d says Linley. In a Londis shop, customers chat to shop assistant Osian Morris, 24, about the excitement up the road. \u201cHe\u2019s epic \u2013 Corbyn is epic,\u201d says Morris, who counts himself as a lifelong Labour supporter, \u201cpretty much\u201d. A researcher who gives her name as Marie chats to Morris about getting out to vote: she has come from Cardiff to campaign and has been on the phones \u201cevery night for the last two weeks in three-hour shifts\u201d trying to convince constituents to vote the Vale red. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a lot of older people on landlines and a lot of them say they used to vote Labour but that they don\u2019t like Corbyn \u2013 and yet when you press them on it, they can\u2019t seem to give a reason why.\u201d The Vale of Glamorgan holds a number of traditionally Conservative wards including the affluent village of Cowbridge. The Vale is a bellwether seat and local candidate Belinda Loveluck-Edwards is praised effusively by Corbyn on stage for her \u201cfantastic energy\u201d in an exhausting campaign. \u201cShe carries the message of decency and social justice,\u201d says Corbyn, reminding the room to \u201cplease take nothing for granted between now and Thursday\u201d. Babies begin to grizzle but their parents roar as Corbyn makes a slapstick swipe at Boris Johnson and insists victory is nigh. \u201cOur Labour government will go into office next week determined to change a lot of things very, very quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not want to live in a country that relies on food banks, debt and handouts for ordinary working people.\u201d After 15 minutes, the crowd gathers for a mass selfie.

Princeton graduate student Xiyue Wang, imprisoned since 2016, was exchanged for Masoud Soleimani, an Iranian scientist arrested at Chicago airport last year and convicted on charges of violating US trade sanctions.

There had been no prior indication he was due to be released, and he was apparently shocked when he was told the news. He initially travelled to Iran to study Farsi and Iranian history.

According to the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker column, the figure is actually an \u201cupper range estimate\u201d for Iranian assets unfrozen under the nuclear deal with Tehran in 2015. On Saturday, the president also thanked Tehran for \u201ca very fair negotiation\u201d and said: \u201cSee, we can make a deal together!\u201d Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iran, accompanied Soleimani to Switzerland to make the exchange and will return with Wang, according to a US official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The swap took place in Zurich and Hook and Wang were en route to Landstuhl in Germany where Wang was to be examined by doctors, the official said. Hook was expected to return to the US from Germany alone, as Wang was expected to be evaluated for several days. Although Hook was present for the swap, the US official said the national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien played the lead role in negotiations dating from his time as special representative for hostage affairs at the state department.

Ironically Britain, with better relations with Iran at least over the JCPOA, is making no progress, at least on the surface, in securing the release of its dual nationals held in Evin prison including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and a retired businessman, Anousheh Ashoori. Both consider themselves hostages captured in a bid to force diplomatic or economic concessions. Other Americans held in Iran include an 81-year-old businessman, Baquer Namazi, who has been held for more than two years and diagnosed with epilepsy. Namazi and his son Siamak Namazi, also a dual national who has been held for more than three years, are serving 10-year sentences after they were convicted of collaborating with a hostile power.

In the history of English top-flight football no team has ever won the title after being 14 points behind the league leaders. Liverpool, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/bournemouth-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">won yet again at Bournemouth</a>, have come to resemble a dot on the horizon.</p> \n<p>For United the emotions were rather different. This was a triumph on many levels, particularly on a tactical front for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, whose fast-breaking approach brought a 2-0 half-time lead, which could, in truth, have been greater.</p> \n<p>Solskj\u00e6r had talked after the encouraging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/04/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">home win over Tottenham</a> on Wednesday about the need for his players to enjoy and express themselves \u2013 it is a prerequisite for those in United shirts, he said \u2013 and how they did so in that opening period, when the lead they built up proved unassailable.

They got that and, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea slipping up at Everton, </a>they could reflect on having closed to within five points of the Champions League places.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5e910711-0880-4306-a1fd-fcb0fda07a2d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cGI9BbMLu14?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was another occasion when United looked good against a high-flying rival, a continuation of the trend that has seen them beat Chelsea, Leicester and Spurs, and draw against Liverpool. Once again they did not have too much possession \u2013 the statistics showed their share to be only 28% \u2013 but it was what they did with it that counted \u2013 how they cut through City in the first half with what Solskj\u00e6r described as \u201cquick, attacking, flowing football\u201d.</p> \n<p>Guardiola said his team had conceded four or five counter-attacks \u2013 no more \u2013 as he sought to play down what had happened. He was also entitled to point out that City had mustered 22 shots to United\u2019s 11, although only five were on target compared with United\u2019s six. City bristled with attacking menace, as they always do, only to routinely lack an end product.</p> \n<p>But they had no answers in defence to United for much of the first half and, as Guardiola ran the gamut of emotions in his technical area, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team threatened with every forward thrust. \u201cWe look like a Man United team,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>United created a fistful of chances in the opening 15 minutes, on the back of slick passing and movement in behind the City defence, and Guardiola could be happy that Ederson\u2019s reflexes were on point. He saved from the excellent Dan James, stuck out a boot to deny Jesse Lingard in a one-on-one and plunged low to keep out an Anthony Martial shot.</p> \n<p>City had a few flickers in the early running, although United got bodies in the way, and a goal for the visitors came to feel increasingly likely. Rashford, inevitably, was at the heart of it, sparking panic inside the City area. City had few answers to his speed and directness and, on this occasion, Bernardo Silva simply crashed into him. There was no action in real time but, when the VAR checks began, it was apparent that it was a penalty. Rashford\u2019s composure from the spot was pronounced.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/dec/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-live\">Manchester City v Manchester United:&nbsp;Premier League \u2013&nbsp;live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The breakthrough was the prompt for City to wobble and United to tighten their grip. Rashford fluffed a glorious chance after yet another rapid counter; he hit the crossbar following another and, when Martial added the second, it was too easy. Together with James, he played through City before beating Ederson at the near post.</p> \n<p>City rallied. Gabriel Jesus missed a gilt-edged diving header, David Silva could not convert a Kevin De Bruyne cross at the far post and Kyle Walker howled for a penalty when his low cross hit Fred\u2019s hand as the United midfielder jumped in to block. \u201cNext season it [VAR] will be better or we\u2019ll be luckier,\u201d Guardiola said.</p> \n<p>City pushed hard in the second half. Victor Lindelof blocked to deny De Bruyne, Aaron Wan-Bissaka got back to tackle Raheem Sterling and Rodri was denied by a David De Gea tip over. Although United retained a threat on the counter, it was City who came to look the likelier scorers of the next goal. Otamendi \u2013 on for the injured John Stones \u2013 got it to set up the grandstand finish and another substitute, Riyad Mahrez, extended De Gea. But United clung on.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/manchester-city-investigate-alleged-racist-abuse-lingard\">Manchester City investigate alleged racist abuse aimed at Jesse Lingard</a> </p> \n</aside>",

They got that and, with Chelsea slipping up at Everton, they could reflect on having closed to within five points of the Champions League places. It was another occasion when United looked good against a high-flying rival, a continuation of the trend that has seen them beat Chelsea, Leicester and Spurs, and draw against Liverpool. Once again they did not have too much possession \u2013 the statistics showed their share to be only 28% \u2013 but it was what they did with it that counted \u2013 how they cut through City in the first half with what Solskj\u00e6r described as \u201cquick, attacking, flowing football\u201d. Guardiola said his team had conceded four or five counter-attacks \u2013 no more \u2013 as he sought to play down what had happened. He was also entitled to point out that City had mustered 22 shots to United\u2019s 11, although only five were on target compared with United\u2019s six. City bristled with attacking menace, as they always do, only to routinely lack an end product. But they had no answers in defence to United for much of the first half and, as Guardiola ran the gamut of emotions in his technical area, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team threatened with every forward thrust. \u201cWe look like a Man United team,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big thing.\u201d United created a fistful of chances in the opening 15 minutes, on the back of slick passing and movement in behind the City defence, and Guardiola could be happy that Ederson\u2019s reflexes were on point. He saved from the excellent Dan James, stuck out a boot to deny Jesse Lingard in a one-on-one and plunged low to keep out an Anthony Martial shot. City had a few flickers in the early running, although United got bodies in the way, and a goal for the visitors came to feel increasingly likely. Rashford, inevitably, was at the heart of it, sparking panic inside the City area. City had few answers to his speed and directness and, on this occasion, Bernardo Silva simply crashed into him. There was no action in real time but, when the VAR checks began, it was apparent that it was a penalty. Rashford\u2019s composure from the spot was pronounced. The breakthrough was the prompt for City to wobble and United to tighten their grip. Rashford fluffed a glorious chance after yet another rapid counter; he hit the crossbar following another and, when Martial added the second, it was too easy. Together with James, he played through City before beating Ederson at the near post. City rallied. Gabriel Jesus missed a gilt-edged diving header, David Silva could not convert a Kevin De Bruyne cross at the far post and Kyle Walker howled for a penalty when his low cross hit Fred\u2019s hand as the United midfielder jumped in to block. \u201cNext season it [VAR] will be better or we\u2019ll be luckier,\u201d Guardiola said. City pushed hard in the second half. Victor Lindelof blocked to deny De Bruyne, Aaron Wan-Bissaka got back to tackle Raheem Sterling and Rodri was denied by a David De Gea tip over. Although United retained a threat on the counter, it was City who came to look the likelier scorers of the next goal. Otamendi \u2013 on for the injured John Stones \u2013 got it to set up the grandstand finish and another substitute, Riyad Mahrez, extended De Gea. But United clung on.",

We will make it a health service to be proud of, where our A&amp;E departments are not crammed with people waiting more than four hours to be seen, and where it is possible to get an appointment with your GP without having to book weeks in advance. Labour will not merely repair the damage done by the Tories; we will expand our health service, with thousands more doctors and nurses, free dental check-ups and free prescriptions in England \u2013 as people have in Wales and Scotland. The American actor Rob Delaney has spoken movingly of the care his son received from the NHS. He called our health service \u201cthe pinnacle of human achievement\u201d and warned us against moving towards the private US system he grew up with. My parents\u2019 generation fought hard to establish a universal health service, owned and run by the public. They left it in our trust. It\u2019s our duty to defend it. On Thursday, you have the chance to do just that. Vote Labour for our NHS.",

Whatever the truth, is there any evidence that such programmes actually work? Not much. Few experts can agree on what deradicalisation means and, as John Horgan, one of the world\u2019s leading researchers in the psychology of terrorism, observes: \u201cThere\u2019s paltry evidence to suggest that people stay out of terrorism because they have been taught to \u2018think different\u2019 about the <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-terrorist-stop-being-a-terrorist-33119\" title=\"\">legitimacy of their views</a>.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s so little consensus about deradicalisation when the idea of radicalisation itself is fraught. Most of the popular explanations about the causes \u2013 from the nature of Islam to western foreign policy \u2013 are <a href=\"https://kenanmalik.com/2015/10/07/radiclization-is-not-so-simple/\" title=\"\">false</a>, while more complex understandings of why some individuals are drawn to jihadist groups are rarely absorbed by politicians. It\u2019s difficult to slay a dragon if you don\u2019t know what a dragon is.</p> <p>What of the argument that certain individuals are so corrupted that they can\u2019t be redeemed, nor should society seek to do so? It is true that those who might indiscriminately bomb cafes or mosques, and whose aim is simply to sow terror, are morally different from burglars or fraudsters. Many jihadists, I have suggested, inhabit a different moral universe, in which they can commit the most inhuman of acts and view them as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/22/islam-terror-morality-paris\" title=\"\">righteous</a>.</p> <p>The possibility of redemption is, however, defined not by the nature of the crime committed but by the fact we are human beings, and moral agents, and as such can change ourselves. It does not mean that everyone is capable of redemption. But neither does it mean that even those who have carried out particularly heinous acts are incapable of change.</p> <p>There is little evidence that deradicalisation programmes work. But to acknowledge the possibility of redemption is the mark of a civilised society. Not to do so would be to take a black-and-white view of human nature uncomfortably close to the worldview of someone such as Usman Khan.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

In Britain, the main programme aimed at \u201cextremist offenders\u201d is the heathy identity intervention (HII). It \u201cencourages and empowers participants to disengage from an extremist group, cause or ideology\u201d and \u201cto \u2018move on\u2019 with their lives, embrace new commitments and feel empowered to \u2018walk away\u2019\u201d. Khan is reported to have taken part in an HII programme, though his solicitor has claimed that he was unable to get \u201cintervention by a deradicaliser\u201d. Whatever the truth, is there any evidence that such programmes actually work? Not much. Few experts can agree on what deradicalisation means and, as John Horgan, one of the world\u2019s leading researchers in the psychology of terrorism, observes: \u201cThere\u2019s paltry evidence to suggest that people stay out of terrorism because they have been taught to \u2018think different\u2019 about the legitimacy of their views.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s so little consensus about deradicalisation when the idea of radicalisation itself is fraught. Most of the popular explanations about the causes \u2013 from the nature of Islam to western foreign policy \u2013 are false, while more complex understandings of why some individuals are drawn to jihadist groups are rarely absorbed by politicians. It\u2019s difficult to slay a dragon if you don\u2019t know what a dragon is. What of the argument that certain individuals are so corrupted that they can\u2019t be redeemed, nor should society seek to do so? It is true that those who might indiscriminately bomb cafes or mosques, and whose aim is simply to sow terror, are morally different from burglars or fraudsters. Many jihadists, I have suggested, inhabit a different moral universe, in which they can commit the most inhuman of acts and view them as righteous. The possibility of redemption is, however, defined not by the nature of the crime committed but by the fact we are human beings, and moral agents, and as such can change ourselves. It does not mean that everyone is capable of redemption. But neither does it mean that even those who have carried out particularly heinous acts are incapable of change. There is little evidence that deradicalisation programmes work. But to acknowledge the possibility of redemption is the mark of a civilised society. Not to do so would be to take a black-and-white view of human nature uncomfortably close to the worldview of someone such as Usman Khan. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

Such storms were a feature of deadly fires in Victoria in 2009, and the Canberra fires in 2003.</p> <p>\u201cThe climate is changing and we are getting more extreme fire behaviour as a result as the atmosphere is hotter and more unstable,\u201d Dr Simon Heemstra, a fire behaviour expert from the RFS, told the inquiry.</p> <p>The coroner also heard from farmers about what they felt was poor communication from the RFS, poor decisions, lack of resources and their sense of \u201cisolation\u201d as they stared down walls of fire.</p> <p>The group of former emergency chiefs has called for a parliamentary inquiry into whether emergency services including the RFS \u2013 made up of 70,000 volunteers and about 1,000 paid staff \u2013 are adequately resourced to respond to the growing threat.</p> <p>Ken Thompson, a former deputy commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW and representative of the Australian Firefighters Climate Alliance, says Australia is seeing longer fire seasons, which overlap with those in the northern hemisphere.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think our firefighting system was ever designed for the scale and magnitude of events that we\u2019re seeing at the moment \u2013 that goes for all agencies involved in firefighting and land management,\u201d Thompson said.</p> <p>\u201cThe world has changed, the climate has changed, but we\u2019re in an old paradigm \u2013 these fires are burning hotter and faster.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Eglinton, those broader concerns are not the immediate focus for the crew returning from the blaze near Sofala, an old gold-mining village.</p> <p>Faces and hands black with soot, their eyes drooping with exhaustion, they are frustrated \u2013 after seven hours of work they have not been able to control a fire burning in extremely challenging countryside.</p> <p>Tanya Willey, a deputy captain, wipes ash from the bridge of her nose as she describes her responsibility to protect the brigade.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always that fear that when you go to things like this that you\u2019re not going to come home, and you try your hardest to come home, and all together.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b28fe453bc7e5830b1e0fcb40947de4adb69f87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b28fe453bc7e5830b1e0fcb40947de4adb69f87/0_57_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanya Willey sits in Eglinton RFS station after seven hours at a bushfire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanya Willey sits in Eglinton RFS station after seven hours at a bushfire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Gardiner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Willey describes herself as a former army wife, having spent years moving with her family to wherever her husband was stationed.</p> <p>He left the army after serving in Afghanistan and they moved to the country to be closer to family.</p> <p>\u201cWe swapped uniforms.

He said, \u2018I can\u2019t, it\u2019s got no fuel\u2019. \u201cSomeone yelled out \u2018Have you got a bottle of scotch?\u2019. So he tipped some scotch in and fired it up and that was the only thing that was saved. \u201cIt was a 1950 Cadillac. I\u2019ve never forgotten that.\u201d The Eglinton brigade is made up of men and women of all ages. There are mechanics, bakers, an accountant, a university student, and many are parents to young children. Locals have decorated a shrub outside the station, a printed sign saying: \u201cThank you to our fireys\u201d. Recently neighbours have delivered homemade cakes to show their gratitude. That sentiment stretches across drought-stricken NSW, amid a fierce bushfire season that started weeks before summer began. Catastrophic conditions \u2013 the worst possible fire weather \u2013 were declared during a heatwave in November and almost 600 schools were closed in eastern parts of the state. Six people have died, hundreds of homes have been destroyed. Enormous fires burn across NSW into December and millions of people in cities and towns have been breathing smoky, polluted air for weeks. The conditions are playing out just as fire and weather experts feared. Earlier this year, 23 former fire and emergency chiefs from around Australia called for stronger action on climate change, predicting longer fire seasons and more frequent catastrophic fire conditions. In late October, deputy state coroner Carmel Forbes handed down her findings into a fire near Dunedoo, east of Dubbo, which burnt through 55,000 hectares, destroyed 35 homes, and killed thousands of animals in February 2017. The inquiry was requested by the RFS to help people understand the incredible danger posed by catastrophic conditions, in which no home is designed to withstand the aggressive, uncontrollable fires fanned by extremely hot and dry weather. The findings described how pyro-convective columns, which can trigger \u201cfire storms\u201d, were once rare but are now more frequent. Such storms were a feature of deadly fires in Victoria in 2009, and the Canberra fires in 2003. \u201cThe climate is changing and we are getting more extreme fire behaviour as a result as the atmosphere is hotter and more unstable,\u201d Dr Simon Heemstra, a fire behaviour expert from the RFS, told the inquiry. The coroner also heard from farmers about what they felt was poor communication from the RFS, poor decisions, lack of resources and their sense of \u201cisolation\u201d as they stared down walls of fire. The group of former emergency chiefs has called for a parliamentary inquiry into whether emergency services including the RFS \u2013 made up of 70,000 volunteers and about 1,000 paid staff \u2013 are adequately resourced to respond to the growing threat. Ken Thompson, a former deputy commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW and representative of the Australian Firefighters Climate Alliance, says Australia is seeing longer fire seasons, which overlap with those in the northern hemisphere. \u201cI don\u2019t think our firefighting system was ever designed for the scale and magnitude of events that we\u2019re seeing at the moment \u2013 that goes for all agencies involved in firefighting and land management,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe world has changed, the climate has changed, but we\u2019re in an old paradigm \u2013 these fires are burning hotter and faster.\u201d Back in Eglinton, those broader concerns are not the immediate focus for the crew returning from the blaze near Sofala, an old gold-mining village. Faces and hands black with soot, their eyes drooping with exhaustion, they are frustrated \u2013 after seven hours of work they have not been able to control a fire burning in extremely challenging countryside. Tanya Willey, a deputy captain, wipes ash from the bridge of her nose as she describes her responsibility to protect the brigade. \u201cThere\u2019s always that fear that when you go to things like this that you\u2019re not going to come home, and you try your hardest to come home, and all together.\u201d Willey describes herself as a former army wife, having spent years moving with her family to wherever her husband was stationed. He left the army after serving in Afghanistan and they moved to the country to be closer to family. \u201cWe swapped uniforms. He got out of his and I jumped into this one,\u201d she says. Willey is quick to smile and cracks jokes. She bids farewell to a colleague with a trill: \u201cBye Benny!\u201d But the enormity of her work is clear. Willey reflects on what it\u2019s like when her fire pager goes off, and how she scrambles to organise her family and her dogs. \u201cHave I locked my front door?\u201d she sometimes wonders in the truck. The youngest of her two daughters hasn\u2019t always been thrilled about her mum fighting fires. \u201cI guess because daddy was always away in his uniform and she\u2019d always look at me in uniform and get a bit upset because I\u2019d have to go,\u201d Willey says. \u201cBut they\u2019re talking about it at school now, the fires are such a big topic. My daughter has changed her tune a little bit.\u201d She says it\u2019s worth it. \u201cWe had a lady turn up and she was thanking us for what we do \u2026 and she got teary and I got teary and that reminds you why you do what you do. \u201cThere\u2019s no ego in it, you\u2019re just helping.\u201d Every crew member uses the word \u201cfamily\u201d to describe their group. They all speak of camaraderie. Many say they found their sense of purpose through the RFS. They say they\u2019ve stuck together through deaths, heartbreak, and difficult scenes like fatal car accidents they cannot bring themselves to describe. They celebrate too, getting together for beers or a barbecue on weekends, and organising a village Christmas party featuring Santa on a 1930s-era fire truck. Steve Plummer, a mechanic, is one of the last to leave the station. He is a senior deputy captain, a rank he says he had no ambition for: \u201cI was happy to just turn up, get on a truck, put wet stuff on the red stuff and that would have been good, but it turns out I\u2019ve got a knack for it.\u201d Plummer grew up in Kurri Kurri, in the Hunter region, and spent his childhood exploring bushland with mates, making slingshots, and climbing in mine shafts. He always wanted to be a police officer, a dream that only intensified when he had his own minor run-in as a teenager. \u201cI used my slingshot to break a streetlight. I was 16 and [the police] scared the beejeebies out of me. \u201cI never got charged or anything, but they took me around the block a few times and took me to the station. \u201cThat was enough to scare me off doing anything like that. It could have gone the other way. I could have been on the other side of the ledger.\u201d Plummer says he was diverted from policing when he took up his trade. But he\u2019s now getting what he hoped for \u2013 a sense of service mixed with adventure \u2013 when he pulls on his yellow and navy RFS uniform. \u201cThese guys, you\u2019re on the frontline with them, and they understand how you feel and we all lean on each other. \u201cIf one\u2019s feeling down, the others will pick them up.\u201d As night falls the doors are pulled shut and the trucks sit ready to go for whatever the morning brings.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Zuckerberg is facing calls to appear before Australia\u2019s parliament and explain how Facebook failed to detect and stop a massive global disinformation network from spreading hate and influencing voters over a two-year period. The Senate this week set up a new inquiry to examine why Facebook and other social media giants have failed to stop clandestine actors using their platforms to spread falsehoods and undermine democracy. The inquiry was established a day before the Guardian revealed that an Israel-based group had penetrated 21 far right Facebook pages across the world, and were using them as vehicles to spread huge volumes of coordinated disinformation that promoted far right politicians and vilified Muslims. Following the Guardian\u2019s revelations on Friday, the chair of the inquiry, Labor MP Jenny McAllister, said \u201cmalign actors\u201d must be stopped from using covert and deceptive means to spread disinformation on social media platforms. \u201cWe all must continue to manage these threats and maintain confidence in our democracy and its institutions,\u201d she told the Guardian. McAllister earlier said it would be in the interests of social media giants to give evidence to the inquiry and that \u201cI think Australians will expect to hear from them\u201d. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi was one of those targeted by the 21-page network last year, when it incited attacks on her from more than 500,000 followers. Faruqi said Zuckerberg must be called to explain why his platform had failed so comprehensively. \u201cI\u2019ll be asking the select committee on foreign interference through social media to invite Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook executives to give evidence,\u201d Faruqi told the Guardian. \u201cThe Guardian investigation\u2019s findings are terrifying because of what they mean for my safety, but also their implications for our democracy.

Every sentence they speak to me starts off with them singing the first lines too. It was very cute, then annoying. But it does make me reflect on what a doozy the change in our environment has been this year.</p> <p>This time last year, we were harvesting on average 400kg of bamboo shoots. We grew four different varieties on the farm, despite the drought conditions of the previous winter. This year, any shoots that tried to emerge from the soil have shrivelled and died back. As the drought worsens, we will not be harvesting any at all this season.</p> <p>I miss those bamboo shoots very much; they are completely a different taste experience to the canned sort. A fresh bamboo shoot is not only a textural wonder, akin to tender palm hearts, it has a faint scent reminiscent of hay and young corn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/01/the-delightful-squash-is-nomadic-prolific-adaptive-and-lush-and-then-it-carks-it\">The delightful squash is nomadic, prolific, adaptive and lush \u2013 and then it carks it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My very favourite variety, the nastus elatus, originates from Papua New Guinea and is referred to colloquially as sweet bamboo. This variety is one of the few that can be eaten raw, due to their lack of cyanogenic glycosides which makes most uncooked bamboo varieties bitter.</p> <p>Should you stumble across fresh shoots that aren\u2019t nastus elatus, don\u2019t let the effort of cooking out the bitterness deter you from buying them.</p> <p>Cooking them involves shredding the shoot, then boiling it, steeping it, changing the water and repeating the process (sometimes multiple times) until all the bitterness has seeped away.</p> <p>But they are worth every bit of hard yakka, and one shoot will yield you multiple meals.</p> <p>The significance of bamboo shoots touches my heart. They\u2019re a common food source all throughout Asia, generally harvested in the beginning of spring, which is also when an abundance of other crops come into production.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The act of harvesting this grass is a poetic meditation on gentleness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I often ponder what made humans think that this shoot emerging from the ground was a desirable food source. Was it subsistence after a hard winter? Was it the animals burrowing down to gnaw at the shoots which made the humans notice?</p> <p>Incidentally bamboo shoots are best harvested by carefully digging around the underexposed culm beneath the ground, just as the tips start to poke through the forest floor mulch. They are sweetest before the shoot is exposed to sunlight or air, and contain less cyanogenic glycosides. The act of harvesting this grass is a poetic meditation on gentleness.</p> <p>Bamboo is also symbolic of strength, resilience, humility, prosperity and grace. The Japanese proverb says \u201ca bamboo that bends is stronger than the oak that resists\u201d. The Chinese still to this day use it as scaffolding to build skyscrapers. Perhaps by consuming it, our ancestors thought we might absorb some of its powers.</p> <p>In Japanese, the literal translation for the word bamboo shoot \u201ctakenoko\u201d is \u201cbamboo child\u201d. Bamboo appears in many traditional stories. The best-known is The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, thought to be the oldest narrative literature in Kana script. It\u2019s about a bamboo child-princess found by a barren couple in the forest, and the story forms the basis of the Studio Ghibli film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/22/tale-of-princess-kaguya-review-kermode\">The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</a>.</p> <p>My lovely and talented friend, the aesthete chef Shinobu Namae-san of L\u2019effervescence and Bricolage in Tokyo, created this gut-wrenchingly beautiful dish (pictured below) symbolising the transition from winter to spring, with white Chinese cabbage representing winter, and bamboo shoots spring. The vegetables were linked by wakame seaweed, which is ever-present between late winter and early spring. Exquisite, yes?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92c1089bb3165f3b35962f79d6368184287f90a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92c1089bb3165f3b35962f79d6368184287f90a3/0_1328_3744_3477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shinobu Namae-san\u2019s bamboo shoot, white cabbage and wakame dish\" width=\"1000\" height=\"929\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shinobu Namae-san\u2019s bamboo shoot, white cabbage and wakame dish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shinobu Namae</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bamboo plays an important part in so many cultures.

      "bodyText": "In our household, thanks to the movie Last Christmas, the Wham song of the same name has been blasted on repeat by my children. Every sentence they speak to me starts off with them singing the first lines too. It was very cute, then annoying. But it does make me reflect on what a doozy the change in our environment has been this year. This time last year, we were harvesting on average 400kg of bamboo shoots. We grew four different varieties on the farm, despite the drought conditions of the previous winter. This year, any shoots that tried to emerge from the soil have shrivelled and died back. As the drought worsens, we will not be harvesting any at all this season. I miss those bamboo shoots very much; they are completely a different taste experience to the canned sort. A fresh bamboo shoot is not only a textural wonder, akin to tender palm hearts, it has a faint scent reminiscent of hay and young corn. My very favourite variety, the nastus elatus, originates from Papua New Guinea and is referred to colloquially as sweet bamboo. This variety is one of the few that can be eaten raw, due to their lack of cyanogenic glycosides which makes most uncooked bamboo varieties bitter. Should you stumble across fresh shoots that aren\u2019t nastus elatus, don\u2019t let the effort of cooking out the bitterness deter you from buying them. Cooking them involves shredding the shoot, then boiling it, steeping it, changing the water and repeating the process (sometimes multiple times) until all the bitterness has seeped away. But they are worth every bit of hard yakka, and one shoot will yield you multiple meals. The significance of bamboo shoots touches my heart. They\u2019re a common food source all throughout Asia, generally harvested in the beginning of spring, which is also when an abundance of other crops come into production. I often ponder what made humans think that this shoot emerging from the ground was a desirable food source. Was it subsistence after a hard winter? Was it the animals burrowing down to gnaw at the shoots which made the humans notice? Incidentally bamboo shoots are best harvested by carefully digging around the underexposed culm beneath the ground, just as the tips start to poke through the forest floor mulch. They are sweetest before the shoot is exposed to sunlight or air, and contain less cyanogenic glycosides. The act of harvesting this grass is a poetic meditation on gentleness. Bamboo is also symbolic of strength, resilience, humility, prosperity and grace. The Japanese proverb says \u201ca bamboo that bends is stronger than the oak that resists\u201d. The Chinese still to this day use it as scaffolding to build skyscrapers. Perhaps by consuming it, our ancestors thought we might absorb some of its powers. In Japanese, the literal translation for the word bamboo shoot \u201ctakenoko\u201d is \u201cbamboo child\u201d. Bamboo appears in many traditional stories. The best-known is The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, thought to be the oldest narrative literature in Kana script. It\u2019s about a bamboo child-princess found by a barren couple in the forest, and the story forms the basis of the Studio Ghibli film The Tale of the Princess Kaguya. My lovely and talented friend, the aesthete chef Shinobu Namae-san of L\u2019effervescence and Bricolage in Tokyo, created this gut-wrenchingly beautiful dish (pictured below) symbolising the transition from winter to spring, with white Chinese cabbage representing winter, and bamboo shoots spring. The vegetables were linked by wakame seaweed, which is ever-present between late winter and early spring. Exquisite, yes? Bamboo plays an important part in so many cultures. That\u2019s why seeing this evergreen grass, seemingly an indestructible crop, losing its leaves this year is alarming. In my subtropical climate on the eastern seaboard of Australia I have never witnessed something like this before. I hope they have fared better in the other parts of Australia. I will keep a keen eye out for them at markets. It\u2019s human nature to want the unattainable. This year all I seem to want (to eat) for Christmas are bamboo shoots. Bamboo shoot, pork and prawn wontons 1 packet wonton wrappers 700g organic ground pork 30% fat 300g raw king prawns, shelled and roughly chopped 300g bamboo shoots, roughly chopped 150g black wood ear mushrooms, if dried then soaked and fine sliced 1 organic egg beaten 1 head of organic garlic, minced 40g fresh organic ginger, grated 2 coriander roots, pounded to a fine paste 2 tbs best quality sesame oil 2 tbs best quality light soy sauce 1 tsp sea salt 1 tsp ground white pepper Mix all ingredients well, except the wonton wrappers! Then chill for an hour or more. Once chilled, place a wonton wrapper in your hand and, using a teaspoon, scoop the filling into the middle of the wrapper. Fold the wonton edges to meet in a triangle, pinch and fold again. In a pot of boiling water, gently place the wontons and cook for approximately four minutes or until they float to the top. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well. For the dressing: 3 stalks spring onions (cut off the roots and replant into a pot on your window sill or better yet into a garden). Finely slice the whole stem, green and white parts 2 tbs sesame oil 2 tbs light soy sauce 3 tbs Chinese red rice vinegar 2 tbs chilli oil 2 tbs shallot oil Whisk together all the ingredients above, excluding the spring onions. Serve on a platter with the dressing poured over and scatter the spring onions. I would recommend 4-6 wontons per person as a starter.",

The investment fund is still looking for the cash to fund the full scope of its contracted property purchases, but talks about investing $1.6bn in the area and creating more than 10,000 jobs \u2013 triple the local population.</p> <p>Documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the purchases are staggered to settle at various times over the next nine months. But the plan also requires a steady stream of investors, and Mayfair is still in the process of attempting to drum up interest. There are emerging signs that the reality may not match the vision Mawhinney announced when he first arrived, or the hype generated by the billboards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/28/concern-over-ad-blitz-for-high-end-investment-fund-buying-into-island-resort\">newspaper ads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmqvZ-SE7nE\">glamorous parties</a> that have followed.</p> <p>The largest single proposed property purchase, the Elandra resort at the far south of the beach, had been slated to be sold to Mayfair for $5.5m, to settle in February next year. It was<a href=\"https://www.commercialrealestate.com.au/property/23-explorers-drive-south-mission-beach-qld-4852-2015243863\"> quietly placed back on the market</a> this week.</p> <h2><strong>The rush for the exit</strong></h2> <p>Mission Beach is actually four villages \u2013 South Mission Beach, Wongaling Beach, North Mission Beach and Bingil Bay \u2013 spread among dense tropical bush that in places touches the shore, one of the few places in the world where two world heritage sites meet: the rainforest and the reef.</p> <p>Up and down the long stretches of beach, faded for sale signs are now mostly covered by sold stickers. More than a dozen sellers spoke to Guardian Australia. Some say their properties had been on the market for years, unable to realise the investments made since 2006 and 2007, when prices last spiked.</p> <p>There is now a rush to leave town as properties begin to settle. Rob O\u2019Neill, one half of the town\u2019s only removals crew, moved up from Lightning Ridge a few months ago. He told Guardian Australia he was now booked solid until March as people move out.</p> <p>Sellers recall being given little information by real estate agents, just that there was a cash buyer, and to come into the office to sign paperwork. In most cases that the Guardian has seen, the terms gave Mayfair\u2019s companies a 90-day due diligence period, with a deposit due at the conclusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"267ef73d245462c0553d2e7ae5575555a6c9378c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/267ef73d245462c0553d2e7ae5575555a6c9378c/0_217_2220_1332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sold sign on a property at Mission Beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mission Beach is full of houses with \u2018sold\u2019 signs in the front yard</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chaotic attempts to scrutinise and process more than 200 real estate transactions seemed at times to overwhelm the local real estate offices. In some cases, Mayfair asked for extensions to the due diligence period. Some were granted; in others the seller backed out.</p> <p>One seller tells Guardian Australia that Mayfair decided not to buy his property before the 90-day deadline had expired.</p> <p>\u201cThey just seemed to go in so fast, then we heard absolutely nothing until right before the 90 days. My place is not on the beach, so it was probably well down the list of their priorities. They went from \u2018yep, we\u2019ll buy it sight unseen\u2019 to just dropping out like that,\u201d the resident says.</p> <p>\u201cLook at it this way, if I thought they would succeed in their grand plans, then I\u2019d have kept my house and watched the value go up, wouldn\u2019t I? A lot of people were desperate because the market has been so way down in the doldrums. Everyone saw that this was money the market wasn\u2019t willing to pay and thought \u2018right, it\u2019s time to get out of here\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Mawhinney says some of the sales had fallen through and acknowledged that the significant number of purchases had in some cases delayed pre-purchase checks.</p> <p>\u201cSince initial contracts were signed, certain properties have had additional environmental and zoning due diligence undertaken,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result of this process, which is standard for all major property transactions, various properties have not passed due-diligence checks and the group has decided against proceeding with these purchases.</p> <p>\u201cMayfair 101 continues to settle on the properties it has contracted to purchase using its own resources, whilst fielding interest from a number of family offices, non-bank financiers and local and international investment groups who have all expressed interest in co-investing.\u201d</p> <p>Mawhinney says the Elandra resort purchase had fallen through during due diligence, but that he was optimistic a new contract could be negotiated.</p> <h2><strong>Fault lines deepen</strong></h2> <p>Long before Mawhinney and Mayfair came to town, Mission Beach was split along well-established fault lines dividing local environmentalists and business owners with competing visions. The property splurge created another fracture, between those eager for grand plans to go ahead and those who see a risk that Mission Beach could be left worse off.</p> <p>\u201cThe scepticism would be the same in any small town,\u201d says Nancy Lowe, who runs a dive boat and water taxi that used to ferry people to Dunk Island before cyclone Yasi. \u201cWhen something this big happens to such a small town everyone\u2019s always going to be wary and a little bit nervous, but the hope of something amazing happening is really strong.\u201d</p> <p>Lowe is the president of local industry group Tropical Coast Tourism. At its annual general meeting on Monday night, Mayfair Iconic Property\u2019s man in Mission Beach, Stuart Duplock, was voted in as vice president.</p> <p>Lowe says Mayfair has engaged with the local community better than any other developer who has shown an interest in Mission Beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3581181281b6ba939edb0b7f7b5d95db65ac377\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3581181281b6ba939edb0b7f7b5d95db65ac377/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Lowe outside her business\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nancy Lowe, Mission Beach boat operator and the president of Tropical Coast Tourism, outside her business.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think (the skepticism) is changing now properties have gone through completely,\u201d Lowe says.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re realists, of course every block of land that has been developed around here there\u2019s risk. But that\u2019s the whole reason they\u2019ve bought the land on Mission Beach, to negate the higher risk on Dunk Island by investing somewhere else. No other company has had the level of intelligence to do that.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get a six star resort, but we\u2019re never going to be Palm Cove, we\u2019re never going to be Noosa or Port Douglas. When (Christopher) Skase came into Port Douglas there weren\u2019t any rules. We back on to world heritage. There\u2019s maximum build heights. Mayfair understand that Mission Beach has to retain its sleepy seaside village atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cYou only need to look at what Hayman and Hamilton islands have done for Airlie Beach and you can only hope that something similar happen (with Dunk Island and Mission Beach).\u201d</p> <p>A business owner in the main street told Guardian Australia that most of his customers were still uneasy. He didn\u2019t want to be named because \u201cit\u2019s a small town and I don\u2019t want to rain on people\u2019s property sales\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people are counting on it, but a lot of people have been trying to sell their properties for a long time. To them, a buyer is a buyer and good luck to them.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who come in here, everyone talks about it, on balance there\u2019s pessimism. A lot of people think it\u2019s pie in the sky and yeah we think there\u2019s a risk that Mission Beach is left worse off if they buy up half the town and everything grinds to a halt before Dunk Island gets built.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the people here they might want to see Mission Beach go ahead, but we\u2019d be mad not to look at something that seems too good to be true, and not question whether it is.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What Mission Beach is all about</strong></h2> <p>Mission Beach has long been a hub for conservation work in the far north; the poet Judith Wright, John Busst and Len Webb first <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/environment-institute/blog/we-can-save-the-great-barrier-reef-because-we-did-it-once-before/\">campaigned to save the Great Barrier Reef from mining</a> from a home in Bingil Bay. The first reef day tours launched from the Perry Harvey jetty, providing access to nearby coral sites in the days before faster boats could leave from larger ports.</p> <p>\u201cMy biggest concern is that when you have these developments it brings in people with different expectations of how you live,\u201d says Peter Rowles, the president of the Community for Coastal and Cassowary Conservation</p> <p>\u201cThere are many of us who live here because we like the lifestyle, we like the place. If you live in a place you can either live with your environment or you can draw territories \u2013 where this is our place and that\u2019s the environment out there. We live here because we want to live with our environment.\u201d</p> <p>Rowles says the local cassowary population has been put at increased risk in recent years, as traffic on local roads increases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1e65ab4f2d025199a73d7be1a8539502e152126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1e65ab4f2d025199a73d7be1a8539502e152126/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Gallie, artist and cassowary conservationist, at Bingil Bay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mission Beach magic\u2019.

That\u2019s what Mission Beach is all about.\u201d</p> <p>Gallie said many people had been jolted by Mayfair\u2019s proposals and public comments about wanting to make Mission Beach a mass tourism destination.</p> <p>\u201cPlaces can change incrementally and one day you go, \u2018it\u2019s not like it used to be, we\u2019ve lost the magic\u2019. But this was thrown out in front of us as one grand plan. The lack of subtlety is a huge thing. It\u2019s made people go \u2018we really like it like this, that\u2019s the reason we came here\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this little tiny place that\u2019s different to everywhere else, it\u2019s lush, it\u2019s got that important cassowary population, it\u2019s got the beaches, it\u2019s got the rainforest coming down, it\u2019s got that overwhelming beauty. It\u2019s called magic.</p> <p>\u201cPeople know it when they see one of those days, the Mission Beach magic. That\u2019s the point of difference that we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p>",

Documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the purchases are staggered to settle at various times over the next nine months. But the plan also requires a steady stream of investors, and Mayfair is still in the process of attempting to drum up interest. There are emerging signs that the reality may not match the vision Mawhinney announced when he first arrived, or the hype generated by the billboards, newspaper ads and glamorous parties that have followed. The largest single proposed property purchase, the Elandra resort at the far south of the beach, had been slated to be sold to Mayfair for $5.5m, to settle in February next year. It was quietly placed back on the market this week. The rush for the exit Mission Beach is actually four villages \u2013 South Mission Beach, Wongaling Beach, North Mission Beach and Bingil Bay \u2013 spread among dense tropical bush that in places touches the shore, one of the few places in the world where two world heritage sites meet: the rainforest and the reef. Up and down the long stretches of beach, faded for sale signs are now mostly covered by sold stickers. More than a dozen sellers spoke to Guardian Australia. Some say their properties had been on the market for years, unable to realise the investments made since 2006 and 2007, when prices last spiked. There is now a rush to leave town as properties begin to settle. Rob O\u2019Neill, one half of the town\u2019s only removals crew, moved up from Lightning Ridge a few months ago. He told Guardian Australia he was now booked solid until March as people move out. Sellers recall being given little information by real estate agents, just that there was a cash buyer, and to come into the office to sign paperwork. In most cases that the Guardian has seen, the terms gave Mayfair\u2019s companies a 90-day due diligence period, with a deposit due at the conclusion. The chaotic attempts to scrutinise and process more than 200 real estate transactions seemed at times to overwhelm the local real estate offices. In some cases, Mayfair asked for extensions to the due diligence period. Some were granted; in others the seller backed out. One seller tells Guardian Australia that Mayfair decided not to buy his property before the 90-day deadline had expired. \u201cThey just seemed to go in so fast, then we heard absolutely nothing until right before the 90 days. My place is not on the beach, so it was probably well down the list of their priorities. They went from \u2018yep, we\u2019ll buy it sight unseen\u2019 to just dropping out like that,\u201d the resident says. \u201cLook at it this way, if I thought they would succeed in their grand plans, then I\u2019d have kept my house and watched the value go up, wouldn\u2019t I? A lot of people were desperate because the market has been so way down in the doldrums. Everyone saw that this was money the market wasn\u2019t willing to pay and thought \u2018right, it\u2019s time to get out of here\u2019.\u201d Mawhinney says some of the sales had fallen through and acknowledged that the significant number of purchases had in some cases delayed pre-purchase checks. \u201cSince initial contracts were signed, certain properties have had additional environmental and zoning due diligence undertaken,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a result of this process, which is standard for all major property transactions, various properties have not passed due-diligence checks and the group has decided against proceeding with these purchases. \u201cMayfair 101 continues to settle on the properties it has contracted to purchase using its own resources, whilst fielding interest from a number of family offices, non-bank financiers and local and international investment groups who have all expressed interest in co-investing.\u201d Mawhinney says the Elandra resort purchase had fallen through during due diligence, but that he was optimistic a new contract could be negotiated. Fault lines deepen Long before Mawhinney and Mayfair came to town, Mission Beach was split along well-established fault lines dividing local environmentalists and business owners with competing visions. The property splurge created another fracture, between those eager for grand plans to go ahead and those who see a risk that Mission Beach could be left worse off. \u201cThe scepticism would be the same in any small town,\u201d says Nancy Lowe, who runs a dive boat and water taxi that used to ferry people to Dunk Island before cyclone Yasi. \u201cWhen something this big happens to such a small town everyone\u2019s always going to be wary and a little bit nervous, but the hope of something amazing happening is really strong.\u201d Lowe is the president of local industry group Tropical Coast Tourism. At its annual general meeting on Monday night, Mayfair Iconic Property\u2019s man in Mission Beach, Stuart Duplock, was voted in as vice president. Lowe says Mayfair has engaged with the local community better than any other developer who has shown an interest in Mission Beach. \u201cI think (the skepticism) is changing now properties have gone through completely,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe\u2019re realists, of course every block of land that has been developed around here there\u2019s risk. But that\u2019s the whole reason they\u2019ve bought the land on Mission Beach, to negate the higher risk on Dunk Island by investing somewhere else. No other company has had the level of intelligence to do that. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get a six star resort, but we\u2019re never going to be Palm Cove, we\u2019re never going to be Noosa or Port Douglas. When (Christopher) Skase came into Port Douglas there weren\u2019t any rules. We back on to world heritage. There\u2019s maximum build heights. Mayfair understand that Mission Beach has to retain its sleepy seaside village atmosphere. \u201cYou only need to look at what Hayman and Hamilton islands have done for Airlie Beach and you can only hope that something similar happen (with Dunk Island and Mission Beach).\u201d A business owner in the main street told Guardian Australia that most of his customers were still uneasy. He didn\u2019t want to be named because \u201cit\u2019s a small town and I don\u2019t want to rain on people\u2019s property sales\u201d. \u201cA lot of people are counting on it, but a lot of people have been trying to sell their properties for a long time. To them, a buyer is a buyer and good luck to them. \u201cThe people who come in here, everyone talks about it, on balance there\u2019s pessimism. A lot of people think it\u2019s pie in the sky and yeah we think there\u2019s a risk that Mission Beach is left worse off if they buy up half the town and everything grinds to a halt before Dunk Island gets built. \u201cMost of the people here they might want to see Mission Beach go ahead, but we\u2019d be mad not to look at something that seems too good to be true, and not question whether it is.\u201d What Mission Beach is all about Mission Beach has long been a hub for conservation work in the far north; the poet Judith Wright, John Busst and Len Webb first campaigned to save the Great Barrier Reef from mining from a home in Bingil Bay. The first reef day tours launched from the Perry Harvey jetty, providing access to nearby coral sites in the days before faster boats could leave from larger ports. \u201cMy biggest concern is that when you have these developments it brings in people with different expectations of how you live,\u201d says Peter Rowles, the president of the Community for Coastal and Cassowary Conservation \u201cThere are many of us who live here because we like the lifestyle, we like the place. If you live in a place you can either live with your environment or you can draw territories \u2013 where this is our place and that\u2019s the environment out there. We live here because we want to live with our environment.\u201d Rowles says the local cassowary population has been put at increased risk in recent years, as traffic on local roads increases. Mahwinney insists Mayfair will frame any development plans around input from the community and traditional owners, and that it wants to \u201cprotect the natural beauty\u201d of the area and populations of important local species like the cassowary. \u201cThe group is mindful of ensuring its development plans are in keeping with the natural, pristine beauty of the region whilst achieving our vision to make the area an Australian tourism mecca,\u201d he says. Liz Gallie, an artist and cassowary conservationist, says the natural world has always been an integrated part of the local community, rather than just a backdrop. \u201cThe rainforest doesn\u2019t get tired like built environment does,\u201d Galle says. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we embrace that? \u201cThe rainforest should be a block, you should be able to walk through it and then have this experience at the beach of coming out into another world. That\u2019s what Mission Beach is all about.\u201d Gallie said many people had been jolted by Mayfair\u2019s proposals and public comments about wanting to make Mission Beach a mass tourism destination. \u201cPlaces can change incrementally and one day you go, \u2018it\u2019s not like it used to be, we\u2019ve lost the magic\u2019. But this was thrown out in front of us as one grand plan. The lack of subtlety is a huge thing. It\u2019s made people go \u2018we really like it like this, that\u2019s the reason we came here\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s this little tiny place that\u2019s different to everywhere else, it\u2019s lush, it\u2019s got that important cassowary population, it\u2019s got the beaches, it\u2019s got the rainforest coming down, it\u2019s got that overwhelming beauty. It\u2019s called magic. \u201cPeople know it when they see one of those days, the Mission Beach magic. That\u2019s the point of difference that we\u2019ve got.\u201d",

And the 2019 CIVICUS Monitor, a global research collaboration that tracks fundamental freedoms in 196 countries, has downgraded Australia from an \u201copen\u201d country to one where civil space has \u201cnarrowed\u201d, citing new laws to expand government surveillance, prosecution of whistleblowers, and raids on media organisations. Human rights organisations have again argued Australia needs a bill of rights to prevent government repression of fundamental human rights. The CIVICUS Monitor assesses freedoms such as association, peaceful assembly and expression, categorising countries as closed, repressed, obstructed, narrowed or open. Its report, People Power Under Attack, says across Asia those freedoms are being quietly eroded, or explicitly repressed, in almost every country. Of 25 countries in the region, four are rated as closed, eight repressed and 10 obstructed. Civic space in South Korea and Japan is rated as narrowed, while Taiwan is the only country rated open. \u201cOur research shows that there continues to be a regression of civic space for activism across the region,\u201d CIVICUS researcher Josef Benedict said. \u201cThe percentage of people living in Asian countries with closed, repressed or obstructed civic space is now at 95%.\u201d Across Asia, countries were increasingly censoring the media and free speech, and using new laws to stifle political rights such as the right to protest or to criticise the government.

In Nauru, where judges have been sacked for decisions the government doesn\u2019t like, critics of the government are subjected to politicised show trials and denied access to lawyers. But CIVICUS said \u201cthe most alarming deterioration in civic space [across the Pacific] is occurring in Australia, which has been downgraded from \u2018open\u2019 to \u2018narrowed\u2019\u201d.

But plummeting air quality levels are a regular occurrence in cities in India, Latin America and China. Here, residents and experts from Delhi, Beijing and Mexico City explain how they survive the smog.</p> <h2>Delhi</h2> <p>\u201cMy advice? Stay indoors, lock all the windows and put an air purifier in every corner of your house,\u201d said Rachna, 31, a resident of south Delhi. \u201cWhat you lose in electricity bills, you gain in extra years of your life.\u201d</p> <p>Severe pollution has become an annual event in Delhi in October and November and as the thick brown smog shrouds the city, it is met with an almost obsessive compulsion by residents to check and discuss the air quality index (AQI).</p> <p>\u201cI would actually recommend people in other polluted cities don\u2019t download any air quality apps,\u201d said Amad Kumar, another Delhi resident. \u201cThey can ruin your life. Sometimes it\u2019s better not to know how bad things are.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/05/the-big-smoke-how-bushfires-cast-a-pall-over-the-australian-summer\">The big smoke: how bushfires cast a pall over the Australian summer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While wearing masks used to be viewed as ridiculous, the taboo has mostly disappeared and most Delhi residents recommend investing in a good quality mask.</p> <p>But when the AQI hits emergency levels in Delhi, those who can stay inside. Food businesses and restaurants in Delhi reported a 10% decline in revenue during the recent pollution peak in November; in contrast, food home delivery app Swiggy reported an upsurge in business.</p> <p>Nilanjana Roy, a Delhi-based author and columnist, said in the worst months she left the city \u201cas often as I can for the Himalayas or for the Corbett forests. It\u2019s a luxury most people don\u2019t have, and it\u2019s expensive, but it clears out my lungs a bit and gives me enough energy to keep going.\u201d</p> <p>When she does stay in Delhi, she calls on a variety of remedies to offset the health impacts of the pollution. \u201cYoga, pranayama (judiciously, not on the most polluted days) help with the constant low fevers and immune system problems,\u201d said Roy. \u201cJuicing, Vitamin C and D, turmeric tea, air purifiers, masks etc also help to a limited extent \u2014 but you can\u2019t escape the environment.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stay indoors, lock all the windows</p> <footer> <cite>Rachna</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, some Delhi malls have capitalised on the bad conditions by installing huge air purifiers and drawing in crowds not for the shopping but for the oxygen. Meanwhile an oxygen bar, where people can pay for the privilege of breathing fragrant fresh air at an upscale Delhi mall, has been doing a booming business.</p> <p>Nonetheless, even with these coping mechanisms, a recent survey found 40% of people wanted to move out of Delhi due to the severity of the pollution. Rachna took a similar stance. \u201cThe best thing to do when things get bad is just leave,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>Mexico City</h2> <p>Ana Lilia Flores says Mexico City\u2019s pollution has been the bane of her life. \u201cMy eyes water, my head hurts, and sometimes I also get short of breath,\u201d the 51-year-old private security guard said. \u201cThe worst is this feeling of agitation.\u201d</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t help that her job involves standing outside a shop beside a busy junction in the city centre for about 10 hours a day, nor that her commute often takes three hours of inching along traffic-choked highways in overcrowded buses.</p> <p>So what does she do when the pollution gets really bad?</p> <p>\u201cI tuck my mouth and nose into the collar of my shirt and when I get home I wash my nose out with camomile tea and gargle with apple vinegar,\u201d she said. \u201cOther people use sprays from the pharmacy but my remedies work just as well and cost less.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab92d2dd351b6fcc76df1a82c252622e0dde03b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab92d2dd351b6fcc76df1a82c252622e0dde03b1/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A thick layer of smog envelops the city of Puebla, southeast of Mexico City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A thick layer of smog envelops the city of Puebla, south-east of Mexico City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Castanares/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mexico City\u2019s pollution problem is far less acute today than it was in the 80s and 90s, when the metropolis that sprawls across a high-altitude valley surrounded by mountains was deemed to have the worst air quality in the world. Things got better because regulations forced factories out, cleaned up the petrol, and kept dirtier cars off the streets at least one day a week.</p> <p>In recent years, however, the improvements have petered out and, while still far from the top of the world pollution tables, the air quality in the Mexican capital is rarely at WHO recommended levels. And while the issue has traditionally been ozone, fine particulate matter is now causing problems as well.</p> <p>This spring the authorities declared a pollution emergency after wildfires around the city during windless days at the end of the dry season shrouded everything in a smoky haze. As well as pulling more cars off the roads and suspending construction projects, they also closed schools and urged parents to keep their kids at home with the windows shut.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only thing to do is ignore it</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Salazar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That emergency triggered a noticeable increase in residents seeking out things they could do to keep themselves healthier outside of emergencies.</p> <p>It is no longer so unusual to see cyclists wearing masks, and lists of the best pollution-absorbing house plants have become Facebook staples. HEPA filter air purifiers are beginning to make an appearance in wealthier homes.</p> <p>Karen C\u00e1mara thought about buying one, but shied away when she saw the price. Still, the 21-year-old student said she does seek to protect herself by exercising in a gym rather than out of doors.</p> <p>\u201cIf the air was better I would run in a park, but I don\u2019t think that is a good idea here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But there are still many in Mexico City who prefer not to think about pollution or what it might be doing to their bodies.</p> <p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s bad, but this is the way it has always been and the only thing to do is ignore it,\u201d said Daniel Salazar, who has been cleaning windscreens at a traffic light for 13 years. \u201cNow when it rains, that\u2019s when I worry, because that is when I can\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <h2>Beijing</h2> <p>Day to day, residents in Beijing are waging a fight against air pollution. Even as the city is expected to drop out of the list of the world\u2019s 200 most polluted places to live, a dull smog often hangs low over Beijing, obscuring the skyline and sometimes filling underground subway stations with haze. In the winter, when the air tends to be worse, almost everyone on the street will be wearing face masks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2be21e07b589210df6816db9653cb2c199fd7902\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be21e07b589210df6816db9653cb2c199fd7902/0_108_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A paramilitary police officer wearing a mask stands guard in front of a portrait of the late Chairman Mao during smog at Tiananmen Square in Beijing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A paramilitary police officer wearing a mask stands guard in front of a portrait of the late Chairman Mao during smog at Tiananmen Square in Beijing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most middle-class families have installed air purifiers in several rooms of their homes, and keep an air quality monitor nearby to measure the levels of particulate matter known as PM2.5, which damages the lungs.</p> <p>Gyms, some restaurants, and offices are also often equipped with air purifiers. Ahead of winter, when pollution is at its worst, and during particularly bad spikes, there are increased sales of the purifiers, which can cost as much as 4,000 yuan (about $570). Some companies have begun selling cheaper, DIY purifiers.</p> <p>Those with less money simply look out their windows to see whether the sun is shining, to determine whether they can leave their windows open and what kind of mask is needed that day.

      "bodyText": "The east coast of Australia is in the grip of a bushfire and air pollution crisis. But plummeting air quality levels are a regular occurrence in cities in India, Latin America and China. Here, residents and experts from Delhi, Beijing and Mexico City explain how they survive the smog. Delhi \u201cMy advice? Stay indoors, lock all the windows and put an air purifier in every corner of your house,\u201d said Rachna, 31, a resident of south Delhi. \u201cWhat you lose in electricity bills, you gain in extra years of your life.\u201d Severe pollution has become an annual event in Delhi in October and November and as the thick brown smog shrouds the city, it is met with an almost obsessive compulsion by residents to check and discuss the air quality index (AQI). \u201cI would actually recommend people in other polluted cities don\u2019t download any air quality apps,\u201d said Amad Kumar, another Delhi resident. \u201cThey can ruin your life. Sometimes it\u2019s better not to know how bad things are.\u201d While wearing masks used to be viewed as ridiculous, the taboo has mostly disappeared and most Delhi residents recommend investing in a good quality mask. But when the AQI hits emergency levels in Delhi, those who can stay inside. Food businesses and restaurants in Delhi reported a 10% decline in revenue during the recent pollution peak in November; in contrast, food home delivery app Swiggy reported an upsurge in business. Nilanjana Roy, a Delhi-based author and columnist, said in the worst months she left the city \u201cas often as I can for the Himalayas or for the Corbett forests. It\u2019s a luxury most people don\u2019t have, and it\u2019s expensive, but it clears out my lungs a bit and gives me enough energy to keep going.\u201d When she does stay in Delhi, she calls on a variety of remedies to offset the health impacts of the pollution. \u201cYoga, pranayama (judiciously, not on the most polluted days) help with the constant low fevers and immune system problems,\u201d said Roy. \u201cJuicing, Vitamin C and D, turmeric tea, air purifiers, masks etc also help to a limited extent \u2014 but you can\u2019t escape the environment.\u201d However, some Delhi malls have capitalised on the bad conditions by installing huge air purifiers and drawing in crowds not for the shopping but for the oxygen. Meanwhile an oxygen bar, where people can pay for the privilege of breathing fragrant fresh air at an upscale Delhi mall, has been doing a booming business. Nonetheless, even with these coping mechanisms, a recent survey found 40% of people wanted to move out of Delhi due to the severity of the pollution. Rachna took a similar stance. \u201cThe best thing to do when things get bad is just leave,\u201d she said. Mexico City Ana Lilia Flores says Mexico City\u2019s pollution has been the bane of her life. \u201cMy eyes water, my head hurts, and sometimes I also get short of breath,\u201d the 51-year-old private security guard said. \u201cThe worst is this feeling of agitation.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help that her job involves standing outside a shop beside a busy junction in the city centre for about 10 hours a day, nor that her commute often takes three hours of inching along traffic-choked highways in overcrowded buses. So what does she do when the pollution gets really bad? \u201cI tuck my mouth and nose into the collar of my shirt and when I get home I wash my nose out with camomile tea and gargle with apple vinegar,\u201d she said. \u201cOther people use sprays from the pharmacy but my remedies work just as well and cost less.\u201d Mexico City\u2019s pollution problem is far less acute today than it was in the 80s and 90s, when the metropolis that sprawls across a high-altitude valley surrounded by mountains was deemed to have the worst air quality in the world. Things got better because regulations forced factories out, cleaned up the petrol, and kept dirtier cars off the streets at least one day a week. In recent years, however, the improvements have petered out and, while still far from the top of the world pollution tables, the air quality in the Mexican capital is rarely at WHO recommended levels. And while the issue has traditionally been ozone, fine particulate matter is now causing problems as well. This spring the authorities declared a pollution emergency after wildfires around the city during windless days at the end of the dry season shrouded everything in a smoky haze. As well as pulling more cars off the roads and suspending construction projects, they also closed schools and urged parents to keep their kids at home with the windows shut. That emergency triggered a noticeable increase in residents seeking out things they could do to keep themselves healthier outside of emergencies. It is no longer so unusual to see cyclists wearing masks, and lists of the best pollution-absorbing house plants have become Facebook staples. HEPA filter air purifiers are beginning to make an appearance in wealthier homes. Karen C\u00e1mara thought about buying one, but shied away when she saw the price. Still, the 21-year-old student said she does seek to protect herself by exercising in a gym rather than out of doors. \u201cIf the air was better I would run in a park, but I don\u2019t think that is a good idea here,\u201d she said. But there are still many in Mexico City who prefer not to think about pollution or what it might be doing to their bodies. \u201cSure, it\u2019s bad, but this is the way it has always been and the only thing to do is ignore it,\u201d said Daniel Salazar, who has been cleaning windscreens at a traffic light for 13 years. \u201cNow when it rains, that\u2019s when I worry, because that is when I can\u2019t work.\u201d Beijing Day to day, residents in Beijing are waging a fight against air pollution. Even as the city is expected to drop out of the list of the world\u2019s 200 most polluted places to live, a dull smog often hangs low over Beijing, obscuring the skyline and sometimes filling underground subway stations with haze. In the winter, when the air tends to be worse, almost everyone on the street will be wearing face masks. Most middle-class families have installed air purifiers in several rooms of their homes, and keep an air quality monitor nearby to measure the levels of particulate matter known as PM2.5, which damages the lungs. Gyms, some restaurants, and offices are also often equipped with air purifiers. Ahead of winter, when pollution is at its worst, and during particularly bad spikes, there are increased sales of the purifiers, which can cost as much as 4,000 yuan (about $570). Some companies have begun selling cheaper, DIY purifiers. Those with less money simply look out their windows to see whether the sun is shining, to determine whether they can leave their windows open and what kind of mask is needed that day. A range of apps tracking the air quality index in locations across the city update throughout the day. Zou Yi, who runs a popular Weibo account called BeijingAirNow, has been taking photos of the skyscraper hosting China\u2019s national broadcaster, CCTV, every day since 2013. He says the number of days where the building\u2019s outline can be clearly seen has increased. He has been working on an app that residents can use to take a photo of the air in a specific area, and use big data to predict the air quality. \u201cI\u2019m glad air condition is getting better. The government has been trying different measures to tackle air pollution, and some measures did work,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of my WeChat friends liked to post photos of blue sky, because blue sky was rare at that time. But now people are getting used to blue sky.\u201d In October, officials released a new \u201caction plan\u201d for air pollution control in Beijing and surrounding areas, to lower the density of PM2.5 another 4% by next March.",

      "bodyText": "Another week and another glut of evidence that the Australian economy is flatlining. Growth figures showed that households have stopped spending and that the economy is being propped up by a few government projects. The next day, retail sales growth came in at exactly 0%, showing that consumers have taken the Coalition\u2019s tax cuts and used them to pay off debt. But as Josh Frydenberg rebuffs the Reserve Bank\u2019s calls for huge new federal spending and instead trumpets the possibility of returning Australia Pty Ltd to surplus, it seems increasingly likely the denizens of Martin Place will cut the cash rate again in February to kickstart the economy. This is starting to feel like groundhog day. The RBA has already cut rates three times this year, in line with similar moves in the United States, Europe and Asia, and failed to move the dial on growth. Most economists doubt that it will make any difference even if the cash rate sinks to 0.25%, as many predict. But a radically different way of managing the economy is gaining more and more attention and could reshape the way we think about society. When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez burst onto the American political scene this year, her suggestions for a Green New Deal became associated with a way of seeing economics known as modern monetary theory (MMT). One of its leading lights is Prof Bill Mitchell, of the University of Newcastle, who says that in contrast to the prevailing monetarist orthodoxy of the past 40 years, countries cannot, and should not, be run like a corner shop.

      "bodyText": "For two weeks at the end of every year, the world\u2019s governments meet to work on a global response to climate change. This year is the 25th meeting of what is known as the conference of the parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Those who attend know it as COP, or COP25. Here\u2019s what you need to know about this year\u2019s talks, which started on Monday in Madrid, and what they could mean for Australia. Where does Australia stand coming into the talks? There are nearly 190 countries represented at the UN climate talks and, contrary to some perceptions, Australia is not just a bit player. Under UN greenhouse accounting, Australia is responsible for about 1.3% of annual pollution, which places it 16th on a ladder of polluting nations. It emits more each year than 40 countries with larger populations, including G7 members Britain, France and Italy. On other measures Australia performs worse. It emits more per person than any other developed country (and far more than most developing countries), and a recent analysis found it was third for exported emissions. It is the world\u2019s biggest seller of coal, particularly metallurgic coal used in steel-making, and either number one or two for natural gas. It is easily the largest emitter in the south Pacific, and has been increasingly drawing criticism from Pacific leaders for not doing more to tackle the issue. As the talks began last week, Australia was at the forefront of the climate emergency in other ways, as drought and bushfires made global headlines. Scientists say both are unprecedented and in line with climate projections. Observers such as Howard Bamsey, the country\u2019s former special envoy on climate change, say events in Australia are noticed and could be used to influence other countries to do more. But the government\u2019s message focuses on its own actions: that it has set a 2030 emissions reduction target, that it more than met previous targets it set for itself and that it will meet this one. Who is representing Australia? Australia has a 21-strong delegation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, led by Jamie Isbister, a senior diplomat who was appointed environment ambassador less than three weeks ago. In the second week\u2019s political stage, Australia will be represented by Angus Taylor, the minister for energy and emissions reduction. It is his first time at climate talks. He arrives under pressure on several fronts, including a bizarre public spat with American author Naomi Wolf. How is Australia positioning itself? Australia is a member of what is known as the umbrella group of countries \u2013 a coalition of mostly developed nations outside the EU, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the US (which has a big delegation despite planning to leave the Paris agreement next year). The group doesn\u2019t agree on everything but works together when like-minded. Observers say the first week of talks has been slow. Australia is in a camp that does not want the meeting to focus on increasing the ambition of targets volunteered under the Paris deal and emphasises the need to implement what has already been agreed. Non-government groups say it is a concerning sign ahead of the next summit in Glasgow at the end of 2020, when countries are meant to come armed with new commitments to move the world closer to the goals agreed in Paris: limiting industrial global warming to well below 2C and as close to 1.5C as possible. According to a UN report published before the talks, global emissions must fall by about 7.6% a year for the next decade to give a chance of meeting the 1.5C goal. Current targets would result in more than 3C warming, considered a disastrous scenario that would trigger dangerous tipping points. Scott Morrison has indicated Australia has no plan to increase what it is doing beyond its 2030 target of a 26-28% cut compared with 2005 levels, which is less than what government advisors found would be Australia\u2019s fair share or it could afford to do. The prime minister has not acknowledged what groups representing business, unions, farmers, investors and the social policy sector this week spelled out in a joint statement \u2013 that the goals of the Paris agreement mean Australia will need to plan to stop emitting any carbon dioxide. Australia\u2019s emissions are not coming down and most experts believe it is not on track to meet its target. But the government released two sets of data before Taylor left for Madrid to buttress his argument that the country has \u201ca track record of which all Australians can be proud\u201d. The first used newly adjusted emissions data to suggest national pollution was basically flatlining, and had dipped slightly over the past two years, rather than increasing year-in-year as the greenhouse accounts had previously shown. The second updated projections of how much pollution will be released to 2030 and found, contrary to other evidence, the country was expected to meet its Paris target. It did this by including an accounting loophole known as carryover credits. More on that in a moment. Environment and other civil society groups at the conference have highlighted Morrison\u2019s language on climate change. They twice last week awarded Australia a \u201cfossil of the day\u201d award, the climate talks equivalent of a Razzie. One was for a tweet he sent from the cricket about the fires. Are carryover credits a big issue at the talks? Potentially. Beyond holding the line on targets, Australia\u2019s most prominent negotiating position is using these credits. They are an accounting measure that allows countries to count emissions cuts from exceeding previous targets against future targets. They were allowed under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol. They are not mentioned in the Paris agreement and Australia is the only country planning to use them under it. Australia accrued the credits after setting unambitious targets, including that it would increase national emissions by up to 8% between 1990 and 2012. The government says it will have credits equivalent to 411m tonnes of carbon dioxide to use against its Paris target, effectively cutting what it needs to do in new emissions reductions by more than half. Critics say it is exploiting a loophole. Under UN rules, the carryover credits can only be banned through consensus, and the Australian delegation made clear in pre-COP briefings that it would not agree to that. But this may not be the end of the discussion. Several countries, including Britain, the European Union, Canada and Pacific nations, have either raised doubts or said outright they should not be used. Analysts say use of the carryover would be at odds with other clear principles set out in the Paris deal. The text of the agreement says countries will make national commitments that are more ambitious through time and reflect the \u201chighest possible ambition\u201d. Some groups, such as the Investor Group on Climate Change, representing institutional investors with $2tr in funds, say use of carryover credits is inconsistent with the agreement because it reduces the action taken. A potential scenario is that developing countries introduce an effective ban on using Kyoto carryover credits into the draft text that governments are negotiating over. Richie Merzian, a former government climate negotiator, now director of the climate and energy program with The Australia Institute, says the Morrison government has yet to formally declare to the UN that it plans to use carryover credits.

A major issue is what is known as Article 6, the part of the Paris rulebook that aims to revive a global carbon market that would help countries cut emissions by paying for measures that reduce pollution in developing countries. The credits generated through these markets differ from carryover credits, as they are tied to actual emissions cuts. Debate over Article 6 is looking at carbon market design and operation and what to do about concerns that some countries led by Brazil are trying to \u201cdouble count\u201d by claiming emissions reductions for credits sold to wealthy nations. The Australian business community has been concerned in the lead-up to the talks that Article 6 may not be resolved. The government\u2019s position is arguably contradictory. Morrison was a frequent pre-election critic of Labor\u2019s plan to use international credits, but supports their use in negotiations. But Bill Hare, the chief executive and scientist at Climate Analytics and an adviser to small developing countries, says Australia is not working to ensure the rules guarantee that the use of offsets always results in real emissions reductions. \u201cI think it\u2019s all about having the ultimate flexibility in what countries want to do, rather than rigorous or accountable oversight,\u201d he says.

      "bodyText": "Labor frontbencher Tanya Plibersek will on Sunday say that people are right to be sceptical about politics and to worry about whether democracy delivers, because \u201cenough people are failing to see the tangible benefits the system promised them\u201d. Labor\u2019s former deputy leader will tell a conference that Australian voters are disillusioned because too many of them are worse off financially, even as the nation as a whole becomes wealthier. \u201cWe sometimes ask people to accept enormous social and economic change, without sharing the economic benefits of that change,\u201d Plibersek will say. \u201cThis feels a lot like a broken contract. \u201cThose struggling hardest, people on Newstart and sole parents, know this truth intimately \u2013 and express disaffection most strongly. Indeed, the group with the lowest trust in democracy \u2013 low-income women \u2013 are the people for whom national economic growth has delivered least. \u201cAustralians can see the immense changes moving through their lives and their communities \u2013 but cannot see their government responding in an equally serious way. There are no obvious plans for meeting the biggest problems facing this country. Most of these are stubborn and intergenerational.\u201d Plibersek will argue people lose trust in politics when they sense a distance between their lived experienced and the priorities and behaviour of those who govern, and the only way to turn the trust deficit around is to \u201cshow the genuine benefit of our system, in clear and material ways\u201d. \u201cThat means being prepared to tackle the hard issues without resorting to insulting simplicity: the ongoing problem of stagnant wages and an insecure labour market; climate change and energy policy; the persistence of inequality and its disproportionate impact on young people.\u201d She says Labor needs to be better than their political opponents, referencing the donations scandal in the New South Wales party. \u201cAs a party, we need to beat the standards we set for our opponents \u2013 to call out corruption and bad behaviour wherever we see it, including on our own side of politics, even when it feels uncomfortable. Especially when it feels uncomfortable.\u201d Plibersek will urge fellow progressives to not just participate, but think about how they contribute to the national conversation. She says it is important to show up \u201cwith generosity, sincerity, kindness, determination and thoughtfulness \u2013 matched by hard, methodical, practical work\u201d. She will say progressive people have a responsibility to work cooperatively for the greater good, to seek the middle ground and find common cause. Plibersek will endorse Barack Obama\u2019s recent criticism of woke \u201ccall out\u201d culture as a substitute for the real hard work of political, social and economic change. \u201cAs citizens, we need to teach ourselves again how to talk, listen and argue courteously,\u201d Plibersek will say. \u201cWe need to take our democratic responsibilities seriously. And if you really believe no one represents you, you should consider joining a party or standing for office.\u201d",

The draw leaves Wimbledon three points above the drop zone, where MK Dons occupy the final slot after drawing 1-1 at Doncaster, Cameron John\u2019s late goal denying the visitors a first league win since September. Between them sit Tranmere, who drew by the same scoreline at home to Accrington Stanley. League Two The afternoon kicked off with five points separating the top seven and ended with Swindon three points clear at the top following their 3-0 win at managerless Grimsby. E\u00f3in Doyle notched his 12th goal in eight games before a Jerry Yates brace sealed his side\u2019s sixth successive win. Exeter came away from a seesawing game against Northampton with a 3-2 win that took them to second, while Forest Green remain third despite losing 2-0 at home to 10-man Scunthorpe, where the game was halted in the second half over racist abuse from the stands. Level on points in the play-off spots are Cheltenham, who cantered to a 3-0 win at Mansfield; Bradford, who saw off Newport thanks to James Vaughn\u2019s penalty, and Crewe, whose match was suspended on Friday after Macclesfield players refused to play in protest over unpaid wages. Morecambe remain at the foot of the table after their six-pointer against Carlisle ended in two points being shared, Hallam Hope\u2019s second-half strike drawing an immediate reply from John O\u2019Sullivan, while Stevenage\u2019s stalemate with Crawley Town leaves them second bottom, level on points with Morecambe but with a game in hand. Also finishing in a draw was the game between Oldham and Leyton Orient, who both stay within six points of the relegation zone.",

You\u2019ll have read every word of the holy trinity (Sarah Waters, Ali Smith and Jeanette Winterson), but what about Jackie Kay\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/16/rereading-trumpet-jackie-kay-ali-smith\" title=\"\">Trumpet</a></strong>?

Angela Chadwick\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/xx-9780349700243.html\" title=\"\">XX</a></strong> isn\u2019t exactly literary, but it is a page-turningly plausible tale of the first two-ovum baby and the cultural ructions it causes. Getting very literary again, from Canada (where I live) I\u2019d fervently recommend Ann-Marie MacDonald (<strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fall-on-your-knees-9780099740513.html\" title=\"\">Fall on Your Knees</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview11\" title=\"\">The Way the Crow Flies</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/28/adult-onset-ann-marie-macdonald-review-parenthood-amity-gaige\" title=\"\">Adult Onset</a></strong>). Also, Helen Humphreys \u2013 any of her exquisitely crafted fiction, but I have a particular fondness for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/may/19/isobelmontgomery\" title=\"\">Afterimage</a></strong> (set on the Isle of Wight, about Julia Margaret Cameron) as well as <strong>Mach</strong><strong>ine Without Horses</strong> (about a Scottish fly-tier), which somehow manages to analyse the process of writing historical fiction and be a historical novel at the same time. In the US, one of my favourites is Carol Anshaw (eg <strong>Lucky in the Corner</strong>). Claire Messud\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/14/woman-upstairs-claire-messud-review\" title=\"\">The Woman Upstairs</a></strong> might not technically be lesbian, but it\u2019s the most memorable account of a woman\u2019s obsession with another woman and her family that I\u2019ve ever read. OK, Alison Bechdel\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/dec/28/comfort-reading-alison-bechdel-fun-home\" title=\"\">Fun Home</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/24/are-you-my-mother-alison-bechdel-review\" title=\"\">Are You My Mother?</a></strong> are graphic memoirs (by which I mean told in words and pictures rather than rude), not fiction, but they\u2019re uniquely brilliant. Since I keep slipping over the category boundaries of your question anyway, let me mention that <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/05/jordy-rosenberg-confessions-of-the-fox-review\" title=\"\">Confessions of </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/05/jordy-rosenberg-confessions-of-the-fox-review\" title=\"\">the Fox</a></strong> by Jordy Rosenberg is a novel about an 18th-century transman that offers thought-provoking meta-brilliance and wit in drawing on, as well as deviating from, lesbian literary tradition.

An alternative course of treatment would be to immerse him in books that remind us that Brexit, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are relatively minor blips in the affairs of the human species when considered in the broad sweep of history.

Yes, race is a key factor in his treatment (he has recently been reunited with his Ethiopian family), but it\u2019s also a story of dislocation and harsh treatment by the very people who should be looking after our most vulnerable children.</p> <p>The happy ending is Lemn himself, full of life and forgiveness, with the kind of wisdom that comes from a long hard look at the monster under the bed.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Q: </strong>What can I get my friend, who is a great admirer of Christopher Logue and Samuel Beckett, in the way of new poetry?</h2> <p><em><strong>Philippa Varcoe</strong>, 46, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"544f20bb30ed900b1241612b807397173fa909b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/544f20bb30ed900b1241612b807397173fa909b7/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Kate Clanchy.\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>A: Kate Clanchy</strong>, author of <em>Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me </em>and <em>England: Poems from a School</em>, writes:</h2> <p><br>Is your friend a fan of Christopher Logue\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/29/war-music-christopher-logue-life-work-homer-iliad\" title=\"\">versions of Homer</a>?

JRR and George RR are certainly the most celebrated double Rs in fantasy literature, but there are other initials that bear inspection. CS, for example. Many people mistakenly believe that the <em>Narnia</em> books belong in that most dreadful of categories: just for children. But <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> novels were once considered children\u2019s books, too, so tell pater to throw aside his preconceptions and dive through that wardrobe and into a parallel universe of divine lions, snow queens and Turkish delight. Your dad will not regret the visit, and he will never fully return. A good book is a good book, no matter what age the reader or what label people stick on the spine.</p> <p>Another perfect example of both this and more timely timeless fantasies is Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/children-of-blood-and-bone-9781509871353.html\" title=\"\">Children of Blood and Bone</a></strong><em>,</em> which follows heroine Z\u00e9lie as she attempts to restore magic to the kingdom of Or\u00efsha. If the first book is anything to go by, the series is destined to be a blockbuster. However, at the moment this is only one book, so if your dad loves a tower of tomes point him towards Raymond E Feist\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/magician-9780007466863.html\" title=\"\">Magician</a></strong> series. He will thank you for the tip once he comes back from the Kingdom of the Isles.</p> <p>Feist\u2019s Riftwar cycle is rightly one of the most venerated fantasy series ever committed to paper, and Pug\u2019s odyssey from accomplice to (spoiler alert) magician is as twisty and epic a journey as ever undertaken by hobbit, orc or troll \u2013 hence the oft-quoted saying: \u201cIf it\u2019s a Feist, don\u2019t think twice.\u201d Actually, I just made that up. It\u2019s terrible, don\u2019t tell Raymond. But corny or not, it\u2019s true, and if your dad enjoys <em>Magician</em>, as I feel confident he will, then Feist has more than two dozen excellent works that should keep your father going for a few years. And if you\u2019re not convinced by my case, just look at the man\u2019s name: Raymond E Feist. Floating initial.

I love these books.</p> <p>I can\u2019t tell you how delighted I am that you want to give short stories as gifts. Zadie Smith recently published her first short story collection, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/grand-union-9780241337028.html\" title=\"\">Grand Union</a></strong>. It is bursting with what I call \u201cabsolute Zadieness\u201d: wit and intelligence, clever observations and startling insights, shot through with a sense of both fun and wonder. I would also recommend <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/manchester-happened-9781786075895.html\" title=\"\">Manchester Happened</a></strong> by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, from Uganda, and <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/better-never-than-late-9781911115540.html\" title=\"\">Better Never Than Late</a></strong> (what a wonderful title!) by Chika Unigwe from Nigeria. These two collections are part of my Christmas reading this year, so I am recommending them purely on the basis of the supreme gifts of their authors, who oth have an ability to make you look at familiar things in new ways.</p> <p>I was thrilled to learn recently that one of my favourite authors, the New Zealander Eleanor Catton, has written the screenplay for the film, out in February 2020, of my second favourite Jane Austen novel, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/emma-9780141028095.html\" title=\"\">Emma</a></strong> (my favourite is <em>Persuasion</em>). I absolutely love this witty, bucolic book. It is Austen\u2019s second longest novel, after <em>Mansfield Park</em>: there are no villains, nothing much happens, and yet it is riveting and propulsive. I know you asked for modern novels but this is a classic that is modern in sensibility. Poor, deluded Emma. The way Austen narrates the story from her unreliable perspective is unparalleled. No wonder it is her most filmed title.

      "bodyText": "Q: Please could you recommend great lesbian literary fiction for someone who has read all the obvious? Anonymous, thirtysomething, south-east England A: Emma Donoghue, playwright and novelist, writes: Oh dear, yours is an intimidating question. Well, if any of my recommendations are what you\u2019d call obvious, maybe we can agree that they\u2019re good, at least. You\u2019ll have read every word of the holy trinity (Sarah Waters, Ali Smith and Jeanette Winterson), but what about Jackie Kay\u2019s Trumpet? Crossing the Irish Sea, Sally Rooney\u2019s Conversations With Friends? You\u2019d probably enjoy Sara Collins\u2019s genre-blending (historical/queer/crime) The Confessions of Frannie Langton \u2013 I lapped that one up. Angela Chadwick\u2019s XX isn\u2019t exactly literary, but it is a page-turningly plausible tale of the first two-ovum baby and the cultural ructions it causes. Getting very literary again, from Canada (where I live) I\u2019d fervently recommend Ann-Marie MacDonald (Fall on Your Knees, The Way the Crow Flies, Adult Onset). Also, Helen Humphreys \u2013 any of her exquisitely crafted fiction, but I have a particular fondness for Afterimage (set on the Isle of Wight, about Julia Margaret Cameron) as well as Machine Without Horses (about a Scottish fly-tier), which somehow manages to analyse the process of writing historical fiction and be a historical novel at the same time. In the US, one of my favourites is Carol Anshaw (eg Lucky in the Corner). Claire Messud\u2019s The Woman Upstairs might not technically be lesbian, but it\u2019s the most memorable account of a woman\u2019s obsession with another woman and her family that I\u2019ve ever read. OK, Alison Bechdel\u2019s Fun Home and Are You My Mother? are graphic memoirs (by which I mean told in words and pictures rather than rude), not fiction, but they\u2019re uniquely brilliant. Since I keep slipping over the category boundaries of your question anyway, let me mention that Confessions of the Fox by Jordy Rosenberg is a novel about an 18th-century transman that offers thought-provoking meta-brilliance and wit in drawing on, as well as deviating from, lesbian literary tradition. Enjoy! * * * Q: My boyfriend is obsessed with politics. Can you recommend some books to guide him through this Brexit Christmas? Anonymous, 27, London A: Andrew Rawnsley, the Observer\u2019s chief political commentator, writes You have my sympathies. It sounds as if your boyfriend may be suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Brexit Disorder, a distressingly common condition that our best minds are still struggling to fully comprehend. Therapy of a kind may be found from Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain. Fintan O\u2019Toole casts a pitilessly acerbic and searingly witty outsider\u2019s eye on our national ailment. Understanding of its pathology will be deepened by reading David Reynolds\u2019s Island Stories in which he locates Brexit in the context of British history. One of his themes is that British \u2013 or, more precisely, English \u2013 ambivalence about the relationship with continental Europe goes a long way back, a millennium and more. Excellent though both these books are, I fear there is a danger that they will inflame rather than alleviate your boyfriend\u2019s condition. An alternative course of treatment would be to immerse him in books that remind us that Brexit, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are relatively minor blips in the affairs of the human species when considered in the broad sweep of history. I always find value in going back to Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond\u2019s classic analysis of why some civilisations go right and some go wrong. Another favourite is Paul Kennedy\u2019s The Rise and Fall of The Great Powers. Do not under any circumstances expose your boyfriend to For the Record by David Cameron. It will trigger an extreme allergic shock. Your boyfriend may simply be in need of some cheering up. As an antidote to the pervasive feeling that we are all going to hell in a handcart, I prescribe the late Hans Rosling\u2019s Factfulness: Ten Reasons We\u2019re Wrong About the World \u2013 and Why Things Are Better Than You Think. Laughter is often the best medicine. I suggest The Little Book of Brexit Bollocks in which Alistair Beaton and Tom Mitchelson have a lot of fun at the expense of the Brexiters and their many fabrications. It will make a good stocking filler. Please let us know whether your boyfriend responds positively to any of these suggested remedies so that we can help the many millions who are afflicted by OCBD. * * * Q: We have nieces and nephews aged one, nine, 11 and 14. What are the best books published this year for these age groups? Catherine, full-time mother, 37, Chichester A: Jasbinder Bilan, author of Asha &amp; the Spirit Bird, writes: Starting with the youngest, your one-year-old would adore sharing the latest book from Patricia Hegarty, On Sleepy Hill. The illustrations are whimsical and the cute peek-through pages are perfect for little fingers to turn. Handa\u2019s Noisy Night, by Eileen Browne, will have them giggling as they guess which animal is making a racket on a special African sleepover. Pull up a deerskin to the roaring fire and your nine-year-old can dig in to the wintry tale of She Wolf, a Viking adventure by Dan Smith set in the wilds of AD866 Northumbria. Totally different is Zanib Mian\u2019s uplifting Tom Gates-style book, Planet Omar: Accidental Trouble Magnet, which is full of humour and heart. For your 11-year-old, the beautifully hopeful Where the River Runs Gold by Sita Brahmachari is an empowering adventure about climate change, set in a dystopian future where bees have disappeared and children are made to work on farms. As night falls, double-lock your doors before opening The Switching Hour by Damaris Young \u2013 a spine-tingling quest to rescue Amaya\u2019s baby brother, Kaleb, from the dreaded monster, Badeko. Girl Boy Sea by Chris Vick is perfect for your 14-year-old, taking them on a sea voyage that transports them to a world of near death and the discovery of an unlikely friendship. Sticking with the oceans, they\u2019d love Frances Hardinge\u2019s latest, Deeplight. A story full of imagination, gods, myths and a twisty plot. * * * Q: I am struggling to think of what book I can get my dad, a liberal white man in his 60s, about the experiences of people of colour living in the UK, that he would relate to. Maybe nonfiction would be best. Any ideas? Cordelia Tucker O\u2019Sullivan, 27, policy and public affairs professional, London A: Kit de Waal, author of My Name Is Leon, writes: You\u2019re right, nonfiction may be better, although I would point you in the direction of Diana Evans\u2019s Ordinary People if you think your father might take to a great read about the middle-class black experience, brilliantly portraying a social and psychological drama played out in deceptively \u201cordinary\u201d events. It\u2019s beautiful and clever. However, if you think he might prefer nonfiction, then Lovers and Strangers by Clair Wills is terrific. It charts the experience of a whole range of immigrants who came to the UK following the second world war, not just people from the Caribbean but from Latvia, Malta, Italy, Cyprus and Ireland. It also explores how these communities lived with one another, the alliances and tensions, the romances and suspicions, with humour and insight. Some were prisoners of war, some were refugees, some were coming to the motherland where they had been promised jobs, security and a warm welcome. It\u2019s very thoroughly done without being dry and academic and was shortlisted for the Orwell prize last year. My Name Is Why, the memoir of Lemn Sissay, is a bit leftfield and a challenging read if only because it\u2019s terrible, unbelievable and utterly true. It is the story of his life as a black boy in the care system and his efforts to forge an identity, to feel whole and loved despite being confounded at every turn. Yes, race is a key factor in his treatment (he has recently been reunited with his Ethiopian family), but it\u2019s also a story of dislocation and harsh treatment by the very people who should be looking after our most vulnerable children. The happy ending is Lemn himself, full of life and forgiveness, with the kind of wisdom that comes from a long hard look at the monster under the bed. * * * Q: What can I get my friend, who is a great admirer of Christopher Logue and Samuel Beckett, in the way of new poetry? Philippa Varcoe, 46, London A: Kate Clanchy, author of Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me and England: Poems from a School, writes: Is your friend a fan of Christopher Logue\u2019s versions of Homer? If so, he should already have a copy of Alice Oswald\u2019s Memorial, about the war dead in the Iliad. And if he\u2019s soaked up that then he might be one of the best readers of Oswald\u2019s new book Nobody, which takes a Homeric bard to a rocky island in the Aegean and leaves him there to sing of a \u201cwater damaged\u201d war. For another radical classical update, there\u2019s Fiona Benson\u2019s magnificent Vertigo &amp; Ghost, which presents a startling vision of Zeus the rapist, or Richard Osmond\u2019s Rock, Paper, Scissors, which takes Osmond\u2019s own experience of the Borough Market attacks and transmogrifies it through juxtaposed ancient texts, from Beowulf and the Qur\u2019an, to present a truly Logue-like vision of elemental, amoral violence. War as a bodily, earthly experience is one of the strongest themes of Logue: your friend might find something similar in Jay Bernard\u2019s intensely moving Surge, which memorialises the fires at Grenfell and at New Cross with such power that the poems seem to lay the dead in front of us. For a Beckett fan, though, Deaf Republic by Ilya Kaminsky might appeal even more. This absorbing, tender, singular book is part drama, part sequence, powerfully and essentially international \u2013 Kaminsky is a Russian immigrant to the US \u2013 and always at the thrilling boundaries of language. If he wants more language being taken to bits, there is Alison Winch\u2019s Darling, It\u2019s Me, Rebecca Tam\u00e1s\u2019s Witch and Sophie Robinson\u2019s Rabbit to enjoy, all of them witty, bizarre and frightening in the proper Beckettian manner. If it\u2019s the Irish Beckett that your friend loves, though \u2013 the chattering, mordant voices of Happy Days \u2013 then he should enjoy Martina Evans\u2019s terrifying tales of peace, Now We Can Talk Openly About Men. * * * Q: I\u2019d like your suggestions for books to give a six-year-old girl who really doesn\u2019t like reading. Gill Fitzgerald, 61, teacher, Herts A: Konnie Huq, TV presenter and author of Cookie! \u2026 and the Most Annoying Boy in the World, writes: For any six-year-old who has a great sense of humour and loves anything off the wall, The Treehouse Books series by Andy Griffiths is fabulous. It\u2019s about two guys trying to write a book, oh... and their 13-storey tree house to which they add 13 more floors with every book and where you can find all sorts, from swimming pools to rollercoasters. I was a reluctant reader myself before stumbling upon Superfudge by Judy Blume, which is actually the third in the hilarious five-book Fudge series. I may have been a little older than your six-year-old, but I think it was the first book I read of my own volition that didn\u2019t have many, if any, pictures. I devoured it. It\u2019s about a character called Peter whose mum, much to his horror, is having a baby; he thinks his little brother Fudge is more than enough. The latest edition of the series features gorgeous cover art from Emily Gravett. Pip Jones\u2019s Izzy Gizmo is a feisty, creative young girl who loves inventing things and carries her tool kit wherever she goes, so she should appeal to any inventive, determined young things. Sara Ogilvie\u2019s exuberant pictures may attract any reluctant readers too. Following in the footsteps of her grandfather, Sophie Dahl\u2019s children\u2019s book debut is magical. Madame Badobedah is an intriguing new guest at the Mermaid hotel, where Mabel lives with her parents. Little does Mabel know but she and this suspicious newcomer \u2013 who Mabel decides must be a \u201csupervillain\u201d \u2013 will become great friends. Perfect for those who like a whimsical adventure, with beautiful pictures by Lauren O\u2019Hara. * * * Q: What can I buy a widely read gay man in his 60s who likes gay history? Martin, sixtysomething runner, north-east England A: Philip Hensher, novelist and critic, writes: Many brilliant books have been published in the past half century or so about particular aspects of gay male history that your friend might appreciate \u2013 James Davidson\u2019s The Greeks and Greek Love or John Boswell\u2019s Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe would go down a storm with someone serious. Graham Robb\u2019s Strangers, about gay life in the 19th century, is not only very well informed but seriously funny. One of the most enjoyable books on the subject this year was Paul Baker\u2019s Fabulosa!, an excavation of the now pretty well lost gay language of Polari, richly evocative and entertaining. Oliver Soden\u2019s new life of Michael Tippett is a terrific account of a gay man living his life more or less openly throughout the 20th century which your friend would enjoy, particularly if he\u2019s musical, as they used to say. Or why not go directly to the original voices and give a beautiful copy of a gay classic? The Library of America\u2019s handsome three-volume set of James Baldwin, for instance. Or go vintage \u2013 online secondhand stores will offer you a complete edition of all Ronald Firbank\u2019s novels, for instance, and a first edition of EM Forster\u2019s Maurice is very reasonably priced. As it\u2019s Christmas, a bit of ribaldry doesn\u2019t go amiss in the form of art books. I\u2019m hoping for Michael Glover\u2019s Thrust: A Spasmodic Pictorial History of the Codpiece in Art in my stocking, as it were. The art book I\u2019ve had most success with over the years, if you can track it down, is Chad States\u2019s Cruising, a collection of photographs of old-school cruising grounds in public parks. From most points of view, it\u2019s a series of pictures of trees and bushes. To recipients of a certain age, this has proved a present supplying endless hilarity. There is nothing nicer than a gift that you feel only the giver and the receiver can be certain of understanding. * * * Q: My dad is a voracious fantasy reader. He\u2019s a huge JRR Tolkien fan and has read all of George RR Martin, Tad Williams and Robert Jordan. Can you recommend any lesser-known writers? Anonymous, 25, Houston, Texas A: Eoin Colfer, author of the Artemis Fowl books, writes: I think your father, Anon Snr, and I would be fast friends, and may I be so bold as to say you have come to the right place with your fantasy-centric question. JRR and George RR are certainly the most celebrated double Rs in fantasy literature, but there are other initials that bear inspection. CS, for example. Many people mistakenly believe that the Narnia books belong in that most dreadful of categories: just for children. But The Lord of the Rings novels were once considered children\u2019s books, too, so tell pater to throw aside his preconceptions and dive through that wardrobe and into a parallel universe of divine lions, snow queens and Turkish delight. Your dad will not regret the visit, and he will never fully return. A good book is a good book, no matter what age the reader or what label people stick on the spine. Another perfect example of both this and more timely timeless fantasies is Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s Children of Blood and Bone, which follows heroine Z\u00e9lie as she attempts to restore magic to the kingdom of Or\u00efsha. If the first book is anything to go by, the series is destined to be a blockbuster. However, at the moment this is only one book, so if your dad loves a tower of tomes point him towards Raymond E Feist\u2019s Magician series. He will thank you for the tip once he comes back from the Kingdom of the Isles. Feist\u2019s Riftwar cycle is rightly one of the most venerated fantasy series ever committed to paper, and Pug\u2019s odyssey from accomplice to (spoiler alert) magician is as twisty and epic a journey as ever undertaken by hobbit, orc or troll \u2013 hence the oft-quoted saying: \u201cIf it\u2019s a Feist, don\u2019t think twice.\u201d Actually, I just made that up. It\u2019s terrible, don\u2019t tell Raymond. But corny or not, it\u2019s true, and if your dad enjoys Magician, as I feel confident he will, then Feist has more than two dozen excellent works that should keep your father going for a few years. And if you\u2019re not convinced by my case, just look at the man\u2019s name: Raymond E Feist. Floating initial. Case closed. * * * Q: My father was a doctor and loves the recent books by Henry Marsh, Adam Kay and Paul Kalanithi. What is there in the same vein for me to buy for him to read next? Anonymous, executive assistant, 48, London Rachel Clarke, author of the forthcoming Dear Life, writes: For sheer electric tension and doomed heroic medicine, the standout medical memoir of 2019, David Nott\u2019s War Doctor, can\u2019t be matched. Your father will be enthralled by Nott\u2019s descriptions of being trapped under fire in a makeshift Sarajevo operating theatre, helplessly trying to clamp a child\u2019s torn aorta with his own gloved hand. Every doctor I know secretly yearns to be as brave and admirable. Nott\u2019s exploration of his addiction to danger zones \u2013 the psychological lure of performing life-saving surgery in some of the most deadly places on Earth \u2013 is every bit as compelling. Closer to home, but no less blood-soaked, is Sue Black\u2019s superb All That Remains. You can\u2019t help but warm to this retired professor of anatomy and forensic anthropology who chose \u201cthe many faces of death\u201d as her medical speciality, yet is herself so vividly alive. Like Nott, Black travelled the world at times, sifting maggots, bullets and human body parts in war and disaster zones. Despite it all, she remains convinced that our essential humanity transcends the very worst of which our species is capable. New York-based oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee\u2019s magnificent The Emperor of All Maladies remains the most moving book from a clinician turned scientist I have ever read. Mukherjee makes cancer his central character. His history of humankind\u2019s most feared disease turns malignancy into a cunning, shape-shifting, bullet-dodging adversary \u2013 part Voldemort, part Moriarty. The descriptions of molecular malfunction are the most exquisite you could ever imagine. For sex, searing honesty and scalpel-sharp prose, surgeon Gabriel Weston\u2019s slim volume Direct Red is a mesmerising account of a woman navigating the locker-room machismo of the predominantly male surgical world. And lastly \u2013 for sheer bloody vivacity, though not written by a doctor \u2013 Lindsey Fitzharris\u2019s The Butchering Art is a gloriously grisly, pulsatingly repulsive, deservedly award-winning biography of the Victorian pioneer of aseptic surgery Joseph Lister. Delicious \u2013 and utterly irresistible.Catnip for anyone, retired doctor or otherwise. * * * Q: My wife is a specialist midwife, so her days are filled with drama, often dark and emotionally draining. As a consequence, her reading habits are mostly limited to fluffy modern romances. Can you recommend anything a step away from the doorstops with embossed titles that are her normal fare? Mild peril is OK, but nothing with violence, drug abuse or serious illness. Mark, 54, electrician, Manchester Louise Doughty, author of Platform Seven, writes: It\u2019s a shame you think your wife\u2019s profession is out as a subject, because there\u2019s a terrific novel called Midwives by the American author Chris Bohjalian, who\u2019s huge in the US but less well known than he deserves to be here. A midwife attends a home birth one freezing Vermont winter as an ice storm descends \u2013 she saves the baby\u2019s life, but the mother dies and the midwife is prosecuted for involuntary manslaughter. OK, maybe a bad choice for your wife, but it\u2019s a great read. If she enjoys romance, how about some classics that have romantic love as a driver but also offer a great deal more? Emma is a great start to discovering Jane Austen. Howards End by EM Forster begins with a romantic misadventure but develops into a touching and true story of the Schlegel sisters (and if she liked that, she\u2019d also like A Room With a View). She would probably also love I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith, which centres on the Mortmain sisters and their desire for love while living in genteel poverty in a crumbling 1930s castle. Its famous first line will give you a clue to the tone of the book: \u201cI write this sitting in the kitchen sink.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for bittersweet and contemporary, you can\u2019t go wrong with anything by Deborah Moggach or David Nicholls. * * * Q: Could you suggest books to buy for fellow animal lovers, especially books about farm animals, which are often overlooked? Julie Gray, 61, freelance editor, Bloomington, Indiana, US Charles Foster, author of Being a Beast, writes: Don\u2019t go first to the farm. You\u2019re a wild thing, even if you wear a suit, and even the most miserable battery chicken is only relatively unwild. Rewild yourself by swimming with Henry Williamson\u2019s Tarka the Otter through the rivers of Devon, being hunted across fields by red-faced and red-coated squires (Wild Lone by BB, AKA Denys Watkins-Pitchford), dodging goose-shot on the Wash and riding the sky roads (BB\u2019s Manka the Sky Gipsy), duelling with an obsessed trapper on Dartmoor (Brian Carter\u2019s A Black Fox Running), and living in an ancient and highly political rabbit city in a Berkshire hill (Richard Adams\u2019s Watership Down. Then start wondering whether it\u2019s intellectually disreputable to think that you can understand anything about animal minds. It\u2019s not: anthropomorphism is a good first guess. Darwin knew it. His intuitions about animal emotion are exhilaratingly confirmed and amplified in Carl Safina\u2019s Beyond Words (focusing on elephants, wolves and orcas) and Frans de Waal\u2019s Mama\u2019s Last Hug (mainly primates, including man). Be prepared for tears, shame at your membership of a psychopathic species, and the loss of a lot of comforting presumptions. By now you\u2019ll have a better idea of what sort of creature you are (it\u2019s nature writing\u2019s main job to give you that) and it\u2019ll be time to look at what happens when humans meet non-humans. It can be mutually redemptive (Gavin Maxwell\u2019s Ring of Bright Water) or malignant (Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Eating Animals, and Philip Lymbery and Isabel Oakeshott\u2019s Farmageddon). Most modern farm animals (most of which are birds) have wretched lives, deprived of the possibility of being themselves. It needn\u2019t be so. The last couple of suggestions will have made you thoroughly depressed. Pick up anything by James Herriot, or by his North Yorkshire veterinary successors Peter Wright (The Yorkshire Vet) and Julian Norton (Horses, Heifers and Hairy Pigs) to cheer yourself up. * * * Q: After trudging through some very dull fiction recently, my request is a simple one: I would like suggestions for gripping, beautifully written modern novels and short stories that I can give as presents. Is that too much to ask? Juliet Humphreys, 56, teacher, Uxbridge Petina Gappah, author of the forthcoming Out of Darkness, Shining Light, writes: Top of my list would be the novels Olive Kitteridge by the American author Elizabeth Strout and the sequel, Olive, Again. I know that there is much pleasure to be found in encountering people like yourself in fiction (do please also consider giving them to yourself as a gift: Olive is a retired schoolteacher!), but there is also joy in getting to know people you are likely never to meet in real life, in a setting you are unlikely to enter, and still recognise the truthfulness of their experience. I love these books. I can\u2019t tell you how delighted I am that you want to give short stories as gifts. Zadie Smith recently published her first short story collection, Grand Union. It is bursting with what I call \u201cabsolute Zadieness\u201d: wit and intelligence, clever observations and startling insights, shot through with a sense of both fun and wonder. I would also recommend Manchester Happened by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, from Uganda, and Better Never Than Late (what a wonderful title!) by Chika Unigwe from Nigeria. These two collections are part of my Christmas reading this year, so I am recommending them purely on the basis of the supreme gifts of their authors, who oth have an ability to make you look at familiar things in new ways. I was thrilled to learn recently that one of my favourite authors, the New Zealander Eleanor Catton, has written the screenplay for the film, out in February 2020, of my second favourite Jane Austen novel, Emma (my favourite is Persuasion). I absolutely love this witty, bucolic book. It is Austen\u2019s second longest novel, after Mansfield Park: there are no villains, nothing much happens, and yet it is riveting and propulsive. I know you asked for modern novels but this is a classic that is modern in sensibility. Poor, deluded Emma. The way Austen narrates the story from her unreliable perspective is unparalleled. No wonder it is her most filmed title. Happy giving! * * * Browse the books featured in Book Clinic at guardianbookshop.com.

It was shortlisted for this year\u2019s Booker prize and won the \u00a310,000 Goldsmiths prize, which goes to a book that \u201copens up new possibilities for the novel form\u201d.</p> <p><strong>When you first started writing <em>Ducks, Newburyport</em>, did you know it would take the shape that it did?</strong><br>No, it doesn\u2019t work to overplan things. My novels are generated by my preoccupations at the time. The principle I stuck to was simply writing the book I wanted to write. There\u2019s no point in writing <em>anything</em> but that.</p> <p><strong>Did you start with the voice or the idea?</strong><br>It started with the phrase \u201cthe fact that\u201d: I wrote a page of sentences starting with \u201cthe fact that\u201d one morning at dawn, and I liked its effect. It can be either emphatic or soothing, and it\u2019s suspenseful: you don\u2019t know how the sentence will end. I set about discovering if I could keep using this phrase ad infinitum in a full-length novel, and it seems that I could.</p> <p>The ideas floating around when I started the novel stemmed from my anger and despair about what we\u2019ve done to the environment. A woman recently came up to me after a talk and said: \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not you.\u201d She was appalled by my level of gloom. But I\u2019m sort of appalled by her resilience. Also, her deafness to satire.</p> <p><strong>Did you always want to be a writer?</strong><br>I wanted to be a sculptor, but I didn\u2019t really enjoy the cold and manky atmosphere of art schools. I\u2019m a wimp. In retrospect, I think there was also an unspoken prejudice against female sculptors, which subtly undermined me.</p> <p><strong>You don\u2019t tend to read contemporary fiction \u2013 why is that? What books are currently on your bedside table?</strong><br>[Virginia] Woolf\u2019s<em> Mrs Dalloway</em> and Caradoc Evans\u2019s story collection <em>My People</em>. She wrestles with the English upper middle class, he tangles with Wales. </p> <p>I find the annual celebration of contemporary writing, the Xmas lists of 2019 books, quite offensive. It seems so arrogant. These lists suggest that the most relevant books must be the ones most recently published. That\u2019s daft. It\u2019s nice of people to take an interest in new writing of course, especially when one has a book out that year oneself, but let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s a marketing ploy. They want to shift some books, and to do so they glory in the \u201cnow\u201d \u2013 while everybody knows readers would get more from reading <em>Ulysses</em> or Woolf or Kafka. <em>Private Eye\u2019</em>s logrolling investigations are getting tired too. So what if some writers know each other? It\u2019s hard to avoid. The British literary world is pretty small. Some time ago I pretty much decided to read only books written before the atom bomb was dropped, when everything changed for all life on Earth. The industrial revolution\u2019s bad enough, but nuclear weapons really are party-poopers.</p> <p>I don\u2019t stick strictly to this policy, but I often find it more rewarding to read what people thought about, and what they did with literature, before we were reduced by war and capitalism to mere monetary units, bomb fodder and password generators. And before the natural world became a depository for plastics and nuclear waste.</p> <p>Anger and alienation have resulted, and they\u2019re fine subjects, but there are times when you\u2019d like to remember some of the higher points in the history of civilisation as well, and the natural world before we learned to view it all as tainted. The intense humour, innocence, sexiness and play of <em>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</em>, for instance \u2013 could this have been written after Hiroshima? Could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview1\" title=\"\"><em>Gargantua and Pantagruel</em></a>? <em>Don Quixote</em>? <em>Emma</em>? I don\u2019t see how. Thanks to the offences of patriarchy, a lot of the fun has gone out of being human, and I like books that look at life in less constricted ways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why in hell would you give the first black woman to win the Booker half the dough?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Many reviewers of <em>Ducks</em> have written about it reverentially, while also straining to emphasise its length, its literary qualities, its challenging nature. How does all this make you feel?</strong><br>Size isn\u2019t everything. I do understand the trials of rushed reviewers, but you can always say no if you can\u2019t face reviewing something. This book had to be long, to do what it does, but I never wanted it to be unapproachable. There\u2019s a tinge of sexism in certain male reviewers\u2019 comments on the book\u2019s length. They\u2019re probably further miffed that it\u2019s a novel about womanhood. The feeling is, how dare a woman, the narrator or the author, take up so much of my time?</p> <p>Can we also talk about the rumour that the book is made up of eight sentences? I\u2019m afraid this seems to have been started by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/15/ducks-newburyport-by-lucy-ellmann-review\" title=\"\">an <em>Observer</em> review</a>. I don\u2019t know how the number eight was arrived at, but that review had legs and the idea really got around. It\u2019s a frustrating miscalculation, as making it eight sentences would not have made any sense at all.</p> <p>I\u2019m planning to get \u201cONE SENTENCE NOT EIGHT\u201d put on my tombstone. That should settle the matter, right? But it seems churlish to complain about the reviews. They have mostly been wonderfully generous.</p> <p><strong>In Ducks, our narrator \u2013 a mother \u2013 thinks: \u201cI\u2019m scared of all young women now, because when I look at them I see another potential mother-hater, the fact that I always wonder now</strong> <strong>how they treat their own moms.\u201d You\u2019re a mother, and both a great defender and critic of motherhood. How do you balance these positions?</strong><br>What worries me is the big divide I\u2019ve occasionally observed between mothers and daughters. I suspect patriarchy is behind this hostility. When women turn on each other, you have to look for the source of that, who benefits. It\u2019s a great pity, because all this woman-on-woman anger could be better directed against our oppressors.</p> <p>I was very close to my own mother, and feel the power and meaning of motherhood are widely overlooked \u2013 again, in service to patriarchy. But now that we\u2019re in a climate emergency, the closer we can get to zero births, the better. I do admire women who decide to not have children for the environment. I think it\u2019s touching and noble and generous. It\u2019s also incredibly sensible. People don\u2019t talk enough about how tiring, boring, enraging, time-consuming, expensive and thankless parenthood is. Why must we keep pretending it\u2019s a joy? Sure, there are delightful elements: children are endearing and fascinating, and if you have some, you get to play with toys again and read children\u2019s books and remember your childhood. But illness, worry, conflict, overcrowding, the relentless cooking, the driving, the loss of privacy, the repression of your own sexuality, the education dilemmas, the lack of employment prospects, and all the wretched insanity of adolescence \u2013 these are big deterrents.</p> <p>You watch people get pregnant and know they\u2019ll be emotionally and intellectually absent for 20 years. Thought, knowledge, adult conversation and vital political action are all put on hold while this needless perpetuation of the species is prioritised. Having babies is a strong impulse, a forgivable one, but it\u2019s also just a habit, a tradition, like weddings or putting butter on popcorn.</p> <p><strong>A couple months on from the Booker, how do you feel about the decision to award two prizes?</strong><br>It was a really crappy decision. Five judges and they can\u2019t reach a democratic result? But they were so determined to reward a famous author this year, they seem to have forgotten about fair and logical voting techniques. The glory of the award can apparently be doubled, not divided, so that\u2019s good. But it doesn\u2019t seem very nice to make the winners share the money! Why in hell would you give the first black woman to win the Booker half the dough? It\u2019s deeply mistaken and insulting.</p> <p>What I like about the Booker Foundation, a registered charity, is its arrangement with the RNIB. All the shortlisted books are recorded for the blind, and that\u2019s an honour.</p> <p><strong>Your books are unabashedly, furiously feminist. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/15/mimi-lucy-ellmann-review\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Mimi</em></strong></a><strong> ends with a great manifesto calling for the creation of a global matriarchy to save the planet. If you were in charge in such a world, what would you change and do with that power?</strong><br>If I were in charge? That\u2019s a rather patriarchal concept! Women should be in charge collectively. This leader shit doesn\u2019t seem to be getting us anywhere. But what would we change? Here\u2019s my plan, based on prehistoric matriarchal cultures (only called \u201cprehistoric\u201d, by the way, because they predate male rule): a three-hour working day, free health care, open borders, wealth redistribution, a fair-minded pooling of resources, and devotion to the common good, veneration of women, harmony with nature, more snow storms, respect for animals, more allotments (I just like the look of them), non-violence, a ban on all weaponry, an end to imprisonment and the beauty cult (another prison), and a moratorium on the mention of religion. (Pursue these belief systems if you must, but keep it to yourself.) And that includes the religions of exercise: jogging, yoga, aerobics, going to the stupid gym (you could be out planting trees!), along with mindfulness, plastic surgery and other supposed forms of self-improvement that really exist only to bug people. We need to raise the level of discourse to which our capitalist masters have relegated us. In service to this, we should redirect all our energies to a wholehearted concentration on the arts, our greatest achievement as a species.</p> <p>And everybody has to eat either Chinese, Indian, Spanish or Italian food. Well, I will anyway.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> by Lucy Ellmann is published by Galley Beggar Press (\u00a313.99).

How do you balance these positions? What worries me is the big divide I\u2019ve occasionally observed between mothers and daughters. I suspect patriarchy is behind this hostility. When women turn on each other, you have to look for the source of that, who benefits. It\u2019s a great pity, because all this woman-on-woman anger could be better directed against our oppressors. I was very close to my own mother, and feel the power and meaning of motherhood are widely overlooked \u2013 again, in service to patriarchy. But now that we\u2019re in a climate emergency, the closer we can get to zero births, the better. I do admire women who decide to not have children for the environment. I think it\u2019s touching and noble and generous. It\u2019s also incredibly sensible. People don\u2019t talk enough about how tiring, boring, enraging, time-consuming, expensive and thankless parenthood is. Why must we keep pretending it\u2019s a joy? Sure, there are delightful elements: children are endearing and fascinating, and if you have some, you get to play with toys again and read children\u2019s books and remember your childhood. But illness, worry, conflict, overcrowding, the relentless cooking, the driving, the loss of privacy, the repression of your own sexuality, the education dilemmas, the lack of employment prospects, and all the wretched insanity of adolescence \u2013 these are big deterrents. You watch people get pregnant and know they\u2019ll be emotionally and intellectually absent for 20 years. Thought, knowledge, adult conversation and vital political action are all put on hold while this needless perpetuation of the species is prioritised. Having babies is a strong impulse, a forgivable one, but it\u2019s also just a habit, a tradition, like weddings or putting butter on popcorn. A couple months on from the Booker, how do you feel about the decision to award two prizes? It was a really crappy decision. Five judges and they can\u2019t reach a democratic result? But they were so determined to reward a famous author this year, they seem to have forgotten about fair and logical voting techniques. The glory of the award can apparently be doubled, not divided, so that\u2019s good. But it doesn\u2019t seem very nice to make the winners share the money! Why in hell would you give the first black woman to win the Booker half the dough? It\u2019s deeply mistaken and insulting. What I like about the Booker Foundation, a registered charity, is its arrangement with the RNIB. All the shortlisted books are recorded for the blind, and that\u2019s an honour. Your books are unabashedly, furiously feminist. Mimi ends with a great manifesto calling for the creation of a global matriarchy to save the planet. If you were in charge in such a world, what would you change and do with that power? If I were in charge? That\u2019s a rather patriarchal concept! Women should be in charge collectively. This leader shit doesn\u2019t seem to be getting us anywhere. But what would we change? Here\u2019s my plan, based on prehistoric matriarchal cultures (only called \u201cprehistoric\u201d, by the way, because they predate male rule): a three-hour working day, free health care, open borders, wealth redistribution, a fair-minded pooling of resources, and devotion to the common good, veneration of women, harmony with nature, more snow storms, respect for animals, more allotments (I just like the look of them), non-violence, a ban on all weaponry, an end to imprisonment and the beauty cult (another prison), and a moratorium on the mention of religion. (Pursue these belief systems if you must, but keep it to yourself.) And that includes the religions of exercise: jogging, yoga, aerobics, going to the stupid gym (you could be out planting trees!), along with mindfulness, plastic surgery and other supposed forms of self-improvement that really exist only to bug people. We need to raise the level of discourse to which our capitalist masters have relegated us. In service to this, we should redirect all our energies to a wholehearted concentration on the arts, our greatest achievement as a species. And everybody has to eat either Chinese, Indian, Spanish or Italian food. Well, I will anyway. \u2022 Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellmann is published by Galley Beggar Press (\u00a313.99).

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.katrinakarkazis.com/\" title=\"\">Katrina Karkazis</a>, a senior research fellow at Yale University, is a cultural anthropologist working at the intersection of science, technology, gender studies and bioethics. With <a href=\"https://womensstudies.barnard.edu/profiles/rebecca-jordan-young\" title=\"\">Rebecca Jordan-Young</a>, a sociomedical scientist, she has written <em>Testosterone: An Unauthorised Biography</em>. It is a critique of both popular and scientific understandings of the hormone, and how they have been used to explain, or even defend, inequalities of power.</p> <p><strong>You suggest that testosterone is understood as an exclusively </strong><strong>male hormone, even though it\u2019s also found in women. But surely no scientist believes this. </strong><br>No, what we\u2019re saying is that the hormone has a century-long biography and identity that continues to be that of a male sex hormone. That language is used by authoritative sources in the US like the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/\" title=\"\">National Library of Medicine</a>, but also in many media articles. It\u2019s an argument that has to do with how the hormone is understood, which then shapes the kinds of research questions that get asked, what kinds of research get done or not done. There\u2019s actually almost no research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression in women. That is a consequence of the framing of the hormone as having to do with men, masculinity, behaviours understood and framed as masculine. It\u2019s the idea that because men generally have more testosterone, somehow that makes it more relevant in men. But the truth is we know very little about it.</p> <p><strong>You write that testosterone\u2019s authorised</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>biography is about libido, aggression and masculinity. Does this mean that testosterone is not about these things? </strong><br>I think that it\u2019s still very widely understood as the driver of all things masculine. When people think about testosterone, aggression is one of the first things that comes to mind. But when you look at the evidence, there\u2019s not good evidence at all. In fact, it\u2019s very weak regarding the relationship between endogenous testosterone [ie testosterone that originates within an organism] and aggression. So it\u2019s an artefact of the ideology of testosterone that we continue to believe that it drives aggression, because aggression has been framed as a masculine behaviour and testosterone has been framed as a masculine hormone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Testosterone responds to\u00a0social cues. If a coach gives\u00a0you positive feedback, that can\u00a0raise your testosterone level</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Regarding libido, there\u2019s this idea that a lot of testosterone is what\u2019s needed to experience sexual desire or to have a libido. But again, the research shows that you actually need relatively low levels of testosterone to have perfectly fine sexual functioning. And indeed, in some of the most extensive clinical trials where they\u2019ve supplemented men who are ageing with testosterone, it had a weak relationship with sexual function. If you\u2019re taking testosterone to improve functioning in libido, the research suggests you would be far better off taking Viagra.</p> <p><strong>Your book has been criticised for overlooking the experience of trans men who</strong><strong> have reported increased sex drive</strong><strong> having received testosterone supplements. Is that a fair criticism? </strong><br>We explain why we don\u2019t focus on any aspect of taking testosterone. The reason we\u2019ve done that is that the root connections in the science between all kinds of behaviours come from studies of endogenous testosterone.

The relationship between testosterone and athleticism is very complicated. One of the things that people often think about this hormone is that you have a level, and that level produces a behaviour or an outcome. So in the context of sport, higher testosterone, better performance, right? But the truth is, testosterone is a very dynamic hormone. It\u2019s actually responsive to social cues and situations. For example, if a coach gives you positive feedback, that can raise your testosterone level. Testosterone affects muscle but research has shown that it can affect different muscles in the body within the same person quite differently. Where we run into trouble is trying to make comparisons across individuals based on testosterone levels. Sometimes it\u2019s individuals with lower testosterone who do better. So it\u2019s not as simple as saying more testosterone equals better performance.</p> <p><strong>You write: \u201cThe science is clear, there is no single, physiological or biological marker that allows for the simple categori</strong><strong>sation of people as male or female.\u201d Would you say, then, that male and female are false categories? </strong><br>No, they\u2019re very real categories. What that statement means is that you can\u2019t use chromosomes alone, you can\u2019t use genitalia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/06/testosterone-biological-sex-sports-bodies\">you can\u2019t use testosterone levels to divide people into male or female</a>. Science isn\u2019t the only way to understand how to think about who\u2019s a man and who\u2019s a woman. Some people argue that identity should be the determinant, irrespective of physiology. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t have the categories just because sex is complex. It means that the categories can be made to accommodate that complexity.</p> <p><strong>You write that \u201cscientism\u201d is a culprit in the misrepresentation of testosterone. What do you mean by scientism? And why is it culpable? </strong><br>Scientism is really the idea that science is the best or primary way of generating knowledge. What it essentially does is elevate scientific values, scientific authority and scientific evidence above all other modes of knowing \u2013 sociological, experiential, philosophical. It says that scientific knowledge is knowledge itself. This is not to undermine the role of science, but we do see that in certain kinds of debates about particular issues, people view science as the only arbiter, the only way to understand or settle an issue. Science is an aid to help us understand something. But it doesn\u2019t answer what we should do about it. We draw on other understandings and frameworks to do that. Ethics, values, human rights, whatever it might be.</p> <p><strong>Do you hope that your book will change the orthodox understanding of testosterone? </strong><br>Yes we do. We\u2019d like to broaden the cultural narratives, but also broaden the kind of scientific questions that are asked. It\u2019s not an attack on science. We say in the introduction, we take the science very seriously, but not literally. And that\u2019s why we spend a long time looking very closely at the methods, not to make an ideological argument, but very often a methodological argument. Our hope is that it encourages scientists working on testosterone to think about its dynamism, to think about its complexity. And to try to broaden the role of the social in some of the studies that are being done. We have biosocial models now that people are using to study complex behaviours.

      "bodyText": "Katrina Karkazis, a senior research fellow at Yale University, is a cultural anthropologist working at the intersection of science, technology, gender studies and bioethics. With Rebecca Jordan-Young, a sociomedical scientist, she has written Testosterone: An Unauthorised Biography. It is a critique of both popular and scientific understandings of the hormone, and how they have been used to explain, or even defend, inequalities of power. You suggest that testosterone is understood as an exclusively male hormone, even though it\u2019s also found in women. But surely no scientist believes this. No, what we\u2019re saying is that the hormone has a century-long biography and identity that continues to be that of a male sex hormone. That language is used by authoritative sources in the US like the National Library of Medicine, but also in many media articles. It\u2019s an argument that has to do with how the hormone is understood, which then shapes the kinds of research questions that get asked, what kinds of research get done or not done. There\u2019s actually almost no research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression in women. That is a consequence of the framing of the hormone as having to do with men, masculinity, behaviours understood and framed as masculine. It\u2019s the idea that because men generally have more testosterone, somehow that makes it more relevant in men. But the truth is we know very little about it. You write that testosterone\u2019s authorised biography is about libido, aggression and masculinity. Does this mean that testosterone is not about these things? I think that it\u2019s still very widely understood as the driver of all things masculine. When people think about testosterone, aggression is one of the first things that comes to mind. But when you look at the evidence, there\u2019s not good evidence at all. In fact, it\u2019s very weak regarding the relationship between endogenous testosterone [ie testosterone that originates within an organism] and aggression. So it\u2019s an artefact of the ideology of testosterone that we continue to believe that it drives aggression, because aggression has been framed as a masculine behaviour and testosterone has been framed as a masculine hormone. Regarding libido, there\u2019s this idea that a lot of testosterone is what\u2019s needed to experience sexual desire or to have a libido. But again, the research shows that you actually need relatively low levels of testosterone to have perfectly fine sexual functioning. And indeed, in some of the most extensive clinical trials where they\u2019ve supplemented men who are ageing with testosterone, it had a weak relationship with sexual function. If you\u2019re taking testosterone to improve functioning in libido, the research suggests you would be far better off taking Viagra. Your book has been criticised for overlooking the experience of trans men who have reported increased sex drive having received testosterone supplements. Is that a fair criticism? We explain why we don\u2019t focus on any aspect of taking testosterone. The reason we\u2019ve done that is that the root connections in the science between all kinds of behaviours come from studies of endogenous testosterone. And if there\u2019s going to be a link, it\u2019s going to be found in those studies. So they\u2019re not studies that supplement with testosterone. Men are around 20 times more likely than women to go to prison. Is your argument that there is no biological reason for this, or simply that the biology has not been established? It\u2019s the latter. The bodies of research we\u2019re talking about, where there\u2019s a weak link between testosterone and aggression, have very often been studies done on prisoners.

The regime initially blamed \u201cZionists\u201d, and \u201cforeign outlaws\u201d. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, pointed to a \u201cdangerous conspiracy\u201d implicating the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia. But such claims persuade nobody. Iran\u2019s clerics seem to have experienced genuine shock at the depth of their own unpopularity, and the willingness of ordinary citizens to challenge their rule despite a brutal crackdown. Belatedly sensing the full extent of public fury at home, the regime has now softened its tone, saying it will show \u201cIslamic mercy\u201d to those arrested. Before resuming their Gulf grudge match, both sides should ask themselves what they want to achieve \u2013 and whether dialogue might better serve their purposes. All have much to lose. Appearing to recognise this, Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u2019s president, repeated an offer to talk, but only if sanctions were lifted first. Trump has not replied. Iran\u2019s internal troubles undoubtedly owe much to US sanctions. But the idea that, by further increasing external pressure, the regime can be forced to bow to US-Israeli demands, or else be toppled from within, remains fanciful in the extreme. Likewise, Iran\u2019s apparent calculation that Trump, seeking re-election next year and averse to waging foreign wars, will not attack is dangerously complacent. And they should know by now that Europe, cowed by Washington, will not ride to the rescue. If Tehran is pushed too far, if the regime\u2019s survival is in doubt, if ethnic and regional cracks begin to show, and if fundamentalists in the clergy, IRGC and judiciary seize control of policy, Iran may hit out in ways that could be utterly disastrous all round. And if either Trump or Netanyahu (or both), made desperate by corruption scandals, facing political extinction and driven by hubris, decides to create a grand drama in which he can star as national saviour, then batten down the hatches. It\u2019s Gulf War III.",

Tottenham Hotspur 5-0 Burnley The Man of the Day award goes to... Final scores You can check all today\u2019s results here. These were the final scores in our featured games. Premier League Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool Tottenham 5-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Championship Fulham 1-2 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 Brentford League One Coventry 1-1 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 3-2 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 3-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 2-1 Bayern Liverpool P16 W15 D1 L0 F40 A16 You might not like them, but you\u2019d have to be a rare old plonker to deny their sheer brilliance. They would give any team in English football history a run for their money. \u2018Run\u2019 being the operative word. The buggers never stop. They are the perfect fusion of attitude and aptitude. Despite a ferocious late onslaught from the home side, Bristol City hold on to beat Fulham and move up to fourth in the table. Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool Ben Fisher has already filed his report from the Vitality Stadium, where the best team in the world swaggered to victory. Jose\u2019s swashbucklers move up to fifth in the table. They are now only six points behind Chelsea. Fulham 1-2 Bristol City Fulham are denied an apparently stonewall penalty, and it\u2019s all kicking off at Craven Cottage as a result. \u201cNot all good news for Liverpool,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cWe have just ended our record run without a clean sheet.\u201d A tedious game ends with a bit of aggro. In a surprising development, Wilfried Zaha was heavily involved. Liverpool move 11 points clear with another comprehensive victory. Not even the apocalypse can stop them now. \u201cA clean sheet for Liverpool,\u201d says Ian Croasdale, \u201cwould be most welcome!\u201d You\u2019ve got Joe Gomez in your Fantasy team, I can tell. Aboubakar Kamara gives Fulham a bit of hope at Craven Cottage. A couple of goals in our featured games Northampton have pulled one back at Exeter - they trail 3-2 now - while Hibs have gone 3-0 up against Aberdeen. Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace The scoreline still flatters both sides, it says here. \u201cIF, IF it happens,\u201d says Peter Butterworth of Liverpool winning the title, \u201cwe do promise to be utterly unbearable.\u201d I\u2019m quite sad that I won\u2019t be around to experience such a momentous occasion. I had no idea this was on the cards when I booked a nuclear bunker in the Kerguelen Islands from March-June 2020. \u201cRob,\u201d says James Boyle. \u201cThe Fiver had a Stop Football campaign some years ago, If we Stop Football this weekend, do Liverpool win the league?\u201d No, I think Everton and Manchester United do. Bristol City have doubled their lead at Craven Cottage, and are on course to move level on points with third-placed Fulham. Poor old Sol His Southend were 2-0 up at Bristol Rovers. They now trail 3-2. He might have to play himself at this rate. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Matty Spillum. \u201cDoes Burnley\u2019s recent form strike a fearful blow to the proper football man set?\u201d Why are you asking me? I\u2019m wearing my Julian Nagelsmann underpants. Steven Fletcher has scored again! His second goal in five minutes gives Sheffield Wednesday the lead against play-off rivals BRENTFORD. The team news is in for the Manchester derby, and Scott Murray is about to dispense it. The reinvention of Jose Mourinho continues. Moussa Sissoko has put his freewheeling Spurs side 5-0 up against Burnley. Steven Fletcher\u2019s penalty brings Sheffield Wednesday level, deservedly so, against Brentford. \u201cWinning at a canter is my preference as it is much better for my blood pressure,\u201d says Mike MacKenzie. \u201cMy fear is that around May 1 the PL will determine that Liverpool failed to register some secondary player who made 10 late substitute appearances and we\u2019ll lose the 30 points from those matches.\u201d Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool \u201cGiven the number of late winners and VAR controv, I wouldn\u2019t be calling this season a \u2018serene procession\u2019, for Liverpool\u201d says Marv. \u201cFun, though.\u201d You\u2019re not looking at the whole pie, Jenny. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Bournemouth 0-3 Liverpool Tottenham 4-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Chelsea (FT) Championship Fulham 0-1 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Brentford Huddersfield 0-2 Leeds (FT) League One Coventry 1-1 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 3-1 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 2-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 2-1 Bayern (FT) Two goals from Martin Boyle - yes, yes, I missed the first - have put Hibernian in control against Aberdeen. Two in two minutes for Exeter. Ramy Bensebaini\u2019s injury-time penalty has put Monchengladbach seven points clear of Bayern, who drop to sixth in the table. Exeter have come from behind to lead in-form Northampton. The leaders have stolen victory against the champions! \u201cHere\u2019s a truly terrifying thought about this year\u2019s Liverpool side,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI was saying to my friend David who was born in Liverpool and knows the team from Shankly\u2019s days, \u2018If a young Ian Rush arrives on the training ground, who does he replace?\u2019 Neither of us had an answer. If Ian freaking Rush can\u2019t start for your team, you\u2019ve got one hell of a team.\u201d Or you have a team that doesn\u2019t play with a classical No9. It\u2019s almost impossible to compare Roberto Firmino and Rush, because apart from their phenomenal defensive work they have very little in common. It\u2019s there! \u201cSTOP TALKING ABOUT US WINNING THE TITLE!!\u201d says JJ. \u201cEvery time people mention it I break out in cold sweats that the whole team is going to break out with a severe bout of norovirus, Hicks and Gillett are going to buy us in the new year and we re-sign Charlie Adam, Stewart Downing et al.\u201d In fairness, Andy Carroll has hit form of late, and you can never have too much squad depth. Bundesliga Jadon Sancho has scored twice for Borussia Dortmund, who are crushing Fortuna Dusseldorf 5-0. They will move up to third unless Bayern get a late winner in Monchengladbach. \u201cThat Son wonder goal immediately reminded me of George Weah\u2019s 1996 solo run vs Verona, which is here in full Channel 4 glory,\u201d says Jeremy Dresner. \u201cIn the sexy sprinting category for sure!\u201d Harry Kane gets his second of the game with another thumping strike. An insouciant flick from Mo Salah puts Liverpool 3-0 up, and 11 points clear. League Two The leaders Swindon are in complete control at Blundell Park; they lead Grimsby 3-0. Great solo goals We\u2019ve updated an old Joy of Six to include Son\u2019s masterpiece. \u201cYou can give it the big \u2018Liverpool are going to be champions\u2019 all you like, I\u2019m not buying it,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201c93 minutes into Newcastle away, if they\u2019re still top, I might start to believe. But even then, I think I\u2019ll probably worry that the whole season could be under VAR review: \u2018Decision Pending - No Title.\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s a question for Liverpool fans: will it feel weird, after waiting for so long, to win it at a canter? I always assumed that, when it happened, it would be an emotional rollercoaster (like 2013-14 would have been) rather than a serene procession. \u201cRob,\u201d says Simon Pennington. \u201cThey\u2019re already playing that Son goal on a loop at half time.\u201d And that\u2019s just at Watford. Ramy Bensebaini rams a header past Manuel Neuer to bring the Bundesliga leaders level! Here\u2019s Simon McMahon, generously doing my job ... so I don\u2019t have to! \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Simon. \u201cRunaway Scottish Championship leaders drawing 1-1 with lowly Alloa at a dreich Tannadice. Nicky Clark with the leveller on the stroke of half time. Expect Lawrence Shankland to finish the job from the bench in the second half. Elsewhere, Arbroath lead beleaguered Dundee 1-0, as do Inverness at home to Ayr. I think there\u2018s a game tomorrow between two Glasgow teams as well...\u201d \u201cWe aren\u2019t champions yet, it\u2019s early December - don\u2019t jinx it!\u201d says Sam Trenery. \u201cUnless that\u2019s the intention. Aside from that - I\u2019m really happy to see Keita on the scoresheet. There\u2019s a seemingly unending hope from our fans that he will come as good as he was meant to be when we signed him. Let\u2019s hope he can kick on now.\u201d The problem for him, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, is getting a regular game. It\u2019s hard to see that happening, certainly in the short-term, even though they are both cracking players. In fact, Oxlade-Chamberlain is probably more deserving of a regular place with his country than with his club. The half-time scores in our featured games Premier League Bournemouth 0-2 Liverpool Tottenham 3-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Chelsea (FT) Championship Fulham 0-1 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Brentford Huddersfield 0-2 Leeds (FT) League One Coventry 0-1 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 1-1 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 0-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga As things stand, RB Leipzig are top of the table. They lead Hoffenheim 2-0, while Bayern are 1-0 up at Monchengladbach. Everything Jurgen Klopp rotates turns to gold. Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri scored against Everton in the week; now Naby Keita has probably sealed victory at Bournemouth with a cool finish from Mo Salah\u2019s beautiful backheel. There\u2019s no two ways about it: Liverpool are going to be champions. Sol Campbell\u2019s Southend lead 2-0 at Bristol Rovers. ICYMI , this is a cracking interview with Sol by our own Jonathan Liew. Tottenham 3-0 Burnley Jay Rodriguez heads a simple chance wide from Dwight McNeil\u2019s gorgeous cross. Ivan Perisic gives Bayern a deserved lead in the meeting of the Bundesliga leaders and champions, lashing a shot through Yann Sommer. A quickfire equaliser for Exeter. Randell Williams is the man spreading cheer around St James Park. These are the latest scores in our featured games. I\u2019ve even got the correct opponent for Sheffield Wednesday this time. Premier League Bournemouth 0-1 Liverpool Tottenham 3-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Chelsea (FT) Championship Fulham 0-1 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Brentford Huddersfield 0-2 Leeds (FT) League One Coventry 0-1 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 0-1 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 0-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 0-0 Bayern (2.30pm) Moments after Nathan Ake limps off injured, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gives the leaders Liverpool the lead from close range. They are on course to go 11 (E-L-E-V-etc) points clear. Charlie Goode has given in-form Northampton the lead in League Two\u2019s big game. Keane... Will Keane! Son has made it 3-0 with an astonishing solo goal. He picked the ball up on the edge of the area. The Spurs area. Then he ran the length of the pitch, beating allcomers in the process, and slipped the ball past Nick Pope. The king of the solo goal, Matt Le Tissier has a big dumb grin on his face and has proclaimed it the Goal of the Season on Sky Sports. Bryan Mbeumo gives Brentford the lead, heading home from a wrongly awarded corner. Tottenham 2-0 Burnley \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that makes me worry more than Spurs going two down in the first ten minutes,\u201d says Ian Davis, \u201cit\u2019s Spurs going two up in the first ten minutes.\u201d Surely Spursiness and Jose Mourinho are mutually exclusive concepts? In the battle between third and fifth, Bristol City take a deserved lead through an emphatic header from Josh Brownhill. A lovely moment on Sky Soccer Saturday, where Paul Merson\u2019s voice crackles with childlike glee as he realises how easy it is to pronounce the name of Bournemouth winger Danjuma. Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace By all accounts, the 0-0 scoreline flatters both sides. Bournemouth 0-0 Liverpool It\u2019s all quiet on the southern front. Liverpool have dominated the match without creating any clear chances. Tottenham 2-0 Burnley Robbie Brady has hit the underside of the bar for Burnley, so perhaps that match isn\u2019t over. Talking of which... \u201cHave you forgotten the new law that specifies Spurs have to concede two goals in every game they play under Jose?\u201d writes Anthony Turi. \u201cDo you mean we can just write this game off as a score draw right now?\u201d The patented Guardian Score Guesser\u2122, having processed the first 20 minutes, suggests it will finish Spurs 74-2 Burnley. Tottenham 2-0 Burnley Now Dele Alli has missed a great chance for Spurs, who are thoroughly rampant. Tottenham 2-0 Burnley Moussa Sissoko has hit the post for Spurs, who are all over Burnley like a cheap clich\u00e9. The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Bournemouth 0-0 Liverpool Tottenham 2-0 Burnley Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Chelsea (FT) Championship Fulham 0-0 Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Preston North End Huddersfield 0-2 Leeds (FT) League One Coventry 0-0 Ipswich Town League Two Exeter 0-0 Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian 0-0 Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 0-0 Bayern (2.30pm) \u201cI\u2019m not worrying about Virgil not getting a rest, as he rarely seems to exert himself,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cOften, the only real stressful part of his game is the energy he has to put into shouting at his fellow defenders.\u201d Lucas Moura scores from a yard to double Spurs\u2019 lead against Burnley. That game is already over. Live scores! You can follow all the goals as they go in around Europe by clicking this thing here. Bundesliga It\u2019s still Monchengladbach 0-0 Bayern, but Bayern have been very dominant and could easily be a couple of goals ahead. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cRight about now, Klopp is probably ordering his crew to set phasers to stun.\u201d I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ANY OF THIS STAR TREK STUFF MEANS. Harold Kane Esquire gives Spurs an early lead with a fierce hit from 25 yards. \u201cThere is a view,\u201d says John Tumbridge, \u201cthat the only reason Ferguson was still employed at Everton was because no one had the courage to tell him to sling his hook.\u201d There\u2019s a drone for that. Peep peep! It\u2019s 3pm, which means the 3pm kick-offs have kicked off! \u201cIf teams are Star Trek line-ups,\u201d begins Ian Copestake, \u201cthen Arsenal quite possibly provide the guys beamed down to the planet with Kirk that no one has seen before or will see again.\u201d That\u2019s extremely harsh on Andr\u00e9 Clarindo dos Santos (born 8 March 1983), more commonly known as Andr\u00e9 Santos, is a Brazilian footballer who most recently played for Figueirense. Bundesliga It\u2019s Borussia Monchengladbach 0-0 Bayern Munich after 20 minutes of the big game in Germany. Bayern have had most of the ball but neither side has had a shot on target, it says here. RB Leipzig, who are second, lead Hoffenheim 1-0. Premier League And here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s report on Everton 3-1 Chelsea. La Liga Here\u2019s more on Real Madrid\u2019s comfortable with over Espanyol, which put them top of the table for at least the next few hours. \u201cGosh Rob, I\u2019d be scared to tell van Dijk he was out of the line-up and I wonder if Jurgen Klopp feels the same,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI\u2019m sure VVD has his light and whimsical side, but from all I\u2019ve seen \u2013 and this is my club, remember \u2013 if they were still making Star Trek movies and you needed an athlete to play a Klingon (as basketball\u2019s James Worthy did) could you think of anyone better? \u2018Prune juice. A warrior\u2019s drink.\u2019\u201d Championship Leeds have gone top of the table with a 2-0 win at Huddersfield. Both goals were crackers - Ezgjan\u2019s Alioski\u2019s volley and a header from Pablo Hernandez to complete a lovely counter-attack. Premier League Everton have beaten Chelsea 3-1 in the early kick-off at Goodison Park. The infectious fervour of Duncan Ferguson made for a classic Goodison occasion; his celebrations alone were worth the ticket price, and I suspect Everton fans will be talking about this day for years. Not because they beat Chelsea, but because Big Dunc\u2019s team beat Chelsea. Brilliant stuff. Liverpool\u2019s packed schedule has forced Jurgen Klopp to embrace rotation in the last couple of weeks. For today\u2019s game, Sadio Mane and Trent Alexander-Arnold are rested. It\u2019s notable, if unsurprising, that there is one player who is yet to be rotated. Virgil van Dijk has started Liverpool\u2019s last 66 Premier League games. (I\u2019m pretty sure that statistic is correct. If it\u2019s not, deal wiv it.)

Championship Leeds, who started the day in second, lead Huddersfield 1-0 thanks to a sizzling volley from Ezgjan Alioski. There are just over 20 minutes remaining in that game. La Liga Real Madrid have beaten Espanyol 2-0 to go top of the table. Raphael Varane and Karim Benzema troubled the scorers. The leaders Liverpool will go 11 points clear, at least for the next 23 hours, if they win at Bournemouth. They famously lost 4-3 at the Vitality Stadium three seasons ago, having been 3-1 up, though that was in the slightly shambolic days before VAR - Virgil, Alisson and Robertson. On their last two trips to Bournemouth, Liverpool have won emphatically, 4-0 each time. Hello and welcome to coverage of another bumper afternoon of association soccer. There are only three 3pm kick offs in the Premier League, but there are plenty of other sources of the old entertainment. One of the more intriguing fixtures is in Germany, where the leaders Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach host the champions Bayern Munich. You can see a full list of fixtures here. We\u2019re unable, in the absence of 482 hands, to focus on all of them. So these are our featured games this afternoon (all 3pm kick-offs unless stated, but you probably knew that anyway, and in truth we could have done without this parenthesis, especially as it\u2019s starting to go on a bit. For heaven\u2019s sake, it\u2019s taken up more than half of this paragraph!). Premier League Bournemouth v Liverpool Spurs v Burnley Watford v Crystal Palace Championship Fulham v Bristol City Sheffield Wednesday v Preston North End League One Coventry v Ipswich Town League Two Exeter v Northampton Scottish Premiership Hibernian v Aberdeen Bundesliga Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach v Bayern (2.30pm) We\u2019ll have team news and all that jazz imminently. In the meantime, you can follow Everton v Chelsea with Scott Murray. You\u2019ll not believe the score!",

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s today\u2019s fun fact: the word \u201ccanvas\u201d is derived from \u201ccannabis\u201d. (And imagine if the two words had still been identical this past century or so: literature would speak of cannabis-covered deck shoes, of boy scouts enjoying their life under cannabis, of going cannabissing for your parliamentary candidate.) There is a simple reason for this etymology. Among the many uses of hemp, the plant from which the drug comes \u2013 uses that include ropes, clothes, food and medicine \u2013 was the fabric for the sails of ships.</p> <p>Once commonplace and useful, and hailed in the 1930s as a \u201cbillion-dollar crop\u201d, hemp\u2019s modern promise was cut short by its association with narcotics, which led its production to be taxed and outlawed across the western world. Call it paranoia, call it realism, but there\u2019s a theory that billionaires with interests in plastics and paper pulp successfully lobbied the US government to have their rival product suppressed. A war on drugs, in this account, was whipped up in order to deepen the public\u2019s dependency on petrochemicals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de0ffa9013960af5464c42cd4bb5d09cc48dcfc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de0ffa9013960af5464c42cd4bb5d09cc48dcfc0/0_0_3840_5249/732.jpg\" alt=\"Flar House close-up\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Retains the character of a recently growing thing\u2019: Flat House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oskar Proctor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, though, hemp looks like a miracle plant, to a point that seems almost too good to be true. Its growth gobbles carbon and replenishes the soil, killing weeds without resort to chemicals. It can be used to detoxify poisoned land. It can make organic alternatives to plastic. BMW use it inside their car door panels. In December 2018 Donald Trump signed the Hemp Farming Act, which relegalised the cultivation of the industrial, non-psychoactive strain of the plant. He wouldn\u2019t have done this, one might guess, if there hadn\u2019t been money in it.</p> <p>And you can<a href=\"https://www.ukhemp.co.uk/articles/hemp-for-construction\" title=\"\"> build with hemp</a>, as a growing global network of enthusiasts <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/science/hemp-homes-cannabis.html\" title=\"\">wants everyone to know</a>. In this country the plant\u2019s properties have inspired <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xzxKFURl80\" title=\"\">Steve Barron</a>, a producer and director of TV and film, and his business partner Fawnda Denham to buy a farm in Cambridgeshire and \u2013 having first been checked out by the police \u2013 grow hemp there, which they are developing into commercial products. On that site, <a href=\"https://margentfarm.com/\" title=\"\">Margent Farm</a>, they have commissioned a house.</p> <p>It is designed by the 10-year-old <a href=\"https://practicearchitecture.co.uk\" title=\"\">Practice Architecture</a>, who made their name with the ultra-low-budget Frank\u2019s Caf\u00e9. This structure serves Bold Tendencies, the summer arts programme held each year on the top of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/27/multi-story-orchestra-review-proms-bold-tendencies-peckham-car-park-choir\" title=\"\">a multi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/27/multi-story-orchestra-review-proms-bold-tendencies-peckham-car-park-choir\" title=\"\">storey car park in Peckham,</a> south London. Like other projects by Practice, it exemplifies their hands-on approach, their interest in getting closely involved with the construction as well as the design of buildings.</p> <p>Flat House, as the home on Margent Farm is called, is the conversion of a steel-framed agricultural shed, within which a new structure has been made of prefabricated timber-framed cassettes that were filled with a mulch of hemp, lime and water known as hempcrete. Once the mulch was dry they were erected into thick, highly insulating walls that also hold the building up. The exterior is covered in corrugated panels, which at first glance looks like the cement cladding typical of farm sheds. It is actually made of fibres from the outer coating of hemp stalks combined with resin taken from agricultural waste. It has a livelier texture and a more translucent quality than cement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97bc1a98fb088e9696564338090529daf357fbd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97bc1a98fb088e9696564338090529daf357fbd0/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"inside Flat House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Layers of openness and enclosure\u2019: inside Flat House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oskar Proctor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These techniques are not all groundbreaking. Hempcrete goes back to the 1980s; Kevin McCloud used hemp-based insulation on his<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/19/kevin-mccloud-housing-triangle-swindon\" title=\"\"> HAB housing project in Swindon</a> in 2011. What is special at Margent Farm is that the material makes the architecture. Whereas in Swindon the houses are finished with conventional plaster and render, here you get to see the hemp, inside and out.</p> <p>McCloud, you might say, didn\u2019t inhale. At Flat House you get a feeling rare in contemporary buildings, which comes from its unity of substance and surface. In most modern construction, as Paloma Gormley of Practice Architecture puts it, \u201cyou have five or six layers of stuff\u201d \u2013 paint, plasterboard, insulation, vapour barriers and waterproof membranes, structure, cladding \u2013 which make houses, like modern phones and cars, inscrutable to their users. You can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on. You need an expert to mend it. Flat House is, Gormley says, \u201clegible and fixable, more accessible to clients \u2013 you can take ownership of a house like this\u201d. You can see where you can and can\u2019t hammer in a nail, for example, to hang a picture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8701482cd1e03fc581dea2903291eac6e873ae76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8701482cd1e03fc581dea2903291eac6e873ae76/0_0_3805_5707/667.jpg\" alt=\"inside Flat House.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The cassettes in which the hemp is formed, eight foot by four foot, give a rhythm and scale to the interior that comes from the making of the building. The exposed material, its texture reminiscent of straw bales, retains the character of a recently growing thing, given a ghostly sheen by the whiteness of the lime. It creates, together with the pale timber that frames it, a soothing tonal range of pinkish greys. The acoustic is soft and restful too. Although the house is built of organic and relatively light materials, it has some of the sense of mass and substance you get in old masonry construction.</p> <p>The house, which is quite small, is given generosity by both a high living area and a big glazed conservatory that occupies the full height of the old shed. The skinny steel and the thick walls create layers of openness and enclosure between inside and out, and different degrees of contact with and shelter from the elements. All around are the fields \u2013 a lovely fact, this \u2013 from where the stuff of the house came. A little way off is another structure built with similar techniques, a single-storey studio constructed by students from the Cass school of architecture in London, under the guidance of Gormley and the photographer David Grandorge, who teach together there.</p> <p>All this is, in principle, environmentally wonderful, the house being made mostly of materials that absorb rather than emit carbon. The project therefore addresses a vital issue that was until recently neglected by most architects, which is the energy consumed and the carbon emitted while buildings are constructed, as opposed to while they are in use.</p> <p>The challenge is how to scale the techniques up to the extent that they make a significant impact on the emissions of the building industry. To this end Gormley has set up a not-for-profit organisation, <a href=\"https://materialcultures.org/\" title=\"\">Material Cultures</a>, in partnership with her fellow architect Summer Islam, the engineers Arup, the University of the Arts London, University College London, and the brick manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.hgmatthews.com/\" title=\"\">HG Matthews</a>.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s today\u2019s fun fact: the word \u201ccanvas\u201d is derived from \u201ccannabis\u201d. (And imagine if the two words had still been identical this past century or so: literature would speak of cannabis-covered deck shoes, of boy scouts enjoying their life under cannabis, of going cannabissing for your parliamentary candidate.) There is a simple reason for this etymology. Among the many uses of hemp, the plant from which the drug comes \u2013 uses that include ropes, clothes, food and medicine \u2013 was the fabric for the sails of ships. Once commonplace and useful, and hailed in the 1930s as a \u201cbillion-dollar crop\u201d, hemp\u2019s modern promise was cut short by its association with narcotics, which led its production to be taxed and outlawed across the western world. Call it paranoia, call it realism, but there\u2019s a theory that billionaires with interests in plastics and paper pulp successfully lobbied the US government to have their rival product suppressed. A war on drugs, in this account, was whipped up in order to deepen the public\u2019s dependency on petrochemicals. Now, though, hemp looks like a miracle plant, to a point that seems almost too good to be true. Its growth gobbles carbon and replenishes the soil, killing weeds without resort to chemicals. It can be used to detoxify poisoned land. It can make organic alternatives to plastic. BMW use it inside their car door panels. In December 2018 Donald Trump signed the Hemp Farming Act, which relegalised the cultivation of the industrial, non-psychoactive strain of the plant. He wouldn\u2019t have done this, one might guess, if there hadn\u2019t been money in it. And you can build with hemp, as a growing global network of enthusiasts wants everyone to know. In this country the plant\u2019s properties have inspired Steve Barron, a producer and director of TV and film, and his business partner Fawnda Denham to buy a farm in Cambridgeshire and \u2013 having first been checked out by the police \u2013 grow hemp there, which they are developing into commercial products. On that site, Margent Farm, they have commissioned a house. It is designed by the 10-year-old Practice Architecture, who made their name with the ultra-low-budget Frank\u2019s Caf\u00e9. This structure serves Bold Tendencies, the summer arts programme held each year on the top of a multistorey car park in Peckham, south London. Like other projects by Practice, it exemplifies their hands-on approach, their interest in getting closely involved with the construction as well as the design of buildings. Flat House, as the home on Margent Farm is called, is the conversion of a steel-framed agricultural shed, within which a new structure has been made of prefabricated timber-framed cassettes that were filled with a mulch of hemp, lime and water known as hempcrete. Once the mulch was dry they were erected into thick, highly insulating walls that also hold the building up. The exterior is covered in corrugated panels, which at first glance looks like the cement cladding typical of farm sheds. It is actually made of fibres from the outer coating of hemp stalks combined with resin taken from agricultural waste. It has a livelier texture and a more translucent quality than cement. These techniques are not all groundbreaking. Hempcrete goes back to the 1980s; Kevin McCloud used hemp-based insulation on his HAB housing project in Swindon in 2011. What is special at Margent Farm is that the material makes the architecture. Whereas in Swindon the houses are finished with conventional plaster and render, here you get to see the hemp, inside and out. McCloud, you might say, didn\u2019t inhale. At Flat House you get a feeling rare in contemporary buildings, which comes from its unity of substance and surface. In most modern construction, as Paloma Gormley of Practice Architecture puts it, \u201cyou have five or six layers of stuff\u201d \u2013 paint, plasterboard, insulation, vapour barriers and waterproof membranes, structure, cladding \u2013 which make houses, like modern phones and cars, inscrutable to their users. You can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on. You need an expert to mend it. Flat House is, Gormley says, \u201clegible and fixable, more accessible to clients \u2013 you can take ownership of a house like this\u201d. You can see where you can and can\u2019t hammer in a nail, for example, to hang a picture. The cassettes in which the hemp is formed, eight foot by four foot, give a rhythm and scale to the interior that comes from the making of the building. The exposed material, its texture reminiscent of straw bales, retains the character of a recently growing thing, given a ghostly sheen by the whiteness of the lime. It creates, together with the pale timber that frames it, a soothing tonal range of pinkish greys. The acoustic is soft and restful too. Although the house is built of organic and relatively light materials, it has some of the sense of mass and substance you get in old masonry construction. The house, which is quite small, is given generosity by both a high living area and a big glazed conservatory that occupies the full height of the old shed. The skinny steel and the thick walls create layers of openness and enclosure between inside and out, and different degrees of contact with and shelter from the elements. All around are the fields \u2013 a lovely fact, this \u2013 from where the stuff of the house came. A little way off is another structure built with similar techniques, a single-storey studio constructed by students from the Cass school of architecture in London, under the guidance of Gormley and the photographer David Grandorge, who teach together there. All this is, in principle, environmentally wonderful, the house being made mostly of materials that absorb rather than emit carbon. The project therefore addresses a vital issue that was until recently neglected by most architects, which is the energy consumed and the carbon emitted while buildings are constructed, as opposed to while they are in use. The challenge is how to scale the techniques up to the extent that they make a significant impact on the emissions of the building industry. To this end Gormley has set up a not-for-profit organisation, Material Cultures, in partnership with her fellow architect Summer Islam, the engineers Arup, the University of the Arts London, University College London, and the brick manufacturers HG Matthews. Its aim is to research building systems and components using hemp and other natural materials, to manufacture them at HT Matthews\u2019s Buckinghamshire factory, and to apply them more widely than on the occasional delightful house. With this combined technical expertise Paloma Gormley wants \u201cto put figures to things that we know are inherently true\u201d, that what she called \u201clow technology high performance methods\u201d can produce genuinely sustainable architecture. They want to prove the point in both theory and practice. A proposed development of 40 new houses in Cornwall is, it is hoped, the next step. Miracle materials can have a way of turning out less so in practice. Unexpected costs and consequences tend to arise. Established industries are reluctant to adapt to them. But hemp, benign in both production and in use, which can also beautify the experience of living in a house, deserves its shot at becoming a mainstream building material.

The onus has long been on women to facilitate easy human relations, and lone reading is an occupation that is not compatible with the social self.</p> <p>Damian Barr, author and founder of the <a href=\"https://www.theliterarysalon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Literary Salon</a> in London, thinks that reading can still be a \u201crebellious and dangerous activity\u201d for women. \u201cThere are men who still find it threatening and dangerous when a woman picks up a book,\u201d he says. When he interviewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, the first minister of Scotland, for his salon, he was appalled at the abuse she had received for talking about novels. \u201cPeople would say that reading fiction is not important, she should be running the country.

Taylor, emeritus professor of English at the University of Exeter, surveyed more than 400 female readers to see how they relate to fiction. The responses are striking in their violence and intensity, in the sin and guilt associated with reading, as well as the defiance. One mother described how she tells her family that she is going downstairs to sort the laundry just so she can steal 10 precious minutes with a novel. Another wrote that for her, reading novels was \u201cfractionally less important than breathing, but only just\u201d. Others fear being caught in the act.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For the most part, it's women who teach children to read, both at school and at home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The idea that fiction is a female domain is taken for granted by most people involved in books. According to <a href=\"https://nielsenbook.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nielsen Book Research</a>, women outbuy men in all categories of novel except fantasy, science fiction and horror. And when men do read fiction, they don\u2019t tend to read fiction by women, while Taylor claims that women read and admire male novelists, rarely making value judgments.</p> <p>Women are not only keener buyers of fiction \u2013 surveys show they account for 80% of sales in the UK, US and Canadian fiction markets \u2013 far more women than men are literary festivalgoers, library members, audio book readers, literary bloggers, and members of literary societies and evening classes. It is also for the most part women who teach children to read, both at school and at home; and women who form book clubs \u2013 often actively shutting out men.</p> <p>Ian McEwan once wrote: \u201cWhen women stop reading, the novel will be dead.\u201d Back in 2005, he and his son culled the library of his London house and took stacks of books to a local park to give away. He said every woman he approached asked for three, whereas every man \u201cfrowned in suspicion, or distaste\u201d and usually said something like: \u201c\u2018Nah, nah. Not for me. Thanks, mate, but no.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The history of fiction has always been a history of women readers. From the 18th century, the novel itself was aimed at a new class of leisured women, who didn\u2019t receive formal education in science or politics. The male writers and critics who wrote and appraised the first novels legitimised the form, but Taylor says they \u201cwere quickly overtaken by women writers of sensation and romance fiction. Women took to it as a way of learning about other lives, fantasising about their own relationships and narratives that allowed them to challenge their own subordinate position to men.\u201d</p> <p>Though there have been histories of women\u2019s reading, Taylor\u2019s spirited, engaging study is the first that tries to capture how fiction matters to contemporary women of different ages, classes and ethnic groups. She says that when she tells men the title of her book, they get defensive. \u201cThey say, \u2018But I read fiction too!\u2019 I say, \u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, but far fewer men do.\u2019 When I scratch beneath the surface to find out why they have read a certain novel, they never give me an emotional answer. It\u2019s always: \u2018Well, it\u2019s because I\u2019m very interested in stories about the first world war or the Victorian period.\u2019 Or they say they did history at university and want to follow up certain ideas.

But he, too, feels that men and women seek different things from fiction. \u201cI dislike generalisations, as a rule,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut if the male reader\u2019s choice is more thrillers or fantasy, while women are more likely to go for \u2018literary\u2019 fiction, that suggests to me that women read books to understand themselves, and men to escape themselves.\u201d</p> <p> Taylor says that it is rare to find men expressing the way in which reading has impacted on their emotional, spiritual and sexual lives. While her correspondents for the book frequently refer to how novels make them feel, their appetite for fiction is \u201cgluttonous\u201d and \u201comnivorous\u201d; one says she has a \u201cprint tooth\u201d and another likens reading to \u201csecret eating\u201d.</p> <p>William Thackeray called fiction \u201csweets\u201d \u2013 to ensure a balanced diet, he also recommended \u201croast\u201d, by which he meant nonfiction. It\u2019s surprising how enduring these puritanical associations have proved; fiction is still seen as \u201ca slippery slope to idle self-indulgence\u201d, as Taylor has it. One of her correspondents wrote: \u201chaving an affair is dangerous, masturbation requires solitude and privacy. Reading a book offers both without anyone noticing.\u201d Some readers are less restrained. Taylor\u2019s book includes Pierre-Antoine Baudoin\u2019s 1760 painting, <em>La </em><em>Lecture</em><em> (The Reader)</em>, which depicts a young woman apparently masturbating with one hand while stroking the pages of a novel with the other.</p> <p>And while for many, reading is an intensely personal activity \u2013 \u201ca lifeline\u201d, \u201cmy best friend\u201d, \u201cthe love of my life\u201d \u2013 it is also an activity that women share with other women. The contemporary book group can trace a lineage back to 17th-century Bible study groups, 18th-century Parisian salons, as well as progressive suffrage groups where women have gathered together to self-educate. The sharing of reading is \u201csomething women undoubtedly do automatically in ways that are inter-generational, gregarious and collegiate,\u201d says Taylor.</p> <p>I\u2019m currently on at least four active WhatsApp threads about fiction with people who have no connection to the publishing world. There\u2019s my local book group of school mums exchanging messages about Madeline Miller\u2019s novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/08/circe-madeline-miller-homer-odyssey-retelling-review\" title=\"\"><em>Circe</em></a>; my mum (a retired teacher) sending me pages from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/edithwharton\" title=\"\">Edith Wharton</a> she\u2019s reading; a friend who has been weeping over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/colson-whitehead\" title=\"\">Colson Whitehead</a>\u2019s latest; and several about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/elizabeth-strout\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Strout</a>\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/21/pulitzer-elizabeth-strout-fiction\" title=\"\"><em>Olive Kitteridge</em></a>, which I bought for two of my best friends.

She made a conscious effort to start a different sort of reading club: she launched a year-long literature course, Rewriting the Canon, held at Liberty department store in London, with the aim of expanding the western canon to include more writers of colour. In collaboration with <a href=\"http://gal-dem.com/\" title=\"\"><em>gal-dem</em></a> magazine, she drew up a list that included <em>Passing</em> by Nella Larsen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/19/james-baldwin-giovannis-room-garth-greenwell-60th-anniversary-gay-novel\" title=\"\"><em>Giovanni\u2019s Room</em> by James Baldwin</a> and <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> by Zora Neale Hurston. It ended up looking very different from \u201cwomen sitting around drinking wine in Wiltshire or Richmond\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s striking how many women in Taylor\u2019s book talk about fiction giving them social mobility. A lot of her correspondents described themselves as having come from working-class or poor backgrounds where there were no books in their house, but through libraries, schools, friends and extended family, they had pulled themselves up. Being accepted as a good reader has long been one of the ways for women to achieve greater social status, Taylor says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"414e2b147ccd738af1cba7b151364c8028e43de9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/414e2b147ccd738af1cba7b151364c8028e43de9/0_54_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Kate Mosse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Kate Mosse, founder of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, there are many female authors who understandably feel ambivalent about whether to embrace this bond with their female readership. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roxane-gay\" title=\"\">Roxane Gay</a> once noted that: \u201cMale writers get treated as intellectuals, women writers get treated as friends.\u201d Will their writing be dismissed as \u201cdomestic saga\u201d or \u201cchick lit\u201d? Will it be a sure route to pastel-coloured book jackets?</p> <p>Responding to a comment by Norwegian author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-ove-knausgard\" title=\"\">Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd</a> that \u201creading is feminine\u201d, novelist and essayist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/03/siri-hustvedt-i-am-writing-for-my-life-memories-of-the-future-interview\" title=\"\">Siri Hustvedt</a> took issue with the idea that the activity should somehow be \u201ctainted\u201d for being associated with women. It elides a historical double standard: literature is sidelined as a fey, womanly business; but for centuries only a privileged class of boys were taught literacy skills. Asked what she thought posed the biggest threat to literature, Hustvedt said: \u201cThat it becomes, in the eyes of culture, a highly feminised form. Far more women read fiction than men, and because of this, novels have become marginalised as serious texts.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a prime concern to Mosse as founder of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction. \u201cImplicit in that is the idea that men\u2019s opinions matter more; that if something is predominantly considered a female activity, then it is not as valuable and important.\u201d And even if women are speaking to other women, why would that be any less meaningful than men speaking to other men? \u201cWomen artists must be allowed to focus on their own achievements, their own writing, their own voices without always being asked to consider the external response to it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hilary-mantel\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel</a> spoke to Taylor about her fear of being \u201cLittle Womaned\u201d \u2013 boxed as an author who is incapable of writing about the \u201cwider society\u201d because she \u201ccannot pull away from personal preoccupations\u201d about what women want.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1d5f3557d795a64c0193e14d02fe62e61b0ce17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d5f3557d795a64c0193e14d02fe62e61b0ce17/0_0_1935_2583/749.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre-Antoine Baudoin\u2019s 1760 painting La Lecture (The Reader).\" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre-Antoine Baudoin\u2019s 1760 painting La Lecture (The Reader).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Picture Art Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that Hilary Mantel wanted to get entirely away from a female world with her Tudor series because she wanted recognition,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cBut at the same time: what could be better as a writer than to feel you are speaking directly to women who see you as a friend? Why would any author object to that? You can say it\u2019s fluffy, but actually it\u2019s real and rather magical. Let\u2019s speak up for the fact we read fiction because we want to explore our feelings. We cry at the end of a romantic novel because we are both moved by someone else\u2019s plight but also because it\u2019s stirring up bittersweet things in us.\u201d</p> <p>Emotional intelligence is something of which women are rightly proud. A woman will often be called upon to play the family peacemaker, to ease social relations, to mediate friendships. She might find in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/jane-austen-emma-changed-face-fiction\" title=\"\">Emma Woodhouse</a> or Dorothea Brooke, say, instructive examples. </p> <p>Taylor feels this needs to be celebrated along with the ways in which women share the fiction that warms, comforts and sustains them. I ask Coe whether he sees marked differences in the way men and women respond to his novels. \u201cFemale readers in the signing queue will sometimes tell you directly how much a book has moved them, whereas male readers will say how much they share my enthusiasm for obscure bands like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield_and_the_North\" title=\"\">Hatfield and the North</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think, essentially, they are saying the same thing: it\u2019s just that men sometimes need these proxies, these intermediaries \u2013 football, music, etc \u2013 as a way of voicing their emotions.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor says she \u201calways warms to men who read novels\u201d and I agree \u2013 we both married our husbands partly because they were keen readers of fiction. It\u2019s no coincidence, I\u2019m sure, that the most emotionally intelligent men I know regularly read and enthuse about women writers. \u201cI love that they\u2019re not reading just to get facts,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI think they\u2019re reading fiction to try and understand the world from an oblique perspective. Fiction takes you on indirect routes to truth.\u201d</p> <p><em>Why Women Read Fiction: The Stories of Our Lives by Helen Taylor is published by Oxford University Press (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "The narrator of Anna Burns\u2019s Booker prize-winning novel, Milkman, likes to read on her way to work, even as she walks. Her preference is 19th-century novels. She likes to retreat to \u201cthe safety of the scroll and papyrus of earlier centuries\u201d. But in her claustrophobic community during Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles, it marks her out as a threat. Even her best friend sees her habit as \u201cdisturbing\u201d, \u201cdeviant\u201d and \u201cnot public-spirited\u201d. The narrator is confused. \u201cAre you saying it\u2019s okay for him to go around with Semtex but not okay for me to read Jane Eyre in public?\u201d A woman doesn\u2019t need to have grown up amid sectarian violence to relate to the narrator\u2019s difficulties. Even in peacetime Bristol, where I occasionally flaunt my literacy in public \u2013 usually while stationary, but not always \u2013 I often run into difficulty. A woman reading a novel in a coffee shop, or on a park bench, or on public transport always runs the risk of someone \u2013 almost always a man \u2013 sidling over and asking: \u201cSo. A reader, huh?\u201d Or, maybe: \u201cHave you read any\u2026 um, um\u2026 Patrick O\u2019Brian?\u201d Or more likely, something completely un-novel-related. It\u2019s as if they assume I\u2019m bored, or sad, or killing time until a man absorbs my attention. Usually, I am reading for work \u2013 so hard to explain this to the interrupter without inviting further interruption! \u2013 and yet I can\u2019t help noticing that this never happens when I am on a laptop, when I might after all be doing something socially useful, perhaps involving a spreadsheet or a credit card. But if I am reading: who knows? There is something about the female bookworm, face obscured by a novel, hidden within plain sight, possibly pondering the bigger questions of life, possibly fantasising, that can serve as an affront. The onus has long been on women to facilitate easy human relations, and lone reading is an occupation that is not compatible with the social self. Damian Barr, author and founder of the Literary Salon in London, thinks that reading can still be a \u201crebellious and dangerous activity\u201d for women. \u201cThere are men who still find it threatening and dangerous when a woman picks up a book,\u201d he says. When he interviewed Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, for his salon, he was appalled at the abuse she had received for talking about novels. \u201cPeople would say that reading fiction is not important, she should be running the country. Why is reading less valuable to a leader than, say, playing golf?\u201d This goes some way to explaining the depth of feeling expressed by the women surveyed in a new book by Helen Taylor, Why Women Read Fiction: The Stories of Our Lives (Oxford University Press). Taylor, emeritus professor of English at the University of Exeter, surveyed more than 400 female readers to see how they relate to fiction. The responses are striking in their violence and intensity, in the sin and guilt associated with reading, as well as the defiance. One mother described how she tells her family that she is going downstairs to sort the laundry just so she can steal 10 precious minutes with a novel. Another wrote that for her, reading novels was \u201cfractionally less important than breathing, but only just\u201d. Others fear being caught in the act. The idea that fiction is a female domain is taken for granted by most people involved in books. According to Nielsen Book Research, women outbuy men in all categories of novel except fantasy, science fiction and horror. And when men do read fiction, they don\u2019t tend to read fiction by women, while Taylor claims that women read and admire male novelists, rarely making value judgments. Women are not only keener buyers of fiction \u2013 surveys show they account for 80% of sales in the UK, US and Canadian fiction markets \u2013 far more women than men are literary festivalgoers, library members, audio book readers, literary bloggers, and members of literary societies and evening classes. It is also for the most part women who teach children to read, both at school and at home; and women who form book clubs \u2013 often actively shutting out men. Ian McEwan once wrote: \u201cWhen women stop reading, the novel will be dead.\u201d Back in 2005, he and his son culled the library of his London house and took stacks of books to a local park to give away. He said every woman he approached asked for three, whereas every man \u201cfrowned in suspicion, or distaste\u201d and usually said something like: \u201c\u2018Nah, nah. Not for me. Thanks, mate, but no.\u2019\u201d The history of fiction has always been a history of women readers. From the 18th century, the novel itself was aimed at a new class of leisured women, who didn\u2019t receive formal education in science or politics. The male writers and critics who wrote and appraised the first novels legitimised the form, but Taylor says they \u201cwere quickly overtaken by women writers of sensation and romance fiction. Women took to it as a way of learning about other lives, fantasising about their own relationships and narratives that allowed them to challenge their own subordinate position to men.\u201d Though there have been histories of women\u2019s reading, Taylor\u2019s spirited, engaging study is the first that tries to capture how fiction matters to contemporary women of different ages, classes and ethnic groups. She says that when she tells men the title of her book, they get defensive. \u201cThey say, \u2018But I read fiction too!\u2019 I say, \u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, but far fewer men do.\u2019 When I scratch beneath the surface to find out why they have read a certain novel, they never give me an emotional answer. It\u2019s always: \u2018Well, it\u2019s because I\u2019m very interested in stories about the first world war or the Victorian period.\u2019 Or they say they did history at university and want to follow up certain ideas. Or that they quite like to read Martin Amis because his characters are funny.\u201d Louise Doughty, author of nine novels, including the bestseller Apple Tree Yard, notes that her male readers often express \u2013 or possibly dress up \u2013 their admiration for her books \u201cas an act of anthropological research\u2026 One very sweet note from a man said, of Whatever You Love, \u2018I learned more about how women feel from your novel than I did from decades of research I commissioned in my job as an advertising executive.\u2019 The implication was he read it from a sincere desire to discover something \u2018other\u2019, rather than discovering a universal truth about human nature.\u201d Jonathan Coe, author of The Rotters\u2019 Club series, considers himself unusual in attracting an equal male-female readership. But he, too, feels that men and women seek different things from fiction. \u201cI dislike generalisations, as a rule,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut if the male reader\u2019s choice is more thrillers or fantasy, while women are more likely to go for \u2018literary\u2019 fiction, that suggests to me that women read books to understand themselves, and men to escape themselves.\u201d Taylor says that it is rare to find men expressing the way in which reading has impacted on their emotional, spiritual and sexual lives. While her correspondents for the book frequently refer to how novels make them feel, their appetite for fiction is \u201cgluttonous\u201d and \u201comnivorous\u201d; one says she has a \u201cprint tooth\u201d and another likens reading to \u201csecret eating\u201d. William Thackeray called fiction \u201csweets\u201d \u2013 to ensure a balanced diet, he also recommended \u201croast\u201d, by which he meant nonfiction. It\u2019s surprising how enduring these puritanical associations have proved; fiction is still seen as \u201ca slippery slope to idle self-indulgence\u201d, as Taylor has it. One of her correspondents wrote: \u201chaving an affair is dangerous, masturbation requires solitude and privacy. Reading a book offers both without anyone noticing.\u201d Some readers are less restrained. Taylor\u2019s book includes Pierre-Antoine Baudoin\u2019s 1760 painting, La Lecture (The Reader), which depicts a young woman apparently masturbating with one hand while stroking the pages of a novel with the other. And while for many, reading is an intensely personal activity \u2013 \u201ca lifeline\u201d, \u201cmy best friend\u201d, \u201cthe love of my life\u201d \u2013 it is also an activity that women share with other women. The contemporary book group can trace a lineage back to 17th-century Bible study groups, 18th-century Parisian salons, as well as progressive suffrage groups where women have gathered together to self-educate. The sharing of reading is \u201csomething women undoubtedly do automatically in ways that are inter-generational, gregarious and collegiate,\u201d says Taylor. I\u2019m currently on at least four active WhatsApp threads about fiction with people who have no connection to the publishing world. There\u2019s my local book group of school mums exchanging messages about Madeline Miller\u2019s novel, Circe; my mum (a retired teacher) sending me pages from the Edith Wharton she\u2019s reading; a friend who has been weeping over Colson Whitehead\u2019s latest; and several about Elizabeth Strout\u2019s book, Olive Kitteridge, which I bought for two of my best friends. We send each other lines from the book that most resonate, and we have all recommended it to our mothers \u2013 and so the chain of bookish messages proliferates. Kate Mosse, novelist, playwright and founder director of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction, suggests that book clubs provide an excuse for women to spend guiltless time with their female friends. \u201c[It] has a sense of there being a purpose to it \u2013 it\u2019s not simply leisure \u2013 so women allow themselves to take time out of day-to-day life.\u201d Women also use books to gauge one another\u2019s aptness for friendship. \u201cFor me, if someone doesn\u2019t value Wuthering Heights (or thinks it overblown, or baggy, or too wild), then I like them just a tiny bit less.\u201d Sharmaine Lovegrove, publisher of Dialogue Books, recognises that women\u2019s book groups often act as \u201cgatekeepers of our culture\u201d. She made a conscious effort to start a different sort of reading club: she launched a year-long literature course, Rewriting the Canon, held at Liberty department store in London, with the aim of expanding the western canon to include more writers of colour. In collaboration with gal-dem magazine, she drew up a list that included Passing by Nella Larsen, Giovanni\u2019s Room by James Baldwin and Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston. It ended up looking very different from \u201cwomen sitting around drinking wine in Wiltshire or Richmond\u201d. It\u2019s striking how many women in Taylor\u2019s book talk about fiction giving them social mobility. A lot of her correspondents described themselves as having come from working-class or poor backgrounds where there were no books in their house, but through libraries, schools, friends and extended family, they had pulled themselves up. Being accepted as a good reader has long been one of the ways for women to achieve greater social status, Taylor says. Meanwhile, there are many female authors who understandably feel ambivalent about whether to embrace this bond with their female readership. Roxane Gay once noted that: \u201cMale writers get treated as intellectuals, women writers get treated as friends.\u201d Will their writing be dismissed as \u201cdomestic saga\u201d or \u201cchick lit\u201d? Will it be a sure route to pastel-coloured book jackets? Responding to a comment by Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd that \u201creading is feminine\u201d, novelist and essayist Siri Hustvedt took issue with the idea that the activity should somehow be \u201ctainted\u201d for being associated with women. It elides a historical double standard: literature is sidelined as a fey, womanly business; but for centuries only a privileged class of boys were taught literacy skills. Asked what she thought posed the biggest threat to literature, Hustvedt said: \u201cThat it becomes, in the eyes of culture, a highly feminised form. Far more women read fiction than men, and because of this, novels have become marginalised as serious texts.\u201d It\u2019s a prime concern to Mosse as founder of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction. \u201cImplicit in that is the idea that men\u2019s opinions matter more; that if something is predominantly considered a female activity, then it is not as valuable and important.\u201d And even if women are speaking to other women, why would that be any less meaningful than men speaking to other men? \u201cWomen artists must be allowed to focus on their own achievements, their own writing, their own voices without always being asked to consider the external response to it.\u201d Hilary Mantel spoke to Taylor about her fear of being \u201cLittle Womaned\u201d \u2013 boxed as an author who is incapable of writing about the \u201cwider society\u201d because she \u201ccannot pull away from personal preoccupations\u201d about what women want. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that Hilary Mantel wanted to get entirely away from a female world with her Tudor series because she wanted recognition,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cBut at the same time: what could be better as a writer than to feel you are speaking directly to women who see you as a friend? Why would any author object to that? You can say it\u2019s fluffy, but actually it\u2019s real and rather magical. Let\u2019s speak up for the fact we read fiction because we want to explore our feelings. We cry at the end of a romantic novel because we are both moved by someone else\u2019s plight but also because it\u2019s stirring up bittersweet things in us.\u201d Emotional intelligence is something of which women are rightly proud. A woman will often be called upon to play the family peacemaker, to ease social relations, to mediate friendships. She might find in Emma Woodhouse or Dorothea Brooke, say, instructive examples. Taylor feels this needs to be celebrated along with the ways in which women share the fiction that warms, comforts and sustains them. I ask Coe whether he sees marked differences in the way men and women respond to his novels. \u201cFemale readers in the signing queue will sometimes tell you directly how much a book has moved them, whereas male readers will say how much they share my enthusiasm for obscure bands like Hatfield and the North,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think, essentially, they are saying the same thing: it\u2019s just that men sometimes need these proxies, these intermediaries \u2013 football, music, etc \u2013 as a way of voicing their emotions.\u201d Taylor says she \u201calways warms to men who read novels\u201d and I agree \u2013 we both married our husbands partly because they were keen readers of fiction. It\u2019s no coincidence, I\u2019m sure, that the most emotionally intelligent men I know regularly read and enthuse about women writers. \u201cI love that they\u2019re not reading just to get facts,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI think they\u2019re reading fiction to try and understand the world from an oblique perspective. Fiction takes you on indirect routes to truth.\u201d Why Women Read Fiction: The Stories of Our Lives by Helen Taylor is published by Oxford University Press (\u00a314.99). It will be Radio 4\u2019s Book of the Week starting 13 January What we\u2019re reading Miyuki Watanabe Currently I\u2019m reading The Alchemist [by Paulo Coelho]. It\u2019s really inspiring, I love it. I do like nonfiction \u2013 biographies, environmental [texts], anything that helps me broaden my empathy \u2013 but that\u2019s true of fiction as well. After delving into nonfiction, it\u2019s nice to go back to fiction and have an easy read before bed. I think women are more empathetic [than men] and more social \u2013 women read fiction to get into the mindset of others. And a lot of women have book clubs and things with friends \u2013 I think that\u2019s a female thing. That\u2019s unfortunate though \u2013 everybody should have a book club! Liz Burdon I\u2019m reading a series of children\u2019s books about refugees, by Alan Gratz. I\u2019m interested in refugees, so I\u2019m reading around the subject and finding it fascinating. Fiction is the best way into history and into humanity. I\u2019m from Dublin originally and if anyone is interested in the history of Ireland I urge them to read Dubliners by Joyce first \u2013 and then look at the history. There\u2019s definitely a difference between what men and women read. In my teaching career, I saw boys who were reluctant readers get completely into reading if you find the right genre. It was all about genre for them. Rebecca Vile I just started reading My Sister, the Serial Killer [by Oyinkan Braithwaite]. I\u2019m only at the first chapter, but it\u2019s getting me in, which is good. I just thought I\u2019d try something new \u2013 I read a review of it in a couple of different newspapers. I\u2019m trying to get into reading more fiction, because I wasn\u2019t into it for a while but I think it helps your brain. It expands you in a different way. My husband just reads dry academic stuff \u2013 forget it, I am not going there. Marie-Claire Chappet I\u2019m rereading The Catcher in the Rye [by JD Salinger]. A friend said it was worth rereading as an adult \u2013 we both read it when we were 10 or 11. I still love it, but I want to be like [the protagonist Holden Caulfield] a lot less! As an adult, you\u2019re like, \u201cPoor boy\u2026\u201d Women are more curious [than men], that\u2019s probably why fiction appeals. I guess we\u2019ve got more to escape from, haven\u2019t we? And we\u2019ve got more access to other kinds of perspectives, because we\u2019re othered by society. I try to read an even balance of men and women, but my tastes veer more towards female writers. Linda Cyrus I like to share books with my daughter. The last book I read was [a memoir] about a woman who has mental health problems \u2013 Sour [by Tracey Miller]. Now I\u2019m trying Queenie [by Candice Carty-Williams]. Women like to read about love and romance \u2013 it feels like a way of settling your mind, taking away today\u2019s mental stress. Just fix it yourself, rather than reading the news all the times, because the news is really depressing. Gwen Coffey I\u2019m reading Tales of the City [by Armistead Maupin]. It\u2019s lovely. I\u2019ve seen the TV version and it\u2019s so close to the book that I know what\u2019s going to happen but I\u2019m still enjoying it. Women have a bit more imagination [than men]. I know the fantasies I get into when reading \u2013 I live it. I\u2019m in love with a character in a book, I\u2019ve been in love with him for a couple of years now. He\u2019s a policeman in Tony Parsons\u2019s books and he\u2019s been stabbed, shot, buried alive\u2026 I think: I must save him! Interviews by Holly Williams",

      "body": "<p>Are millennials selfish and rude or do they just define etiquette differently to older people? And if the latter is true, is that just to stop themselves going mad?</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/05/young-adults-think-traditional-manners-like-saying-please-thank-outdated-11277824/\" title=\"\">survey</a>, published last week, found that 42% of millennials \u2013 people reaching young adulthood in the early 21st century \u2013 wouldn\u2019t give up their seat for somebody elderly or pregnant on public transport, while almost one in three would ignore a queuing system. However, more than a third of those surveyed thought it impolite to ignore people on social media, while other objections included texts being read over people\u2019s shoulders and programme spoilers.</p> <p>So, Young People, let\u2019s get this straight (jabs accusing crone-like finger): sitting on a train or bus while a pregnant woman or elderly person stands is absolutely fine. But if someone accidentally mentions what happened in an episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stranger-things\" title=\"\"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> you haven\u2019t seen, that\u2019s downright rude? Sheesh, priorities\u2026</p> <p>Not that stereotyping millennials as antisocial and selfish works. That recent cheering surge of last-minute electoral registering was said to mainly come from millennials. Moreover, in the Extinction Rebellion era, older people would have a damn nerve accusing the young of being disengaged.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s intriguing that there\u2019s a tendency among millennials to prioritise online etiquette over real-life manners. It would seem to reverse what\u2019s generally presumed about online conduct \u2013 aren\u2019t people supposed to feel emboldened to behave <em>worse</em> online? Maybe that\u2019s tragic older types, who still haven\u2019t managed to get over the novelty of the internet\u2019s cloak of invisibility. In contrast, younger people take it so for granted they have developed a far greater sense of accountability for their online identities.</p> <p>Certainly, it\u2019s interesting to think that some younger humans prefer to exist in their most realised form in the online world, even developing better manners there. Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, they\u2019re barging through queues, not opening doors and ambling around semi-detached, almost as though other people are made of pixels in the real world.</p> <p>All of which is mystifying until you take a look at what comprises reality for many young folk. Millennials have plenty to feel disengaged about in a world where they\u2019re been shafted out of real-life futures at every turn (economic, professional, climate, home-ownership, affording to have children, everything). Had all this been our lot when we were young, maybe we\u2019d also have opted to be our better selves, living our best lives, in an online reality. While millennials should realise that they exist in the real, rather than virtual, world, older people need to realise that millennials are becoming dangerously detached from a world that keeps kicking them in the teeth. That said, have a heart, millennials \u2013 let the pregnant women sit down.</p> <h2>A mea culpa via social media?

Timbers continued: \u201cA few weeks ago I displayed a strong lapse of judgment \u2013 but let me clear \u2013 nothing happened with my co-star\u2026 I drank way too much that night and I regret my behaviour\u2026 I apologise to my amazing wife and family\u2026 I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be\u2026\u201d Blah blah, yak yak.</p> <p>The post ends with a reference to <em>Palmer</em> \u2013 because, hey ladeez, nothing says \u201csorry\u201d more meaningfully than a film plug.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with an apology, but why did it have to happen on social media? One presumes, as husband and wife, Timberlake and Biel have occasional face-time access to each other (schedules permitting). And aren\u2019t celebrities constantly gassing about media invasions of their privacy? Yet here\u2019s Timberlake invading his <em>own</em> privacy, blasting out an apology to Biel rather strangely in front of the world and humiliating Wainwright (the \u201cco-star\u201d; it would appear that no name is necessary) in the process.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to think that this was Biel\u2019s doing: \u201cOi, you messed up in public \u2013 you can apologise in public too.\u201d Sadly, one suspects that this wasn\u2019t so much an apology as a brand announcement to repair Timberlake\u2019s reputation. So it\u2019s technically more of an apology to his agent and marketing team. Next time Timberlake needs to apologise to his wife, maybe he should consider doing it with a big bunch of flowers and a box of Milk Tray \u2013 even better, some humility and sincerity behind firmly closed doors.</p> <h2>Guys, you\u2019ll never win a girl by giving her a Peloton</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1b9e93f66dba2ad0068b7a8b63be7b07f535b41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1b9e93f66dba2ad0068b7a8b63be7b07f535b41/136_0_2115_1269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peloton exercise bike\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Peloton ad: \u2018reductive and sexist\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peloton/Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the Christmas gift of a woman\u2019s dreams \u2013 being told that you\u2019re out of shape by your significant other.

It would seem to reverse what\u2019s generally presumed about online conduct \u2013 aren\u2019t people supposed to feel emboldened to behave worse online? Maybe that\u2019s tragic older types, who still haven\u2019t managed to get over the novelty of the internet\u2019s cloak of invisibility. In contrast, younger people take it so for granted they have developed a far greater sense of accountability for their online identities. Certainly, it\u2019s interesting to think that some younger humans prefer to exist in their most realised form in the online world, even developing better manners there. Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, they\u2019re barging through queues, not opening doors and ambling around semi-detached, almost as though other people are made of pixels in the real world. All of which is mystifying until you take a look at what comprises reality for many young folk. Millennials have plenty to feel disengaged about in a world where they\u2019re been shafted out of real-life futures at every turn (economic, professional, climate, home-ownership, affording to have children, everything). Had all this been our lot when we were young, maybe we\u2019d also have opted to be our better selves, living our best lives, in an online reality. While millennials should realise that they exist in the real, rather than virtual, world, older people need to realise that millennials are becoming dangerously detached from a world that keeps kicking them in the teeth. That said, have a heart, millennials \u2013 let the pregnant women sit down. A mea culpa via social media? Sorry, Timbers, but that\u2019s bad How wonderfully modern that Justin Timberlake took to Instagram to apologise to his wife, Jessica Biel. After being snapped looking inebriated on a balcony, holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright, Timberlake began his Insta-soz post saying: \u201cI stay away from gossip as much as I can.\u201d Of course you do, you marvellous, honourable man! Timbers continued: \u201cA few weeks ago I displayed a strong lapse of judgment \u2013 but let me clear \u2013 nothing happened with my co-star\u2026 I drank way too much that night and I regret my behaviour\u2026 I apologise to my amazing wife and family\u2026 I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be\u2026\u201d Blah blah, yak yak. The post ends with a reference to Palmer \u2013 because, hey ladeez, nothing says \u201csorry\u201d more meaningfully than a film plug. There\u2019s nothing wrong with an apology, but why did it have to happen on social media? One presumes, as husband and wife, Timberlake and Biel have occasional face-time access to each other (schedules permitting). And aren\u2019t celebrities constantly gassing about media invasions of their privacy? Yet here\u2019s Timberlake invading his own privacy, blasting out an apology to Biel rather strangely in front of the world and humiliating Wainwright (the \u201cco-star\u201d; it would appear that no name is necessary) in the process. I\u2019d love to think that this was Biel\u2019s doing: \u201cOi, you messed up in public \u2013 you can apologise in public too.\u201d Sadly, one suspects that this wasn\u2019t so much an apology as a brand announcement to repair Timberlake\u2019s reputation. So it\u2019s technically more of an apology to his agent and marketing team. Next time Timberlake needs to apologise to his wife, maybe he should consider doing it with a big bunch of flowers and a box of Milk Tray \u2013 even better, some humility and sincerity behind firmly closed doors. Guys, you\u2019ll never win a girl by giving her a Peloton It\u2019s the Christmas gift of a woman\u2019s dreams \u2013 being told that you\u2019re out of shape by your significant other. Peloton, which produces \u00a32,000 exercise bikes that access virtual spin classes, has just wiped $1.5bn off its share value with a misguided festive advert featuring a man giving his partner a bike. Instead of the woman saying something realistic such as: \u201cGet out!\u201d, she has a gratitude orgasm, pedalling furiously and simpering: \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much this would change me.\u201d Well, some of us didn\u2019t realise that feminism would be pronounced dead in late 2019. Meanwhile, the man sits on the sofa doing faff all, presumably becoming fit by osmosis. However, while this advert was reductive and sexist, the main problem is that a man (even a fictional one) dared to give a woman an exercise bike for Christmas, which is only marginally better timing than Valentine\u2019s Day. Yes, there is an obesity crisis, but no one has the right to comment on anyone else\u2019s fitness. Memo to men: unless requested, gym equipment beats even \u201cunspecified domestic appliance\u201d in the top 10 of dud gifts guaranteed to make a woman hate you. And, yes, I do mean forever. Astonishing as it may seem, women don\u2019t fantasise about being presented with the opportunity to strive to look hotter for you. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>Wasted youth, random violent death and the folly of armed conflict are the big themes of <em>1917</em>, Sam Mendes\u2019s orchestral symphony of a first world war film. But for the director and the team who made it alongside him, no detail was too small to consider.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very important, the question of historical accuracy,\u201d said Mendes. \u201cWe had two very fine historical advisers, Andy Robertshaw and Peter Barton, who are world renowned. And one military adviser, Paul Biddiss, who was also brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>The film, out in cinemas in January, has already won many admiring reviews and was premiered last Wednesday in front of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at Leicester Square. Set on 6 April in northern France, after the Germans had staged a tactical retreat to the position known as the Hindenburg Line, <em>1917</em> follows a soldier\u2019s deadly mission to help a family member. Mendes\u2019s own mission as director was to be faithful to the experiences of the men who fought, including his own grandfather, Alfred H Mendes.</p> <p>As a child the Oscar-winning director of <em>American Beauty</em> and <em>Skyfall</em> often listened to the wartime stories of his charismatic grandparent, a teenage lance corporal in 1917, and wondered at the thin line they described between luck and misfortune, life and death. One \u201cfragment\u201d in particular, the story of a message carried through the mist of no man\u2019s land at dusk, has never left Mendes; it sparked the plot of his first screenplay, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. </p> <p>\u201cThe film is a compression of time and place, so you take what\u2019s important,\u201d said Mendes. \u201cYou are not making a documentary, but you do want it to feel, in every possible detail, historically accurate.\u201d</p> <p>Mendes adds that Biddiss was vital for \u201chands-on\u201d military and technical advice: \u201cwhat\u2019s in their kit bag, how to handle their weapons \u2013 this sort of stuff\u201d. Robertshaw concentrated on getting the practical surroundings right: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the trenches, what\u2019s in the dug-outs, what they would have imported or brought from home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f7fdc7395f7103715dcac29e3fdcec86e4292fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f7fdc7395f7103715dcac29e3fdcec86e4292fe/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The actors are taught how to handle First World War weaponry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The actors are taught how to handle First World War weaponry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Biddiss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director describes Barton, the historian, as \u201cmore of an overall challenger\u201d. Once a draft of the screenplay was written Mendes and Wilson-Cairns handed it over.</p> <p>\u201cI just said: \u2018Pick as many holes in the script as you can.\u2019 And he did. At great length. And it was tough actually. There were some really hard notes to factor in. But we did. And if we didn\u2019t, there was a specific reason,\u201d said Mendes.</p> <p>While the shape of a military helmet might not be enough to make or marr a good film, for Mendes and his advisers it was imperative to replicate the uniforms shown in documentary footage and photographs. Many other dramas set in the trenches have thriftily relied upon re-purposed second world war helmets. But not on the set of <em>1917</em>. Although the Brodie helmets worn in \u201cthe Great War\u201d are no longer around in large numbers, Mendes\u2019s troops wear accurate recreations. What is more, they differ subtly from one battalion to another, since at the time the film is set, helmet shape was changing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I watched the footage back each day I tried to find any slip that I possibly could, such as undone ammunition pouches,\u201d said Biddiss, an ex-paratrooper who ran the six-month training camp set up before filming by Mendes for those chosen to play troops. \u201cIn the first world war soldiers were taught to check their ammunition before they moved off,\u201d said Biddiss. \u201cLance Corporal Schofield, played by George MacKay, is supposed to have fought in the Somme and so would have already had problems with his webbing [military belts and harnesses]. Soldiers had found it flapped open and the bullets often fell out so after the Somme it was modified and all soldiers were drilled to check their pouches. They still are today.\u201d</p> <p>The open-air action was filmed this summer on Salisbury Plain and in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire. Other scenes were filmed in Oxfordshire, Glasgow and in a Darlington river.</p> <p>In February, before the long shoot in Salisbury, the film crew invited local men aged 16-35 to audition to become troops. And then Biddiss\u2019s training camp began. MacKay, who stars in the film alongside Dean-Charles Chapman, has spoken of this training period as \u201can incredible process\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to make sure they were all mentally and physically fit,\u201d said Biddiss. \u201cWe used about 800 men in all and about 500 for the Salisbury section, as well as the main cast. I wanted them all to understand the etiquette of the trenches.\u201d</p> <p>Several of those selected were asked to grow moustaches, although beards were not permitted, except for the Sikh soldiers in turbans.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the first lessons I gave George and Dean was about their boots,\u201d said Biddiss. \u201cI told them looking after them would be as crucial for them as it had been for the soldiers.\u201d</p> <p>Clad in hobnail boots for 12-hour days, the young actors learned to act quickly when they felt the \u201chotspots\u201d that would lead to blisters and which, during the war, would have gone on endanger their lives as full-blown trenchfoot.</p> <p>\u201cI also taught them not to put their fingers on the trigger of their guns. Soldiers are trained to do that only when about to fire,\u201d said Biddiss.</p> <p>Character was key to the advice required and so Biddiss suggested the nervous novice played by Chapman should continually check his bayonet as they await an order to go \u201cover the top\u201d.</p> <p>He also said that when MacKay\u2019s corporal is injured, it should be a glancing blow to the head rather than a shoulder wound that would quickly incapacitate any soldier.</p> <p>Establishing the emotions felt by the assembled troops was also a priority for Mendes and Biddiss, even though some of them would be in shot just for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cI emphasised the fear and anger,\u201d Biddiss said. \u201cI can relate to that because I remember jumping out of a Chinook in the dark after I had been briefed that there were people out there who wanted to kill me.</p> <p>\u201cIn fear, you breathe and taste the air differently, knowing you may die. And the anger was important because that is how soldiers feel when they realise they are in a dangerous situation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8b3d5bdd373d9cb8bc0b16088394213eed3deea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8b3d5bdd373d9cb8bc0b16088394213eed3deea/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The actors were also taught tactics and battlefield movement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The actors were also taught tactics and battlefield movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Biddiss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The military adviser was especially happy with a scene near the close of the film when one of the young heroes runs through a long trench against the clock. It clearly shows how trenches were organised, with sergeants and platoon sergeants running things, while an officer is shown breaking down with nerves.</p> <p>And what was the need for all this military training, followed by such a long rehearsal period? Well, Mendes had decided early on he wanted to make the film in a continuous shot, as if happening in real time.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Sam told me,\u201d recalled Biddiss, \u201che said, \u2018So it has got to be on the money from the word \u201cAction\u201d\u2019. No pressure!\u201d</p> <p>And for Biddiss the film became more personal than expected. \u201cI discovered while working on this that one of my uncles, Lance Corporal Robert Victor Biddiss of the London Regiment, had died in December 1917 as he moved into the Hindenburg Support advance.\u201d</p> <p>The effort to honour the story accurately was then more pertinent. \u201cIt was important for all of us to get it right, not just for Sam, because we all have relatives who fought.\u201d </p>",

Establishing the emotions felt by the assembled troops was also a priority for Mendes and Biddiss, even though some of them would be in shot just for a moment. \u201cI emphasised the fear and anger,\u201d Biddiss said. \u201cI can relate to that because I remember jumping out of a Chinook in the dark after I had been briefed that there were people out there who wanted to kill me. \u201cIn fear, you breathe and taste the air differently, knowing you may die. And the anger was important because that is how soldiers feel when they realise they are in a dangerous situation.\u201d The military adviser was especially happy with a scene near the close of the film when one of the young heroes runs through a long trench against the clock. It clearly shows how trenches were organised, with sergeants and platoon sergeants running things, while an officer is shown breaking down with nerves. And what was the need for all this military training, followed by such a long rehearsal period? Well, Mendes had decided early on he wanted to make the film in a continuous shot, as if happening in real time. \u201cWhen Sam told me,\u201d recalled Biddiss, \u201che said, \u2018So it has got to be on the money from the word \u201cAction\u201d\u2019. No pressure!\u201d And for Biddiss the film became more personal than expected. \u201cI discovered while working on this that one of my uncles, Lance Corporal Robert Victor Biddiss of the London Regiment, had died in December 1917 as he moved into the Hindenburg Support advance.\u201d The effort to honour the story accurately was then more pertinent. \u201cIt was important for all of us to get it right, not just for Sam, because we all have relatives who fought.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>An ornithologist cradles a nuthatch in his hand as the low December sun throws the stark winter canopy of trees into relief.</p> <p>Frost-covered leaves crunch underfoot along a path which meanders through ancient oaks, sycamores and willows. It is fringed with wood piles playing host to multiple types of fungi. Buzzards swoop overhead and birdsong fills the air.</p> <p>This 3.2 hectares on the Northamptonshire/Warwickshire border has been woodland since the 1600s when James VI was on the throne. It is a breeding ground for many British birds, including tawny owls, woodpeckers and the now globally-at-risk marsh tit, willow tit and woodcock. As such it qualifies as ancient woodland, a unique and now increasingly threatened habitat in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Walking through Glyn Davies wood, Luci Ryan, lead ecologist for the Woodland Trust, points to the pink flags marking out how the HS2 rail link will \u2013 if the railway goes ahead \u2013 tear apart this old English woodland. Her job is to try to save not just Glyn Davies wood, which is owned by the Banbury Ornithological Society, but more than a thousand other ancient woodlands in the UK from the relentless encroachment of development.</p> <p>\u201cAncient woodlands are an ecological goldmine,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cThey are the most biodiverse habitats in the UK. They are uniquely British, and part of our heritage. They are our natural cathedrals, and cannot be replaced just by planting trees elsewhere. It is like knocking down St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, putting the pile of bricks somewhere else and trying to say it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly, the UK\u2019s ancient woodland is being lost to housing or industrial developments and transport links, and protecting these incomparable habitats makes up much of the workload of the Woodland Trust, one of four charities supported by the 2019 <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> climate emergency charity appeal. The trust\u2019s job has never been tougher; 1,064 ancient woodlands are currently under threat across the UK \u2013 the highest number since the trust\u2019s records began in 1999. Since that year, the campaigning work of the trust has saved 1,101 from destruction, while 800 have suffered loss or damage. \u201cIt is deeply frustrating,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cAncient woodland only covers 2.4% of the UK, so you would have thought it could be avoided. But that isn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"874b2df2b30ec679049f85a61e74ad02f046b253\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/874b2df2b30ec679049f85a61e74ad02f046b253/0_619_5178_3106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Nuthatch, one of the species of birds threatened by habitat loss caught in a mist net and ringed by the British Trust for Ornithology at Glyn Davies Wood Nature reserve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Nuthatch, one of the species of birds threatened by habitat loss caught in a mist net and ringed by the British Trust for Ornithology at Glyn Davies Wood Nature reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Robertson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trust supports a team of 60 volunteers across the country who act as an early warning system. Known as the \u201cthreat detectors\u201d, they scour planning applications for any sign of woodlands at risk, and pass details on to Ryan and the campaign team at the trust.</p> <p>In the last seven years, it has been the Goliath of HS2 \u2013 created through an act of parliament rather than the normal planning process \u2013 which Ryan has been up against. The planned railway link between London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester will destroy or partially destroy 108 ancient woodlands covering 56 hectares of land.</p> <p>Tenacious campaigning by the Woodland Trust has managed to save 14 hectares of ancient woodland, mostly by persuading ministers and HS2 of technical solutions \u2013 including tunnelling \u2013 to avoid desecrating the woodlands and the soil habitats within them which have been untouched for 400 years.</p> <p>The trust also protects woodland through the purchase of areas which are threatened. Their sites range from ownership of a hedge in Sherborne, Dorset, to Loch Arkaig, a Caledonian pine forest in Spean Bridge, and Ben Sheildaig, a mountain in the west Highlands, which they purchased earlier this year.</p> <p>Decades of pressure by the trust helped to change the national planning framework, which sets out the government\u2019s planning policies for England. It now states that any development resulting in the loss of ancient woodland or ancient and veteran trees must be refused unless wholly exceptional.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/06/the-climate-crisis-is-the-most-urgent-threat-of-our-time-help-us-fight-it\">The climate crisis is the most urgent threat of our time.

      "bodyText": "An ornithologist cradles a nuthatch in his hand as the low December sun throws the stark winter canopy of trees into relief. Frost-covered leaves crunch underfoot along a path which meanders through ancient oaks, sycamores and willows. It is fringed with wood piles playing host to multiple types of fungi. Buzzards swoop overhead and birdsong fills the air. This 3.2 hectares on the Northamptonshire/Warwickshire border has been woodland since the 1600s when James VI was on the throne. It is a breeding ground for many British birds, including tawny owls, woodpeckers and the now globally-at-risk marsh tit, willow tit and woodcock. As such it qualifies as ancient woodland, a unique and now increasingly threatened habitat in the United Kingdom. Walking through Glyn Davies wood, Luci Ryan, lead ecologist for the Woodland Trust, points to the pink flags marking out how the HS2 rail link will \u2013 if the railway goes ahead \u2013 tear apart this old English woodland. Her job is to try to save not just Glyn Davies wood, which is owned by the Banbury Ornithological Society, but more than a thousand other ancient woodlands in the UK from the relentless encroachment of development. \u201cAncient woodlands are an ecological goldmine,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cThey are the most biodiverse habitats in the UK. They are uniquely British, and part of our heritage. They are our natural cathedrals, and cannot be replaced just by planting trees elsewhere. It is like knocking down St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, putting the pile of bricks somewhere else and trying to say it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d Increasingly, the UK\u2019s ancient woodland is being lost to housing or industrial developments and transport links, and protecting these incomparable habitats makes up much of the workload of the Woodland Trust, one of four charities supported by the 2019 Guardian and Observer climate emergency charity appeal. The trust\u2019s job has never been tougher; 1,064 ancient woodlands are currently under threat across the UK \u2013 the highest number since the trust\u2019s records began in 1999. Since that year, the campaigning work of the trust has saved 1,101 from destruction, while 800 have suffered loss or damage. \u201cIt is deeply frustrating,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cAncient woodland only covers 2.4% of the UK, so you would have thought it could be avoided. But that isn\u2019t happening.\u201d The trust supports a team of 60 volunteers across the country who act as an early warning system. Known as the \u201cthreat detectors\u201d, they scour planning applications for any sign of woodlands at risk, and pass details on to Ryan and the campaign team at the trust. In the last seven years, it has been the Goliath of HS2 \u2013 created through an act of parliament rather than the normal planning process \u2013 which Ryan has been up against. The planned railway link between London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester will destroy or partially destroy 108 ancient woodlands covering 56 hectares of land. Tenacious campaigning by the Woodland Trust has managed to save 14 hectares of ancient woodland, mostly by persuading ministers and HS2 of technical solutions \u2013 including tunnelling \u2013 to avoid desecrating the woodlands and the soil habitats within them which have been untouched for 400 years. The trust also protects woodland through the purchase of areas which are threatened. Their sites range from ownership of a hedge in Sherborne, Dorset, to Loch Arkaig, a Caledonian pine forest in Spean Bridge, and Ben Sheildaig, a mountain in the west Highlands, which they purchased earlier this year. Decades of pressure by the trust helped to change the national planning framework, which sets out the government\u2019s planning policies for England. It now states that any development resulting in the loss of ancient woodland or ancient and veteran trees must be refused unless wholly exceptional. In Harrogate Keith Wilkinson, a trust volunteer, was among an army of campaigners who fought successfully to save dense ancient woodland covering the steep sides of Nidd Gorge, where the River Nidd enters a deep ravine, from the bulldozers clearing land for a relief road. A combination of high-profile marches attended by hundreds, and petitions thousands strong, finally reaped rewards when North Yorkshire county council withdrew the relief road project in October. \u201cFor a fairly modest charity, with a small staff, trying to cover the whole of the UK, the Woodland Trust is amazing,\u201d said Wilkinson. \u201cThey are tenacious. They are the protectors of the country\u2019s woodlands. In the fading light at Glyn Davies wood Helen Franklin, from the Banbury Ornithological Society, completes the ringing of blue tits, nuthatches and other birds \u2013 part of the society\u2019s work to closely monitor population changes and movement. Remembering the moment that the threat from HS2 was confirmed, Franklin is emotional. \u201cI burst into tears. It is heartbreaking,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is no logic to it and it makes me angry and deeply frustrated.\u201d There remains a glimmer of hope that the wood may be saved; its fate rests on the whim of a new government, even as the diggers wait a few feet away in a siding.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a quick afternoon summary of today\u2019s events. Jeremy Corbyn declined to disclose the source of documents used as evidence that the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in a post-Brexit UK/US trade deal, after Reddit warned of a link to a Russian interference campaign. The forum issued a statement on Friday night saying that the documents had been posted on their site in late October. \u201cWe investigated this account and the accounts connected to it and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia,\u201d it said. The Labour leader today declined to respond to a question of where Labour obtained the documents from: We obtained those documents. We believed those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday denied the correctness of those documents. The issue is there should be no interference in British politics by anybody else. The father of a man killed in the London Bridge attack has accused Boris Johnson of lying and making \u201cpolitical capital\u201d from his son\u2019s death during the BBC leaders\u2019 debate. David Merritt \u2013 whose son Jack was stabbed to death by convicted terrorist Usman Khan \u2013 called the prime minister a fraud following his appearance on Friday night\u2019s TV debate, six days before polling day. \u201cJohnson lied and used our son\u2019s death to make political capital,\u201d Merritt said in a thread posted on Twitter on Saturday. The Conservatives are investigating three parliamentary candidates over antisemitism and are facing calls to suspend them before the election. \u2013 Sally-Ann Hart, standing in the Tory marginal seat of Hastings, shared a video with an image implying that the billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, controls the EU, and she also liked a Nazi slogan on Facebook. \u2013 Lee Anderson, standing for the Conservatives in Labour-held Ashfield, is an active member of Ashfield Backs Boris, a Facebook group where Soros conspiracy theories have been promoted and which includes supporters of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. \u2013 Richard Short, the candidate for St Helens South and Whiston, is being investigated for asking whether a Jewish journalist was more loyal to Israel than to Britain. The Labour party has pledged to electrify England\u2019s entire bus fleet by 2030, promising to bring services \u201cinto the future\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn said \u201cthe Westminster bubble\u201d didn\u2019t care about buses, despite the fact that so many people rely on them. He said the Conservatives had overseen the cancellation or reduction of 3,000 routes across the country leaving people \u201cisolated and stuck at home\u201d. His party plans to electrify all of England\u2019s 35,000 buses by 2030, reducing their emissions by 72%, and fund a reverse in the cuts to services as well as creating new ones. Boris Johnson was asked about the case of serial rapist Joseph McCann, after the probation service apologised for \u201cfailings\u201d that enabled him to carry out a series of attacks on women and children. Asked whether anyone in government should take responsibility, he said: I think it\u2019s an absolutely appalling case and shows that there is something very wrong and what we\u2019re going to do is, what I\u2019ve said for a long, long time, is that we want to review the way sentencing takes place and the way sentences are served. And at the moment, the automatic early release at the halfway point for serious sexual and violent offenders is totally wrong, and I said that back in August, and we\u2019re going to stop that. We have a bill ready to go, in parliament, if we can get a working majority on Thursday, we will not only get Brexit done, we will get other things done, including that. (Here is some useful analysis by the Guardian\u2019s home affairs correspondent Jamie Grierson, arguing that the key issue in the McCann case is not actually his initial sentence but its management.) Johnson repeated that he thought terrorists should have to serve their full sentences, following from the London Bridge attack last Friday. I also think that, as I\u2019ve said, the terrorists will serve their full sentence but when it comes to this individual case we have to look at exactly what happened and we have to make sure we do not have a continual habit of early release for really serious sexual and violent offenders. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have rehabilitation, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do things to ensure you keep people out of prison. You can do all sorts of things to work with young people to get their lives back on track, but when someone commits a serious sexual or violent offence they should not be released early. Such comments today provoked more furious criticism from David Merritt \u2013 whose son Jack was killed in the attack \u2013 who used a thread on Twitter to say the prime minister \u201cused our son\u2019s death to make political capital\u201d. You can read the full story here: While we\u2019re on the topic \u2013 Johnson has been asked again about the parliamentary committee report on potential Russian interference in the EU referendum and the 2017 general election, which he has refused to publish. Well I can repeat what I\u2019ve already said about this, many times, which is that, I know of no evidence of any successful interference by Russia in any democratic event in this country and on the report, we (are) obviously just complying with the normal timetable for releasing such things and I saw no reason to release it earlier just because there was an election going on. Corbyn is speaking about the leaked document on US trade talks, which he says shows the US would demand access to the health market in Britain and access to our public services. He says that the Conservatives are now saying those documents aren\u2019t real. (The Conservative line is actually that the documents don\u2019t show what Labour says they do, not that they are not real.) Corbyn says: A week later they claim that somebody else wrote these documents. Well, it seems a very strange turn of events that, first of all, you get a refusal to publish the documents \u2013 so you get the redacted version, which did confirm that all the meetings had taken place. Then you get the American version, which shows they did take place. Then you get the version which was given to me, which I produced for the public interest, which suddenly, this morning, is apparently an invention by somebody else. I tell you what it\u2019s in their imagination. They are up to their dirty tricks with our NHS, our services, our lives and our market in the future. No Labour government will ever sell our National Health Service. It is simply not for sale. Just to be clear, the suggestion is that the documents were first posted on Reddit by an account which was part of a campaign directed by Moscow. Here\u2019s Reddit\u2019s statement from last night: \u201cWe were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK. We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn says he was proud to go to Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green and say that a Labour government would scrap universal credit. He says we need \u201ca real living wage\u201d for all workers, including young workers. On the NHS, Corbyn says that Johnson seemed annoyed yesterday when he mentioned that the Conservatives voted against its creation 41 times. \u201cThe Welsh Labor government has been grotesquely underfunded by the Westminster government,\u201d says Corbyn. It would be so much better with a Labour government in Westminster working with a Labour government in Wales, he says. On the issue of compensating the Waspi women, he says the media often ask him how he can afford the policy. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a moral responsibility,\u201d says Corbyn. He says Michael Gove doesn\u2019t like him very much. There are boos from the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok. They don\u2019t call me marmite for nothing,\u201d says Corbyn. He talks about Labour\u2019s plans for a \u201cgreen revolution\u201d. \u201cYou cannot go on watching species being extinct and forests burned in Latin America and West Africa,\u201d he says. He says he wants a Labour government to host COP26 and \u201cto go further and faster then Paris envisaged\u201d. \u201cAt the current rate we won\u2019t reach emissions targets until 2099,\u201d he says. Jeremy Corbyn is talking at an event in Swansea. He\u2019s talking about the linking of music and art with socialist ideas to \u201ccreate the kind of society we want to create\u201d. He pays tribute to his favourite poet, Dylan Thomas, from Swansea. You can watch it live here. Boris Johnson has abandoned a walkabout in Westhoughton, Lancashire, after about 100 protesters took to the town\u2019s high street along with a large screen with a photo of the prime minister with Donald Trump. \u201cHave they just done the UK\u2019s biggest drug deal?\u201d it asked. The PM had planned to meet voters in the marginal Bolton West constituency, taken by the Tories\u2019 Chris Green in 2015 after holding off Labour\u2019s Julie Hilling by just 936 votes in 2017. But after the Tory battle bus arrived in town it was decided that the visit should be abandoned, amid the presence of protesters. The demonstrators, some of whom were from the Socialist Worker newspaper and holding banners saying: \u201cNo to Racism, No to Boris Johnson\u201d, had lined the high street where the walkabout was expected to take place. Instead, Johnson travelled back to London by car after his trip to the north-west on Saturday and his battle bus also headed south. Jo Swinson has insisted she would not quit as leader of the Liberal Democrats leader if the party fails to make significant gains in the general election. Asked if she would stand down in such circumstances, Swinson said: No, because I have just been elected as leader of the Liberal Democrats four months ago with an overwhelming majority. We have got more members than we have ever had before and we are running a strong campaign. So, people have got confidence in my leadership and I\u2019m excited to be doing the job. Boris Johnson has been asked about the issue of a potential Russian link to the NHS documents while on a campaign event in Cheshire. Well I do think we need to get to the bottom of that. As far as I am aware we haven\u2019t yet established the truth about that, but what I certainly think is that document, whatever it was intended to prove, did not prove what Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party hoped it would prove. And I\u2019m afraid it was just another distraction. Jeremy Corbyn has been asked about Reddit\u2019s announcement that documents used by Labour as evidence that the NHS would be on the table in a post-Brexit US trade deal were posted by an account linked to a disinformation campaign directed by Moscow. (See our story here.) He was asked to respond to the suggestion that Labour had either directly or indirectly benefited from a Russian trolling operation. This is such nonsense. This is such an advanced state of rather belated conspiracy theories by the prime minister. When we released the documents, at no stage did the prime minister or anybody deny that those documents were real, deny the arguments that we put forward. And if there has been no discussion with the US about access to our health markets, if all of that is wrong, how come after a week they still haven\u2019t said that? The issues are that those documents show exactly what the British government is doing in discussions with Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the USA and also why the prime minister has refused to release the report on Russian interference in British politics, which he\u2019s been sitting on for a very long time. He refused to say from where the Labour party had obtained the documents. We obtained those documents. We believed those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday denied the correctness of those documents. The issue is there should be no interference in British politics by anybody else. The prime minister has answers to give, which he refuses to do, about Russian donations to the Tory party or the report that he is sitting on about Russian interference in British politics. Of course there should be no interference in our British political system by Donald Trump or the Russians. More photo ops on the campaign trail. You can watch a live stream of Jeremy Corbyn making a latte on a visit to a cafe in Swansea here: Boris Johnson has been visiting Cheadle, near Stockport, where he attended a junior girls\u2019 soccer match between Hazel Grove United U10s and Poynton Juniors u10s. The PA news agency has been following Nigel Farage on his visit to Sedgefield in County Durham. The Brexit party leader donned a hard hat and protective glasses as he visited the factory of Tolley Fabrications, a company specialising in aluminium, stainless steel and super-duplex fabrications. He was asked by a worker who he trusted most out of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn . \u201cDo you know something, that\u2019s the most difficult question I\u2019ve been asked,\u201d he responded. \u201cI\u2019ve known Boris on and off for 25 years, and he is a likeable, entertaining personality. Would you absolutely trust him? No.\u201d When asked whether the prime minister could be trusted to deliver Brexit, Farage said: \u2018Get Brexit done\u2019 is an attractive line to a country where a lot of people are utterly cheesed off that this has been going on for three-and-a-half years. The idea that somebody\u2019s going to wave a magic wand is very appealing, and if it was true I would support him 100%. But it\u2019s not. If he passes the withdrawal agreement unamended, we go into three more years of agony. It will be Brexit in name only, but we\u2019ll still be stuck with all the European rules and regulations, with no say whatsoever and with a huge bill. Here is the latest piece of polling analysis by Dan Sabbagh, defence and security editor and our resident polling expert for the election. A week to go before the election and the Conservative vote appears to have peaked. The party\u2019s share hit 42% about a fortnight ago and has not advanced since \u2013 a level that is intriguingly similar to the 42.34% result achieved by Theresa May in the last general election. The party now dominates the leave vote \u2013 with a 69% share, according to ICM\u2019s analysis published this week \u2013 following the effective surrender of Nigel Farage in the early part of the campaign. Essentially, the Conservatives\u2019 five-point improvement during the campaign has been almost entirely at the Brexit party\u2019s expense. Friends of the Earth has judged that Labour has the most impressive environmental policies of any of the main UK-wide political parties. The organisation examined the manifestos of the Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats and Green parties and scored each against their election asks, which covered 10 areas, including climate targets, energy, transport, food and nature. The manifestos were marked out of 45. They said: The final assessment saw Labour, Lib Dems and Greens all marked highly, but with the Labour party given a slightly higher score overall. The Conservative party scored poorly: its manifesto was judged to be missing significant commitments in numerous areas, inadequate policies in others, and actively damaging policies in transport. Here were the final scores: Labour: 33 Green: 31 Liberal Democrat: 30 Conservatives: 5.5 Dave Timms, Friends of the Earth\u2019s head of political affairs, said: Environmental issues have been given greater priority in this election than ever before \u2013 and with the world in the midst of an ecological and climate crisis this must be the next government\u2019s top priority. Many of the policies that Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Green party have put forward are commensurate with, or striving to meet, the challenges we face. It is disappointing we have not yet seen the same urgency, ambition or consistency from the Conservative party. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has also been on both the Today programme and Sky News. He\u2019s been setting out Labour\u2019s plans to electrify England\u2019s entire bus fleet. You can read the story here: In the light of claims that UK government documents leaked online \u2013 and used by Labour to hammer home their argument about NHS vulnerability in post-Brexit US/UK trade talks \u2013 could have been subject to Russian interference, McDonald said it would be perfectly legitimate to hold an inquiry. I think that\u2019s perfectly legitimate. I think what interests me particularly is the content of the documents. He called on the government to publish the report by parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee (ISC) into possible Russian interference in the UK democratic process. If we want to get to the bottom of the extent to which the Russian state interferes in elections, can we please publish the Intelligence and Security Committee report? Let\u2019s get that out there. That should have been published ages ago. Here\u2019s a roundup of what is happening on the campaign trail today. Today is \u201csmall business Saturday\u201d, so expect the party leaders to be setting out their offerings to small business owners. Boris Johnson is visiting north-west England, although his exact plans have not yet been disclosed. Jeremy Corbyn takes the Labour campaign to Wales, touring the country and appearing at a rally. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson will visit Hertfordshire to discuss her policies with small businesses to try to convince them to back her party. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, travels to Sedgefield in County Durham, where he will also meet business representatives. The outgoing culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning about the Conservative party\u2019s pledge to invest \u00a3550m in grassroots football. (You can read the BBC story here.) She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that it was \u201cextremely serious\u201d that leaked documents \u2013 used by Labour to claim that the US wanted NHS to be included in future trade deals \u2013 could be linked to a Russian disinformation campaign. You can read the background here: I understand from what was being put on that website, those who seem to know about these things say that it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference. And if that is the case, that obviously is extremely serious. And actually as culture secretary, obviously one of the things that we are looking for and monitoring is any interference in our elections. She was later asked by Sky News why, if they were so concerned about Russian interference, had No 10 blocked the publication of a report examining the country\u2019s infiltration of British politics. She said it had been a matter of timing and the speed with which parliament had been dissolved. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a parliament to publish that report to,\u201d she said. All I can say is the government, obviously, is taking steps. We are very aware of the potential for overseas interference and watching very carefully through lots of different channels as to what potentially might be going on. Here\u2019s a video of the highlights from last night\u2019s debate \u2013 Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog on the morning after Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson went head-to-head in a BBC debate. The party leaders clashed over Islamophobia and antisemitism in their parties, with both accusing the other of \u201ca failure of leadership\u201d. Johnson said: \u201cI think that Mr Corbyn\u2019s handling of this particular issue, his unwillingness to take a stand and stand up for Jewish people in the Labour party and put an arm round them is a failure of leadership.\u201d Corbyn hit back: \u201cA failure of leadership is when you use racist remarks to describe people from different countries or in our society. I will never do that \u2026 I hope that the prime minister understands the hurt that people feel when they hear remarks and articles he has written.\u201d You can read the full write-up from the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, and political correspondent Kate Proctor here. And political correspondent Peter Walker has an assessment of who won the debate here. A snap poll from YouGov found 52% of Britons asked after watching the debate believed Johnson won and 48% Corbyn. The pollster said it fell within the margin of error and so could be considered another draw. Those surveyed said Corbyn was more trustworthy than Johnson by 48% to 38% but Johnson was considered more prime ministerial by 54% to 30%. We have fact-checked claims made by the two party leaders.

      "body": "<h2>\u2018Think of your ornaments as heirlooms\u2019: Hannah Bullivant, stylist</h2> <p>Sustainability and seasonality are two guiding principles in the work of Kent-based stylist Hannah Bullivant. \u201cI don\u2019t want to create pretty things that then end up in landfill. I don\u2019t want to add to that problem,\u201d she explains. Her work \u2013 which encompasses event styling, creative workshops and interior styling projects \u2013 wholeheartedly embraces the storied and the secondhand. So, when asked to create a sustainable tree, she immediately headed outside.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re out foraging, there is often a story associated with the objects you find. You\u2019ll remember the walk you were on, the people with you, the light or the weather that day. Foraging makes something place-specific, and it\u2019s free!\u201d</p> <p>The branch that Bullivant has dressed was found in her friends\u2019 garden. It had fallen from an oak tree. \u201cIt is hard to find the perfect branch,\u201d she says. \u201cFor this, I was looking for one with a straight middle and an equal spread at the top, but nothing too perfect. I love that it still has a few oak leaves hanging on.\u201d It is held upright in a metal tree stand with screws, which is covered by a tree skirt, woven in willow. (\u201cNot everyone has time to forage \u2013 and not everyone will necessarily know what to do with the branch when they do,\u201d Bullivant admits. If that\u2019s the case, then she suggests a sustainable, shop-bought alternative, such as <a href=\"http://www.demelzahill.com/branch\" title=\"\">Branch</a>, by the designer Demelza Hill.)</p> <p>The branch has been dressed with a combination of foraged posies and eco-friendly shop-bought decorations. Bullivant made the posies by gathering a mixture of fresh and dried foliage, including sprigs of box hedge, bronze-coloured bracken, dried seed heads, and spikes of rosemary or thyme. (\u201cNever uproot a plant, strip a bush, or take from public green spaces without permission,\u201d she advises.) These have been tied to the branch with ribbons supplied by <a href=\"https://www.thenaturaldyeworks.com/\" title=\"\">Natural Dyeworks</a>, a local small-batch company that creates natural dye from foraged ingredients such as nettle, madder root and alder cones.</p> <p>Bullivant suggests you approach your purchases with sustainability and longevity in mind.

The white porcelain ornaments, stamped with objects found in nature, are from <a href=\"https://www.aerende.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Aerende</a>, an online \u201clife-improving\u201d homeware store that sells products crafted in the UK by people facing barriers to employment.

The hand-painted, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 baubles are made from recycled newspaper.</p> <p>\u201cThink of your ornaments as heirlooms to be passed down,\u201d Bullivant suggests. It\u2019s a philosophy that extends right the way to the bottom of the branch, where the gifts have been wrapped in material from <a href=\"https://www.foldswrap.com/\" title=\"\">Folds</a>, a company that sells reusable organic cotton and certified linen gift wrap. \u201cA fragrant herb or slice of dried orange can be tucked into the gifts for a complete sensory, present-opening experience,\u201d adds Bullivant. <br><em><a href=\"http://hannahbullivant.com\" title=\"\">hannahbullivant.com</a></em></p> <h2>\u2018I want to make waste meaningful\u2019: Robi Walters, artist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f43723c7ce9ae52474f80fb0288e5cd460ddb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f43723c7ce9ae52474f80fb0288e5cd460ddb2/0_604_5200_5091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019ve always enjoyed taking unwanted things  and making them beautiful\u2019: Robi Walters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"979\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve always enjoyed taking unwanted things and making them beautiful\u2019: Robi Walters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Mulvey/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.\u201d The artist Robi Walters lives by this maxim. For more than a decade, his practice has involved building up mesmerising collages from individual, hand-cut petals made from recycled card. The colours gently shift in tone and are shot through with flecks of neon or metallic.</p> <p>\u201cEven as a boy, I was inquisitive about discarded objects,\u201d Walters recalls. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to take things that were unwanted and make them beautiful, so that they become wanted. It has taken me years to discover that my art is really a reflection of my life story.\u201d His childhood was unsettled and, following a traumatic event, he was taken into care at five. That experience has shaped his award-winning art, which has also been informed by his daily meditation.</p> <p>\u201cThe shapes in my work are inspired by sacred geometry,\u201d Walters explains. \u201cThe shape of the petal is of two overlapping circles, which for me represents renewal or creation.\u201d By laying these petals one on top of the other, Walters achieves that elusive state of flow: \u201cI have to not think about what I\u2019m doing. As soon as I do, it becomes a struggle.\u201d</p> <p>The concept of creating a sustainable Christmas tree wasn\u2019t new to Walters. In the past, he has taken the trunks of discarded trees and sliced them into wooden discs, incorporating them into his art. For this structure, Walters asked friends and family to part with Christmas cards they\u2019ve held on to for years. \u201cI wanted these messages and sentiments to live on instead of being kept in a box,\u201d he says. These multiple seasonal greetings have been given new meaning in his gleaming collage, which Walters would like to see placed on display in a children\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>He has also made freestanding ornaments from simple painted wooden shapes from off-cuts of wood salvaged from a building site near his studio in Soho, central London. Walters sat with his daughter to paint the small shapes and crafted the neon paper chain from strips of spray-painted <em>Observer Magazine</em> pages. \u201cI want to make waste beautiful in a simple, meaningful way,\u201d he explains. \u201cGetting the next generation involved is a big part of that. If I can inspire those who see my art to create something similar \u2013 to look at their rubbish in a new light \u2013 then that is fantastic.\u201d<br><em>Robi Walters is the artist in residence at Aston Martin.

She is moving on to a 35ft houseboat and her collapsible Christmas tree is coming with her. \u201cIt hangs, so it\u2019s a brilliant space-saver, and it will move around as the boat bobs on the water,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Potter\u2019s sustainable tree is made from easily accessible materials (what hasn\u2019t been found has been bought cheaply from a local hardware store). The base of the structure is an old aluminium bike wheel with its spokes removed. Chains have been screwed inside the spoke holes to form a pyramid structure that is hung from a central carabiner. Tensioning wire has then been threaded around the chains. The jade-coloured fronds of the tree are made from salvaged ghost gear \u2013 abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing nets that wash up on shorelines around the UK.</p> <p>Potter runs a circular-economy design studio in Hove, East Sussex. \u201cEverything we do is regenerative by design,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe try to utilise waste streams in our design processes, so this tree design represents exactly the sort of project we do. It also ties in with our specialism \u2013 marine plastics \u2013 and the voluntary work I\u2019m part of.\u201d</p> <p>Potter founded the <a href=\"https://www.plasticfreepledge.com/\" title=\"\">Plastic Free Pledge</a> campaign in 2016, which has since grown into a global movement. She is a voluntary representative for <a href=\"https://www.sas.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Surfers Against Sewage</a>, and leads regular beach cleans in Brighton. She is also a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ghostgear.org/\" title=\"\">Global Ghost Gear Initiative</a> (GGGI), which strives to reduce the 640,000 tonnes of fishing gear discarded in the sea each year.</p> <p>\u201cGhost gear is called ghost gear because it carries on fishing throughout its life, which is upwards of 600 years.\u201d The trawl nets that wash up on our shores are made from polypropylene or polyethylene, and the latter is not currently recyclable in the UK. \u201cOn beach cleans, the litter you find \u2013 glass, cans, some plastics \u2013 can quite often be recycled,\u201d says Potter. \u201cBut fishing net has no outlet whatsoever: it has zero value to the fishers and it actually costs them money to get rid of it.\u201d</p> <p>Through the government-funded <a href=\"http://www.clairepotterdesign.com/theecospot/category/project-net%C2%B7worth/\" title=\"\">Project: Net Worth</a>, Potter has developed products that can be made from melted, injection-moulded ghost gear, such as an incredibly robust cabinet handle. \u201cIt looks like malachite or jade and it will last pretty much for ever. The idea is to show how the material could be used and to actually increase its value. It\u2019s about thinking innovatively and finding ways to lock up that material for as long as possible.\u201d<br><em><a href=\"http://clairepotterdesign.com/\" title=\"\">clairepotterdesign.com</a></em></p>",

It has taken me years to discover that my art is really a reflection of my life story.\u201d His childhood was unsettled and, following a traumatic event, he was taken into care at five. That experience has shaped his award-winning art, which has also been informed by his daily meditation. \u201cThe shapes in my work are inspired by sacred geometry,\u201d Walters explains. \u201cThe shape of the petal is of two overlapping circles, which for me represents renewal or creation.\u201d By laying these petals one on top of the other, Walters achieves that elusive state of flow: \u201cI have to not think about what I\u2019m doing. As soon as I do, it becomes a struggle.\u201d The concept of creating a sustainable Christmas tree wasn\u2019t new to Walters. In the past, he has taken the trunks of discarded trees and sliced them into wooden discs, incorporating them into his art. For this structure, Walters asked friends and family to part with Christmas cards they\u2019ve held on to for years. \u201cI wanted these messages and sentiments to live on instead of being kept in a box,\u201d he says. These multiple seasonal greetings have been given new meaning in his gleaming collage, which Walters would like to see placed on display in a children\u2019s hospital. He has also made freestanding ornaments from simple painted wooden shapes from off-cuts of wood salvaged from a building site near his studio in Soho, central London. Walters sat with his daughter to paint the small shapes and crafted the neon paper chain from strips of spray-painted Observer Magazine pages. \u201cI want to make waste beautiful in a simple, meaningful way,\u201d he explains. \u201cGetting the next generation involved is a big part of that. If I can inspire those who see my art to create something similar \u2013 to look at their rubbish in a new light \u2013 then that is fantastic.\u201d Robi Walters is the artist in residence at Aston Martin. If you can find a place for his tree in a children\u2019s ward, email gallery@robiwalters.com \u2018Everything we make is regenerative\u2019: Claire Potter, designer and activist \u201cLiving in the smallest space possible is one of the most responsible things we can do,\u201d explains designer and campaigner Claire Potter, who is currently downsizing. She is moving on to a 35ft houseboat and her collapsible Christmas tree is coming with her. \u201cIt hangs, so it\u2019s a brilliant space-saver, and it will move around as the boat bobs on the water,\u201d she says. Potter\u2019s sustainable tree is made from easily accessible materials (what hasn\u2019t been found has been bought cheaply from a local hardware store). The base of the structure is an old aluminium bike wheel with its spokes removed. Chains have been screwed inside the spoke holes to form a pyramid structure that is hung from a central carabiner. Tensioning wire has then been threaded around the chains. The jade-coloured fronds of the tree are made from salvaged ghost gear \u2013 abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing nets that wash up on shorelines around the UK. Potter runs a circular-economy design studio in Hove, East Sussex. \u201cEverything we do is regenerative by design,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe try to utilise waste streams in our design processes, so this tree design represents exactly the sort of project we do. It also ties in with our specialism \u2013 marine plastics \u2013 and the voluntary work I\u2019m part of.\u201d Potter founded the Plastic Free Pledge campaign in 2016, which has since grown into a global movement. She is a voluntary representative for Surfers Against Sewage, and leads regular beach cleans in Brighton. She is also a member of the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI), which strives to reduce the 640,000 tonnes of fishing gear discarded in the sea each year. \u201cGhost gear is called ghost gear because it carries on fishing throughout its life, which is upwards of 600 years.\u201d The trawl nets that wash up on our shores are made from polypropylene or polyethylene, and the latter is not currently recyclable in the UK. \u201cOn beach cleans, the litter you find \u2013 glass, cans, some plastics \u2013 can quite often be recycled,\u201d says Potter. \u201cBut fishing net has no outlet whatsoever: it has zero value to the fishers and it actually costs them money to get rid of it.\u201d Through the government-funded Project: Net Worth, Potter has developed products that can be made from melted, injection-moulded ghost gear, such as an incredibly robust cabinet handle. \u201cIt looks like malachite or jade and it will last pretty much for ever. The idea is to show how the material could be used and to actually increase its value. It\u2019s about thinking innovatively and finding ways to lock up that material for as long as possible.\u201d clairepotterdesign.com",

      "body": "<p>For my sins, I get invited to give a few public lectures every year. Mostly, the topic on which I\u2019m asked to speak is the implications for democracy of digital technology as it has been exploited by a number of giant US corporations. My general argument is that those implications are not good, and I try to explain why I think this is the case. When I\u2019ve finished, there is usually some polite applause before the Q&amp;A begins. And always one particular question comes up. \u201cWhy are you so pessimistic?\u201d</p> <p>The interesting thing about that is the way it reveals as much about the questioner as it does about the lecturer. All I have done in my talk, after all, is to lay out the grounds for concern about what networked technology is doing to our democracies. Mostly, my audiences recognise those grounds as genuine \u2013 indeed as things about which they themselves have been fretting. So if someone regards a critical examination of these issues as \u201cpessimistic\u201d then it suggests that they have subconsciously imbibed the positive narrative of tech evangelism.</p> <p>An ideology is what determines how you think even when you don\u2019t know you\u2019re thinking. Tech evangelism is an example. And one of the functions of an ideology is to stop us asking awkward questions. Last week Vice News carried another horrifying story about the dark underbelly of social media. A number of Facebook moderators \u2013 those who spot and delete unspeakable content uploaded to the platform \u2013 are suing the company and one of its subcontractors in an Irish court, saying they suffered \u201cpsychological trauma\u201d as a result of poor working conditions and a lack of proper training to prepare them for viewing some of the most horrific content seen anywhere online. \u201cMy first day on the job,\u201d one of them, Sean Burke, reported, \u201cI witnessed someone being beaten to death with a plank of wood with nails in it.\u201d A few days later he \u201cstarted seeing actual child porn\u201d.</p> <p>Facebook employs thousands of people like Burke worldwide, generally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/17/revealed-catastrophic-effects-working-facebook-moderator\" title=\"\">using subcontractors</a>.

The soothing tech narrative is that Facebook is spending all this money to ensure that our social-media feeds are clean and unperturbing. So it\u2019s an example of corporate social responsibility. The question that is never asked is, why does Facebook allow anybody to post anything they choose \u2013 no matter how grotesque \u2013 on its platforms, when it has total control of those platforms?

      "bodyText": "For my sins, I get invited to give a few public lectures every year. Mostly, the topic on which I\u2019m asked to speak is the implications for democracy of digital technology as it has been exploited by a number of giant US corporations. My general argument is that those implications are not good, and I try to explain why I think this is the case. When I\u2019ve finished, there is usually some polite applause before the Q&amp;A begins. And always one particular question comes up. \u201cWhy are you so pessimistic?\u201d The interesting thing about that is the way it reveals as much about the questioner as it does about the lecturer. All I have done in my talk, after all, is to lay out the grounds for concern about what networked technology is doing to our democracies. Mostly, my audiences recognise those grounds as genuine \u2013 indeed as things about which they themselves have been fretting. So if someone regards a critical examination of these issues as \u201cpessimistic\u201d then it suggests that they have subconsciously imbibed the positive narrative of tech evangelism.

Today, one in every five pounds of UK retail spending is online \u2013 double the figure for a decade ago. It is not all doom and gloom: tills are still ringing in some locations, especially the more upmarket centres. But the property industry\u2019s view is that 30% of the UK\u2019s 111m sq metres of shop space is redundant and needs to be repurposed as hotels and leisure destinations \u2013 or, particularly within the M25, as housing.</p> <p>\u201cThe pressure to drive rents has disappeared,\u201d says Simms. \u201cIf you take 20% of spend out of bricks and mortar over a 15-year period, that is a huge change.

Nobody is confident enough to say we are through this period of turmoil.\u201d</p> <p>But while equity markets have slashed the value of bricks-and-mortar retailers and their listed landlords, the true value of direct property funds like M&amp;G\u2019s has not been tested, because no one has been selling amid the turmoil.</p> <p>James Child, head of retail and industrial research at <em>EG</em> magazine, says the past six months have been the worst for deal-making on record: \u201cUK shopping-centre investment has plummeted by more than 50% this year, compared with the same period in 2018.\u201d</p> <p>Less than \u00a3540m has been invested in shopping centre assets so far this year, which Child says looks set to be the lowest annual figure recorded since 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d972cee0b1fb3d9977431dcee747b072142aa86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d972cee0b1fb3d9977431dcee747b072142aa86/0_241_6398_3839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The House of Fraser store at the Gracechurch Centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The House of Fraser store at the Gracechurch Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of 2018, the asset manager Fidelity International warned that the value of UK shopping centres and retail parks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/29/collapsed-intu-bid-reveals-bricks-and-mortar-retailers-fight-for-survival\" title=\"\">could fall by 20-70%</a> if prices were to catch up with retail\u2019s grim new reality.

Suspending the property fund is designed to give M&amp;G\u2019s managers a window to rebuild its cash pile by selling assets in an \u201corderly manner\u201d to \u201cpreserve value for our investors\u201d, the company says. Good luck with that, say property experts. Buyers \u2013 of shopping centres, at least \u2013 are as rare as hen\u2019s teeth as owners sit tight and bargain-hunters scent blood in the water. Dan Simms of the property advisory firm Colliers International says such assets are hard to price amid a stream of company voluntary arrangements \u2013 a form of insolvency being used by retailers to close stores \u2013 that are pulling down rents. \u201cThe problem is liquidity. The market doesn\u2019t know how far rents are going to fall,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to stop, the price people are willing to pay is constantly being discounted.\u201d The fact that the retail sector is going through a rough patch is not news to anyone. A succession of household names \u2013 from the department store chains House of Fraser and Debenhams to, most recently, the card retailer Clintons \u2013 have resorted to rescue deals to stay in business over the past two years. Others, such as Karen Millen and Coast, have shut up shop and moved online. So unloved is Marks &amp; Spencer these days that it has dropped out of the FTSE 100. The quoted property companies have been hammered too. Intu Properties, the company behind Lakeside shopping centre in Essex and many others, has debts of \u00a34.5bn and is headed for a cash call. Its shares have fallen by nearly 70% this year, and the group \u2013 which was the subject of an abortive \u00a32.9bn takeover last year \u2013 is now worth less than \u00a3500m. Nearly 40% of the M&amp;G fund\u2019s holdings are shopping centres and retail parks. Its biggest investments include Gracechurch, which it bought for \u00a388m in 2013; Fremlin Walk in Maidstone, Kent, where struggling House of Fraser is the star attraction, which cost \u00a3110m in 2014; and the Bridgend Designer Outlet in Wales, which it snapped up for a similar amount in 2015. When M&amp;G announced the deal for Gracechurch, it was billed as a \u201cgood quality shopping centre\u201d that had \u201cproved resilient in tough market conditions\u201d. Today, regulars describe it as \u201cdepressing\u201d as the big household names vacate. \u201cThe way they have let this go now, it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d complains David Brunn, who has come to look around the shops with his wife, Linda. \u201cShops open for six months and then they shut again.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d agrees Linda. \u201cSince we lost M&amp;S there\u2019s nowhere to buy stuff. They need to spend money on it: all the shops are closing.\u201d While demand for warehousing to handle web orders has increased, the march of the internet has cast a deep shadow over the future worth of shopping centres and retail parks. Today, one in every five pounds of UK retail spending is online \u2013 double the figure for a decade ago. It is not all doom and gloom: tills are still ringing in some locations, especially the more upmarket centres. But the property industry\u2019s view is that 30% of the UK\u2019s 111m sq metres of shop space is redundant and needs to be repurposed as hotels and leisure destinations \u2013 or, particularly within the M25, as housing. \u201cThe pressure to drive rents has disappeared,\u201d says Simms. \u201cIf you take 20% of spend out of bricks and mortar over a 15-year period, that is a huge change. We don\u2019t know where this will end at the moment. Nobody is confident enough to say we are through this period of turmoil.\u201d But while equity markets have slashed the value of bricks-and-mortar retailers and their listed landlords, the true value of direct property funds like M&amp;G\u2019s has not been tested, because no one has been selling amid the turmoil. James Child, head of retail and industrial research at EG magazine, says the past six months have been the worst for deal-making on record: \u201cUK shopping-centre investment has plummeted by more than 50% this year, compared with the same period in 2018.\u201d Less than \u00a3540m has been invested in shopping centre assets so far this year, which Child says looks set to be the lowest annual figure recorded since 2012. At the end of 2018, the asset manager Fidelity International warned that the value of UK shopping centres and retail parks could fall by 20-70% if prices were to catch up with retail\u2019s grim new reality. The price crash would reflect the need for rents to be reset, with Fidelity suggesting cuts of 10-40% were the order of the day to make stores \u201csustainable and affordable\u201d for bricks-and-mortar retailers. Fidelity\u2019s real estate investment director, Adrian Benedict, says values have fallen by about 10% this year but warns that rents are still \u201ctoo high\u201d and that would-be sellers will need to find courageous buyers willing to \u201ccatch a falling knife\u201d. \u201cOver the past 12 months there has been a phoney war because nobody has really had to sell anything,\u201d Benedict says. \u201cWe are now in a situation where we have a market participant where they need to sell and find a price. This could be the catalyst for the correction.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Until as recently as two years ago, one of the defining moments of Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s career was the one she spent years trying to forget. Wozniacki was ranked No 1 when she stared down Li Na in the semi-final of the Australian Open in 2011 and it had all the makings of a typical Wozniacki win: she chased down every last ball and gave nothing away, flitting to within a point of her second grand slam final at 20 years old.</p> <p>On match point Wozniacki changed nothing, but across the net adrenaline coursed through Li\u2019s veins as she made her last stand. She stepped inside the court and seized the moment, bulldozing a down\u2011the-line forehand winner to scupper her opponent before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/27/australian-open-2011-li-na\" title=\"\">turning the match around in three sets</a>.</p> <p>The defeat was so devastating for Wozniacki that, when she returned to the semi-final seven years later, it was still on her mind. \u201cI had match points against Li Na,\u201d she said in 2018. \u201cI lost it. That\u2019s still haunting me to this day.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/06/caroline-wozniacki-retire-after-australian-open-new-challenges-tennis\">Caroline Wozniacki will retire after bid to regain Australian Open title</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The loss would change the discourse around Wozniacki from bright new star to a player with fundamental flaws in her game and an asterisk beside her ranking. Wozniacki is one of the most defensive players to reach No 1 \u2013 she even ushered in the return of the moonball \u2013 and overly defensive players are often sneered at. Although Wozniacki consistently ground down top opponents in regular tournaments, deep in the biggest events the best shot-makers would rise to the occasion and hit her off the court.</p> <p>Wozniacki finished 2010 and 2011 ranked No 1 with 12 titles in two years, but her inability to complement those results with a slam helped to embed a new pejorative in the tennis lexicon: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/17/caroline-wozniacki-interview-australian-open\" title=\"\">\u201cSlamless No 1</a>.\u201d People questioned why her serve could scale 118mph but her forehand could not crack open an egg. Fingers often pointed directly at her father and coach, Piotr.</p> <p>On Friday, Wozniacki announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/06/caroline-wozniacki-retire-after-australian-open-new-challenges-tennis\" title=\"\">she will retire</a> after the Australian Open in January. \u201cI\u2019ve always told myself, when the time comes, that there are things away from tennis that I want to do more, then it\u2019s time to be done. In recent months, I\u2019ve realised that there is a lot more in life that I\u2019d like to accomplish off the court,\u201d she wrote on social media.</p> <p>Although Wozniacki is 29 in a world where the 38-year-olds Roger Federer and Serena Williams are still going strong, this is no surprise. Last year, she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and competing with it this year has been tough. Her ranking has fallen to 38th after returning to the No 1 spot last season.</p> <p>Her diminished stamina and chronic stiffness directly affect her physical strengths and it has left her body more brittle. Off the court, Wozniacki married her fiance, the former NBA player David Lee, and as she took her first extended glance towards her future, she looked back at her sport with a changed perspective. Wozniacki always said that she did not plan on competing deep into her thirties. This was an opportunity to depart joyfully on her terms and she took it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7e87993fcf301adb9780eefd11311ce829e4043\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e87993fcf301adb9780eefd11311ce829e4043/0_148_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Wozniacki celebrates her first grand slam title after beating Simona Halep at the 2018 Australian Open.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Wozniacki celebrates her first grand slam title after beating Simona Halep at the 2018 Australian Open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wozniacki\u2019s beginnings reflect her drive and mental fortitude. Her parents immigrated to Denmark from Poland in the late 1980s, a few years before she was born. There was no solid structure to help her reach the top and the country simply did not produce players until she came along. Wozniacki has frequently played alongside unranked novices in the Fed Cup team.</p> <p>Since neither Piotr or her mother, Anna, spoke English, from as young as 11 Wozniacki controlled much of her own destiny. She took important telephone calls, translated contracts and liaised with tournament directors, all with the aim of becoming the best in the world.</p> <p>After their daily practice sessions, Wozniacki and her father would regularly drive around Denmark to pitch her potential to sponsors. They had to convince organisations that a girl from an immigrant background would somehow make it to the top in a country with no top players and then that they should give money to her. Throughout her youth, they were burned by the constant criticisms of her father\u2019s hands-on approach to her career.</p> <p>Despite the clear obstacles, Wozniacki\u2019s rise proved to be seamless.

      "bodyText": "Until as recently as two years ago, one of the defining moments of Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s career was the one she spent years trying to forget. Wozniacki was ranked No 1 when she stared down Li Na in the semi-final of the Australian Open in 2011 and it had all the makings of a typical Wozniacki win: she chased down every last ball and gave nothing away, flitting to within a point of her second grand slam final at 20 years old. On match point Wozniacki changed nothing, but across the net adrenaline coursed through Li\u2019s veins as she made her last stand. She stepped inside the court and seized the moment, bulldozing a down\u2011the-line forehand winner to scupper her opponent before turning the match around in three sets. The defeat was so devastating for Wozniacki that, when she returned to the semi-final seven years later, it was still on her mind. \u201cI had match points against Li Na,\u201d she said in 2018. \u201cI lost it. That\u2019s still haunting me to this day.\u201d The loss would change the discourse around Wozniacki from bright new star to a player with fundamental flaws in her game and an asterisk beside her ranking. Wozniacki is one of the most defensive players to reach No 1 \u2013 she even ushered in the return of the moonball \u2013 and overly defensive players are often sneered at. Although Wozniacki consistently ground down top opponents in regular tournaments, deep in the biggest events the best shot-makers would rise to the occasion and hit her off the court. Wozniacki finished 2010 and 2011 ranked No 1 with 12 titles in two years, but her inability to complement those results with a slam helped to embed a new pejorative in the tennis lexicon: \u201cSlamless No 1.\u201d People questioned why her serve could scale 118mph but her forehand could not crack open an egg. Fingers often pointed directly at her father and coach, Piotr. On Friday, Wozniacki announced that she will retire after the Australian Open in January. \u201cI\u2019ve always told myself, when the time comes, that there are things away from tennis that I want to do more, then it\u2019s time to be done. In recent months, I\u2019ve realised that there is a lot more in life that I\u2019d like to accomplish off the court,\u201d she wrote on social media. Although Wozniacki is 29 in a world where the 38-year-olds Roger Federer and Serena Williams are still going strong, this is no surprise. Last year, she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and competing with it this year has been tough. Her ranking has fallen to 38th after returning to the No 1 spot last season. Her diminished stamina and chronic stiffness directly affect her physical strengths and it has left her body more brittle. Off the court, Wozniacki married her fiance, the former NBA player David Lee, and as she took her first extended glance towards her future, she looked back at her sport with a changed perspective. Wozniacki always said that she did not plan on competing deep into her thirties. This was an opportunity to depart joyfully on her terms and she took it. Wozniacki\u2019s beginnings reflect her drive and mental fortitude. Her parents immigrated to Denmark from Poland in the late 1980s, a few years before she was born. There was no solid structure to help her reach the top and the country simply did not produce players until she came along. Wozniacki has frequently played alongside unranked novices in the Fed Cup team. Since neither Piotr or her mother, Anna, spoke English, from as young as 11 Wozniacki controlled much of her own destiny. She took important telephone calls, translated contracts and liaised with tournament directors, all with the aim of becoming the best in the world. After their daily practice sessions, Wozniacki and her father would regularly drive around Denmark to pitch her potential to sponsors. They had to convince organisations that a girl from an immigrant background would somehow make it to the top in a country with no top players and then that they should give money to her. Throughout her youth, they were burned by the constant criticisms of her father\u2019s hands-on approach to her career. Despite the clear obstacles, Wozniacki\u2019s rise proved to be seamless. She became the junior world No 1 and Wimbledon girls\u2019 champion in 2006. As she racked up titles and marched deep into most other tournaments, it always seemed like a slam draw would eventually break apart for her. Instead, her career after 2012 would be a turbulent cycle of injuries, burnout and comebacks. Wozniacki was a struggling nonentity for nearly two years until she returned unexpectedly in the summer of 2014, storming into the US Open final and eventually returning to the top 10 in a season punctuated by a 3hr 26min 33sec debut New York marathon time after a 10-month tennis season. However, the marathon effort only seemed to invite more injuries; by 2016, Wozniacki had fallen as low as 74th. Seven years after her loss to Li, Wozniacki stared down two match points at 1-5 and 40-15 in the second round of the 2018 Australian Open against the unheralded Jana Fett. She recovered before outlasting Simona Halep in a grimy, exhausting three\u2011set match to win her first slam title in oppressive humidity. Although Wozniacki has made small adjustments to her game over the years, she worked a tired Halep so thoroughly that the Romanian finished the night dehydrated in hospital. The manner of the victory was a reminder that Wozniacki had spent years hearing people tell her she was too defensive and needed a new coach. Although she responded calmly to every question about her limp forehand and overbearing father, she never let those outside opinions sway her into overhauling her game. Wozniacki\u2019s composure rarely breaks unless she is petulantly battling umpires or verbally jousting with her nemesis, Maria Sharapova, but as she finally achieved the elusive slam that had weighed so heavily on her shoulders, she stared at her father and sobbed in disbelief. What a triumph to have finally succeeded on her own path and in her own time and likewise to depart from her sport with her head held high and the rest of her life still to come.",

Charlotte Perriand worked and made iconic designs with Le Corbusier. She designed simple things for everyday life \u2013 tables, stools, kitchens \u2013 so you can find her design in a lot of places. There\u2019s a minimalism to her work, but also a playfulness, a lightness. I think this exhibition [at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris] is very important, because she was a bit underrated compared with people like Jean Prouv\u00e9, but now she\u2019s getting the praise she always deserved.</p> <h2>2.

So I dug into all these newspaper and magazine articles, then last weekend I started reading this book. I have to say that it was quite scary, because it details all these new forms of economy that don\u2019t follow rules of any kind. I think everybody should be aware of what\u2019s happening and this book is very good for that: it\u2019s clear and well written and well explained, and it allows you to form your own opinion.</p> <h2>3.

This one has a lot of strange flashbacks and strange philosophies, but it\u2019s approachable for everybody. I thought the music was really cool, then I saw on the credits that it\u2019s by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who I\u2019m a big fan of.

There\u2019s a minimalism to her work, but also a playfulness, a lightness. I think this exhibition [at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris] is very important, because she was a bit underrated compared with people like Jean Prouv\u00e9, but now she\u2019s getting the praise she always deserved. 2. Nonfiction The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff Jaron Lanier\u2019s Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now introduced me to the new business model of data and Google and so on. So I dug into all these newspaper and magazine articles, then last weekend I started reading this book. I have to say that it was quite scary, because it details all these new forms of economy that don\u2019t follow rules of any kind. I think everybody should be aware of what\u2019s happening and this book is very good for that: it\u2019s clear and well written and well explained, and it allows you to form your own opinion. 3. Television Watchmen (HBO) There are so many TV shows now but this one is unique: I just finished watching it and it\u2019s very smart. I like it when shows are commercial \u2013 in that they are successful and people watch them \u2013 but at the same time very weird. This one has a lot of strange flashbacks and strange philosophies, but it\u2019s approachable for everybody. I thought the music was really cool, then I saw on the credits that it\u2019s by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who I\u2019m a big fan of. It\u2019s an amazing soundtrack: it takes possession of you. 4. Music book Phoenix: Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Phoenix! (Rizzoli) I love this book for many reasons. I\u2019m part of that movement from the 90s when all these French bands showed up on the scene, so it\u2019s like an old group of friends I\u2019m happy to see 20 years later. Usually books about bands are more like fan books, but this one is a real piece of art. It shows all aspects of life in a band, and how you can achieve a career without losing your essence. They really put their soul into the publishing of it: the way it\u2019s presented, the photographs. It really is a classic. 5. Shop Workshop Iss\u00e9, Paris This is the best sake shop in Paris. My friend Christian and I go here all the time to test new sake and eat food \u2013 in France we\u2019re obsessed with pairing the right drink with the right food. It\u2019s my headquarters: every week I go there and buy new products from Japan, and I do all my groceries there \u2013 you can find everything you need to cook Japanese food. I love the design, I love the music and I love their philosophy. This little shop is very important for me. I need that kind of place in Paris. It\u2019s like my drug. 6. Place Anavilhanas national park, Brazil My wife is from Brazil so we go there all the time, and it\u2019s really scary what\u2019s happening right now with the Amazon fires and all that destruction. I encourage anyone to go to this reserve: it\u2019s a natural archipelago three hours from Manaus, where you can discover the Amazon ecosystem by boat. You feel the wilderness of the environment and all the animals \u2013 it\u2019s very noisy at night \u2013 and you can feel you\u2019re part of something way, way bigger than you. You have to take a couple of planes to get to the lodge, but once you\u2019re there you will not regret it.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m not very good at resting. When I told friends that after writing books covering emotions, time perception and the psychology of money I had started writing one on rest, their first reaction was usually, \u201cBut you\u2019re always working. You never <em>rest</em>!\u201d</p> <p>More generally, if someone asks me how things are going, my stock answer is, \u201cFine, busy, too busy really.\u201d But while this claim feels true of my life, how much is it also a claim to status? If you say you are busy, then it implies you\u2019re important, you\u2019re in demand. As the time-use researcher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/30/academicexperts.research\" title=\"\">Jonathan Gershuny</a> puts it, busyness has become \u201ca badge of honour\u201d.</p> <p>In contrast to the 19th century, when the upper classes were happy to flaunt their idleness, in the 21st century it is work and not leisure that gives us social status.

And yet, it\u2019s not true that I\u2019m working all the time.

We feel we\u2019re not making the most of our lives and really should be doing something. And these days, for most of us, \u201cdoing something\u201d is defined very narrowly. It means, being busy. And not just some of the time, but all of the time.</p> <p>Yet as far back as Socrates we have been warned of the barrenness of a busy life. If we\u2019re busy all the time, life lacks essential rhythm. We miss out on the contrasts between doing and not doing. Of course, the art of rest does not lie in replacing constant busyness with total inactivity. If you are unemployed or have depression, enforced rest is far from relaxing.</p> <p>The state we want to reach is where we\u2019re active and engaged a lot of the time, but we have proper breaks away from it all. Rest without guilt, rest without stress.</p> <p>I spent almost two years studying rest as part of a multidisciplinary group at the <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/\" title=\"\">Wellcome Collection</a> on London\u2019s busy Euston Road. The group included poets, composers, geographers, neuroscientists, historians and more, each of whom approached the topic of rest slightly differently.</p> <p>We wondered whether other people found it hard to rest, too, and decided to find out not just what a few people thought, but what, as it turned out, 18,000 people from 135 countries thought. A group of psychologists from Durham University designed a survey called the Rest Test, which was launched on the programmes I present \u2013 <em>All in the Mind</em> on BBC Radio 4 and <em>Health Check</em> on the BBC World Service.</p> <p>We discovered that the sense of experiencing a rest deficit is widely shared. Two-thirds of the people who chose to fill in the survey told us they would like more rest. When we asked what rest meant to them, they often used words such as restorative, sublime or precious, but they also used words like guilty and irritating.</p> <p>If a lack of rest is a shared problem, is there a common solution? Can we learn from each other how to rest more and rest better?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s only by exerting your body that you can rest your mind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To make one<em><strong> </strong></em>thing clear, the rest I\u2019m referring to is not sleep. I\u2019m talking about any time while you are awake that feels restful. This could mean lying on the sofa staring into space, but it could mean something more active. The most popular restful activity in our survey was reading. Other people chose activities that might not be seen by some as restful at all. In the Rest Test survey, 38% of the respondents said they found walking restful, another 8% listed running. Sometimes it\u2019s only by exerting your body that you can rest your mind. People who do more exercise believe they get more rest, and in fact they do \u2013 they reported more hours of rest in the past 24 hours than people who exercised less. The point is that a restful activity doesn\u2019t have to involve lazing around; it can involve intense exercise, but crucially it must help to relax, refresh and restore you.</p> <p>In the early part of this year, I was singularly failing to heed what was emerging from the Rest Test research. Having missed the deadline for handing in my book, and with so much other work on, I only had one weekend off between New Year and Easter. I had little or no time to rest during that hectic period. But I was spending a lot of time thinking about rest and since then I have been putting these ideas into practice.</p> <p>It was clear that I had to find things that were restful to me personally. I am more of an active than an inactive rester. I\u2019ve never been one for holidays that involve more than one day lying on the beach or lazing by the pool. I soon get fidgety and want to do some sightseeing. My partner and I have started going on walking holidays. The days involve plenty of physical exertion, but they also relax my mind \u2013 and ultimately my body \u2013 wonderfully. I end each day tired but strangely refreshed.</p> <p>At home, my choice is gardening. It does, of course, require effort both physical and sometimes mental (for instance, how on earth am I going to beat those slugs that have ruined my kale crop yet again?).</p> <p>But for all the exertion, I find being in the garden instantly restful. Within moments of going into my tiny, standing-room-for-one-person-only greenhouse, I feel better. Almost as soon as I am digging in my raised beds, or planting out in my small front garden, I am relaxed and happy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve reframed my resting time outs as a way of protecting my mental health</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So now I prescribe myself at least 15 minutes of gardening every day, even on one of my working-from-home days. In the past I would have felt guilty about being away from my desk, but now I\u2019ve reframed the time out as a way of protecting my mental health and enhancing my wellbeing. Although I have slightly less time to work, I return to my desk feeling calmer and I end up being more productive.</p> <p>In fact, I probably should make myself take longer breaks, though it\u2019s hard to prescribe the exact amount of rest each of us should have. In the Rest Test, wellbeing levels were highest in those who had rested for between five and six hours the previous day, with levels dipping again if people rested for more than that time. To me, five hours of rest seems like a lot.</p> <p>Yet it might depend on how I am defining different activities. I spend quite a lot of time waiting for and travelling by bus, train or tube. Now I try to view this time not as wasted and stressful, but as an opportunity to rest. Similarly, when I get into the long queue at the sorting office, having found yet another Sorry We Missed You card on the doormat, I now reframe that as an opportunity to take a 10-minute break during which no one can demand anything of me and I\u2019m free to let my mind wander. If all this time is counted, along with my obvious resting periods, such as watching TV (a favourite of mine) or having a hot bath, then I\u2019m getting closer to the optimal time.</p> <p>I\u2019m still busy, of course, and probably always will be, but I\u2019ve learned to take rest more seriously, to view it not as a thing to do when everything else is done, but as an essential part of life.</p> <p><em>The Art of Rest by Claudia Hammond is published at \u00a316.99 by Canongate.

When I told friends that after writing books covering emotions, time perception and the psychology of money I had started writing one on rest, their first reaction was usually, \u201cBut you\u2019re always working. You never rest!\u201d More generally, if someone asks me how things are going, my stock answer is, \u201cFine, busy, too busy really.\u201d But while this claim feels true of my life, how much is it also a claim to status? If you say you are busy, then it implies you\u2019re important, you\u2019re in demand. As the time-use researcher Jonathan Gershuny puts it, busyness has become \u201ca badge of honour\u201d. In contrast to the 19th century, when the upper classes were happy to flaunt their idleness, in the 21st century it is work and not leisure that gives us social status.

Oh Powercube! How could you. Anyway, Duncan Ferguson takes temporary control of the Toffees today, as Everton begin their desperate search for a result that would take this grand old institution, last relegated in 1951, out of the drop zone.</p> <p><strong>They\u2019ll not be particularly pleased to welcome Chelsea this lunchtime, as the recent head-to-heads aren\u2019t great.</strong> True, they did win this fixture 2-0 towards the end of last season, Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson scoring the goals. But that was against a Chelsea side in a hot funk during the dying days of the brief Maurizio Sarri regime. Before that, there were a couple of goalless draws. And before those, Chelsea won four in a row to the aggregate score of 12-1.</p> <p><strong>History isn\u2019t Everton\u2019s friend, and neither is the current form book. </strong>Everton have lost their last three matches, slightly unfortunately against Leicester but miserably against Norwich and Liverpool. They\u2019ve only won two of their last six league games at Goodison. Chelsea by contrast have won five of their six away fixtures this season, only slipping up against the champions Manchester City, which is hardly a stick to beat someone with. It all suggests this should be Chelsea\u2019s day.</p> <p><strong>But football is football, and there\u2019s always hope. </strong>Frank\u2019s Freewheeling Fledglings aren\u2019t the finished product yet, as their recent loss at home to West Ham demonstrates. Everton meanwhile should take a little succour from the fight they showed at the King Power and Anfield, though much good it did them. And nobody in blue will want to disappoint Big Dunc, will they. Imagine going back into that dressing room after a comprehensive loss. Imagine the silence, punctuated only by his exhaling slowly through his nose. It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about, does it.</p> <p><strong>So can Everton haul themselves out of the relegation places?</strong> Or will Chelsea put on another roadshow? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Andy Hunter was our man at the Goodison party. Here\u2019s his report. Enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. An unhappy Frank Lampard contemplates a third defeat in four matches. \u201cWe\u2019ve given them three goals. When you give Everton a goal to hang onto, you give yourself a problem. The second and third goals were really poor. We have to do more than we did. Sometimes we matched them in workrate and intensity, but sometimes no. It\u2019s going to be tough to come to Goodison and win like that. We can\u2019t defend like that. If there\u2019s ever a game that shows in one little package how far we still need to go, it\u2019s that one.\u201d Big Dunc, thrilled beyond words, speaks to BT Sport, and despite much prompting, declines the opportunity to put himself forward for the manager\u2019s job on a full-time basis. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything like it in my life, the atmosphere was fantastic. We knew we had to sit tight and keep our shape, and play on the break. I thought our players were absolutely fantastic. What a fantastic result, eh? We really like Dominic Calvert-Lewin here, he\u2019s always a threat. Richarlison as well. What a shift they put in. We\u2019ll savour the moment, it\u2019s three fantastic points. God almighty, I was kissing everybody! I\u2019m here for Everton, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there looking for the right candidate, the best out there.\u201d Outro music. \u201cVAR is not my favourite thing either,\u201d begins Peter Oh. \u201cHere are a couple of additional lyrics I humbly submit for Mac Millings\u2019 consideration: Pause on the pitch while the clock keeps on ticking Wait while the backroom refs do their mouse-clicking Armpits, appendages, lines on the screen These are among my least favourite things Chelsea dominated possession, but mistakes at the back were their undoing. Everton held firm under pressure, and took the chances that were gifted to them. A fighting performance, a deserved victory, and one that\u2019s being celebrated to the Goodison rafters. Everton are up to 14th, at least for a couple of hours. Chelsea are stuck in fourth. Duncan Ferguson raises both arms in victory, and bumps fists with several delirious punters, before disappearing down the tunnel with a wide grin playing across his face. \u201cDunc\u2019s come in, he knows this club, it\u2019s in his heart,\u201d says Theo Walcott. \u201cThe fans were fantastic. And this man here [two-goal hero Dominic Calvert-Lewin] was fantastic!\u201d Calvert-Lewin adds: \u201cDunc has stuck by me, I\u2019m happy to score the two goals, that was my way of trying to repay him.\u201d And that\u2019s it! Goodison roars with joy and relief as Everton pick up a crucial three points! They\u2019re out of the relegation zone. 90 min +6: Pulisic\u2019s foul throw puts the tin lid on it for Chelsea. 90 min +5: Kovacic and Batshuayi combine cutely down the right, but just as it looks as though Everton are opened up, the doors slam shut. A goal then would have made for an interesting final 90 seconds or so. 90 min +3: Kovacic, who has been Chelsea\u2019s best player today, shins the ball out of play under no pressure whatsoever. It\u2019s been that sort of day for the visitors, basic mistakes obliterating quality. 90 min +2: Hudson-Odio crosses from the right. Batshuayi can\u2019t take the ball down from the sky. Pulisic snatches at a shot from the edge of the box. Chelsea don\u2019t appear to have a dramatic comeback in them. 90 min: There have been plenty of stoppages in this second half, so there will be six added minutes. 89 min: Kovacic crosses deep from the right. Pulisic, coming in from the left, slaps a header straight at Pickford. He should have made the keeper work harder. 87 min: Kepa was shaking his head in impotent anger after the third goal. He\u2019s not happy with his team-mates. He\u2019s got some nerve, given the hospital pass he gave Zouma, and the fact he was nutmegged by Calvert-Lewin. 86 min: Walcott is forced to go off, having tweaked something while assisting in the third goal. He\u2019s replaced by Bernard. 85 min: Big Dunc hoisted another ballboy into the air while wheeling around in celebration. The feelgood factor has returned to Goodison Park! Another huge Chelsea cock-up at the back. Kepa plays a dismal pass towards Zouma. But not particularly near him. Walcott zips away with the ball down the right and feeds Calvert-Lewin, who shuttles the ball further infield for Davies. Davies can\u2019t quite get a shot away, but the ball breaks to Calvert-Lewin, who pokes home through the hapless Kepa\u2019s legs. 82 min: And there\u2019s more waiting around, as Digne finally succumbs to that groin strain. He limps off, and the old warhorse Leighton Baines comes on. Finally the corner\u2019s taken ... and it really wasn\u2019t worth waiting for. 81 min: But before the corner can be taken, Batshuayi replaces James. 80 min: Azpilicueta scampers into space down the left, found by a lovely Kovacic dink. He pulls back to Mount, whose snapshot is blocked by Holgate. Azpilicueta latches onto the rebound and sends a riser straight at Pickford from a tight angle. Pickford tips over. 78 min: Christensen is afforded way too much time to shoot from 25 yards. He flashes a decent effort just wide of the bottom left, though Pickford had it covered. Goodison is a collective bag of nerves right now. Everton are so close to a precious three-point haul that would spring them clear of the relegation places. 77 min: Digne whips in a cross from the left. Zouma clears. Calvert-Lewin has another go from the same flank. Too deep, and Walcott can\u2019t recycle possession out on the other flank. 75 min: Calvert-Lewin attempts to beat Kepa from the halfway line. Full marks for ambition, if nothing else. Meanwhile it looks as though Digne has run off his groin issue, while Abraham is up and about again too. 74 min: Now Abraham is in the wars, having taken a whack while challenging Pickford and Keane for a long ball. He rolls off the pitch, clutching his back. The Chelsea doctors run onto the pitch to get to their man, attracting the ire of the Goodison faithful. Gotta love the festive panto. 73 min: Digne looks to have picked up a strain while setting up that chance. He limps off holding his groin. But he limps back on, determined to run it off. 72 min: Davies nearly makes an instant impact, but can\u2019t quite get on the end of a Digne left-wing cross. He launches into a diving header, but doesn\u2019t connect at all. 71 min: Chelsea make their first change, too. Callum Hudson-Odoi comes on for Willian. 70 min: Pulisic is stripped of possession by Sidibe, who then executes a perfect triple salchow to purchase a cheap free-kick. The board goes up. A row of 6.0s? Nope, it\u2019s a substitution. Richarlison off, Tom Davies on. 68 min: Zouma flicks Richarlison to the ground, and it\u2019s a free kick out on the right. Schneiderlin lumps it in. Keane wins a header but sends the ball nowhere in particular. Chelsea clear their lines. 66 min: Mount, Willian and Abraham link up on the edge of the Everton box, but can\u2019t quite get a shot away. Chelsea are knocking at the door. 64 min: Nearly a picture-book goal. Kovacic floats a pass down the inside-left channel. Kante, breaking into the box, cushions it down for Mount, who attempts to send a curler from the left of the D into the top right. He gets the swerve all wrong, sending it bending wide right. A shame, because that would have been a very pretty goal. 63 min: Kovacic is permitted to dance his way down the inside-right channel. As he reaches the edge of the box, he launches a shot towards the top right. It\u2019s wide and high, but not by great margins. Pickford probably had it covered, mind you. 62 min: Chelsea waste the free kick. Walcott zips off up the other end, but disappears down a cul-de-sac. It\u2019s a very open end-to-end match now. Great fun. 61 min: Mount and Pulisic combine well down the left and nearly open Everton up. Keane stands firm. Chelsea switch wings, and Iwobi barges James to the ground. Clumsy and unnecessary. This is a free kick in a very dangerous position. 59 min: Walcott scampers into acres of space down the right. He really should feed Richarlison on the penalty spot, but takes the shot on himself. Kepa refuses to be beaten at his near post, and parries well. More poor decision-making from Walcott. 58 min: Willian grafts down the right and earns a corner off Digne. He takes it himself. Zouma wins a header but can\u2019t guide it towards the goal. Eventually the flag goes up for offside. A real sense that the scoring is far from over, though. 56 min: Sidibe steals the ball from Kovacic, out on the Everton right, and makes his way into the box. He feeds Calvert-Lewin, who can\u2019t sort his feet out for a shot. The ball breaks to Schneiderlin, who tries a curler towards the top left. Miles off target. 54 min: Both of those goals were pored over by VAR, for absolutely no reason whatsoever. There goes the atmosphere, the thrill of celebrating a goal. It\u2019s not too late to unplug the box and take it back to the shop, you know. We can forget it ever happened. It was nearly 3-0; it\u2019s now 2-1! Azpilicueta crosses from the left. Digne half clears. Kovacic, to the left of the D, meets the clearance with the inside of his right boot, steering a stunning first-time shot into the bottom left. What a strike! 51 min: Richarlison shoots from a tight angle on the left. Kepa does very well to keep hold of the shot. 50 min: Fine opportunism from Calvert-Lewin there. Utterly dreadful defending by Zouma. On the touchline, Big Dunc picks up the nearest ballboy and hugs the little lad with unbridled glee! Everyone loves ballboys these days, Jose Mourinho\u2019s really started something. A dreadful shank on the edge of the Chelsea box by Zouma. The ball flies straight up in the air. Neither Zouma nor Christensen can deal with it when it falls. Calvert-Lewin nips in between them, turns and slips the ball past Kepa and into the bottom left! 47 min: Sigurdsson sends the ball into the Chelsea box. Calvert- Lawton Lewin rises highest and powers a header over the crossbar. 46 min: Calvert-Lewin is clattered from behind by Zouma, as the two challenge for a high ball, and this is a free kick out on the right, a chance to load the box. Everton get the second half underway. No half-time changes by either side. \u201cHas Tommy Lawton been reincarnated as a feisty Brazilian?\u201d wonders Roy Allen. \u201cRicharlison\u2019s recent headers suggest it\u2019s possible. Maybe.\u201d Half-time entertainment. Other bluenoses are available. Nothing comes of the corner, and there\u2019s that whistle. Chelsea have dominated possession, but Everton have the lead, and Big Dunc walks off down the tunnel looking fairly content. Frank Lampard not so much. 45 min +1: In the first of two additional minutes, Walcott wins Everton\u2019s first corner of the afternoon, out on the right. They take their sweet time over it. Having been under the cosh during the last ten minutes or so, they\u2019ll be wanting to hear the half-time whistle. 45 min: Digne\u2019s undercoooked backpass nearly puts Everton in a world of pain, but Pickford races from his area to blooter clear with Abraham lurking. 43 min: Mount takes the resulting free kick and hoicks the ball into a loaded box from the left. Schneiderlin does well to clear. Chelsea come straight back at Everton, Abraham and Willian combining down the inside-left channel and nearly working a shooting chance. But Everton swarm the pair and the ball clanks out for a goal kick. 42 min: Chelsea press Everton back. Some pretty passing. The hosts get frustrated, and Richarlison snaps into a challenge, sliding into the back of Kovacic. He goes in the book. 40 min: Pulisic reaches the byline on the left, and looks for Willian, six yards out. Sidibe does extremely well to ensure Willian isn\u2019t teed up for a tap-in. Everton clear their lines. 39 min: Walcott considers volleying a ball that\u2019s dropping inside the Chelsea box. He changes his mind last minute, tries to round Azpilicueta, and runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. Not a masterclass in decision-making. 37 min: Pulisic feeds Mount down the left. Mount can\u2019t get a proper shot away, Holgate sliding in to block. It\u2019s good end-to-end fun, this. 36 min: A loose ball ricochets into Walcott\u2019s path, down the inside-right channel. Walcott shoots, but his effort is easily blocked by Azpilicueta. A poor effort. 35 min: Pulisic swings a ball into the Everton area from the left. Abraham can\u2019t get enough purchase on his header, and Pickford plucks from the sky. He then creams a clearance down the left, nearly releasing Iwobi into acres of space. It doesn\u2019t quite come off, but full marks for quick thinking. 34 min: Boos ring around Goodison as former favourite Ross Barkley warms up on the touchline. It is panto season, after all. 33 min: Chelsea should be level. Mount drops a shoulder to make a bit of space on the left. He curls a low ball through the six-yard box. Abraham slides in late, and can\u2019t get a toe on the ball to poke home. 32 min: More space for Willian down the right. He cuts the ball back for Abraham, but the pass is behind his team-mate and Everton can clear. Just as well, really, because the move started from a free kick awarded when Mount tripped over his own feet. Everton would have been within their rights to have a good old moan. But all\u2019s fine. 30 min: Willian dribbles powerfully out of the Chelsea box, threatening to launch a counter. Digne hauls him down cynically, and he\u2019s in the book. He can have no complaints. 28 min: A lull. It\u2019s been a breezy match so far, though. 26 min: The corner. Kovacic loops the ball into the box from the left. James attempts a fancy backheel, but the ball balloons high and wide right. Chelsea come again immediately, Willian diddling Digne down the right and whipping a low cross towards Abraham at the near post. The striker can only feather the ball across the face of goal, and Everton breathe again. 25 min: Pulisic drives down the left and wins a corner off Keane. Before the set piece can be taken, Richarlison goes down, rubbing that sore shin. He grimaces hard. But the physio gives the bench the thumbs up, so looks like the goalscorer will be fine to continue. 23 min: Zouma and Kovacic faff around at the back, nearly letting Richarlison in on goal. They just about get away with it. Everton\u2019s pressing has been very effective so far. 21 min: Mount threatens to break into the Everton box on the right. Richarlison stops his gallop with a firm challenge, but hurts himself in doing so. He\u2019s up and about soon enough, but that looked a painful whack on the shin. \u201cBecause of (and despite) Everton\u2019s scattergun supermarket-sweep player purchase policy, they do have some fine footballers,\u201d suggests Matt Dony. \u201cClearly, they have been underperforming. I would suggest that a pretty sure fire way to guarantee players put in more effort is to stick Big Dunc in charge. I know I\u2019d certainly try hard to keep on his good side.\u201d 19 min: Keane makes a royal hash of a clearance, gifting possession to Abraham, who exchanges passes with Willian. Chelsea should score, they\u2019ve got a two on one, but Abraham and Willian overthink it, make way too many passes, and the chance to get a shot away is gone. A mess all round. 17 min: Calvert-Lewin stands on Mount\u2019s foot. He\u2019s fortunate to escape a booking, though in fairness there aren\u2019t too many Chelsea complaints. 16 min: Everton open Chelsea up down the right again, Walcott slipping a pass down the channel for Calvert-Lewin. Simple as that. The striker strides into the box and smashes a shot straight at Kepa. A real chance to double Everton\u2019s lead spurned. 14 min: Mount earns Chelsea\u2019s first corner of the afternoon, off Iwobi down the right. Willian takes. It\u2019s easily cleared by Calvert-Lewin. Pickford hasn\u2019t had a thing to do yet. 13 min: Abraham flips a cute reverse pass down the inside left for Mount, who topples over. Mount wants a penalty, but the clip from Sidibe was minimal and outside the box anyway. The ref\u2019s not interested. 11 min: Azpilicueta clips Walcott out on the Everton right. The hosts load the box. Schneiderlin hoicks it into the mixer. Chelsea struggle to clear as the ball pings this way and that. Walcott takes up possession out on the right, and curls it low and hard towards the far post. Richarlison slides in, but can\u2019t connect. Goal kick, but this is impressive stuff from Everton. 9 min: Chelsea suddenly don\u2019t look quite so confident. Everton are pressing them hard, and the home fans are enjoying themselves greatly. \u201cPoor stuff from Big Dunc,\u201d tut-tuts Gary Naylor. \u201cHe really should have had the shirt off and whirling around his head.\u201d 7 min: What a strange start to the match. Chelsea had looked assured and confident, Everton nervous and shaky. But that was a lovely flowing move upfield to shock Chelsea, Sigurdsson and Calvert-Lewin also involved. Goodison fair erupted when Richarlison scored. Big Dunc would have been proud to score that header himself. So having said that, the hosts take an early lead! Richarlison slips a pass wide right for Sidibe, who curls a glorious cross back into the middle. Richarlison had kept going, rises high, and plants a header to the left of Kepa and into the net! Duncan Ferguson races down the touchline with great feeling. What a start to the big man\u2019s caretaker reign! 4 min: Space for Willian down the right. He tees up James, who whips to the far post, hoping to find the head of Abraham. Not quite; the ball flies out for another goal kick. But this is a lively start by Chelsea. 2 min: Christensen sprays a lovely pass wide left for Azpilicueta. Where\u2019s Sidibe? Who knows. After his first-half horror show at Anfield, that\u2019s a worrying early sign. Fortunately for Everton, the Chelsea captain rolls a poor pass, intended for Pulisic, out of play for a goal kick. It\u2019s fourth versus 18th, and Chelsea get the ball rolling. A bit of early to and fro in the middle of the park. The teams are out! The Theme from Z-Cars blares out of the Goodison speakers, and there\u2019s a cracking atmosphere at the old place. \u201cWhen Evertonians have their blood up, there\u2019s no better place to play football,\u201d Duncan Ferguson says in his programme notes. A huge reception for the big man as he arrives fashionably late. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. On the subject of Christmas ... our old pal Mac Millings really has excelled himself here. You know Basham and Ansu And Draxler, Eriksen Coman and Kewell Maradona, Lee Dixon But Stuart McCall the most famous reindeer Fitz Hall? Mou-dolph and Harry Kanedeer Had a Dele Alli, Rose Kant\u00e9, Firmino, San\u00e9 Hughes, Wijnaldum, Salah (Mo) Oliver Kahn, Der Kaiser Eustace, Pfaff and Collins (James) They never let poor Mou-dolph Jonny, Nani, David James Juanfran, Oggy, Tiss, Nasri Sancho, Ke\u00efta, Shay Mou-dolph, Withe, Sarr, Jones, Mark Bright Wanchope, Divock, Leighton, Wright Stam, Dahlberg, Reina, Lovren Juande Ramos, Sammy Lee Mou-dolph and Harry Kanedeer Dunga, Downing, Summerbee! I know, I know, we shouldn\u2019t encourage him. Season of goodwill, though, innit. And now here\u2019s Frank. \u201cIt\u2019s a potentially more dangerous game for us. Whenever there\u2019s a change there is often a bounce back. Factor in a club legend like Duncan Ferguson, and the way he played the game, I expect them to have a real go. It could be a tough match for us. We need to counter that with how we play, our aggression. We were really good against Villa, so I\u2019ve given the players another chance to go, and expect more of the same from us.\u201d A brief word with Big Dunc. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be positive. Make sure everyone\u2019s got a smile on their face. We\u2019ve picked them up.\u201d He\u2019s suited and booted, so Paul Scholes will be happy. Blue Xmas. A couple of reminders that Christmas is coming. Here\u2019s a chap in a bonny sweater ... ... and then there\u2019s this page-seven fella. Everton will wear their famous blue shirts ... ... forcing Chelsea into second-choice black. Duncan Ferguson makes two changes to the Everton team battered at Anfield on Wednesday night. Theo Walcott and Morgan Schneiderlin come in for the injured Yerry Mina and the stood-down Tom Davies. Chelsea are very much in if-it-ain\u2019t-broke territory. Having beaten Aston Villa midweek, Frank Lampard names the same starting XI. Ross Barkley is back on the bench, though, just in time to revisit his alma mater. Everton: Pickford, Sidibe, Holgate, Keane, Digne, Walcott, Schneiderlin, Sigurdsson, Iwobi, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Tosun, Bernard, Stekelenburg, Davies, Kean, Niasse. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, James, Christensen, Zouma, Azpilicueta, Kante, Kovacic, Willian, Mount, Pulisic, Abraham. Subs: Jorginho, Barkley, Caballero, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi, Tomori, Emerson Palmieri. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire). The post-Marco Silva era begins here. This week, Everton became the second big club in 12 months, after Manchester United, to jib off their manager in the immediate wake of Xherdan Shaqiri running rings around them. Oh Powercube! How could you. Anyway, Duncan Ferguson takes temporary control of the Toffees today, as Everton begin their desperate search for a result that would take this grand old institution, last relegated in 1951, out of the drop zone. They\u2019ll not be particularly pleased to welcome Chelsea this lunchtime, as the recent head-to-heads aren\u2019t great. True, they did win this fixture 2-0 towards the end of last season, Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson scoring the goals. But that was against a Chelsea side in a hot funk during the dying days of the brief Maurizio Sarri regime. Before that, there were a couple of goalless draws. And before those, Chelsea won four in a row to the aggregate score of 12-1. History isn\u2019t Everton\u2019s friend, and neither is the current form book. Everton have lost their last three matches, slightly unfortunately against Leicester but miserably against Norwich and Liverpool. They\u2019ve only won two of their last six league games at Goodison. Chelsea by contrast have won five of their six away fixtures this season, only slipping up against the champions Manchester City, which is hardly a stick to beat someone with. It all suggests this should be Chelsea\u2019s day. But football is football, and there\u2019s always hope. Frank\u2019s Freewheeling Fledglings aren\u2019t the finished product yet, as their recent loss at home to West Ham demonstrates. Everton meanwhile should take a little succour from the fight they showed at the King Power and Anfield, though much good it did them. And nobody in blue will want to disappoint Big Dunc, will they. Imagine going back into that dressing room after a comprehensive loss. Imagine the silence, punctuated only by his exhaling slowly through his nose. It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about, does it. So can Everton haul themselves out of the relegation places? Or will Chelsea put on another roadshow? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

When she last visited several years ago, it was \u201cnot in a great state of repair I\u2019m concerned about who has custody of these graves\u201d. After stumbling across references to the Jewish flight to the Caribbean, Newman spent two decades scouring archives and gathering testimonies and memoirs for her book. \u201cI come from a refugee family on my father\u2019s side, so I grew up with stories of the persecution that my grandparents faced,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/22/michael-lewis-trump-gambling-america\" title=\"\">Michael Lewis</a> has made his brilliant journalistic career by finding engaging human stories to illuminate the data-driven, risk-avoiding complexities of our world. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/27/big-short-inside-doomsday-machine\" title=\"\">The Big Short</a></em> Lewis brought to life the extraordinary black comedy of those who had made fortunes betting on the global financial crash. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jul/29/summer-readings-moneyball-michael-lewis\" title=\"\">Moneyball</a></em> examined the characters behind the new science of success in sports. His most recent book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=fifth+risk\" title=\"\">The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy</a></em>, applies his insider\u2019s eye to unsung heroes of government administration, in light of the reckless dismantling of the US civil service under Trump. Lewis defines the fifth risk to civilisation \u2013 alongside more visible contenders like climate crisis and nuclear conflict \u2013 as a loss of faith in the mission of effective governance, \u201cwhat you never learn that might have saved you\u201d.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>afterword to your new book, written after Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2019\" title=\"\">shutdown of government</a> in January 2019</strong><strong>, describes the life of Arthur A</strong><strong> Allen</strong><strong>, whose innovations in </strong><strong>air-</strong><strong>sea </strong><strong>rescue for the US Coastguard <a href=\"https://www.international-maritime-rescue.org/news/arthur-allen-us-coast-guard\" title=\"\">saved countless lives</a> in the course of his long career. He was among tens of thousands of civil servants considered expendable by Trump\u2019s regime. Why do you think stories like his have been so rarely heard?</strong><br>There is less diversity in the news. It has gotten harder and harder to tell a small story that is actually a big story. If you don\u2019t start with a celebrity, it is harder to persuade people to take an interest in it. It is almost the reverse of what has happened in entertainment. Netflix has worked out how to make these very niche dramas and comedies and make them universal. News is much less good at it.</p> <p><strong>In both our countries we are being sold the line by populists that the civil service, public service in general, is wasteful and bureaucratic; dull. That was clearly not your experience?</strong><br>I actually purposefully chose the departments I thought would be least interesting: energy and agriculture and commerce. I avoided defence and treasury and state. I wanted to show you could drop people into any part of American government and find hundreds of stories that are of potentially earth-shattering importance. I wanted the reader to have the sense: \u201cMy God, even here there are things I need to know and worry about.\u201d</p> <p><strong>When you have done readings from the book, how have audiences reacted? </strong><br>I never found anyone who said: \u201cYou are exaggerating the importance of these people.\u201d The closest I got to the Trump administration was to talk to Steve Bannon about it. Bannon had this election line: \u201cWe are going to tear down and destroy the administrative state.\u201d I asked him what on earth he meant by that. What would it mean to destroy the Department of Agriculture, say? He didn\u2019t really even try to answer. What we are witnessing is a decline in interest in how you fix other people\u2019s problems.</p> <p><strong>Part of your story examines the consequences of the ideological cull of climate scientists from government. You have lived in close proximity to wildfires in California, there have been unprecedented hurricanes. Do you think there will come a point when people demand leaders who understand the importance of scientific knowledge</strong><strong>?</strong><br>You would think so. It hasn\u2019t happened yet. For people to suddenly start to value what good government does, I think there will have to be something that threatens a lot of people at once. The problem with a wildfire in California, or a hurricane in Florida, is that for most people it is happening to someone else. I think a pandemic might do it, something that could affect millions of people indiscriminately and from which you could not insulate yourself even if you were rich. I think that might do it.</p> <p><strong>That is quite an apocalyptic thought. You have always seemed by nature an optimist, are you feeling more nihilistic about what you call the drift of things?</strong><br>I\u2019m a little more wary than I have been. What we are seeing is an attack on the idea of progress and the idea of science. In the Trump administration there seems to be a total lack of respect for expertise. It sounds like you have something of the same with Boris Johnson. For this kind of attack to work you need to have characters who don\u2019t care at all about consequences.</p> <p><strong>Where do you think that disregard comes from?</strong><br>I think there is a deeply corrupt streak in a lot of it. If you want your polluting to succeed then you remove from power anyone who cares about pollution. It is a celebration of ignorance for the purpose of profit. Part of it is status-based, too: people don\u2019t like feeling stupid. They don\u2019t want to be told what to do by people with fancy educations. You can see that even within Trump\u2019s family. Donald Jnr and Eric have probably been made to feel stupid by their peers. Now they can say: \u201cIf you are so smart, why aren\u2019t you rich and powerful like me?\u201d</p> <p><strong>You still seem to see this as a</strong><strong> historical blip, though. Could you actually be writing the Decline and Fall of the American Empire?</strong><br>It could be that. But my gut says don\u2019t bet against the country.

      "bodyText": "Michael Lewis has made his brilliant journalistic career by finding engaging human stories to illuminate the data-driven, risk-avoiding complexities of our world. In The Big Short Lewis brought to life the extraordinary black comedy of those who had made fortunes betting on the global financial crash. Moneyball examined the characters behind the new science of success in sports. His most recent book, The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy, applies his insider\u2019s eye to unsung heroes of government administration, in light of the reckless dismantling of the US civil service under Trump. Lewis defines the fifth risk to civilisation \u2013 alongside more visible contenders like climate crisis and nuclear conflict \u2013 as a loss of faith in the mission of effective governance, \u201cwhat you never learn that might have saved you\u201d. The afterword to your new book, written after Trump\u2019s shutdown of government in January 2019, describes the life of Arthur A Allen, whose innovations in air-sea rescue for the US Coastguard saved countless lives in the course of his long career. He was among tens of thousands of civil servants considered expendable by Trump\u2019s regime. Why do you think stories like his have been so rarely heard? There is less diversity in the news. It has gotten harder and harder to tell a small story that is actually a big story. If you don\u2019t start with a celebrity, it is harder to persuade people to take an interest in it. It is almost the reverse of what has happened in entertainment. Netflix has worked out how to make these very niche dramas and comedies and make them universal. News is much less good at it. In both our countries we are being sold the line by populists that the civil service, public service in general, is wasteful and bureaucratic; dull. That was clearly not your experience? I actually purposefully chose the departments I thought would be least interesting: energy and agriculture and commerce. I avoided defence and treasury and state. I wanted to show you could drop people into any part of American government and find hundreds of stories that are of potentially earth-shattering importance. I wanted the reader to have the sense: \u201cMy God, even here there are things I need to know and worry about.\u201d When you have done readings from the book, how have audiences reacted? I never found anyone who said: \u201cYou are exaggerating the importance of these people.\u201d The closest I got to the Trump administration was to talk to Steve Bannon about it. Bannon had this election line: \u201cWe are going to tear down and destroy the administrative state.\u201d I asked him what on earth he meant by that. What would it mean to destroy the Department of Agriculture, say? He didn\u2019t really even try to answer. What we are witnessing is a decline in interest in how you fix other people\u2019s problems. Part of your story examines the consequences of the ideological cull of climate scientists from government. You have lived in close proximity to wildfires in California, there have been unprecedented hurricanes. Do you think there will come a point when people demand leaders who understand the importance of scientific knowledge? You would think so. It hasn\u2019t happened yet. For people to suddenly start to value what good government does, I think there will have to be something that threatens a lot of people at once. The problem with a wildfire in California, or a hurricane in Florida, is that for most people it is happening to someone else. I think a pandemic might do it, something that could affect millions of people indiscriminately and from which you could not insulate yourself even if you were rich. I think that might do it. That is quite an apocalyptic thought. You have always seemed by nature an optimist, are you feeling more nihilistic about what you call the drift of things? I\u2019m a little more wary than I have been. What we are seeing is an attack on the idea of progress and the idea of science. In the Trump administration there seems to be a total lack of respect for expertise. It sounds like you have something of the same with Boris Johnson. For this kind of attack to work you need to have characters who don\u2019t care at all about consequences. Where do you think that disregard comes from? I think there is a deeply corrupt streak in a lot of it. If you want your polluting to succeed then you remove from power anyone who cares about pollution. It is a celebration of ignorance for the purpose of profit. Part of it is status-based, too: people don\u2019t like feeling stupid. They don\u2019t want to be told what to do by people with fancy educations. You can see that even within Trump\u2019s family. Donald Jnr and Eric have probably been made to feel stupid by their peers. Now they can say: \u201cIf you are so smart, why aren\u2019t you rich and powerful like me?\u201d You still seem to see this as a historical blip, though. Could you actually be writing the Decline and Fall of the American Empire? It could be that. But my gut says don\u2019t bet against the country. It has this incredible capacity for self-reinvention. If it was Britain and this was happening I would say yes, it might be a one-way ticket to decline. But in the States I think something will come along that will finally induce the requisite state of terror \u2013 and it will regenerate the place.

      "body": "<p>Bedroom-pop star Clairo is a study in shy charm. On the second of two gigs in London \u2013 this extra night was added to her UK tour after the first date sold out \u2013 the 21-year-old American Claire Cottrill occasionally clasps the hands of the adoring front row. Just as often, she\u2019ll back away from her microphone to lurk in shadow and play guitar. There isn\u2019t even a spotlight to run from: everything is lit only in fuzzy pink or peachy gold. If she says anything meaningful between songs, only the first few rows can hear it.</p> <p>Somewhere inside this diffident contemporary musician, however, is a core of steel and a level of outgoing ambition that allowed her to put songs up on the internet throughout her teenage years. Drill down into Clairo\u2019s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ccottrill\" title=\"\">SoundCloud</a> and among her embryonic originals, you can find covers of everything from the super-indie Beat Happening to contemporary bard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/21/sandy-alex-g-rocket-review\" title=\"\">(Sandy) Alex G</a>, via the in-your-face digitals of PC Music\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/01/hannah-diamond-reflections-review\" title=\"\">Hannah Diamond</a>. Last year she toured arenas with Dua Lipa and this summer she guested with Khalid. Next year she supports Tame Impala in the US. For now, she is the unstarry star of her own show, with more than 338.6m combined global streams (as of last August)\u201d.</p> <p>Her ambition also comes with deep reserves of resilience. The title of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/04/clairo-immuity-review-claire-cottrill-winning-debut\" title=\"\">Immunity</a></em>, Clairo\u2019s 2019 debut album \u2013 from which much of tonight\u2019s set is drawn \u2013 glances sideways at her juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune condition). It also references the tougher carapace she has developed emotionally since she began growing up in public. An old soul trapped in a young body, her songs are often thoughtful confessionals, tackling the yearning, miscommunication and regret of teenage-to-young adult life. Coming to terms with her sexuality forms part of the mix, so do songs called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f43ODtOUmBw\" title=\"\">Flaming Hot Cheetos</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of the songs become indie rock by default, with Clairo drowned out by the excited chatter of the fans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No little scar tissue has also formed, too, as a result of the internet taking umbrage at Clairo\u2019s father\u2019s music industry connections. Clairo was labelled an \u201cindustry plant\u201d; her authenticity questioned. It\u2019s true those connections were helpful in Clairo securing a record deal with the independent <a href=\"https://www.faderlabel.com/clairo\" title=\"\">Fader</a> label. But even the most supportive parenting can hardly be responsible for the raw digital sharing that powered her initial rise \u2013 or her simpatico with her listeners, relating hard tonight to the emotions in one of her best songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HYJbe9Y18\" title=\"\">Bags</a>, in which she frets that her undeclared love, for a girl, might be unrequited.</p> <p>Every teenage bedroom is a haven, workspace and isolation unit. She spent even more time in hers (in small-town Massachusetts) than most, when her inflamed knees couldn\u2019t make it downstairs. At 16, her early musical efforts were first featured in the US teen magazine <em>Rookie</em>. In 2018, a video of Clairo miming badly to one of her songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mngtcfcaVrI\" title=\"\">Pretty Girl</a>, went viral. The song itself was catchy enough, but what really sold it was her goofing around on her webcam, trying on sunglasses and pulling faces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"776c5ec451a038144ea5e3e136cfa45c2ae3bad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/776c5ec451a038144ea5e3e136cfa45c2ae3bad0/0_486_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clairo at Electric Ballroom in Camden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clairo and an adoring front row.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She also undercut her own lyrics. \u201cI could be a pretty girl, I\u2019ll wear a skirt for you,\u201d she sang, while shaking her head, turning what sounded at first like a saccharine plea to be loved into something much more eye-rolling. Near the end of tonight\u2019s encore, Clairo performs the song while a projection of the video plays out on a white sheet at the back of the stage.</p> <p>Co-produced by former Vampire Weekend man Rostam Batmanglij, her <em>Immunity</em> album scaled up the work of this DIY pop phenomenon, walking a tightrope between maintaining Clairo\u2019s homespun, straight-to-webcam charisma and adding more generous production values.</p> <p>Her live show walks the same line, not always quite as successfully. Clairo\u2019s relatability remains key to this most 2019 of artists. Tonight, she wears a baggy jumper with her hair pulled back, some stray locks tipped in blue. Like many of her bedroom pop cohorts \u2013 British singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/27/rex-orange-county-pony-album-review-tara-joshi\" title=\"\">Rex Orange County</a> has also sold out sizable venues; another Brit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/07/one-to-watch-beabadoobee-bea-kristi-space-cadet\" title=\"\">Beabadoobee</a> is on several tipsheets for 2020 \u2013 her early songs remain dispatches from the frontline of adolescent intensity.</p> <p>These were made solo, with rudimentary technology and guitar techniques picked up off YouTube videos, but are delivered tonight by a super-competent band who can churn out funk and R&amp;B as well as the straight-ahead guitar songs. The drummer plays behind a screen \u2013 so as not to drown out Clairo, you assume.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"adc8daa38de8681952d7209626343cb0e0a12a59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adc8daa38de8681952d7209626343cb0e0a12a59/0_977_4912_6140/800.jpg\" alt=\"Clairo at London\u2019s Electric Ballroom.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Homespun charisma\u2019: Clairo at London\u2019s Electric Ballroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The visual effect, though, is disorienting. Candid DIY artists normally function as part of a tight-knit unit of like-minded souls, not at the front of a cadre of session musicians. As well as everything else, Clairo is a phenomenon who collapses the old space between amateur and pro, indie and mainstream, lo-fi and R&amp;B, making her fiercely contemporary \u2013 but also unclear in her presentation.</p> <p>The fresh, delicate production on <em>Immunity</em> does not survive the leap to the live setting. So a lot of these songs become common-or-garden indie rock by default, with Clairo drowned out by the excited chatter of fans. It means, too, that only the most forthcoming of Clairo\u2019s songs really punch their way out of the nice-enough thrum.</p> <p>It feels disloyal to Clairo\u2019s quiet, unshowy muse to say so, but a song such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AmOMH-pSAg\" title=\"\">Feel Something</a> is an undeniable banger, an ambivalent love song in which Clairo casually joins the mainstream on its own terms (sort of indie R&amp;B).</p> <p>With its uptick in BPMs and giddy keyboards, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9l8zCOwEII\" title=\"\">Sofia</a> \u2013 a love song to a girl, and one of Clairo\u2019s anthems \u2013 also kicks off much joy in the room tonight. The gig ends with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wUIexMVG9k&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nOJgaLceyL_La1wdUMUJL0QMRkp-vj_d0\" title=\"\">I Don\u2019t Think I Can Do This Again</a>, a tune she made with Guernsey producer Mura Masa. Her contemplation of an on-off relationship is soft focus, but totally conventional uplift comes from the shouted chorus and body-ready beats.</p> <p>The track that opens both the album and Clairo\u2019s set tonight, however, is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBjmnqewTeo\" title=\"\">Alewife</a> \u2013 the most hair-raising few minutes of her discography. The title names the town 30 minutes away where the young Claire could get the train into Boston. But the song really relives the night when, at just 13, she felt suicidal. She was saved by a friend who kept her talking until the police arrived. At their very best, Clairo\u2019s songs skewer a moment, or crystallise a mixture of emotions; they are quietly devastating.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bedroom-pop star Clairo is a study in shy charm. On the second of two gigs in London \u2013 this extra night was added to her UK tour after the first date sold out \u2013 the 21-year-old American Claire Cottrill occasionally clasps the hands of the adoring front row. Just as often, she\u2019ll back away from her microphone to lurk in shadow and play guitar. There isn\u2019t even a spotlight to run from: everything is lit only in fuzzy pink or peachy gold. If she says anything meaningful between songs, only the first few rows can hear it. Somewhere inside this diffident contemporary musician, however, is a core of steel and a level of outgoing ambition that allowed her to put songs up on the internet throughout her teenage years. Drill down into Clairo\u2019s SoundCloud and among her embryonic originals, you can find covers of everything from the super-indie Beat Happening to contemporary bard (Sandy) Alex G, via the in-your-face digitals of PC Music\u2019s Hannah Diamond. Last year she toured arenas with Dua Lipa and this summer she guested with Khalid. Next year she supports Tame Impala in the US. For now, she is the unstarry star of her own show, with more than 338.6m combined global streams (as of last August)\u201d. Her ambition also comes with deep reserves of resilience. The title of Immunity, Clairo\u2019s 2019 debut album \u2013 from which much of tonight\u2019s set is drawn \u2013 glances sideways at her juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune condition). It also references the tougher carapace she has developed emotionally since she began growing up in public. An old soul trapped in a young body, her songs are often thoughtful confessionals, tackling the yearning, miscommunication and regret of teenage-to-young adult life. Coming to terms with her sexuality forms part of the mix, so do songs called Flaming Hot Cheetos. No little scar tissue has also formed, too, as a result of the internet taking umbrage at Clairo\u2019s father\u2019s music industry connections. Clairo was labelled an \u201cindustry plant\u201d; her authenticity questioned. It\u2019s true those connections were helpful in Clairo securing a record deal with the independent Fader label. But even the most supportive parenting can hardly be responsible for the raw digital sharing that powered her initial rise \u2013 or her simpatico with her listeners, relating hard tonight to the emotions in one of her best songs, Bags, in which she frets that her undeclared love, for a girl, might be unrequited. Every teenage bedroom is a haven, workspace and isolation unit. She spent even more time in hers (in small-town Massachusetts) than most, when her inflamed knees couldn\u2019t make it downstairs. At 16, her early musical efforts were first featured in the US teen magazine Rookie. In 2018, a video of Clairo miming badly to one of her songs, Pretty Girl, went viral. The song itself was catchy enough, but what really sold it was her goofing around on her webcam, trying on sunglasses and pulling faces. She also undercut her own lyrics. \u201cI could be a pretty girl, I\u2019ll wear a skirt for you,\u201d she sang, while shaking her head, turning what sounded at first like a saccharine plea to be loved into something much more eye-rolling. Near the end of tonight\u2019s encore, Clairo performs the song while a projection of the video plays out on a white sheet at the back of the stage. Co-produced by former Vampire Weekend man Rostam Batmanglij, her Immunity album scaled up the work of this DIY pop phenomenon, walking a tightrope between maintaining Clairo\u2019s homespun, straight-to-webcam charisma and adding more generous production values. Her live show walks the same line, not always quite as successfully. Clairo\u2019s relatability remains key to this most 2019 of artists. Tonight, she wears a baggy jumper with her hair pulled back, some stray locks tipped in blue. Like many of her bedroom pop cohorts \u2013 British singer-songwriter Rex Orange County has also sold out sizable venues; another Brit, Beabadoobee is on several tipsheets for 2020 \u2013 her early songs remain dispatches from the frontline of adolescent intensity. These were made solo, with rudimentary technology and guitar techniques picked up off YouTube videos, but are delivered tonight by a super-competent band who can churn out funk and R&amp;B as well as the straight-ahead guitar songs. The drummer plays behind a screen \u2013 so as not to drown out Clairo, you assume. The visual effect, though, is disorienting. Candid DIY artists normally function as part of a tight-knit unit of like-minded souls, not at the front of a cadre of session musicians. As well as everything else, Clairo is a phenomenon who collapses the old space between amateur and pro, indie and mainstream, lo-fi and R&amp;B, making her fiercely contemporary \u2013 but also unclear in her presentation. The fresh, delicate production on Immunity does not survive the leap to the live setting. So a lot of these songs become common-or-garden indie rock by default, with Clairo drowned out by the excited chatter of fans. It means, too, that only the most forthcoming of Clairo\u2019s songs really punch their way out of the nice-enough thrum. It feels disloyal to Clairo\u2019s quiet, unshowy muse to say so, but a song such as Feel Something is an undeniable banger, an ambivalent love song in which Clairo casually joins the mainstream on its own terms (sort of indie R&amp;B). With its uptick in BPMs and giddy keyboards, Sofia \u2013 a love song to a girl, and one of Clairo\u2019s anthems \u2013 also kicks off much joy in the room tonight. The gig ends with I Don\u2019t Think I Can Do This Again, a tune she made with Guernsey producer Mura Masa. Her contemplation of an on-off relationship is soft focus, but totally conventional uplift comes from the shouted chorus and body-ready beats. The track that opens both the album and Clairo\u2019s set tonight, however, is Alewife \u2013 the most hair-raising few minutes of her discography. The title names the town 30 minutes away where the young Claire could get the train into Boston. But the song really relives the night when, at just 13, she felt suicidal. She was saved by a friend who kept her talking until the police arrived. At their very best, Clairo\u2019s songs skewer a moment, or crystallise a mixture of emotions; they are quietly devastating.",

He had a blast filming the commercial and, when the ad came out in November, his friends kindly told him it was great.</p> <p>But this week the ad went viral and poor Hunter\u2019s world started to fall apart. Twitter declared the ad Very Bad Indeed! People were mean about him on the internet and suggested the fictional husband he played was abusive. One of his own pals joked that Hunter had become a \u201csymbol of the patriarchy\u201d. Recounting his ordeal to <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/aesthetics-101/201912/disgraced-peloton-husband-speaks-out\">Psychology Today</a>, Hunter lamented that his \u201cfive seconds of air time created an array of malicious feedback that is all associated with my face\u201d. In order to distance himself from the commercial, Hunter changed his Instagram handle to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pelotonhusband/\">pelotonhusband</a>,</p> <p>For those of you haven\u2019t seen the ad yet: a woman gets Peloton\u2019s $2,400, Wifi-enabled exercise bike from her husband (Hunter) for Christmas. She starts a video diary of her sessions, and manages to give the unnerving impression that her husband will beat her or leave her if she doesn\u2019t wake up early every morning to exercise on her fancy bike.</p> <p>That\u2019s the precis, but I suggest you watch the ad for yourself because words can\u2019t do justice to how cringeworthy it is. Indeed, when I first saw it trending I assumed Peloton had made the ad awful on purpose so that it would go viral. The company is valued at several billion dollars, after all. Surely it knows what it\u2019s doing?</p> <p>And then I watched the \u201csexist and dystopian\u201d ad. It wasn\u2019t tongue-in-cheek terrible. It was terrible-terrible. Its attempts to portray getting on an exercise bike as some sort of life-changing spiritual journey inadvertently lifted a lid on the \u201cwellness\u201d industry, revealing it as an expensive scam. I started to understand why the company\u2019s stock had plunged and it had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/04/peloton-backlash-sexist-dystopian-exercise-bike-christmas-advert\">lost $1.5bn in value amid the Twitter backlash</a>.</p> <p>I have some sympathy for the fact that Hunter\u2019s face is now associated with a viral ad the entire internet is dunking on.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for The week in patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. \u2018Peloton husband\u2019 finally shares his terrible ordeal Sean Hunter, a Canadian actor and school teacher, was thrilled when he booked a role in a Peloton ad. He had a blast filming the commercial and, when the ad came out in November, his friends kindly told him it was great. But this week the ad went viral and poor Hunter\u2019s world started to fall apart. Twitter declared the ad Very Bad Indeed! People were mean about him on the internet and suggested the fictional husband he played was abusive. One of his own pals joked that Hunter had become a \u201csymbol of the patriarchy\u201d. Recounting his ordeal to Psychology Today, Hunter lamented that his \u201cfive seconds of air time created an array of malicious feedback that is all associated with my face\u201d. In order to distance himself from the commercial, Hunter changed his Instagram handle to pelotonhusband, For those of you haven\u2019t seen the ad yet: a woman gets Peloton\u2019s $2,400, Wifi-enabled exercise bike from her husband (Hunter) for Christmas. She starts a video diary of her sessions, and manages to give the unnerving impression that her husband will beat her or leave her if she doesn\u2019t wake up early every morning to exercise on her fancy bike. That\u2019s the precis, but I suggest you watch the ad for yourself because words can\u2019t do justice to how cringeworthy it is. Indeed, when I first saw it trending I assumed Peloton had made the ad awful on purpose so that it would go viral. The company is valued at several billion dollars, after all. Surely it knows what it\u2019s doing? And then I watched the \u201csexist and dystopian\u201d ad. It wasn\u2019t tongue-in-cheek terrible. It was terrible-terrible. Its attempts to portray getting on an exercise bike as some sort of life-changing spiritual journey inadvertently lifted a lid on the \u201cwellness\u201d industry, revealing it as an expensive scam. I started to understand why the company\u2019s stock had plunged and it had lost $1.5bn in value amid the Twitter backlash. I have some sympathy for the fact that Hunter\u2019s face is now associated with a viral ad the entire internet is dunking on. But it\u2019s also somewhat ironic that a man with five seconds of air time has set out to prove he isn\u2019t a \u201csymbol of the patriarchy\u201d by making the Peloton advert controversy entirely about him and bizarrely casting himself as a victim. Hunter could have spent five minutes thinking critically about why the ad was being called \u201csexist\u201d. Instead he whined that \u201cviewers can mistake an actor as that person after they\u2019ve seen them on television instead of a person given a script with no opinion on what they are being told to portray.\u201d Dude, I think people realize you were playing a fictional character and that you didn\u2019t write the script. He also sadly asked: \u201cIf recognized on the street, what will people\u2019s first opinions be of me?\u201d Hunter, mate, let me reassure you that by next week this ad, and your face, will be very old news.

Despite efforts by the emergency services, two men, aged 21 and 37, were pronounced dead at the scene, while three people sustained serious injuries and remain in hospital. The victims\u2019 families have been informed and are being supported by officers, West Midlands police said. The road was closed in both directions between the Patent Shaft roundabout and Moxley Junction for several hours to allow police to examine the scene. Sgt Alan Hands from the serious collision investigation unit said: \u201cWe\u2019re currently working to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision and whether any other vehicles were involved. \u201cI\u2019d ask that anyone who has information or witnessed what happened, in particular any motorists who were in the area and have dashcam footage to come forward and contact the investigation team.\u201d",

Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Araimi, 26, was stabbed in a suspected robbery near Harrods in Knightsbridge, west London, as he and a friend made their way home from a nearby restaurant late on Thursday evening. He was found unconscious with a stab wound to the back just after midnight, and pronounced dead on Brompton Road 40 minutes later. The Omani embassy posted in Arabic on Twitter: \u201cThere was an unfortunate attack that claimed the life of the Omani student Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Araimi. \u201cThe Embassy is closely following the circumstances of the incident with the competent British authorities.

I urge anyone who has information concerning this incident to contact my team who are waiting to speak with you.\u201d Meanwhile, detectives have charged 26-year-old Kieran Brown with the murder of Exauce Ngimbi in Hackney, east London. Ngimbi was attacked in Clarence Mews shortly after 2pm on Thursday and died half an hour later. Brown, from Hackney, is due to appear at Thames magistrates court on Saturday and is also charged with possession of a bladed article. Three other men, aged 14 to 26, have been bailed pending further inquiries. Crosslom Davis, a member of the south London drill group Harlem Spartans, was stabbed to death in the capital about 12 and a half hours after Ngimbi. The 20-year-old, also known by his rap name Bis, used to perform alongside Latwaan Griffiths, who was murdered in July 2018 at the age of 18. He was pronounced dead just after 3.30am on Friday in Deptford, south-east London. Harlem Spartans, who regularly rapped about violence and knifings, have achieved prominence, with Davis\u2019s latest song attracting close to a million views on YouTube. They were championed by Tim Westwood when they performed on the former Radio 1 DJ\u2019s YouTube channel in 2017.

      "body": "<p>I did not intend to be single in the rural village where I live. I\u2019d moved there with my fiance after taking a good job at the local university. We\u2019d bought a house with room enough for children. Then the wedding was off and I found myself single in a town where the non-student population is 1,236 people. I briefly considered flirting with the cute local bartender, the cute local mailman \u2013 then realised the foolishness of limiting my ability to do things such as get mail or get drunk in a town with only 1,235 other adults. For the first time in my life, I decided to date online.</p> <p>The thing about talking to people on Tinder is that it is boring. I am an obnoxious kind of conversation snob and have a pathologically low threshold for small talk. I love people who fall into the category of Smart Sad People Flaunting Their Intelligence With Panache. I love Shakespeare\u2019s fools and Elizabeth Bennet and Cyrano de Bergerac. I love Gilmore Girls and the West Wing and Rick And Morty. I want a conversation partner who travels through an abundance of interesting material at breakneck speed, shouting over their shoulder at me: Keep up. I want a conversation partner who assumes I am up for the challenge, who assumes the best of me.</p> <p>It will not surprise you to learn that this is a totally batshit way to approach Tinder and that, for my snobbery, I paid a price.</p> <p>The first man I chatted with who met my conversational standards was an academic, a musician. He taught refugee children how to play steel drums. He had a dark sense of humour, he was witty, and he laid all his baggage out there on the line right away. Even through our little chat window it was obvious he was fully and messily human, which I loved, and so we chatted all day long, for days, and I could not wait to meet him.</p> <p>Reality was different. What had seemed passionate and daring online, turned out to be alarmingly intense. There were multiple bouts of tears, there were proposed road trips to Florida to meet his mother and dog, there was an unexpected accordion serenade, and there was the assertion that I would make a very beautiful pregnant woman. Listen: I think a man who can cry is an evolved man. I hope to some day have kids, which, I suppose, would entail being, for a time, a pregnant woman. I even like the accordion. None of this was bad on its own, but it was so much.

My date spent most of our dinner conversation monologuing about how Americans were \u201cvery fat\u201d, which made it difficult to enjoy my chiles rellenos. But when we went back to his apartment for a drink, it was beautifully decorated: full of plants and woven hangings and a bicycle propped against a shelf full of novels. He was smart and handsome and sort of an asshole, but perhaps in a way that would mellow over time in a Darcy-ish manner. We drank some wine and eventually I said I should go home but he got up and kissed me, kissed me well, so I told myself this was what online dating was like, and I should carpe diem and have an experience.</p> <p>During sex, he choked me. Not for long, and not very hard, but his hands manifested very suddenly around my throat in a way I know was meant to be sexy but which I found, from this relative stranger, totally frightening.

But not as a surprise.</p> <p>Afterwards, he chatted to me as I counted the appropriate number of minutes I needed to wait before making an exit that wouldn\u2019t seem like I was running away.

It was a compilation of mass shooters\u2019 video manifestos, but set to comically upbeat music. It\u2019s hilarious, he asserted. I said I had to go. The next day, and a few times after, he messaged asking why I had run away and gone dark.</p> <p>I realised that perhaps what seemed interesting online did not translate into real life. My method of going on dates only with people who gave good banter was working poorly. It was pointing me toward the extremes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once I gave up on the banterers, my Tinder chats became uniform.

In class, we discussed the ways in which a robot, or chatbot, might try to convince you of its humanity.

It was easier to pretend I was a woman conducting a scientific investigation of language and love than it was to admit I was lonely. Easier than admitting that an algorithm someone had made to sell ads to singles was now in charge of my happiness. Easier than admitting that this was a risk I was willing to take.</p> <p>I knew a little bit about how to proceed with my Tinder Turing tests from one of my favourite books \u2013 one I was teaching at the time: The Most Human Human, by Brian Christian. In this book, which I have read five times, Christian goes to participate in the world\u2019s most famous Turing test, the Loebner prize in Brighton. He serves as a human blind, chatting with people through an interface, who then have to decide whether he is a human or a chatbot. The true point of the Loebner prize is to see whether any of the chatbots can convince the judges of their humanity \u2013 but as Christian\u2019s title suggests, there is also a jokey prize offered to the human blind who the fewest participants mistake for a robot. Receiving the Most Human Human award was Christian\u2019s goal. In the book, he asks: what could a human do with language that a robot could not? What are the ways of expressing ourselves which are the most surprisingly human? How do we recognise our fellow humans on the other side of the line? And so, as I attempted to find the lovely and interesting people I was sure were lurking behind the platitudes the average Tinder chat entails, I asked myself Christian\u2019s question: how could I both be a person who understood she was online, on Tinder, but still communicate like a humane human being? What could I do that a robot couldn\u2019t?</p> <p>I was thinking of robots metaphorically, but there are real chatbots on Tinder. I never encountered one (to my knowledge; was Dale, age 30, with the six pack and swoopy hair and the photo on a yacht who wanted to know if I was DTF RN only ever just a beautiful amalgamation of 1s and 0s?). But I know lots of people who have, and men seem to be particularly besieged by them. This is such a common problem on Tinder that a culty test has emerged \u2013 a kind of CAPTCHA for humans to deploy if a match seems suspiciously glamorous or otherwise unreal. In the Potato test, you ask the person you\u2019re speaking to to say potato if they\u2019re human. And if they don\u2019t, well, you know. You might think this is ridiculous but one of my favourite screen shots of this going down (the Tinder subreddit is a glorious place) reads as follows:</p> <p>Tinder: You matched with Elizabeth.<br>Actual Human Man: Oh lord. Gotta do the Potato test. Say potato if you\u2019re real.<br>\u201cElizabeth\u201d: Heyy! you are my first match.<br>I dare you to try to make a better first message ahaha.<br>Actual Human Man: Say potato Elizabeth.<br>\u201cElizabeth\u201d: And btw, if you don\u2019t mind me asking this, why are you on Tinder?<br>Personally I think I\u2019m not much into serious stuff ahaha.<br>Actual Human Man: SAY POTATO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the conversations I was having with true potato-tested men and women weren\u2019t much different from Actual Human Man\u2019s conversation with Elizabeth. These conversations never resolved into anything more than small talk \u2013 which is to say they never resolved into anything that gave me a sense of who the hell I was talking to.</p> <p>I started taking hopeful chances again, and many of my conversations yielded real-life dates. I could write you a taxonomy of all the different kinds of bad those dates were. Sometimes it was my fault (blazing into oversharing and rightfully alienating people), sometimes it was their fault (bringing his own chicken sandwich and commenting on my tits within the first 15 minutes), and sometimes it was nobody\u2019s fault and we had a fine time but just sat there like two non-reactive elements in a beaker. One way or another, though, what it always came down to was the conversation.</p> <p>The chapter I have always loved most in Christian\u2019s book is the one about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/garry-kasparov\" title=\"\">Garry Kasparov</a> \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/may/12/deep-blue-beats-kasparov-1997\" title=\"\">losing\u201d at chess to Deep Blue</a>, IBM\u2019s chess-playing computer. Christian explains the chess concept of playing \u201cin book\u201d. In short, the book is the known series of chess moves that should be played in sequence to optimise success. In most high-level chess matches, the first part of any game is played \u201cin book\u201d and a smart observer will know which moves will follow which until a certain amount of complexity and chaos necessitates improvisation \u2013 at which point the players begin to play in earnest. Some might say, as themselves. Kasparov holds that he did not lose to Deep Blue because the game was still in book when he made his fatal error and so, while he flubbed the script, he never truly even played against the algorithmic mind of his opponent.</p> <p>In this chapter, Christian makes a brilliant comparison between most polite conversation, small talk, and \u201cthe book\u201d, arguing that true human interaction doesn\u2019t start happening until one or both of the participants diverge from their scripts of culturally defined pleasantries. The book is necessary in some ways, as it is in chess (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/15/bobby-fischer-chess-downfall\" title=\"\">Bobby Fischer </a>would disagree), in order to launch us into these deeper, realer conversations. But it is all too easy to have an entire conversation without leaving the book these days \u2013 to talk without accessing the other person\u2019s specific humanity.</p> <p>This was my trouble with Tinder. No matter how hard I tried to push into real human terrain over chat, and sometimes on real-life dates, I always found myself dragged back into a scripted dance of niceties. I might as well have been on dates with Deep Blue, ordering another round of cocktails and hoping its real programming would eventually come online.</p> <p>After these dates, I felt pretty low. Like I would never find what I was looking for.</p> <p>What was I looking for?</p> <p>To answer that, I have to go back to Elizabeth Who Wouldn\u2019t Say Potato. There\u2019s something about the way her suitor asks her not if she\u2019s human, but if she\u2019s real, that I\u2019m a sucker for. There\u2019s a passage from <a href=\"http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/williams/rabbit/rabbit.html\" title=\"\">The Velveteen Rabbit </a>that my sister asked me to read at her wedding. I thought I was up for the task (it\u2019s a children\u2019s book, for God\u2019s sake), but when the time came, I ugly-cried all the way through:</p> <p><em>\u201cReal isn\u2019t how you are made,</em><em>\u201d said the Skin Horse. </em><em>\u201cIt\u2019s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.</em><em>\u201d</em></p> <p><em>\u201cDoes it hurt?</em><em>\u201d asked the Rabbit.</em></p> <p><em>\u201cSometimes,</em><em>\u201d said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. </em><em>\u201cWhen you are Real you don\u2019t mind being hurt.</em><em>..</em><em> You become. It takes a long time. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don\u2019t matter at all, because once you are Real you can\u2019t be ugly, except to people who don\u2019t understand.\u201d</em></p> <p>Margery Williams Bianco, The Velveteen Rabbit</p> <p>I want to pretend that I\u2019m cooler than crying about The Velveteen Rabbit but I\u2019m just not. And if I\u2019m honest with myself, this was what I wanted: for someone not only to prove to me that they weren\u2019t a robot, but that they were real, and would make me real, too. Could I put this in my Tinder bio? CJH, 34: looking to keep it real and love off most of your hair till your eyes drop out &lt;3.</p> <p>It had been, by this point, a year of on and off Tinder dating. At one point I even googled Christian to see if he was single. He was not. On what I decided had to be my last Tinder date ever, a neuroscientist in a hipster diner delivered a nonstop monologue about his recent life that was mostly his consideration of moving to LA because the women there were so hot. He gave me a briefing on the various types of plastic surgery that were \u201cin right now\u201d. It was a conversation that felt like the headlines of checkout aisle magazines had come to life, to shame me for my non-cyborg womanhood.</p> <p>That\u2019s it, I told my friends, for whom I always performed the stories of my bad dates. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m ghosting everyone in my inbox and deleting my account.</p> <p>I meant to.</p> <p>But there was one man who kept talking to me.</p> <p>Me: I\u2019m laughing at the part of your bio where you say you\u2019re \u201chopelessly extroverted\u201d. Are you the sort of person who makes friends on airplanes?</p> <p>Him: No but I\u2019m a chronic oversharer!</p> <p>Me: I\u2019ve actually grown into oversharing. It\u2019s the only way to avoid infinite small talk purgatory.</p> <p>Him: Tinder is by definition small talk purgatory.</p> <p>Me: God save us all.</p> <p>Him: We\u2019re all doomed.</p> <p>Me: How do we escape?</p> <p>Him: Get away from cell signals and head for the hills.</p> <p>We were out of book. It was as if he had gestured to the conversational matrix we were talking inside of, the one I\u2019d been trying to escape, and said: hey, I see it, too.</p> <p>Every day we kept talking and every day I said I was going to delete the app, but didn\u2019t. Because every time I tried, I wound up having delightful conversations with this human on the other side of the wires and waves. We developed our own language. There were inside jokes, callbacks, patterns of engagement. After that first day, a robot could not have replaced either of us, because our speech was for each other. It revealed who we were together: goofy, honest, heartbroken, funny about our sadness, a little awkward. The language we spoke in was what Christian would call \u201csite specific\u201d, meaning it was a language meant to exist in a certain place, at a certain time, with a certain person. It was the opposite of everything No Potato Elizabeth had to say.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The man across the bar was even cuter than I\u2019d anticipated and I was able to admit how much I hoped he might like me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, I agreed to go on a real-life date \u2013 bargaining us down from dinner to drinks because my expectations were so warped and strange by this point. I made no effort to look nice. I drank two beers with friends beforehand to numb myself to the misery I anticipated. But as soon as I showed up at the brewery we\u2019d picked, I immediately regretted these decisions. The man sitting across the bar was even cuter than I\u2019d anticipated and, as I approached him, thinking about our conversations over the past weeks, I was able to admit to myself how much I hoped he might like me. How much I hoped I hadn\u2019t already blown this. As soon as we started talking, my ratty shirt and snowboots, my buzz and other defences, didn\u2019t matter, though. Our date was all of the things our chats were \u2013 awkward, funny, honest, and backandforthy, which is to say: human.</p> <p>\u201cI actually hate this brewery,\u201d I told him. \u201cTheir beer is so bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too!\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThen why did we pick it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt just seems like the sort of place you\u2019re supposed to meet.\u201d</p> <p>This past year, on our first anniversary, this man gave me a present. It was a blanket, and woven into it was the image of our first Tinder conversation. He laughed very hard, and I laughed very hard, as he offered it to me, because it was ridiculous. It was meant to be. But it was undercover earnest, too. It was sweet and it was dumb and I could not have loved that blanket more.</p> <p>We split up before we could reach another anniversary, but as I went about the breakup torture that is boxing up all your ex\u2019s things, the photos and gifts too painful to stare down, I couldn\u2019t give up the blanket. It was a reminder that being human is risky, and painful, and worth doing. That I\u2019d rather lose everything as Kasparov than succeed as Deep Blue.</p> <p>The conversation on the blanket is actually quite long. You can\u2019t read precisely what it says, but you can see the rhythm of it. The longer bursts of sharing. The questioning responses. The patter. One of our friends, upon seeing the blanket, teased us. \u201cYou talked for this long before you locked it up? You both need better game.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true that neither of us had any game. It\u2019s also true that this wasn\u2019t the point. The point was that we found a mutual language in which to prove ourselves human and pass each other\u2019s Turing tests. We both understood how easy it is to let your life pass along, totally in book, unless you take a risk, and disrupt the expected patterns, and try to make something human happen.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "I did not intend to be single in the rural village where I live. I\u2019d moved there with my fiance after taking a good job at the local university. We\u2019d bought a house with room enough for children. Then the wedding was off and I found myself single in a town where the non-student population is 1,236 people. I briefly considered flirting with the cute local bartender, the cute local mailman \u2013 then realised the foolishness of limiting my ability to do things such as get mail or get drunk in a town with only 1,235 other adults. For the first time in my life, I decided to date online. The thing about talking to people on Tinder is that it is boring. I am an obnoxious kind of conversation snob and have a pathologically low threshold for small talk. I love people who fall into the category of Smart Sad People Flaunting Their Intelligence With Panache. I love Shakespeare\u2019s fools and Elizabeth Bennet and Cyrano de Bergerac. I love Gilmore Girls and the West Wing and Rick And Morty. I want a conversation partner who travels through an abundance of interesting material at breakneck speed, shouting over their shoulder at me: Keep up. I want a conversation partner who assumes I am up for the challenge, who assumes the best of me. It will not surprise you to learn that this is a totally batshit way to approach Tinder and that, for my snobbery, I paid a price. The first man I chatted with who met my conversational standards was an academic, a musician. He taught refugee children how to play steel drums. He had a dark sense of humour, he was witty, and he laid all his baggage out there on the line right away. Even through our little chat window it was obvious he was fully and messily human, which I loved, and so we chatted all day long, for days, and I could not wait to meet him. Reality was different. What had seemed passionate and daring online, turned out to be alarmingly intense. There were multiple bouts of tears, there were proposed road trips to Florida to meet his mother and dog, there was an unexpected accordion serenade, and there was the assertion that I would make a very beautiful pregnant woman. Listen: I think a man who can cry is an evolved man. I hope to some day have kids, which, I suppose, would entail being, for a time, a pregnant woman. I even like the accordion. None of this was bad on its own, but it was so much. After I said I didn\u2019t want to date any more he sent me adorable letterpress cards in the mail with upsetting notes inside that said he was upset, no, angry, that I wouldn\u2019t give us a shot. I chalked this experience up to bad luck, and continued to only date people with whom I had interesting online conversations. My next IRL date had just moved to New York by way of Europe and was a collector of small stories and observations. Our chats took the form of long blocks of text. Anecdotes swapped and interrogated. Stories from the world presented to each other like offerings dropped at each other\u2019s feet. I love such things; I am a magpie at heart. But these stories became grotesque in real life.

Actual Human Man: Say potato Elizabeth. \u201cElizabeth\u201d: And btw, if you don\u2019t mind me asking this, why are you on Tinder? Personally I think I\u2019m not much into serious stuff ahaha. Actual Human Man: SAY POTATO. Meanwhile, the conversations I was having with true potato-tested men and women weren\u2019t much different from Actual Human Man\u2019s conversation with Elizabeth.

One way or another, though, what it always came down to was the conversation. The chapter I have always loved most in Christian\u2019s book is the one about Garry Kasparov \u201closing\u201d at chess to Deep Blue, IBM\u2019s chess-playing computer.

In most high-level chess matches, the first part of any game is played \u201cin book\u201d and a smart observer will know which moves will follow which until a certain amount of complexity and chaos necessitates improvisation \u2013 at which point the players begin to play in earnest. Some might say, as themselves. Kasparov holds that he did not lose to Deep Blue because the game was still in book when he made his fatal error and so, while he flubbed the script, he never truly even played against the algorithmic mind of his opponent. In this chapter, Christian makes a brilliant comparison between most polite conversation, small talk, and \u201cthe book\u201d, arguing that true human interaction doesn\u2019t start happening until one or both of the participants diverge from their scripts of culturally defined pleasantries. The book is necessary in some ways, as it is in chess (Bobby Fischer would disagree), in order to launch us into these deeper, realer conversations. But it is all too easy to have an entire conversation without leaving the book these days \u2013 to talk without accessing the other person\u2019s specific humanity. This was my trouble with Tinder. No matter how hard I tried to push into real human terrain over chat, and sometimes on real-life dates, I always found myself dragged back into a scripted dance of niceties. I might as well have been on dates with Deep Blue, ordering another round of cocktails and hoping its real programming would eventually come online. After these dates, I felt pretty low. Like I would never find what I was looking for. What was I looking for? To answer that, I have to go back to Elizabeth Who Wouldn\u2019t Say Potato. There\u2019s something about the way her suitor asks her not if she\u2019s human, but if she\u2019s real, that I\u2019m a sucker for. There\u2019s a passage from The Velveteen Rabbit that my sister asked me to read at her wedding. I thought I was up for the task (it\u2019s a children\u2019s book, for God\u2019s sake), but when the time came, I ugly-cried all the way through: \u201cReal isn\u2019t how you are made,\u201d said the Skin Horse. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.\u201d \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d asked the Rabbit. \u201cSometimes,\u201d said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. \u201cWhen you are Real you don\u2019t mind being hurt... You become. It takes a long time. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don\u2019t matter at all, because once you are Real you can\u2019t be ugly, except to people who don\u2019t understand.\u201d Margery Williams Bianco, The Velveteen Rabbit I want to pretend that I\u2019m cooler than crying about The Velveteen Rabbit but I\u2019m just not. And if I\u2019m honest with myself, this was what I wanted: for someone not only to prove to me that they weren\u2019t a robot, but that they were real, and would make me real, too. Could I put this in my Tinder bio? CJH, 34: looking to keep it real and love off most of your hair till your eyes drop out &lt;3. It had been, by this point, a year of on and off Tinder dating. At one point I even googled Christian to see if he was single. He was not. On what I decided had to be my last Tinder date ever, a neuroscientist in a hipster diner delivered a nonstop monologue about his recent life that was mostly his consideration of moving to LA because the women there were so hot. He gave me a briefing on the various types of plastic surgery that were \u201cin right now\u201d. It was a conversation that felt like the headlines of checkout aisle magazines had come to life, to shame me for my non-cyborg womanhood. That\u2019s it, I told my friends, for whom I always performed the stories of my bad dates. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m ghosting everyone in my inbox and deleting my account. I meant to. But there was one man who kept talking to me. Me: I\u2019m laughing at the part of your bio where you say you\u2019re \u201chopelessly extroverted\u201d. Are you the sort of person who makes friends on airplanes? Him: No but I\u2019m a chronic oversharer! Me: I\u2019ve actually grown into oversharing. It\u2019s the only way to avoid infinite small talk purgatory. Him: Tinder is by definition small talk purgatory. Me: God save us all. Him: We\u2019re all doomed. Me: How do we escape? Him: Get away from cell signals and head for the hills. We were out of book. It was as if he had gestured to the conversational matrix we were talking inside of, the one I\u2019d been trying to escape, and said: hey, I see it, too. Every day we kept talking and every day I said I was going to delete the app, but didn\u2019t. Because every time I tried, I wound up having delightful conversations with this human on the other side of the wires and waves. We developed our own language. There were inside jokes, callbacks, patterns of engagement. After that first day, a robot could not have replaced either of us, because our speech was for each other. It revealed who we were together: goofy, honest, heartbroken, funny about our sadness, a little awkward. The language we spoke in was what Christian would call \u201csite specific\u201d, meaning it was a language meant to exist in a certain place, at a certain time, with a certain person. It was the opposite of everything No Potato Elizabeth had to say. Eventually, I agreed to go on a real-life date \u2013 bargaining us down from dinner to drinks because my expectations were so warped and strange by this point. I made no effort to look nice. I drank two beers with friends beforehand to numb myself to the misery I anticipated. But as soon as I showed up at the brewery we\u2019d picked, I immediately regretted these decisions. The man sitting across the bar was even cuter than I\u2019d anticipated and, as I approached him, thinking about our conversations over the past weeks, I was able to admit to myself how much I hoped he might like me. How much I hoped I hadn\u2019t already blown this. As soon as we started talking, my ratty shirt and snowboots, my buzz and other defences, didn\u2019t matter, though. Our date was all of the things our chats were \u2013 awkward, funny, honest, and backandforthy, which is to say: human. \u201cI actually hate this brewery,\u201d I told him. \u201cTheir beer is so bad.\u201d \u201cMe, too!\u201d he said. \u201cThen why did we pick it!\u201d \u201cIt just seems like the sort of place you\u2019re supposed to meet.\u201d This past year, on our first anniversary, this man gave me a present. It was a blanket, and woven into it was the image of our first Tinder conversation. He laughed very hard, and I laughed very hard, as he offered it to me, because it was ridiculous. It was meant to be. But it was undercover earnest, too. It was sweet and it was dumb and I could not have loved that blanket more. We split up before we could reach another anniversary, but as I went about the breakup torture that is boxing up all your ex\u2019s things, the photos and gifts too painful to stare down, I couldn\u2019t give up the blanket. It was a reminder that being human is risky, and painful, and worth doing. That I\u2019d rather lose everything as Kasparov than succeed as Deep Blue. The conversation on the blanket is actually quite long. You can\u2019t read precisely what it says, but you can see the rhythm of it. The longer bursts of sharing. The questioning responses. The patter. One of our friends, upon seeing the blanket, teased us. \u201cYou talked for this long before you locked it up? You both need better game.\u201d It\u2019s true that neither of us had any game. It\u2019s also true that this wasn\u2019t the point. The point was that we found a mutual language in which to prove ourselves human and pass each other\u2019s Turing tests. We both understood how easy it is to let your life pass along, totally in book, unless you take a risk, and disrupt the expected patterns, and try to make something human happen. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Biden deemed him a \u201cdamn liar\u201d and \u201ctoo old to vote for me\u201d and maybe, just maybe, \u201cfat\u201d.</p> \n<p>The man, an 83-year-old retired farmer, had challenged Biden on one of his many vulnerabilities \u2013 his son\u2019s high-paying work for a Ukrainian energy company. Without direct evidence, the man said Biden, then the vice-president, secured his son the job. \u201cYou\u2019re selling access to the president just like [Trump] is,\u201d the unidentified man said.</p> \n<p>The man also attacked the 77-year-old\u2019s fitness for the presidency, saying Biden was \u201ctoo old for the job\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The confrontation was vintage Biden: rambling if aggressive, swaggering and strange</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sedentary,\u201d Biden fumed in response. \u201cYou want to check my shape on, let\u2019s do push-ups together, let\u2019s run, let\u2019s do whatever you want to do, let\u2019s take an IQ test.\u201d He also apparently added, during the exchange, \u201cBut look, fat, here\u2019s the deal,\u201d though his campaign maintains that Biden had begun to say \u201clook, facts\u201d.</p> \n<p>The confrontation was vintage Biden: rambling if aggressive, swaggering and strange. A thousand takes flew. Voters and pundits wondered if the gaffe-prone Biden was up for challenging President Donald Trump, the clown king of trolling.</p> \n<p>It may be difficult to remember, but Biden was once praised for his aggressive style, in particular the perception that he brawled effectively with Republican Paul Ryan during the 2012 vice-presidential debates. Though deeply flawed as a candidate, Biden should not be underestimated in the Democratic primary and, if he prevails, in a match-up against Trump.

      "bodyText": "On Thursday, Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner for president, angrily confronted a voter in Iowa who didn\u2019t like him very much. Biden deemed him a \u201cdamn liar\u201d and \u201ctoo old to vote for me\u201d and maybe, just maybe, \u201cfat\u201d. The man, an 83-year-old retired farmer, had challenged Biden on one of his many vulnerabilities \u2013 his son\u2019s high-paying work for a Ukrainian energy company. Without direct evidence, the man said Biden, then the vice-president, secured his son the job. \u201cYou\u2019re selling access to the president just like [Trump] is,\u201d the unidentified man said. The man also attacked the 77-year-old\u2019s fitness for the presidency, saying Biden was \u201ctoo old for the job\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not sedentary,\u201d Biden fumed in response. \u201cYou want to check my shape on, let\u2019s do push-ups together, let\u2019s run, let\u2019s do whatever you want to do, let\u2019s take an IQ test.\u201d He also apparently added, during the exchange, \u201cBut look, fat, here\u2019s the deal,\u201d though his campaign maintains that Biden had begun to say \u201clook, facts\u201d. The confrontation was vintage Biden: rambling if aggressive, swaggering and strange. A thousand takes flew. Voters and pundits wondered if the gaffe-prone Biden was up for challenging President Donald Trump, the clown king of trolling. It may be difficult to remember, but Biden was once praised for his aggressive style, in particular the perception that he brawled effectively with Republican Paul Ryan during the 2012 vice-presidential debates. Though deeply flawed as a candidate, Biden should not be underestimated in the Democratic primary and, if he prevails, in a match-up against Trump. Voter turnout will probably surge and anyone, Biden included, running under the Democratic banner will benefit from a furious and united anti-Trump vote. Biden\u2019s punch-drunk routine could go over well against an infantile bully like Trump. We know that, at the very least, Biden won\u2019t shrink from a fight.

      "body": "<p>Just as we are getting to grips with trying to live less wastefully (carrying reusable cups, eating less meat, flying less and buying less) along comes Christmas. The festive season is a frenzy of spending: in 2018, according to a <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/deloitte-christmas-survey-2018.html\" title=\"\">survey by Deloitte</a>, we spent an average of \u00a3299 per person on gifts in the UK, many cast aside on Boxing Day.</p> <p>There are signs that shopping habits are changing. This year, more than 60,000 people pledged to take part in #SecondHandSeptember, a campaign promoted by Oxfam, which estimates that more than two tonnes of clothing are bought in the UK every minute, generating the carbon emissions equivalent to driving a car round the world six times. Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Boycott Fashion group has more than 18,000 followers. Hashtags such as #buynothingnew, #lovedclotheslast and #secondhandfirst are sources of inspiration. This year, the message isn\u2019t shop till you drop: it\u2019s slow down before it\u2019s too late. Some people, including the actor Emma Thompson, plan to eschew presents altogether. I\u2019m not going that far, but without wishing to be Scrooge-like, I have taken on the challenge of buying nothing new for Christmas. We need to do our bit to stem the flow of plastic toys, cheap party clothes and throwaway electronic gizmos. All it takes is a bit of imagination and some forward planning.</p> <p>You might need to spend time sprucing up your buys, but that is part of the fun. I spent an hour at a car boot sale unearthing a silk scarf printed with hearts. It cost \u00a35. At home, I realised it smelled as if it had been in a damp lock-up for 20 years. After two handwashes, a day blowing about on the washing line and a night in the freezer, the smell had gone and I took great enjoyment in ironing it gently so nobody would know it was a car-boot orphan. Whoever unwraps it on Christmas morning will, I hope, be as charmed by it as I am and wear it for years to come.</p> <p>The world is full of treasures like this \u2013 you just have to look for them. Shopping secondhand will reconnect you with the person you are buying for, make you value the item you choose and may even encourage you to develop and polish some good old-fashioned cleaning and repair skills along the way.</p> <p>You will also enjoy some great community spirit as you shop. The volunteers at my local Cancer Research UK shop are super-friendly, unlike assistants at many ordinary shops, where I have sometimes left feeling unworthy of browsing the rails. I particularly enjoyed an exchange with the stallholder at the car boot sale who explained that all the money she makes goes to various animal charities: \u201cBears in Winnipeg, and cats in the UK.\u201d Here are some of my finds; I\u2019m feeling better about Christmas already.</p> <h2><strong>Lego and construction kit </strong><br></h2> <p>Online, eBay is toy heaven, overflowing with barely used Sylvanian hedgehogs, Toy Story rejects, Duplo and Brio train sets and enough Lego to build a life-sized skyscraper. There is more than enough Lego in the world not to buy any new ever again. I like the bricks you can buy by the kilo because nothing is wasted \u2013 the problem with boxed sets is that if a few pieces are lost, your Death Star is redundant \u2013 and once it\u2019s built, that\u2019s it. The original idea behind Lego was that the imagination led the creation: your construction ideas could be endless, not led by a series of instructions. I opted for a \u201cbuy it now\u201d (to save my adrenaline levels from the bidding war) kilo of assorted bricks, plus surprise mini figures, for \u00a317.99. I also found Making Stuff for Kids for \u00a33.49 at an Oxfam bookshop in Liverpool, which is crammed with great craft and construction projects, perfect for my 11-year-old son (I hope he\u2019s not reading this).</p> <h2><strong>Trainers</strong></h2> <p>Teenagers are difficult to buy for at the best of times, but a love of trainers seems pretty universal. I couldn\u2019t resist a pair of crazy-coloured Nike ID customised hi-tops hiding in a corner at the Royal Trinity Hospice shop in London. They were \u00a330, which seems expensive but if they are looked after, trainers hold their value. If you want a particular brand or style, download<a href=\"https://www.depop.com/\" title=\"\"> the Depop app</a><a href=\"https://www.depop.com/\" title=\"\"> </a>(a cross between Instagram and eBay) and chances are you will find it. Involve your teenager in choosing their dream pair (which you might not otherwise be able to afford). If they are unsure about wearing pre-worn shoes, tell them buying secondhand trainers will be a step closer to saving the planet, give them a budget, and let them choose a pair they love to unwrap on Christmas Day. Once they have finished with them, they can sell them on.</p> <h2><strong>Polaroid camera</strong></h2> <p>Last year, the shops were flooded with new Polaroid cameras, an analogue novelty for a generation bred on selfies and digital images. So why not buy an original camera and be truly retro? I found this OneStep 1980s instamatic Polaroid camera on Etsy from a shop called Preloved Polaroid. It cost \u00a325 (a carbon offset delivery service costs \u00a33.99) and is in full working order. Far cooler, and cheaper, than buying new. Find Polaroid film at <a href=\"https://uk.polaroidoriginals.com/\" title=\"u\">uk.polaroidoriginals.com</a> (\u00a317.99 for pack of eight pictures).</p> <h2><strong>Spider brooch</strong></h2> <p>When Lady Hale made her historic ruling on the prorogation of parliament at the supreme court in September, it was her spider brooch that nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/28/lady-hale-spider-brooch-launches-global-trend\" title=\"\">broke the internet</a>.

      "bodyText": "Just as we are getting to grips with trying to live less wastefully (carrying reusable cups, eating less meat, flying less and buying less) along comes Christmas. The festive season is a frenzy of spending: in 2018, according to a survey by Deloitte, we spent an average of \u00a3299 per person on gifts in the UK, many cast aside on Boxing Day. There are signs that shopping habits are changing. This year, more than 60,000 people pledged to take part in #SecondHandSeptember, a campaign promoted by Oxfam, which estimates that more than two tonnes of clothing are bought in the UK every minute, generating the carbon emissions equivalent to driving a car round the world six times. Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Boycott Fashion group has more than 18,000 followers. Hashtags such as #buynothingnew, #lovedclotheslast and #secondhandfirst are sources of inspiration. This year, the message isn\u2019t shop till you drop: it\u2019s slow down before it\u2019s too late. Some people, including the actor Emma Thompson, plan to eschew presents altogether. I\u2019m not going that far, but without wishing to be Scrooge-like, I have taken on the challenge of buying nothing new for Christmas. We need to do our bit to stem the flow of plastic toys, cheap party clothes and throwaway electronic gizmos. All it takes is a bit of imagination and some forward planning. You might need to spend time sprucing up your buys, but that is part of the fun. I spent an hour at a car boot sale unearthing a silk scarf printed with hearts. It cost \u00a35. At home, I realised it smelled as if it had been in a damp lock-up for 20 years. After two handwashes, a day blowing about on the washing line and a night in the freezer, the smell had gone and I took great enjoyment in ironing it gently so nobody would know it was a car-boot orphan. Whoever unwraps it on Christmas morning will, I hope, be as charmed by it as I am and wear it for years to come. The world is full of treasures like this \u2013 you just have to look for them. Shopping secondhand will reconnect you with the person you are buying for, make you value the item you choose and may even encourage you to develop and polish some good old-fashioned cleaning and repair skills along the way. You will also enjoy some great community spirit as you shop. The volunteers at my local Cancer Research UK shop are super-friendly, unlike assistants at many ordinary shops, where I have sometimes left feeling unworthy of browsing the rails. I particularly enjoyed an exchange with the stallholder at the car boot sale who explained that all the money she makes goes to various animal charities: \u201cBears in Winnipeg, and cats in the UK.\u201d Here are some of my finds; I\u2019m feeling better about Christmas already. Lego and construction kit Online, eBay is toy heaven, overflowing with barely used Sylvanian hedgehogs, Toy Story rejects, Duplo and Brio train sets and enough Lego to build a life-sized skyscraper. There is more than enough Lego in the world not to buy any new ever again. I like the bricks you can buy by the kilo because nothing is wasted \u2013 the problem with boxed sets is that if a few pieces are lost, your Death Star is redundant \u2013 and once it\u2019s built, that\u2019s it. The original idea behind Lego was that the imagination led the creation: your construction ideas could be endless, not led by a series of instructions. I opted for a \u201cbuy it now\u201d (to save my adrenaline levels from the bidding war) kilo of assorted bricks, plus surprise mini figures, for \u00a317.99. I also found Making Stuff for Kids for \u00a33.49 at an Oxfam bookshop in Liverpool, which is crammed with great craft and construction projects, perfect for my 11-year-old son (I hope he\u2019s not reading this). Trainers Teenagers are difficult to buy for at the best of times, but a love of trainers seems pretty universal. I couldn\u2019t resist a pair of crazy-coloured Nike ID customised hi-tops hiding in a corner at the Royal Trinity Hospice shop in London. They were \u00a330, which seems expensive but if they are looked after, trainers hold their value. If you want a particular brand or style, download the Depop app (a cross between Instagram and eBay) and chances are you will find it. Involve your teenager in choosing their dream pair (which you might not otherwise be able to afford). If they are unsure about wearing pre-worn shoes, tell them buying secondhand trainers will be a step closer to saving the planet, give them a budget, and let them choose a pair they love to unwrap on Christmas Day. Once they have finished with them, they can sell them on. Polaroid camera Last year, the shops were flooded with new Polaroid cameras, an analogue novelty for a generation bred on selfies and digital images. So why not buy an original camera and be truly retro? I found this OneStep 1980s instamatic Polaroid camera on Etsy from a shop called Preloved Polaroid. It cost \u00a325 (a carbon offset delivery service costs \u00a33.99) and is in full working order. Far cooler, and cheaper, than buying new. Find Polaroid film at uk.polaroidoriginals.com (\u00a317.99 for pack of eight pictures). Spider brooch When Lady Hale made her historic ruling on the prorogation of parliament at the supreme court in September, it was her spider brooch that nearly broke the internet. I had endless enjoyment looking for similar jewelled arachnids, and finally found one for the princely sum of \u00a32.99 at a British Heart Foundation shop in Ormskirk, Lancashire. Small market towns like this are great hunting grounds for charity shops \u2013 you will have many to choose from. To make it extra special, look for a beautiful box to put it in. The box might cost more than the brooch, but presentation counts for a lot \u2013 especially when a gift is secondhand. Cross-body bag It\u2019s worth checking the resale site Vestiaire Collective for small luxuries. While a lot of items are pricey, set the guide to your budget and you may be surprised. I found this jaunty, canvas cross-body bag by Tommy Hilfiger for \u00a325. You can pay a few pounds extra to have it authenticated. Allow for shipping time from Vestiaire; they suggest 10 days, but warn it can take up to 30. Another great bet for interesting bags is TRAID. I spotted a monogrammed Cerruti 1881 bag for \u00a314.99 (find a local shop or use its online shop on eBay). Cashmere jumper Cashmere is always a treat, whether new or secondhand. Keep a look out on eBay and Oxfam online but be warned, bidding can be fierce. You might prefer, as I did, to buy from The Nearly New Cashmere Boutique which has a new shop in Masham, North Yorkshire. The founder, Alison Orr, sources old (and some deadstock) cashmere which she washes, debobbles and, if necessary, reconditions and sells. Her prices are keen and the knitwear arrives beautifully packaged \u2013 as new. I opted for a soft striped Banana Republic jumper with three small holes that had been mended (almost invisibly). A bargain at \u00a332. Vintage wine glasses I found a set of six 1920s engraved vintage wine glasses at a flea market in London. I didn\u2019t even need to haggle for the stallholder to knock them down from \u00a324 to \u00a320, which seems extraordinary for something so refined and fragile that has survived in perfect condition for a century. I\u2019ll be wrapping up these dinky wine glasses to accompany a bottle of my home-made damson gin, which I hope will be ready by Christmas. Men\u2019s shirts There are so many good-quality shirts on charity shop rails. Depending on the taste of your shirt-wearer, you can find everything from Jermyn Street posh to high-quality hipster.

      "body": "<p>Greta Gerwig\u2019s new big-screen adaptation of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/03/100-best-novels-little-women-louisa-may-alcott\" title=\"\">Little Women</a></em>, the sixth about the March sisters to be made so far, starts with a scene taken from the middle of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s second volume. Almost all the others have begun with the girls\u2019 childhood, but in Gerwig\u2019s film, we first meet an adult Jo March in the New York offices of the Weekly Volcano, where she hopes to place a story \u2013 thus setting it up as a film about writing. Along with all the things we expect from this story (coming of age, sibling relations, the challenge of being good), the film is about the relationship of fiction with life, and the challenges and the rewards of writing as a job. The parallels between Jo and her creator, Alcott, are also drawn out by Gerwig, and this adult Jo co-exists throughout the film with the child Jo, who is learning how to write, how to be a woman and, often, how similar these processes can be.</p> <p>Published in the late 1860s, <em>Little Women</em>, for those for whom mentions of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy do not instantly evoke scenes known since childhood (a book-burning, the shearing of a head of long hair), tells the story of four girls whose father is away, working as a chaplain in the US civil war. They used to be well off, but he was too trusting with his money, and now they are poor; the famed first lines \u2013 \u201c\u2018Christmas won\u2019t be Christmas without any presents,\u2019 grumbled Jo, lying on the rug\u201d \u2013 establish how they feel about it, and some of the ways in which they will be tested. It tells a rather different story depending on whether you read it in the US or in the UK, where the second half is generally hived off as <em>Little Women Wedded</em>, or <em>Good Wives</em>, and often not read at all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It has never been a secret that Jo is a version of Alcott, who 'never liked girls or knew many, except my sisters'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The girls work as governesses and lady\u2019s companions; they mend old clothes to make them last; they make their own entertainment: plays, newspapers, books, music. When the first book opens they range in age from 11 or so (Amy) to 16 (Meg), and thus are on the brink of womanhood. This is an unusual choice, as Anne Boyd Rioux pointed out in last year\u2019s incisive <em>Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy: The Story of Little Women and Why It Still Matters</em>, eschewing as it does the calmer, more \u201cinnocent\u201d state of childhood. <em>Little Women</em>, she notes, is full of coded references to the arrival of puberty and the ways in which this arrival is also a curbing: don\u2019t shake hands, take small steps, wear gloves. Meg, excited by dances, beginning to understand the power of her pretty face, tries to conform; Beth, agonisingly shy, stays at home playing the piano; Amy aims to combine feminine power and an ambition to be a great artist; while Jo, already a writer and a confirmed tomboy, struggles to be what her father calls her, \u201c\u2018a little woman\u2019, and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else\u201d.</p> <p>It has never been a secret that Jo is a tidied-up version of Alcott herself, who \u201cnever liked girls or knew many, except my sisters\u201d, and never especially wanted to be or act like one. Rioux\u2019s account brings out the ways in which Alcott\u2019s life was both harder and often more progressive than those of her characters. Alcott and her three sisters were poor, and had to work \u2013 though not because her father was at war but because, as a transcendentalist teacher, he so often put his ideals of self-improvement ahead of anything as prosaic as earning a living. Those ideals, however, included an absolute belief, shared by his wife Abigail \u2013 an outspoken suffrage campaigner and one of America\u2019s first social workers \u2013 in a woman\u2019s right to realise her full potential; in education; and in the iniquity of slavery (the school Jo eventually sets up includes a \u201cquadroon\u201d even though it might lead to \u201cruin\u201d; Alcott\u2019s father did the same, and had to shut down). He was a vegan who believed in maintaining the health of the body as well as the mind (for years his daughter went for a run every day), and he banned his family from using cotton, as it was harvested by slaves.</p> <p>Though they often had to rely on charity from their family, who could not resist ladling a sauce of told-you-sos over their cash (echoed by the fictional irascible Aunt March), they nevertheless sheltered abused women, children with mental health issues and runaway slaves. One sister, Lizzie, died young of a wasting disease, as Beth does in <em>Little Women Wedded</em>; Louisa cared for her, as Jo does for Beth, and was deeply affected. Unlike Jo, however, who marries, Louisa \u2013 who also lost her long hair, but through illness rather than choosing to cut it off \u2013 remained single.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da82d7538512fde98bf2306b5ef7e0ba5fb52961\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da82d7538512fde98bf2306b5ef7e0ba5fb52961/271_0_1352_1689/800.jpg\" alt=\"Winona Ryder as Jo in the 1994 film version of Little Women.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winona Ryder as Jo in the 1994 film version of Little Women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alcott was also radical in deciding to write <em>Little Women</em> in defiantly direct, colloquial language, so full of New England slang that Rioux\u2019s recent edition of the book for Penguin Classics (with a foreword by Patti Smith) required a glossary. The language matched Alcott\u2019s other departure, from the preachiness of contemporary children\u2019s literature to the resolutely ordinary: to talk of darning socks, or cooking lunch. The book was instantly successful; 2,000 copies of the first volume were sold in the first two weeks, and millions more,<strong> </strong>in about 50 languages, have sold since.</p> <p>For bookish, tomboyish \u2013 or just ambitious \u2013 girls, Jo was an inspiration: writing in a garret first at home and then in New York City (echoing Alcott\u2019s apartment in Boston), in a \u201cfunny little sky parlor \u2026 [with] a stove in it, and a nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like\u201d. Rioux\u2019s lists of women influenced by Jo go on for pages. Jo March was, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ursulakleguin\" title=\"\">Ursula K Le Guin</a> once wrote, \u201cclose as a sister \u2026 I don\u2019t know where else I or many others like me, in my generation or my mother\u2019s or my daughter\u2019s, were to find this model, this validation\u201d. Caitlin Moran, who modelled Johanna Morrigan in her novel <em>How to Build a Girl </em>on Jo, once said: \u201cI owe everything I am to Jo March in <em>Little Women</em> and Anne Shirley in <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Alcott yearned to rival the Bront\u00ebs, as well as Emerson and Thoreau, her neighbours in Concord, yet her first efforts to write a serious, ambitious novel were only published after extensive and, she felt, damaging cuts \u2013 an experience echoed in Jo\u2019s story. (<em>Little Women</em>, which she did not especially want to write, was initially read and admired by all sorts of people, male and female, young and old, but as the century turned it was increasingly pushed into the cul-de-sac of \u201cwomen\u2019s writing\u201d.) Alcott \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford to starve on praise\u201d and turned to writing sensationalist stories \u2013 as does Jo in <em>Little Women</em>: \u201c<em>The Duke\u2019s Daughter</em> paid the butcher\u2019s bill, <em>A Phantom Hand</em> put down a new carpet, and <em>The Curse of the Coventrys</em> proved the blessing of the Marchs in the way of groceries and gowns,\u201d as Jo puts it. Later, however, Jo intuits that Professor Bhaer, a German teacher she has begun to care for, is concerned about how these stories might affect her writing and her soul, and stops working on them altogether.</p> <p>This is a point that has bothered readers so much that many adaptations have taken the scene to mean that Bhaer goes on to run Jo\u2019s career; Gerwig reads the book correctly, and instead shows Jo (played by Saoirse Ronan) in control: writing no more sensations, yes \u2013 but proceeding to discover her true metier and enjoying her successes. Not least because, as the film goes on, the Jo character begins to merge with a portrayal of Alcott.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d7e8b2f373bcbc24dfc1c163d5fd079b4a50b84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d7e8b2f373bcbc24dfc1c163d5fd079b4a50b84/0_224_2772_1663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louisa May Alcott, photographed in about 1860.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louisa May Alcott, photographed in about 1860.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Again and again lines in Gerwig\u2019s film are drawn from Alcott\u2019s own life. In the novel, for instance, Jo is honest about her envy of her youngest sister, but the idea that she gets the \u201ccream\u201d of everything, as Jo says in the film, comes from a comment Alcott made about her own sister, May. In the book, Jo says: \u201cI don\u2019t believe I shall ever marry. I\u2019m happy as I am, and love my liberty too w ell to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man\u201d; in the film she says: \u201cI\u2019d rather be a free spinster and paddle my own canoe\u201d \u2013 which comes from a letter Alcott wrote to a friend after visiting her just-married older sister. So many pithy statements about sexual politics are given to Amy (Florence Pugh) and to Aunt March (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\" title=\"\">Meryl Streep</a>) that the film threatens to become a 21st-century feminist lecture \u2013 until one remembers that they were all subjects about which Alcott herself was vocal. Not that she necessarily got her way: Alcott\u2019s publisher was initially bored by <em>Little Women </em>and changed his mind only when his young daughters got hold of the manuscript and loved it (a similar scene appears in the film). He does not budge, however, in his demand that her female characters end the novel \u201cmarried \u2013 or dead, either way\u201d. All four girls duly marry or die, and many critics have found this a profoundly disappointing outcome.</p> <p>There has always been particular discomfort with Meg\u2019s seeming subjugation, after discussions with her mother, to the sensible, \u201cmasterful\u201d John Brooke, and with the Bhaer figure, whom Alcott supplied in order both to comply with her publisher\u2019s wishes and frustrate the public demand that Jo do the easy, obvious thing and marry her childhood friend Laurie. But Gerwig seems to be trying to explore something less Manichean than personal fulfilment versus subjugation. \u201cI\u2019m sick of people saying love is all a woman\u2019s fit for,\u201d she has Jo say. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of it! But I\u2019m so lonely.\u201d (In the book, it is Marmee who says: \u201cI can\u2019t help seeing that you are very lonely.\u201d) The challenge for Jo, then, as for all her sisters, is to find fulfilment while at the same time taking steps to be less alone. As Rioux writes, the girls navigate \u201ca fundamental conflict for women \u2013 how to love and be loved without losing oneself\u201d. How to have it all, as we would put it now.</p> <p>We may these days, Rioux argues, be surrounded by books containing extraordinary girls \u2013 Lyra, Hermione, Katniss \u2013 but it is striking that they are exceptions, and often alone; groups of girls in, say, the Gossip Girl books are toxic and destructive. <em>Little Women</em> is about \u201ca world of women, of value in and of itself\u201d. It is also, Gerwig has said, \u201cone of the few books about childhood that isn\u2019t about escape. There is bravery, but it\u2019s a hero\u2019s journey contained inside the home.\u201d And one whose male characters are peripheral. In the first volume Jo, furious that Meg is thinking of getting married, thus breaking up the cosy family, rages that \u201cbuds will be roses, and kittens cats \u2013 more\u2019s the pity\u201d. In Gerwig\u2019s film Meg replies to a similar outburst with: \u201cJust because my dreams are different from yours doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not important.\u201d Perhaps the truly radical thing is that Alcott tried to make space and time for all of them.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Little Women is on general release in the UK from 26 December.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Greta Gerwig\u2019s new big-screen adaptation of Little Women, the sixth about the March sisters to be made so far, starts with a scene taken from the middle of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s second volume. Almost all the others have begun with the girls\u2019 childhood, but in Gerwig\u2019s film, we first meet an adult Jo March in the New York offices of the Weekly Volcano, where she hopes to place a story \u2013 thus setting it up as a film about writing. Along with all the things we expect from this story (coming of age, sibling relations, the challenge of being good), the film is about the relationship of fiction with life, and the challenges and the rewards of writing as a job. The parallels between Jo and her creator, Alcott, are also drawn out by Gerwig, and this adult Jo co-exists throughout the film with the child Jo, who is learning how to write, how to be a woman and, often, how similar these processes can be. Published in the late 1860s, Little Women, for those for whom mentions of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy do not instantly evoke scenes known since childhood (a book-burning, the shearing of a head of long hair), tells the story of four girls whose father is away, working as a chaplain in the US civil war. They used to be well off, but he was too trusting with his money, and now they are poor; the famed first lines \u2013 \u201c\u2018Christmas won\u2019t be Christmas without any presents,\u2019 grumbled Jo, lying on the rug\u201d \u2013 establish how they feel about it, and some of the ways in which they will be tested. It tells a rather different story depending on whether you read it in the US or in the UK, where the second half is generally hived off as Little Women Wedded, or Good Wives, and often not read at all. The girls work as governesses and lady\u2019s companions; they mend old clothes to make them last; they make their own entertainment: plays, newspapers, books, music. When the first book opens they range in age from 11 or so (Amy) to 16 (Meg), and thus are on the brink of womanhood. This is an unusual choice, as Anne Boyd Rioux pointed out in last year\u2019s incisive Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy: The Story of Little Women and Why It Still Matters, eschewing as it does the calmer, more \u201cinnocent\u201d state of childhood. Little Women, she notes, is full of coded references to the arrival of puberty and the ways in which this arrival is also a curbing: don\u2019t shake hands, take small steps, wear gloves. Meg, excited by dances, beginning to understand the power of her pretty face, tries to conform; Beth, agonisingly shy, stays at home playing the piano; Amy aims to combine feminine power and an ambition to be a great artist; while Jo, already a writer and a confirmed tomboy, struggles to be what her father calls her, \u201c\u2018a little woman\u2019, and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else\u201d. It has never been a secret that Jo is a tidied-up version of Alcott herself, who \u201cnever liked girls or knew many, except my sisters\u201d, and never especially wanted to be or act like one. Rioux\u2019s account brings out the ways in which Alcott\u2019s life was both harder and often more progressive than those of her characters. Alcott and her three sisters were poor, and had to work \u2013 though not because her father was at war but because, as a transcendentalist teacher, he so often put his ideals of self-improvement ahead of anything as prosaic as earning a living. Those ideals, however, included an absolute belief, shared by his wife Abigail \u2013 an outspoken suffrage campaigner and one of America\u2019s first social workers \u2013 in a woman\u2019s right to realise her full potential; in education; and in the iniquity of slavery (the school Jo eventually sets up includes a \u201cquadroon\u201d even though it might lead to \u201cruin\u201d; Alcott\u2019s father did the same, and had to shut down). He was a vegan who believed in maintaining the health of the body as well as the mind (for years his daughter went for a run every day), and he banned his family from using cotton, as it was harvested by slaves. Though they often had to rely on charity from their family, who could not resist ladling a sauce of told-you-sos over their cash (echoed by the fictional irascible Aunt March), they nevertheless sheltered abused women, children with mental health issues and runaway slaves. One sister, Lizzie, died young of a wasting disease, as Beth does in Little Women Wedded; Louisa cared for her, as Jo does for Beth, and was deeply affected. Unlike Jo, however, who marries, Louisa \u2013 who also lost her long hair, but through illness rather than choosing to cut it off \u2013 remained single. Alcott was also radical in deciding to write Little Women in defiantly direct, colloquial language, so full of New England slang that Rioux\u2019s recent edition of the book for Penguin Classics (with a foreword by Patti Smith) required a glossary. The language matched Alcott\u2019s other departure, from the preachiness of contemporary children\u2019s literature to the resolutely ordinary: to talk of darning socks, or cooking lunch. The book was instantly successful; 2,000 copies of the first volume were sold in the first two weeks, and millions more, in about 50 languages, have sold since. For bookish, tomboyish \u2013 or just ambitious \u2013 girls, Jo was an inspiration: writing in a garret first at home and then in New York City (echoing Alcott\u2019s apartment in Boston), in a \u201cfunny little sky parlor \u2026 [with] a stove in it, and a nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like\u201d. Rioux\u2019s lists of women influenced by Jo go on for pages. Jo March was, Ursula K Le Guin once wrote, \u201cclose as a sister \u2026 I don\u2019t know where else I or many others like me, in my generation or my mother\u2019s or my daughter\u2019s, were to find this model, this validation\u201d. Caitlin Moran, who modelled Johanna Morrigan in her novel How to Build a Girl on Jo, once said: \u201cI owe everything I am to Jo March in Little Women and Anne Shirley in Anne of Green Gables.\u201d Alcott yearned to rival the Bront\u00ebs, as well as Emerson and Thoreau, her neighbours in Concord, yet her first efforts to write a serious, ambitious novel were only published after extensive and, she felt, damaging cuts \u2013 an experience echoed in Jo\u2019s story. (Little Women, which she did not especially want to write, was initially read and admired by all sorts of people, male and female, young and old, but as the century turned it was increasingly pushed into the cul-de-sac of \u201cwomen\u2019s writing\u201d.) Alcott \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford to starve on praise\u201d and turned to writing sensationalist stories \u2013 as does Jo in Little Women: \u201cThe Duke\u2019s Daughter paid the butcher\u2019s bill, A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet, and The Curse of the Coventrys proved the blessing of the Marchs in the way of groceries and gowns,\u201d as Jo puts it. Later, however, Jo intuits that Professor Bhaer, a German teacher she has begun to care for, is concerned about how these stories might affect her writing and her soul, and stops working on them altogether. This is a point that has bothered readers so much that many adaptations have taken the scene to mean that Bhaer goes on to run Jo\u2019s career; Gerwig reads the book correctly, and instead shows Jo (played by Saoirse Ronan) in control: writing no more sensations, yes \u2013 but proceeding to discover her true metier and enjoying her successes. Not least because, as the film goes on, the Jo character begins to merge with a portrayal of Alcott. Again and again lines in Gerwig\u2019s film are drawn from Alcott\u2019s own life. In the novel, for instance, Jo is honest about her envy of her youngest sister, but the idea that she gets the \u201ccream\u201d of everything, as Jo says in the film, comes from a comment Alcott made about her own sister, May. In the book, Jo says: \u201cI don\u2019t believe I shall ever marry. I\u2019m happy as I am, and love my liberty too w ell to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man\u201d; in the film she says: \u201cI\u2019d rather be a free spinster and paddle my own canoe\u201d \u2013 which comes from a letter Alcott wrote to a friend after visiting her just-married older sister. So many pithy statements about sexual politics are given to Amy (Florence Pugh) and to Aunt March (Meryl Streep) that the film threatens to become a 21st-century feminist lecture \u2013 until one remembers that they were all subjects about which Alcott herself was vocal. Not that she necessarily got her way: Alcott\u2019s publisher was initially bored by Little Women and changed his mind only when his young daughters got hold of the manuscript and loved it (a similar scene appears in the film). He does not budge, however, in his demand that her female characters end the novel \u201cmarried \u2013 or dead, either way\u201d. All four girls duly marry or die, and many critics have found this a profoundly disappointing outcome. There has always been particular discomfort with Meg\u2019s seeming subjugation, after discussions with her mother, to the sensible, \u201cmasterful\u201d John Brooke, and with the Bhaer figure, whom Alcott supplied in order both to comply with her publisher\u2019s wishes and frustrate the public demand that Jo do the easy, obvious thing and marry her childhood friend Laurie. But Gerwig seems to be trying to explore something less Manichean than personal fulfilment versus subjugation. \u201cI\u2019m sick of people saying love is all a woman\u2019s fit for,\u201d she has Jo say. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of it! But I\u2019m so lonely.\u201d (In the book, it is Marmee who says: \u201cI can\u2019t help seeing that you are very lonely.\u201d) The challenge for Jo, then, as for all her sisters, is to find fulfilment while at the same time taking steps to be less alone. As Rioux writes, the girls navigate \u201ca fundamental conflict for women \u2013 how to love and be loved without losing oneself\u201d. How to have it all, as we would put it now. We may these days, Rioux argues, be surrounded by books containing extraordinary girls \u2013 Lyra, Hermione, Katniss \u2013 but it is striking that they are exceptions, and often alone; groups of girls in, say, the Gossip Girl books are toxic and destructive. Little Women is about \u201ca world of women, of value in and of itself\u201d. It is also, Gerwig has said, \u201cone of the few books about childhood that isn\u2019t about escape. There is bravery, but it\u2019s a hero\u2019s journey contained inside the home.\u201d And one whose male characters are peripheral. In the first volume Jo, furious that Meg is thinking of getting married, thus breaking up the cosy family, rages that \u201cbuds will be roses, and kittens cats \u2013 more\u2019s the pity\u201d. In Gerwig\u2019s film Meg replies to a similar outburst with: \u201cJust because my dreams are different from yours doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not important.\u201d Perhaps the truly radical thing is that Alcott tried to make space and time for all of them. \u2022 Little Women is on general release in the UK from 26 December.",

Sydney FC were on a different planet tonight and, with a clear buffer on top of the ladder, will be very hard to stop in their bid to be champions for a second straight season. Le Fondre\u2019s first A-League hat-trick takes him above Jamie Maclaren on the goal-scoring charts and he can thank the likes of Baumjohann, Ninkovic and Barbarouses for the shiniest of silver service.

      "bodyText": "Not a game, but a shame. Sydney FC were on a different planet tonight and, with a clear buffer on top of the ladder, will be very hard to stop in their bid to be champions for a second straight season. Le Fondre\u2019s first A-League hat-trick takes him above Jamie Maclaren on the goal-scoring charts and he can thank the likes of Baumjohann, Ninkovic and Barbarouses for the shiniest of silver service. A great performance by Sydney FC and a great day of sport. Thanks for your company. See you soon. Brisbane get a consolation goal, a penalty to O\u2019Donovan, after a clear infringement in the box. Not the way Sydney wanted to end the game, but 5-1 it is. Le Fondre gets a hat-trick, his first in the A-League, by heading home a delightful little cross from Buhagiar. My, hasn\u2019t that man had an impact in his few moments on the pitch. This is about right, 5-0. Le Fondre turns provider, picking out Baumjohann with a searching ball on the right and this time it\u2019s Buhagiar who finds himself on the final pass - and the man who\u2019s been on for less than a minute makes no mistake. 85 mins: Buhagiar on for Barbarouses, who positively sprints off the pitch after what happened to Ninkovic. 82 mins: Ryan Teague, Australia\u2019s U17s skipper, replaces Brattan to run on for the first time in an A-League game. Good luck, young man. 81 mins: Barbarouses again and again Young is good enough to keep the deficit to three goals, blocking the full-blooded shot with his outstretched right hand. Good stop. 77 mins: Sydney squander a chance to go 4-0 up with Caceres and Barbarouses each having a good chance to beat the keeper, but Young, who\u2019s had plenty of practice tonight, is equal to the task. At the other end, O\u2019Donovan attempts a bicycle kick. Nice try but nothing doing. 69 mins: Yellow card! Le Fondre\u2019s got a bit to say to the ref, perhaps not happy with how he\u2019s being treated, and whatever he said was enough to draw a yellow. And now it\u2019s time for Sydney\u2019s first change - Ninkovic off for Caceres. The ref is getting rather officious and brandishes a yellow card for Ninkovic, who didn\u2019t depart the field of play quite as quickly, or directly, as the whistleblower would\u2019ve liked. 63 mins: NO GOAL! Le Fondre waltzes into a one-on-one with the keeper and \u2018scores\u2019 his hat-trick, but the flag was up for off-side. Moments later Le Fondre goes down after a coming-together with Aldred, who\u2019s already on a yellow. 59 mins: Another change for Amadi-Holloway on for Wenzel-Halls. So, thankfully, the hyphen equilibrium is restored. That\u2019s Fowler done for the night in terms of substitutions. Amadi-Holloway makes an immediate impact, making the keeper work with a cute little back-heel. 57 mins: Yellow card! Baumjohann again. Yellow card again. This time Brisbane resort to the old hands-over-the-shoulder-and-drag-this-bloke-to-the-turf routine. This time it\u2019s O\u2019Neill whose name goes into the book. 54 mins: Yellow card! Baumjohann does what Baumjohann does, ball on a string and all that, and Aldred has had enough, chopping the playmaker down with cynical intent to rightfully attract a yellow. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken the Roar this long to go the knuckle. 50 mins: Baumjohann, light on those twinkletoes of his, dances around a defender or two but can\u2019t get past another. For a fleeting moment it looked like he might scythe through the lot of them and make it 4-0. But no. Not yet. 46 mins: A double change for Brisbane. Fowler might have liked to make it 11 in, 11 out. But it\u2019s just the two - Bowles on for Gillesphey, and Powell on for Inman. A complete mismatch. Sydney\u2019s ball players are doing as they please - Baumjohann, Ninkovic and Barbarouses are cutting the Roar to ribbons - and Le Fondre is doing the rest. Brisbane have won just one of their past 19 A-League games away from home. It\u2019s about to be one of their past 20. How\u2019s this for a sausage roll? Wow. A stunningly weighted ball from Grant, on the right just inside his own half, finds Barbarouses, who cuts back into the path of Le Fondre and the striker caresses the ball into the top-left corner. Brisbane in disarray, and likely in awe of this vastly superior opponent. 31 mins: The Roar defence is again stretched as Le Fondre picks out Barbarouses but the angle gets away from him and the keeper protects his near post. Here\u2019s Ninkovic\u2019s goal. I think Baumjohann is my new favourite player. Baumjohann to Barbarouses to Ninkovic. Goal. Training ground stuff from a seriously good football team and Brisbane just have no answer to it. Baumjohann shows poise and patience to find Barbarouses, whose cross along the floor finds Ninkovic directly in front and the rest is history. This could get ugly. This is ugly. 23 mins: Neville is afforded some rare space down the right and has a chance to produce a good cross, but the execution just isn\u2019t there. The ball slingshots down the other end and Barbarouses beats his direct opponent but shoots just wide of the right post. 16 mins: A chance for Brisbane with Gillesphey lining up for a free kick just outside the box. Beckham would\u2019ve gobbled it up, but Gillesphey isn\u2019t Beckham. Gillesphey is Gillesphey. The ball flies over the crossbar. Here\u2019s Le Fondre\u2019s goal. The one that counted. 12 mins: NO GOAL! Le Fondre runs at angles and the Roar defence has no idea where he is as Baumjohann releases the striker, who beats the keeper one-on-one to seemingly make it 2-0. But Le Fondre himself looks doubtful and Brisbane get the requisite video assistance. The Sydney FC man was off-side, marginally, but off-side all the same. Still, these are bad signs for the visiting team. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ball from Ninkovic splits the Roar defence wide open and releases Barbarouses, who cuts back from the right and the resultant loose ball is pounced upon by Le Fondre. And Le Fondre rarely needs to be asked twice. First blood to Sydney FC. Did I mention that the ball from Ninkovic was beautiful? 3 mins: Early free kick for Sydney FC, deep in their own half. So no imminent threat, but Robbie Fowler\u2019s brow still looks very furrowed. You see that a lot these days. I much preferred it when he was a player and celebrating goals by rubbing his nose along the boundary line. 1 min: And we\u2019re away. Playing surface looks lovely. How\u2019s this for a stat: Brisbane Roar are yet to score a first-half goal this A-League season. SYDNEY FC (4-2-2-2) - Andrew Redmayne (GK); Rhyan Grant, Ryan McGowan, Alex Wilkinson, Joel King; Luke Brattan, Paulo Retre; Alexander Baumjohann, Milos Ninkovic; Kosta Barbarouses, Adam Le Fondre. BRISBANE ROAR (4-4-2) - Jamie Young (GK); Scott Neville, Tom Aldred, Jordan Courtney-Perkins, Macaulay Gillesphey; Bradden Inman, Aiden O\u2019Neill, Jay O\u2019Shea, Stefan Mauk; Dylan Wenzel-Halls, Roy O\u2019Donovan. Just minutes away from tonight\u2019s A-League game between Sydney FC and Brisbane Roar at Kogarah, which as it happens is just down the road from Chez Heinrich. Anyway, doesn\u2019t seem as smoky today as it has been. But on the teams front, Brandon O\u2019Neill is a big out for Sydney FC after failing to recover from a knock suffered against Western United. Speaking of Markus Babbel, have you seen David Squires\u2019 latest hilarious offering? It\u2019s about the Grosse Deutsche. A third straight win for the Nix, which takes them into the top six on the ladder. More VAR drama, however, with Wellington claiming all three points after a handball in the box that preceded D\u00e1vila\u2019s 89th-minute penalty. Cue controversy, fallout and an even bigger headache for Markus Babbel. In the Australian Open golf tournament, Matt Jones is poised to become a multiple winner of the event after posting a three-under 68 on moving day. Thanks to AAP, here\u2019s a snapshot of the day: PLAYER OF THE DAY: Matt Jones - the 2015 champion and 2017 runner-up continued his affinity with The Australian, where he\u2019s a member, to grab a three-stroke lead with his three-under-par 68 SHOT OF THE DAY: It takes a pretty special shot to finish up a tree but that\u2019s exactly what last year\u2019s runner-up Dimi Papadatos did with his drive on the par-4 12th hole QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cI did see and it was pretty ordinary, to be honest.\u201d Marc Leishman reckons American Patrick Reed deserves all the roasting he gets from fans at next week\u2019s Presidents Cup in Melbourne after being penalised two strokes for illegal play on Saturday at Tiger Woods\u2019 Hero Challenge in the Bahamas TOURNAMENT SUMMARY: Jones is poised to join some of the legends of golf as a multiple Open champion as he heads into the final round three shots clear of American Cameron Tringale and four ahead of Japanese amateur Takumi Kanaya, South African Louis Oosthuizen (70) and Englishman Paul Casey How about the MCG pitch?

      "bodyText": "Passengers are facing travel problems this weekend as engineering works take place during a strike over rail workers\u2019 long-running dispute regarding guards on trains. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union on South Western Railway (SWR) walked out on Saturday for the sixth time since last Monday as part of 27 days of industrial action. Hundreds of guards and a small number of drivers will not clock on for work until Christmas, apart from on election day on 12 December, in a bitter row over the role and responsibilities of onboard train crew. The SWR line is one of the busiest commuter routes in the country, used by about 600,000 passengers daily. Picket lines were again mounted outside stations across the SWR network, disrupting one of the busiest shopping weekends before Christmas. Many services were cancelled or replaced by buses and those that were running were expected to be much busier than normal. The RMT says the dispute is focused on whether guards should have a few seconds to make sure trains leave platforms safely. Andy Mellors, managing director of SWR, said in a letter that further talks must be on the proviso that the union had a new solution on safely delivering at least 10m more peak-time passenger journeys on time each year. An RMT spokesman said: \u201cThe union will continue to push for a negotiated settlement that protects passenger safety and our members remain rock-solid in the ongoing action. \u201cWe are bitterly disappointed that the company are throwing obstacles in the way of a settlement, which is about nothing more than three seconds\u2019 extra time on the dispatch process in the interests of safety.\u201d Engineering work caused a number of line closures, including between Bournemouth and Poole, as well as in the Twickenham area, and between London Waterloo and Kingston. All lines in the Leatherhead area will be closed all day on Sunday for maintenance work. Earlier on Saturday morning, the M25 was partially reopened after a crane overturned and crashed across both sides of the carriageway. The incident took place at junction 27 with the M11 in Essex at about 5.30pm on Friday. Highways England said: \u201cThe clockwise side has been reopened with a lane three closure in place whilst the central reservation is repaired.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This summer was my third without a holiday, spent instead in legal communications with the government. In the summer of 2016, I was doing the same over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\" title=\"\">Theresa May</a>\u2019s decision to trigger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article-50\" title=\"\">Article 50</a> without consulting parliament. In the summer of 2017, it was regarding what then first minister of Wales Carwyn Jones referred to as her \u00a31 billion \u201cbung\u201d to the DUP. And this summer it was over Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to prorogue parliament \u2013 that is shut it down for five weeks and deny elected members of parliament their legal voice over Brexit.</p> <p>My communication with the prime minister started on 11 July, as a warning shot, to say if rumours of his plans to close down parliament were true, this, in my view, was illegal and I would not hesitate to seek clarification from the courts. All through the summer, I received letters from the government, in which they went to great lengths to assure me they would abide by the law. So much so that there was something fishy about it. My legal team and I continued preparing the case.</p> <p>The final letter from the government\u2019s legal department arrived on 27 August at 5pm, promising that I need not go to court because prime minister Johnson would not be proroguing parliament. The next morning the decision to prorogue was announced: we filed the case at 4.30pm that afternoon. Presumably they had hoped their assurances would lull us into a false sense of security and we wouldn\u2019t have time to pull a case together. Whistleblowers said the government had been given advice that our case would fail, that it was not justiciable \u2013 that it would never get to the supreme court as they would be too afraid to touch it.</p> <p>Others were telling me there had been discussions about the possibility of the five-week closure of parliament being extended, had I not got permission to have the case heard, or if we had lost the case. That would have allowed Johnson to push through No Deal.</p> <p>We had three weeks to prepare a supreme court case, with my legal team in different countries, different time zones. To add to the drama, a normal supreme court \u201cterm\u201d starts in October, and we needed the judges back in September to stand a chance of stopping Johnson\u2019s action; but most were also travelling around the globe with various commitments. As required for a verdict, we needed an odd number of judges, and thought the efficient supreme court team would manage five. At no time did we envisage \u2013 as eventually happened \u2013 all 11 back in time to hear our case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88e193475af0105eb57bd2b4f141300eef09bd03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88e193475af0105eb57bd2b4f141300eef09bd03/0_103_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miller outside the Supreme Court after the hearing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miller outside the Supreme Court after the hearing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the day of judgment came and Lady Hale started to read the decision, she stated that it was unanimous; the team looked at each other in dread, thinking we had lost. It wasn\u2019t until she had neared the end of her summary that it slowly dawned on us that we had won. A unanimous judgment was extraordinary: my legal team were extraordinary. Interestingly, in the aftermath of the case, Lady Hale and I were the only ones who received a torrent of abuse. Everyone seemed to have forgotten there were 10 other judges. It was amusing that Lady Hale became famous for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/28/lady-hale-spider-brooch-launches-global-trend\" title=\"\">spider brooch</a> when I had been referred to as the \u201cBlack Widow Spider\u201d in the past. Yet at the same time, here you had the first female president of a UK supreme court and, rather than talk about her expertise, reputation and grace, all the media could fixate on was her brooch.</p> <p>It was also notable that Lady Hale was portrayed as the face of the case. I have spoken to political advisers and commentators who referred to this and asked why they thought it happened. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a woman of colour beating Boris,\u201d was the general reply. There was also a fear of a backlash calling for Johnson to stand down, hence the need to underplay the significance of the case and dismiss the roles of the judges and me. Even the fuss over the brooch smacked of attempts to distract from the implications of the ruling.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s top court confirmed its official live stream attracted more than 29m views over the course of the hearing, beating its previous record of roughly 520,000 views, which was from my first case. More importantly, something seemed to have shifted in the global response. Against a backdrop of courts in many different modern democracies being challenged by autocratic, rightwing politicians, legal professionals around the globe were looking to the UK to set an example in defence of democracy. We have had messages from judges around the world saying the case has steeled their resolve and given them confidence; it demonstrated that the rule of law cannot be bullied or diminished by the rise of dictatorial power-grabbing regimes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As I tried to get into my security car, the\u00a0men reached the car doors yelling: \u2018Cut her filthy tongue out\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On a personal level, the abuse was much worse this time. Most notably the men standing outside the supreme court with a noose, with posters calling me a traitor, who were present throughout the entire case. I had to enter and leave each day through the throng shouting \u201chang her\u201d, \u201csend her back home\u201d. As I quickly tried to get into my security car one day, they broke ranks, reaching the car doors and yelling: \u201cCut her filthy tongue out.\u201d The police should never have allowed them to be there. They said it was freedom of speech, but inciting violence or making threats against me exercising my civil, lawful rights should not have been allowed. You can\u2019t hide behind freedom of speech when violence is being advocated \u2013 and inciting violence is a criminal offence.</p> <p>I do understand my friends and family who say, \u201cEnough, Gina.\u201d But for too long, too many politicians from across the spectrum have got away with weaponising language, with adversarial soundbites that have turned interviews and articles into propaganda rather than fact-based arguments or policy scrutiny. And I cannot stand by while that happens.</p> <p>The path to a more hopeful future will be one step at a time and we need to persuade individuals, corporations and politicians to do their part. Successful societies and cultures evolve against the backdrop of their contemporary issues and I am afraid what that means for politicians is having to speak truth to power. We\u2019re not ever going to go back to the way it was before. Whatever happens, there have to be new conversations, with a new regard for honesty and what we are as a country. What are our faults, our strengths, our opportunities, our sense of identity? Our identity tends to be too closely linked to a past viewed through rose-tinted glasses, rather than the truth of who we are now; and who we\u2019re likely to be in the future.</p> <p>And that leads me back to the deeper, thornier issues at the heart of Brexit. It\u2019s hard to complain about the world we live in when we don\u2019t take an active part in shaping it. We all have a responsibility. That doesn\u2019t have to mean thinking in big thoughts or gestures. It\u2019s as simple as stopping to give your neighbour five minutes if they\u2019re isolated and can\u2019t go out shopping. Speaking to someone from a different part of your community. It\u2019s a lack of empathy towards other ethnic groups and social classes that makes oppression and inequality possible. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Gina Miller\u2019s Rise: Life Lessons in Speaking Out, Standing Tall &amp; Leading the Way is published in paperback by Canongate.

In the summer of 2016, I was doing the same over Theresa May\u2019s decision to trigger Article 50 without consulting parliament. In the summer of 2017, it was regarding what then first minister of Wales Carwyn Jones referred to as her \u00a31 billion \u201cbung\u201d to the DUP. And this summer it was over Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to prorogue parliament \u2013 that is shut it down for five weeks and deny elected members of parliament their legal voice over Brexit. My communication with the prime minister started on 11 July, as a warning shot, to say if rumours of his plans to close down parliament were true, this, in my view, was illegal and I would not hesitate to seek clarification from the courts. All through the summer, I received letters from the government, in which they went to great lengths to assure me they would abide by the law. So much so that there was something fishy about it. My legal team and I continued preparing the case. The final letter from the government\u2019s legal department arrived on 27 August at 5pm, promising that I need not go to court because prime minister Johnson would not be proroguing parliament. The next morning the decision to prorogue was announced: we filed the case at 4.30pm that afternoon. Presumably they had hoped their assurances would lull us into a false sense of security and we wouldn\u2019t have time to pull a case together. Whistleblowers said the government had been given advice that our case would fail, that it was not justiciable \u2013 that it would never get to the supreme court as they would be too afraid to touch it. Others were telling me there had been discussions about the possibility of the five-week closure of parliament being extended, had I not got permission to have the case heard, or if we had lost the case. That would have allowed Johnson to push through No Deal. We had three weeks to prepare a supreme court case, with my legal team in different countries, different time zones. To add to the drama, a normal supreme court \u201cterm\u201d starts in October, and we needed the judges back in September to stand a chance of stopping Johnson\u2019s action; but most were also travelling around the globe with various commitments. As required for a verdict, we needed an odd number of judges, and thought the efficient supreme court team would manage five. At no time did we envisage \u2013 as eventually happened \u2013 all 11 back in time to hear our case. When the day of judgment came and Lady Hale started to read the decision, she stated that it was unanimous; the team looked at each other in dread, thinking we had lost. It wasn\u2019t until she had neared the end of her summary that it slowly dawned on us that we had won. A unanimous judgment was extraordinary: my legal team were extraordinary. Interestingly, in the aftermath of the case, Lady Hale and I were the only ones who received a torrent of abuse. Everyone seemed to have forgotten there were 10 other judges. It was amusing that Lady Hale became famous for her spider brooch when I had been referred to as the \u201cBlack Widow Spider\u201d in the past. Yet at the same time, here you had the first female president of a UK supreme court and, rather than talk about her expertise, reputation and grace, all the media could fixate on was her brooch. It was also notable that Lady Hale was portrayed as the face of the case. I have spoken to political advisers and commentators who referred to this and asked why they thought it happened. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a woman of colour beating Boris,\u201d was the general reply. There was also a fear of a backlash calling for Johnson to stand down, hence the need to underplay the significance of the case and dismiss the roles of the judges and me. Even the fuss over the brooch smacked of attempts to distract from the implications of the ruling. The UK\u2019s top court confirmed its official live stream attracted more than 29m views over the course of the hearing, beating its previous record of roughly 520,000 views, which was from my first case. More importantly, something seemed to have shifted in the global response. Against a backdrop of courts in many different modern democracies being challenged by autocratic, rightwing politicians, legal professionals around the globe were looking to the UK to set an example in defence of democracy. We have had messages from judges around the world saying the case has steeled their resolve and given them confidence; it demonstrated that the rule of law cannot be bullied or diminished by the rise of dictatorial power-grabbing regimes. On a personal level, the abuse was much worse this time. Most notably the men standing outside the supreme court with a noose, with posters calling me a traitor, who were present throughout the entire case. I had to enter and leave each day through the throng shouting \u201chang her\u201d, \u201csend her back home\u201d. As I quickly tried to get into my security car one day, they broke ranks, reaching the car doors and yelling: \u201cCut her filthy tongue out.\u201d The police should never have allowed them to be there. They said it was freedom of speech, but inciting violence or making threats against me exercising my civil, lawful rights should not have been allowed. You can\u2019t hide behind freedom of speech when violence is being advocated \u2013 and inciting violence is a criminal offence. I do understand my friends and family who say, \u201cEnough, Gina.\u201d But for too long, too many politicians from across the spectrum have got away with weaponising language, with adversarial soundbites that have turned interviews and articles into propaganda rather than fact-based arguments or policy scrutiny. And I cannot stand by while that happens. The path to a more hopeful future will be one step at a time and we need to persuade individuals, corporations and politicians to do their part. Successful societies and cultures evolve against the backdrop of their contemporary issues and I am afraid what that means for politicians is having to speak truth to power. We\u2019re not ever going to go back to the way it was before. Whatever happens, there have to be new conversations, with a new regard for honesty and what we are as a country. What are our faults, our strengths, our opportunities, our sense of identity? Our identity tends to be too closely linked to a past viewed through rose-tinted glasses, rather than the truth of who we are now; and who we\u2019re likely to be in the future. And that leads me back to the deeper, thornier issues at the heart of Brexit. It\u2019s hard to complain about the world we live in when we don\u2019t take an active part in shaping it. We all have a responsibility. That doesn\u2019t have to mean thinking in big thoughts or gestures. It\u2019s as simple as stopping to give your neighbour five minutes if they\u2019re isolated and can\u2019t go out shopping. Speaking to someone from a different part of your community. It\u2019s a lack of empathy towards other ethnic groups and social classes that makes oppression and inequality possible. \u2022 Gina Miller\u2019s Rise: Life Lessons in Speaking Out, Standing Tall &amp; Leading the Way is published in paperback by Canongate.

Having risen to stardom via his debut album 2Pacalypse Now and 1993 commercial breakthrough Strictly 4 My NIGGAZ, the Californian rapper was now on trial for possession of illegal weapons and sexual assault after a woman accused him and his entourage of raping her in a New York hotel room 12 months earlier. The jury was almost ready to deliver its verdict, and the planned recording session \u2013 with Brooklyn MC Little Shawn \u2013 promised a brief respite from these legal woes, and to net the rapper a much-needed $7,000.</p> <p>But as Tupac entered the lobby at Quad Studios, three waiting gunmen opened fire. He survived, and accused New York gangsta rap figurehead Christopher \u201cBiggie Smalls\u201d Wallace of setting up the hit. This ignited a conflict between hip-hop\u2019s east and west coast factions that would outlive its key protagonists; Tupac was shot dead in September 1996 and Biggie was killed in a drive-by the following March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/tupac-biggie-deaths\">Both murders remain unsolved</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThey were two of the biggest celebrities of the 90s,\u201d says Joel Anderson, culture journalist and host of the latest season of Slate\u2019s acclaimed podcast Slow Burn, which investigates the lives and deaths of Tupac and Biggie, AKA Notorious BIG. \u201cThey were black. They died so young. And we still don\u2019t have any resolution about what both their careers and their deaths meant.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson is a reporter in search of that closure. Where the first two series of Slow Burn, presented by Leon Neyfakh, explored the respective impeachment trials of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, season three exits the White House to examine what Anderson describes on the show as \u201ca friendship gone bad that turned into a nationwide turf war\u201d. Anderson heard the news of Tupac\u2019s death while driving home from college. \u201cAll the people on the radio were crying,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just this huge outpouring of grief.

A lot of documentaries and books have focused on that aspect, and have all ended up at the same place. We have a rough idea of what happened, but it\u2019s doubtful these murders will ever be solved. The police couldn\u2019t do it. But we won\u2019t run away from discussing what happened there \u2013 and why it wasn\u2019t solved. And we\u2019re gonna talk about how some don\u2019t even believe Tupac is dead in the first place,\u201d he adds, referencing conspiracy theories that the rapper had faked his death (a scenario that inspired one of comic Dave Chappelle\u2019s best sketches).</p> <p>Instead of re-raking the over-familiar \u201cTupac v Biggie\u201d narrative, Anderson approaches his subject from new angles. Just as Slow Burn\u2019s first two series brought to life the fevered eras of Watergate and the Lewinsky scandal, Anderson says the third aims to \u201cexamine and unearth strange subplots and the hidden characters of the story\u201d, focusing on unexplored details and bringing the background to the foreground. At the podcast\u2019s centre is a US still reeling from the 1992 LA riots, and in the grip of moral hysteria over gangsta rap. We meet lawyers who tried to keep defendants accused of killing police officers away from death row by citing the influence of rap, and hear the actor and National Rifle Association (NRA) spokesperson Charlton Heston reciting the lyrics to Ice-T\u2019s Cop Killer in his campaign to get the rapper\u2019s band Body Count kicked off their record label.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think there were Capitol Hill hearings about the music of the Geto Boys and Tupac,\u201d Anderson says, of the era\u2019s febrile mood. \u201cBut gangsta rap was much more explicit about what was going on in the artists\u2019 communities, talking about real violence, real sexism, real police brutality \u2013 things that people did not talk about in that way before. It was jarring. But it\u2019s incredible to listen to the audio of those hearings; they really thought Tupac was gonna encourage a whole generation of cop killers.\u201d</p> <p>The podcast also investigates the issues that gave rise to gangsta rap and the shockwaves it sent. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring the over-policing of minority communities, the discourse over what is or isn\u2019t acceptable for the \u2018public square\u2019, and issues of sexism and misogyny,\u201d he says. \u201cTupac is a guy who went to prison after being convicted of sexual abuse, who raised the stakes of the beef by boasting that he slept with Biggie\u2019s wife Faith Evans [on the 1996 track Hit \u2019Em Up]. The violent sexism in this story is something people really didn\u2019t grapple with at the time; nobody sat down and said: \u2018He\u2019s using a woman as a pawn in a revenge scheme against his enemy. There\u2019s a problem with that.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cf46f90f231abe070ec2fa5717779a8c29a7ba5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cf46f90f231abe070ec2fa5717779a8c29a7ba5/17_0_1091_655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Anderson, presenter of Slow Burn, Podcast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Anderson, presenter of the podcast Slow Burn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anderson\u2019s wide-ranging and restless deep dive turns up vivid details and powerful vignettes. Tupac is cavity-searched by prison guards in front of his attorney, purely to humiliate him. Lest his ears be sullied, a judge wears earplugs as Tupac\u2019s Soulja\u2019s Story is played as evidence during a trial involving the murder of a policeman. Veteran civil-rights activists demand gangsta rappers be censored, and stage the ceremonial destruction of their tapes and CDs.</p> <p>But Slow Burn\u2019s focus on the wider picture never loses sight of its central characters. Anderson describes Tupac as \u201cfearless, to the point of recklessness\u201d, depicting him as mercurial, brilliant and troubled. \u201cHe\u2019s endlessly fascinating. The emotion and pain he put into his music spoke to people. To my interviewees, he was like a whirlwind that changed their lives, no matter how long or brief their relationship,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cMeanwhile, with Biggie, the stories people told about him were about hanging out with him, smoking weed and eating pizza in the neighbourhood where he was born, lived and died. People were awed by Tupac, but they felt so much warmth for Biggie; he touched them deeply.\u201d</p> <p>It is a story that Anderson believes contains lessons for the US and that still resonates two decades on. \u201cI keep thinking of the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still don\u2019t appreciate or protect black lives the way we do others. We\u2019re still grappling with what it means to be black in America, and what\u2019s going on in our communities, and if we\u2019re going to get treated in the same way as everybody else.</p> <p>\u201cLaw enforcement doesn\u2019t necessarily take crime in poor black and brown communities seriously. You can see that in how these murders have gone unsolved. These two famous, talented people that emerged from really poor communities, they were like the best of us,\u201d Anderson adds. \u201cAnd they were gone, just like that [snaps fingers]. We didn\u2019t appreciate them while they were here and now we don\u2019t have any closure.\u201d</p> <p>While Slow Burn never reveals a culprit for the murders, the stories that it tells \u2013 the doomed heroes it portrays, the injustices it illuminates, and how they endure to this day \u2013 bring us closer to understanding this bloody chapter in hip-hop history.</p> <p><em>New episodes of Slow Burn: Biggie and Tupac are available Wednesdays</em></p>",

I didn\u2019t even have a cellphone.\u201d Slow Burn does not play the story as some whodunnit. \u201cIf people think we\u2019re gonna solve it, they\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the show to be some kind of autopsy. A lot of documentaries and books have focused on that aspect, and have all ended up at the same place. We have a rough idea of what happened, but it\u2019s doubtful these murders will ever be solved. The police couldn\u2019t do it. But we won\u2019t run away from discussing what happened there \u2013 and why it wasn\u2019t solved. And we\u2019re gonna talk about how some don\u2019t even believe Tupac is dead in the first place,\u201d he adds, referencing conspiracy theories that the rapper had faked his death (a scenario that inspired one of comic Dave Chappelle\u2019s best sketches). Instead of re-raking the over-familiar \u201cTupac v Biggie\u201d narrative, Anderson approaches his subject from new angles. Just as Slow Burn\u2019s first two series brought to life the fevered eras of Watergate and the Lewinsky scandal, Anderson says the third aims to \u201cexamine and unearth strange subplots and the hidden characters of the story\u201d, focusing on unexplored details and bringing the background to the foreground. At the podcast\u2019s centre is a US still reeling from the 1992 LA riots, and in the grip of moral hysteria over gangsta rap. We meet lawyers who tried to keep defendants accused of killing police officers away from death row by citing the influence of rap, and hear the actor and National Rifle Association (NRA) spokesperson Charlton Heston reciting the lyrics to Ice-T\u2019s Cop Killer in his campaign to get the rapper\u2019s band Body Count kicked off their record label. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think there were Capitol Hill hearings about the music of the Geto Boys and Tupac,\u201d Anderson says, of the era\u2019s febrile mood. \u201cBut gangsta rap was much more explicit about what was going on in the artists\u2019 communities, talking about real violence, real sexism, real police brutality \u2013 things that people did not talk about in that way before. It was jarring. But it\u2019s incredible to listen to the audio of those hearings; they really thought Tupac was gonna encourage a whole generation of cop killers.\u201d The podcast also investigates the issues that gave rise to gangsta rap and the shockwaves it sent. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring the over-policing of minority communities, the discourse over what is or isn\u2019t acceptable for the \u2018public square\u2019, and issues of sexism and misogyny,\u201d he says. \u201cTupac is a guy who went to prison after being convicted of sexual abuse, who raised the stakes of the beef by boasting that he slept with Biggie\u2019s wife Faith Evans [on the 1996 track Hit \u2019Em Up]. The violent sexism in this story is something people really didn\u2019t grapple with at the time; nobody sat down and said: \u2018He\u2019s using a woman as a pawn in a revenge scheme against his enemy. There\u2019s a problem with that.\u2019\u201d Anderson\u2019s wide-ranging and restless deep dive turns up vivid details and powerful vignettes. Tupac is cavity-searched by prison guards in front of his attorney, purely to humiliate him. Lest his ears be sullied, a judge wears earplugs as Tupac\u2019s Soulja\u2019s Story is played as evidence during a trial involving the murder of a policeman. Veteran civil-rights activists demand gangsta rappers be censored, and stage the ceremonial destruction of their tapes and CDs. But Slow Burn\u2019s focus on the wider picture never loses sight of its central characters. Anderson describes Tupac as \u201cfearless, to the point of recklessness\u201d, depicting him as mercurial, brilliant and troubled. \u201cHe\u2019s endlessly fascinating. The emotion and pain he put into his music spoke to people. To my interviewees, he was like a whirlwind that changed their lives, no matter how long or brief their relationship,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cMeanwhile, with Biggie, the stories people told about him were about hanging out with him, smoking weed and eating pizza in the neighbourhood where he was born, lived and died. People were awed by Tupac, but they felt so much warmth for Biggie; he touched them deeply.\u201d It is a story that Anderson believes contains lessons for the US and that still resonates two decades on. \u201cI keep thinking of the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still don\u2019t appreciate or protect black lives the way we do others. We\u2019re still grappling with what it means to be black in America, and what\u2019s going on in our communities, and if we\u2019re going to get treated in the same way as everybody else. \u201cLaw enforcement doesn\u2019t necessarily take crime in poor black and brown communities seriously. You can see that in how these murders have gone unsolved. These two famous, talented people that emerged from really poor communities, they were like the best of us,\u201d Anderson adds. \u201cAnd they were gone, just like that [snaps fingers]. We didn\u2019t appreciate them while they were here and now we don\u2019t have any closure.\u201d While Slow Burn never reveals a culprit for the murders, the stories that it tells \u2013 the doomed heroes it portrays, the injustices it illuminates, and how they endure to this day \u2013 bring us closer to understanding this bloody chapter in hip-hop history.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ll never forget the day my parents told me that they were getting divorced. It was the late 90s, I was 11, and I had returned from school clutching an oil pastel copy of Picasso\u2019s Woman In A Hat (Olga), 1935, which I had made in art class for reasons now lost to the mists of time. I was excited to show it to them. Instead, they told me I should sit down, and that their marriage was ending. It didn\u2019t seem appropriate to show off my picture after that.</p> <p>Seven years later, I saw the painting in real life at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, learning, in a twist of synchronicity, that Picasso had painted this sad, unflattering portrait of his first wife shortly after their marriage had collapsed. Olga left Picasso, and my mother left my father, though it was Dad who moved out of the family home. It broke my heart.</p> <p>It\u2019s now 50 years since the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1969/55/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Divorce Reform Act 1969</a> was drafted. The legislation meant that, for the first time, couples could divorce without one necessarily having to prove the fault of the other (they still needed evidence of adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion, or separation for two years \u2013 or five years if one party did not consent to the divorce). It liberalised the process, making divorce available to ordinary couples, and giving them the option of a less adversarial legal process.</p> <p>The legislation transformed society, changed attitudes, emancipated women, and arguably saved many children from the emotional damage of being raised in miserable homes. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/divorce/bulletins/divorcesinenglandandwales/2017\" title=\"\">an estimated 42% of all marriages</a> in England and Wales currently end in divorce; and in 2017, 62% of divorces of opposite sex couples were on the petition of the wife.</p> <p>Divorce is now so common that its impact on children and their emotional wellbeing can sometimes be downplayed. Yet almost every child of divorce I have spoken to acknowledges that it has shaped the way they see the world. It feels almost childish to speak of the emotional legacy of my own parents\u2019 divorce, how it left its mark on me in a hundred perceptible and imperceptible ways; after all, it was so many years ago. Yet however well you do it, divorce determines who we become as adults.</p> <p>I set out to meet people whose parents divorced in each decade following the 1969 act, to try to understand more about how it has affected their lives. How has it shaped their attitudes to relationships and marriage? And do they wish their parents had done anything differently?</p> <p>***</p> <p>By the time my parents divorced, in 2001, almost all my school friends were living in single-parent households, so I didn\u2019t feel unusual. Chris Marsh, however, was the only child of divorce in his Church of England school in 1972. The 1970s might now be associated with sexual liberation, but at the start of the decade Britain remained a conservative society where divorce was stigmatised and rare. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/divorce/bulletins/divorcesinenglandandwales/2017\" title=\"\">In 1971, 74,437 couples divorced</a> in England and Wales. By 1979, the number of divorces had almost doubled, to 138,706.</p> <p>Marsh is 57, and when we meet in a cafe near his London home, he tells me that, following a nervous breakdown five years ago, he is now disabled and unable to work. \u201cI have some days where I can\u2019t leave the house,\u201d he says. A tall, gentle man with kind eyes, he talks rapidly in a cockney accent not unlike Michael Caine\u2019s.</p> <p>Marsh was 11 when his parents divorced in 1972. His father was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/02/lord-marsh-obituary\" title=\"\">Richard Marsh</a>, then an MP and later chairman of British Rail. \u201cThe divorce was splashed across the front pages of the local newspapers and covered extensively in the national press,\u201d he says. His father had left his mother for a BBC researcher. One day he arrived in the school playground and everyone knew. \u201cA group of kids surrounded me, like I\u2019m a human maypole. Dancing around it going: \u2018Your daddy\u2019s left your mummy.\u2019\u201d He repeats the taunt in the singsong voice beloved of school bullies everywhere. \u201cI was overwhelmed,\u201d Marsh says. \u201cI can remember their voices clearly. It was the most traumatic experience I\u2019ve had.\u201d Sent home from school, he sat in a park, and never mentioned the bullying to his already distraught mother. \u201cI learned then that this had broken social taboos \u2013 that this was something bad.\u201d</p> <p>Marsh says the experience has left him with an intense fear of being judged, which has affected his whole life, including the way he dealt with his sexuality. \u201cI\u2019d already learned that you don\u2019t break social taboos,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to conform. I didn\u2019t come out until I was 32.\u201d Marsh has had one long-term relationship, but says he finds gay marriage at odds with the idea of gay liberation. \u201c[Divorce] taught me that nothing lasts for ever.\u201d</p> <p>He is scathing about the way cultural attitudes at the time were shaped by the church. \u201cI\u2019m not just an atheist \u2013 I believe religion is dangerous. It sets morals that people can\u2019t live up to,\u201d he says. His early trauma was compounded by others: his father\u2019s second wife, Caroline Dutton, died in a car crash in 1975, followed by his mother. His father contemplated suicide. There was so much unexpressed pain. But there was no counselling in the 1970s, he reminds me; to his father, that would have been weakness. They never really spoke about the divorce.</p> <p>What, I ask him, would you say to a child whose parents are getting divorced today? \u201cTalk to people. There\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling confused, upset and angry.\u201d I reflect that I should probably have had counselling, too, but at least I was able to have open conversations with my parents. \u201cWe lost our families,\u201d Marsh says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, the most important anchor you\u2019ve got is your family.\u201d</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27004c40f0b6ed26c3542abec198bbea0047be45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27004c40f0b6ed26c3542abec198bbea0047be45/347_1031_3796_4744/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rachael Stevenson\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachael Stevenson describes her childhood as idyllic; but when her parents separated, she was abruptly taken out of boarding school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rachael Stevenson\u2019s parents divorced over a decade later, in 1987, when she was 11. The 1980s was the decade that produced the most unsuccessful marriages: of the 344,334 couples who tied the knot in 1983, 43% subsequently divorced, a higher rate than today. There was conservative panic about \u201cfamily values\u201d, with Margaret Thatcher telling her private secretary: \u201cChildren need security and must be brought up in a stable, loving environment in which parents offer time, affection and guidance. These things are most likely when the parents are married \u2013 and stay married.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson is 44 now, and lives in Manchester with her second husband. They have five children \u2013 three from Stevenson\u2019s first marriage, one from her husband\u2019s first marriage, and one together. Stevenson describes her childhood as idyllic; but when her parents separated, she was abruptly taken out of boarding school, and her world shifted. \u201cSuddenly we were up until midnight dealing with distressing situations,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A cookery teacher asked why I had no ingredients. I said, 'My mum's left and we are in a B&B.'

Her mother, meanwhile, moved in with her new partner and became pregnant shortly afterwards. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have counselling. We didn\u2019t have anybody ask us how we were,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cWe stopped talking about my mum at home. When we had the new house we had no pictures of her up \u2013 we didn\u2019t really say the word \u2018mum\u2019 at all. It was like we hadn\u2019t had the life we\u2019d had.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that was big to me was that people would assume you had a mum, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d she continues. Once, a teacher put her on the spot in cookery class by asking her why she hadn\u2019t brought any ingredients. \u201cI just ended up saying, \u2018My mum has left, and we are living in a bed and breakfast in Southport.\u2019 That shut her up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"491580c6221508828ed5c251307c2e5c4a06625c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/491580c6221508828ed5c251307c2e5c4a06625c/174_429_4476_2685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachael Stevenson and her brother and sister stayed with their father (all pictured) when her parents split in 1987\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachael Stevenson and her brother and sister stayed with their father (all pictured) when her parents split in 1987.

She became pregnant when she was just 18, by a US serviceman, and they married shortly afterwards. She didn\u2019t take up her university place and went on to have three children with him, divorcing at 29. \u201cI was very insecure about whether or not he loved me, or if he was interested in other people. I was very jealous and had a lot of mood swings, which I didn\u2019t realise at the time weren\u2019t normal.\u201d</p> <p>When she divorced her first husband, Stevenson was careful not to speak ill of him in front of the children. She met her second husband through Reverse Rett, the charity she set up for research into Rett Syndrome, a severe disability that affects both their daughters. She has been working on her anxiety about self-esteem and abandonment in therapy.</p> <p>She says her parents\u2019 abrupt divorce has shaped her own parenting style. \u201cI am absolutely desperate for them never to feel abandoned. I can\u2019t stand the thought of being late to pick them up from school,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving my own children made me realise that parents are just people who have children. They don\u2019t get everything right. My mum loved us, even though things panned out the way they did.\u201d She adds that her father \u201chas always been there for us\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you are splitting up with somebody, your attitude towards them shapes who you are and who your children become,\u201d Stevenson says. Things were hard for her father, she says, trying to bring up three broken children on his own, but he never spoke badly of their mother. \u201cI do feel as if there\u2019s a statute of limitations for blaming your parents. But divorce changes your life, your outlook, your ability to love and be in relationships.\u201d</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30829f3c5cb3735f3580b7036a09d6c453cc5f90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30829f3c5cb3735f3580b7036a09d6c453cc5f90/162_621_3575_4467/800.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Cottle was six when her parents divorced in 1995.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Cottle was six when her parents divorced in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Emma Cottle, 30, from Exeter, was six when her parents divorced, in 1995. She and her brother were part of a custody battle that resulted in her splitting her time between her mother and father\u2019s homes: \u201c[I had] Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays with my mum, Wednesdays with my dad and then we alternated weekends. I wanted to spend more time with my dad, so I asked to have Thursdays with him, too.\u201d It helped that Cottle\u2019s parents lived in the same village. \u201cThey were both mindful of not creating a big drama, and they wanted me and my brother to feel safe and secure,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My parents have been so much happier apart, just living their own lives, and it's made me independent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cottle didn\u2019t learn the reasons for the breakdown of the marriage until she was 17. Her eventual heart-to-heart with her father was, she says, \u201ccathartic\u201d. \u201cUp to that point I\u2019d never spoken to him about it. I hadn\u2019t wanted to open up old wounds.\u201d Cottle, who is single, is philosophical about the divorce. \u201cThe thought of my parents being together and miserable is heartbreaking,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so much happier apart, just living their own lives, and I think it has \u2013 maybe too much \u2013 taught me how to be independent.

Last summer, her mother died of cancer, and she says it was a great comfort that her father was a huge help. \u201cHe has been amazing. When she arrived at the hospice, he wheeled her around the gardens to see the flowers, and made sure she was settled in. After that, she was too poorly to go outside, so I will always be grateful to him for that.\u201d</p> <p>He sounds like a very emotionally intelligent man, I say, and she agrees. This seems an important cultural shift. As the decades since the divorce act have passed, we have become more comfortable discussing our feelings; more open to families in all their incarnations.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the mid-1990s, the Family Law Bill proposed the removal of all remnants of matrimonial fault from legislation in England and Wales, but became mired in dispute. Baroness Young argued that \u201cby removing [fault], the state is actively discouraging any concept of lifelong commitment in marriage, to standards of behaviour, to self-sacrifice, to any thought for members of the family\u201d. In the end, this portion of the bill was never enacted. Had it been, I have no doubt that many people\u2019s divorces would have been far less conflict-ridden.</p> <p>By the start of the new millennium, children were considered people in their own right, whose wishes and needs began to take on more importance. Attitudes to relationships were liberalising, and sociologists argued that divorce causes relatively few children enduring problems. Other factors, such as poor parental mental health, financial hardship, repeated disruption and high levels of conflict during separation were recognised as having a more significant impact on a child\u2019s wellbeing.</p> <p>Bethan Tolley, 25, from the West Midlands, was eight when her parents divorced in 2002. \u201cI\u2019ve got to give it to them \u2013 they painted the picture really well,\u201d she says of the moment she learned they were splitting up. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re going to have two Christmases, you\u2019re going to have two birthdays.\u2019 I loved the idea of having two bedrooms.\u201d</p> <p>Tolley\u2019s parents stayed on good terms. When her mother started dating women, eventually marrying her stepmum, dealing with the homophobia was more difficult than anything to do with the divorce. Her father has remarried, too, meaning that Tolley now has two stepmums. Both sets of grandparents were also a big presence in her childhood.</p> <p>Having so many supportive adults around must have helped, I say. \u201cLife is more full because of all the people in it,\u201d Tolley agrees. Being a child of divorce hasn\u2019t put her off marriage, and she is now engaged. \u201cIf anything, my parents\u2019 divorce made me even more serious about marriage,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the structure and the stability I have always wanted. I love the idea of that person you spend the rest of your life with, and having a family.\u201d Though she hopes she would never divorce, she is glad the option is there. \u201cThere is no point wasting each other\u2019s lives and time,\u201d she says. \u201cI think sometimes the arguing can have a much worse impact than just biting the bullet and moving on.\u201d</p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09a23cd27d99eb3cef3e0bbcfd352f2a589b45de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09a23cd27d99eb3cef3e0bbcfd352f2a589b45de/0_277_3272_4087/801.jpg\" alt=\"Maz Halima\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maz Halima: \u2018I haven\u2019t seen a healthy version of marriage, so I\u2019m not in a rush to do it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maz Halima is a 30-year-old writer and charity worker from Croydon. When her parents divorced, in 2002, she was 14 and very relieved. Halima remembers the environment at home was toxic, with lots of arguments. Her mother came to the UK from Pakistan as a young child, and her father when he was 27. They had been divorced from one another once before, in the 1980s, before Halima was born. It was, she says, a \u201ccan\u2019t live with each other, can\u2019t live without each other\u201d relationship, and when it ended her mother entered a downward spiral that included alcohol abuse.</p> <p>The divorce, Halima says, has affected her approach to relationships. \u201cI\u2019ve unfortunately become the person who feels more worthy in a relationship that has drama, because I see drama as meaning that the other person cares.\u201d She came close to marriage once, before ending the relationship. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a healthy version of marriage, so I\u2019m not in a rush to go and do it. I\u2019m scared of ownership. I also want to do what I want, when I want, and I think it\u2019s hard to find someone who is OK with that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d541cbe33173642a9de6d53d01b8f63fb4568d22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d541cbe33173642a9de6d53d01b8f63fb4568d22/209_725_3613_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Halima with her mother, father and older sister in 1992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Halima with her mother, father and older sister in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Maz Halima</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Choosing her words carefully, she says that the way in which marriage can be perceived within Pakistani culture, and the way her father responded to her mother ending the relationship, has shaped her feminist politics. \u201cYou \u2018buy\u2019 a woman in a sense.

Gay marriage has been legalised, and blended, non-traditional families are increasingly the norm. Even Prince Harry married a divorcee. In April, the government announced fresh plans to introduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/apr/09/no-fault-divorce-lawyers-england-wales\" title=\"\">no-fault divorce</a> \u2013 though it is hard to know if and when this will happen. The reforms will include a minimum timeframe of six months from petition stage to a marriage being ended, designed to allow couples to reflect on their decision. They will also prevent people from refusing a divorce if their spouse wants one.</p> <p>Matthew Betts\u2019 parents divorced in 2013. He is now 30, and grew up in Derby. He is disarmingly open about his family background, but his story demonstrates that progress doesn\u2019t always move in a straight line. Betts\u2019 mother didn\u2019t tell him, or other family and friends, until three months after the marriage ended. Before that, his father would come home and give the impression he was living in the marital home whenever their sons were visiting. Until his mother broke down and told him what had happened, he had never seen her cry. \u201cMy mum was a bearer of stigma. She thought it was a failure. She was concerned about us having a fractured home. It was because she made a vow, for better or worse\u2026 while my dad had reached the point where it was untenable.\u201d</p> <p>Betts describes his upbringing as \u201cutterly heteronormative \u2013 a mum who was a cook and a cleaner, and a dad who was the worker. I felt a considerable amount of guilt that they stayed together for the sake of me and my brothers, and the archaic notion of a \u2018traditional home\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9298f6a325352506a6a42043515a2fd6647427ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9298f6a325352506a6a42043515a2fd6647427ad/0_184_2987_2987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Betts with his mother\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Betts with his mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Matthew Betts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After deciding to retrain as a doctor, Betts moved back in with his mother, and was there while she was treated for depression. He also became closer to his two brothers. \u201cIt was like the skies cleared after a tempest,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Divorce can do that, I think, prompting conversations that would otherwise have been repressed. You cry in front of each other. People shout. You come to see your parents as flawed humans, rather than authority figures. If you\u2019re lucky, a distance can sometimes be breached.</p> <p>Betts says he went through a phase where he was anti-monogamy, but is now in a relationship. \u201cIt works for many, many people \u2013 you\u2019ve just got to communicate,\u201d he says. I ask Betts if he thinks people of our generation will handle divorce better. He frames his response like the doctor he is training to be: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what the epidemiology is in 20 years\u2019 time, when it\u2019s us who are negotiating these things. I really hope so.\u201d</p> <p>That day when I came home clutching my Picasso changed everything. But I recognise now that my parents\u2019 long-term wellbeing, and therefore my own, was dependent on their marriage not continuing. What it all comes down to, ultimately, is language \u2013 the way we explain to a child what is happening, or the way we describe a partner in front of them. It\u2019s about finding the words, but also knowing when to say nothing. In trying to make sense of the knot of complex feelings we have around divorce, we\u2019re all still learning the language. </p> <h2>It\u2019s the end of the world as they know it: how to help children cope with divorce</h2> <p>\u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t bad-mouth each other and don\u2019t try to make the children take sides, or even worse, alienate a child from a parent.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll never forget the day my parents told me that they were getting divorced. It was the late 90s, I was 11, and I had returned from school clutching an oil pastel copy of Picasso\u2019s Woman In A Hat (Olga), 1935, which I had made in art class for reasons now lost to the mists of time. I was excited to show it to them. Instead, they told me I should sit down, and that their marriage was ending. It didn\u2019t seem appropriate to show off my picture after that. Seven years later, I saw the painting in real life at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, learning, in a twist of synchronicity, that Picasso had painted this sad, unflattering portrait of his first wife shortly after their marriage had collapsed. Olga left Picasso, and my mother left my father, though it was Dad who moved out of the family home. It broke my heart. It\u2019s now 50 years since the Divorce Reform Act 1969 was drafted. The legislation meant that, for the first time, couples could divorce without one necessarily having to prove the fault of the other (they still needed evidence of adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion, or separation for two years \u2013 or five years if one party did not consent to the divorce). It liberalised the process, making divorce available to ordinary couples, and giving them the option of a less adversarial legal process. The legislation transformed society, changed attitudes, emancipated women, and arguably saved many children from the emotional damage of being raised in miserable homes. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, an estimated 42% of all marriages in England and Wales currently end in divorce; and in 2017, 62% of divorces of opposite sex couples were on the petition of the wife. Divorce is now so common that its impact on children and their emotional wellbeing can sometimes be downplayed. Yet almost every child of divorce I have spoken to acknowledges that it has shaped the way they see the world. It feels almost childish to speak of the emotional legacy of my own parents\u2019 divorce, how it left its mark on me in a hundred perceptible and imperceptible ways; after all, it was so many years ago. Yet however well you do it, divorce determines who we become as adults. I set out to meet people whose parents divorced in each decade following the 1969 act, to try to understand more about how it has affected their lives. How has it shaped their attitudes to relationships and marriage? And do they wish their parents had done anything differently? *** By the time my parents divorced, in 2001, almost all my school friends were living in single-parent households, so I didn\u2019t feel unusual. Chris Marsh, however, was the only child of divorce in his Church of England school in 1972. The 1970s might now be associated with sexual liberation, but at the start of the decade Britain remained a conservative society where divorce was stigmatised and rare. In 1971, 74,437 couples divorced in England and Wales. By 1979, the number of divorces had almost doubled, to 138,706. Marsh is 57, and when we meet in a cafe near his London home, he tells me that, following a nervous breakdown five years ago, he is now disabled and unable to work. \u201cI have some days where I can\u2019t leave the house,\u201d he says. A tall, gentle man with kind eyes, he talks rapidly in a cockney accent not unlike Michael Caine\u2019s. Marsh was 11 when his parents divorced in 1972. His father was Richard Marsh, then an MP and later chairman of British Rail. \u201cThe divorce was splashed across the front pages of the local newspapers and covered extensively in the national press,\u201d he says. His father had left his mother for a BBC researcher. One day he arrived in the school playground and everyone knew. \u201cA group of kids surrounded me, like I\u2019m a human maypole. Dancing around it going: \u2018Your daddy\u2019s left your mummy.\u2019\u201d He repeats the taunt in the singsong voice beloved of school bullies everywhere. \u201cI was overwhelmed,\u201d Marsh says. \u201cI can remember their voices clearly. It was the most traumatic experience I\u2019ve had.\u201d Sent home from school, he sat in a park, and never mentioned the bullying to his already distraught mother. \u201cI learned then that this had broken social taboos \u2013 that this was something bad.\u201d Marsh says the experience has left him with an intense fear of being judged, which has affected his whole life, including the way he dealt with his sexuality. \u201cI\u2019d already learned that you don\u2019t break social taboos,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to conform. I didn\u2019t come out until I was 32.\u201d Marsh has had one long-term relationship, but says he finds gay marriage at odds with the idea of gay liberation. \u201c[Divorce] taught me that nothing lasts for ever.\u201d He is scathing about the way cultural attitudes at the time were shaped by the church. \u201cI\u2019m not just an atheist \u2013 I believe religion is dangerous. It sets morals that people can\u2019t live up to,\u201d he says. His early trauma was compounded by others: his father\u2019s second wife, Caroline Dutton, died in a car crash in 1975, followed by his mother. His father contemplated suicide. There was so much unexpressed pain. But there was no counselling in the 1970s, he reminds me; to his father, that would have been weakness. They never really spoke about the divorce. What, I ask him, would you say to a child whose parents are getting divorced today? \u201cTalk to people. There\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling confused, upset and angry.\u201d I reflect that I should probably have had counselling, too, but at least I was able to have open conversations with my parents. \u201cWe lost our families,\u201d Marsh says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, the most important anchor you\u2019ve got is your family.\u201d *** Rachael Stevenson\u2019s parents divorced over a decade later, in 1987, when she was 11. The 1980s was the decade that produced the most unsuccessful marriages: of the 344,334 couples who tied the knot in 1983, 43% subsequently divorced, a higher rate than today. There was conservative panic about \u201cfamily values\u201d, with Margaret Thatcher telling her private secretary: \u201cChildren need security and must be brought up in a stable, loving environment in which parents offer time, affection and guidance. These things are most likely when the parents are married \u2013 and stay married.\u201d Stevenson is 44 now, and lives in Manchester with her second husband. They have five children \u2013 three from Stevenson\u2019s first marriage, one from her husband\u2019s first marriage, and one together. Stevenson describes her childhood as idyllic; but when her parents separated, she was abruptly taken out of boarding school, and her world shifted. \u201cSuddenly we were up until midnight dealing with distressing situations,\u201d she says. Stevenson, her brother and their father stayed with relatives and in temporary accommodation (her sister remained at school). Her mother, meanwhile, moved in with her new partner and became pregnant shortly afterwards. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have counselling. We didn\u2019t have anybody ask us how we were,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cWe stopped talking about my mum at home. When we had the new house we had no pictures of her up \u2013 we didn\u2019t really say the word \u2018mum\u2019 at all. It was like we hadn\u2019t had the life we\u2019d had. \u201cThe thing that was big to me was that people would assume you had a mum, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d she continues. Once, a teacher put her on the spot in cookery class by asking her why she hadn\u2019t brought any ingredients. \u201cI just ended up saying, \u2018My mum has left, and we are living in a bed and breakfast in Southport.\u2019 That shut her up.\u201d Stevenson says the divorce affected her approach to relationships. \u201cIn my early teens I became desperate for love and connection, which I frequently mistook for sex,\u201d she says. She became pregnant when she was just 18, by a US serviceman, and they married shortly afterwards. She didn\u2019t take up her university place and went on to have three children with him, divorcing at 29. \u201cI was very insecure about whether or not he loved me, or if he was interested in other people. I was very jealous and had a lot of mood swings, which I didn\u2019t realise at the time weren\u2019t normal.\u201d When she divorced her first husband, Stevenson was careful not to speak ill of him in front of the children. She met her second husband through Reverse Rett, the charity she set up for research into Rett Syndrome, a severe disability that affects both their daughters. She has been working on her anxiety about self-esteem and abandonment in therapy. She says her parents\u2019 abrupt divorce has shaped her own parenting style. \u201cI am absolutely desperate for them never to feel abandoned. I can\u2019t stand the thought of being late to pick them up from school,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving my own children made me realise that parents are just people who have children. They don\u2019t get everything right. My mum loved us, even though things panned out the way they did.\u201d She adds that her father \u201chas always been there for us\u201d. \u201cWhen you are splitting up with somebody, your attitude towards them shapes who you are and who your children become,\u201d Stevenson says. Things were hard for her father, she says, trying to bring up three broken children on his own, but he never spoke badly of their mother. \u201cI do feel as if there\u2019s a statute of limitations for blaming your parents. But divorce changes your life, your outlook, your ability to love and be in relationships.\u201d *** Emma Cottle, 30, from Exeter, was six when her parents divorced, in 1995. She and her brother were part of a custody battle that resulted in her splitting her time between her mother and father\u2019s homes: \u201c[I had] Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays with my mum, Wednesdays with my dad and then we alternated weekends. I wanted to spend more time with my dad, so I asked to have Thursdays with him, too.\u201d It helped that Cottle\u2019s parents lived in the same village. \u201cThey were both mindful of not creating a big drama, and they wanted me and my brother to feel safe and secure,\u201d she says. Cottle didn\u2019t learn the reasons for the breakdown of the marriage until she was 17. Her eventual heart-to-heart with her father was, she says, \u201ccathartic\u201d. \u201cUp to that point I\u2019d never spoken to him about it. I hadn\u2019t wanted to open up old wounds.\u201d Cottle, who is single, is philosophical about the divorce. \u201cThe thought of my parents being together and miserable is heartbreaking,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so much happier apart, just living their own lives, and I think it has \u2013 maybe too much \u2013 taught me how to be independent. I don\u2019t look to find meaning in a partner.\u201d Her parents remained civil, attending Cottle\u2019s graduation ceremony together. Last summer, her mother died of cancer, and she says it was a great comfort that her father was a huge help. \u201cHe has been amazing. When she arrived at the hospice, he wheeled her around the gardens to see the flowers, and made sure she was settled in. After that, she was too poorly to go outside, so I will always be grateful to him for that.\u201d He sounds like a very emotionally intelligent man, I say, and she agrees. This seems an important cultural shift. As the decades since the divorce act have passed, we have become more comfortable discussing our feelings; more open to families in all their incarnations. *** In the mid-1990s, the Family Law Bill proposed the removal of all remnants of matrimonial fault from legislation in England and Wales, but became mired in dispute. Baroness Young argued that \u201cby removing [fault], the state is actively discouraging any concept of lifelong commitment in marriage, to standards of behaviour, to self-sacrifice, to any thought for members of the family\u201d. In the end, this portion of the bill was never enacted. Had it been, I have no doubt that many people\u2019s divorces would have been far less conflict-ridden. By the start of the new millennium, children were considered people in their own right, whose wishes and needs began to take on more importance. Attitudes to relationships were liberalising, and sociologists argued that divorce causes relatively few children enduring problems. Other factors, such as poor parental mental health, financial hardship, repeated disruption and high levels of conflict during separation were recognised as having a more significant impact on a child\u2019s wellbeing. Bethan Tolley, 25, from the West Midlands, was eight when her parents divorced in 2002. \u201cI\u2019ve got to give it to them \u2013 they painted the picture really well,\u201d she says of the moment she learned they were splitting up. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re going to have two Christmases, you\u2019re going to have two birthdays.\u2019 I loved the idea of having two bedrooms.\u201d Tolley\u2019s parents stayed on good terms. When her mother started dating women, eventually marrying her stepmum, dealing with the homophobia was more difficult than anything to do with the divorce. Her father has remarried, too, meaning that Tolley now has two stepmums. Both sets of grandparents were also a big presence in her childhood. Having so many supportive adults around must have helped, I say. \u201cLife is more full because of all the people in it,\u201d Tolley agrees. Being a child of divorce hasn\u2019t put her off marriage, and she is now engaged. \u201cIf anything, my parents\u2019 divorce made me even more serious about marriage,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the structure and the stability I have always wanted. I love the idea of that person you spend the rest of your life with, and having a family.\u201d Though she hopes she would never divorce, she is glad the option is there. \u201cThere is no point wasting each other\u2019s lives and time,\u201d she says. \u201cI think sometimes the arguing can have a much worse impact than just biting the bullet and moving on.\u201d *** Maz Halima is a 30-year-old writer and charity worker from Croydon. When her parents divorced, in 2002, she was 14 and very relieved. Halima remembers the environment at home was toxic, with lots of arguments. Her mother came to the UK from Pakistan as a young child, and her father when he was 27. They had been divorced from one another once before, in the 1980s, before Halima was born. It was, she says, a \u201ccan\u2019t live with each other, can\u2019t live without each other\u201d relationship, and when it ended her mother entered a downward spiral that included alcohol abuse. The divorce, Halima says, has affected her approach to relationships. \u201cI\u2019ve unfortunately become the person who feels more worthy in a relationship that has drama, because I see drama as meaning that the other person cares.\u201d She came close to marriage once, before ending the relationship. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a healthy version of marriage, so I\u2019m not in a rush to go and do it. I\u2019m scared of ownership. I also want to do what I want, when I want, and I think it\u2019s hard to find someone who is OK with that.\u201d Choosing her words carefully, she says that the way in which marriage can be perceived within Pakistani culture, and the way her father responded to her mother ending the relationship, has shaped her feminist politics. \u201cYou \u2018buy\u2019 a woman in a sense. So the fact that they got divorced and my mum said, I\u2019m done \u2013 I think that was kind of outrageous to him.\u201d Despite this, their relationship improved after they separated. \u201cThe whole of their marriage, they were never friends. They were only friends after they got divorced,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen my dad\u2019s been ill, my mum\u2019s cooked for him, she\u2019s cleaned his house. I\u2019ll go there and she\u2019ll just be there having a cup of tea. But then they argued last week.\u201d She smiles as if to say: that\u2019s the way it goes. \u201cI am trying to unlearn it, but I romanticise the instability I experienced. Your parents are the first example of love that you\u2019re shown.\u201d *** As we near the end of the 2010s, there has been significant progress in attitudes towards divorce. Gay marriage has been legalised, and blended, non-traditional families are increasingly the norm. Even Prince Harry married a divorcee. In April, the government announced fresh plans to introduce no-fault divorce \u2013 though it is hard to know if and when this will happen. The reforms will include a minimum timeframe of six months from petition stage to a marriage being ended, designed to allow couples to reflect on their decision. They will also prevent people from refusing a divorce if their spouse wants one. Matthew Betts\u2019 parents divorced in 2013. He is now 30, and grew up in Derby. He is disarmingly open about his family background, but his story demonstrates that progress doesn\u2019t always move in a straight line. Betts\u2019 mother didn\u2019t tell him, or other family and friends, until three months after the marriage ended. Before that, his father would come home and give the impression he was living in the marital home whenever their sons were visiting. Until his mother broke down and told him what had happened, he had never seen her cry. \u201cMy mum was a bearer of stigma. She thought it was a failure. She was concerned about us having a fractured home. It was because she made a vow, for better or worse\u2026 while my dad had reached the point where it was untenable.\u201d Betts describes his upbringing as \u201cutterly heteronormative \u2013 a mum who was a cook and a cleaner, and a dad who was the worker. I felt a considerable amount of guilt that they stayed together for the sake of me and my brothers, and the archaic notion of a \u2018traditional home\u2019.\u201d After deciding to retrain as a doctor, Betts moved back in with his mother, and was there while she was treated for depression. He also became closer to his two brothers. \u201cIt was like the skies cleared after a tempest,\u201d he says. Divorce can do that, I think, prompting conversations that would otherwise have been repressed. You cry in front of each other. People shout. You come to see your parents as flawed humans, rather than authority figures. If you\u2019re lucky, a distance can sometimes be breached. Betts says he went through a phase where he was anti-monogamy, but is now in a relationship. \u201cIt works for many, many people \u2013 you\u2019ve just got to communicate,\u201d he says. I ask Betts if he thinks people of our generation will handle divorce better. He frames his response like the doctor he is training to be: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what the epidemiology is in 20 years\u2019 time, when it\u2019s us who are negotiating these things. I really hope so.\u201d That day when I came home clutching my Picasso changed everything. But I recognise now that my parents\u2019 long-term wellbeing, and therefore my own, was dependent on their marriage not continuing. What it all comes down to, ultimately, is language \u2013 the way we explain to a child what is happening, or the way we describe a partner in front of them. It\u2019s about finding the words, but also knowing when to say nothing. In trying to make sense of the knot of complex feelings we have around divorce, we\u2019re all still learning the language. It\u2019s the end of the world as they know it: how to help children cope with divorce \u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t bad-mouth each other and don\u2019t try to make the children take sides, or even worse, alienate a child from a parent. This way, the likelihood of a child being permanently traumatised is considerably lessened,\u201d says psychotherapist Philippa Perry. \u2022 Children want to be told what is happening \u2013 involve them as much as you can. Some want to be involved in decisions about where they will live. According to research from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, how well they cope depends on the timing and pace of change, and the extent to which they are prepared. \u2022 Recognise that a child\u2019s happiness isn\u2019t dependent on a nuclear family structure: \u201cThe arrangements can be as conventional or unconventional as you like. Parents can live apart, or together, in a commune or a menage a trois, they can be gay, straight or bisexual \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Perry in her bestseller, The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read. It is the way the family functions that is more relevant. \u2022 There are a range of services dedicated to assisting parents and children during and after divorce. Counselling may help. Contact your GP, Relate or the Association of Child Psychotherapists. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>Nothing goes down better with a section of the British public than a posh old lady who isn\u2019t afraid to talk dirty. It\u2019s the contrast between the drawling vowels, blossomy complexion, sculpted cheekbones and sexual frankness that turns us into what Nanny would probably call \u201cgiggling ninnies\u201d. Anne Glenconner, who at the age of 87 has published a bestselling memoir, was a big hit this autumn on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/graham-norton\" title=\"\">The Graham Norton Show</a></em>, <em>Loose Women</em> and all manner of breakfast television sofas. One of her plummiest anecdotes concerns her mother, Lady Coke, trying to explain sexual intercourse in terms of canine coupling. \u201cDo you remember Daddy\u2019s labrador getting on top of Biscuit? Well, that\u2019s what happens when you get married and have sex, except you will probably be lying down in a bed.\u201d Cue peals of shocked laughter from the studio audience.</p> <p>In fact, there\u2019s nothing especially odd or even socially elevated about Lady Coke\u2019s advice to her eldest girl on the eve of her 1956 marriage. Anne belonged to the generation of girls who were too young to have served in the WAAF and, instead of jitterbugging with young men, spent their chaste teenage years knitting socks for them. You didn\u2019t need to have been brought up on the 27,000 acre Holkham Hall estate, nor been crowned \u201cDeb of the Year\u201d by Tatler, to have arrived at your courtship years without knowing much about men beyond a vague rule of thumb that some were \u201csafe in taxis\u201d while others most definitely were not.</p> <p>Colin Tennant, the man Anne was marrying, really wasn\u2019t safe anywhere, which doubtless explains his appeal. The evening after her disastrous wedding night to the mercurial banker, the blushing bride found herself whisked through Paris for a \u201csurprise\u201d. This turned out not to be dinner at the Ritz, but rather a seedy brothel where she was forced to watch a couple have sex, as if performing a public service. When they asked if Anne would like to join in, she replied politely: \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, but no thank you.\u201d Cue more studio laughter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The blushing bride found herself whisked through Paris for a 'surprise' \u2013 not dinner at the Ritz but sex at a brothel</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She must have got the hang of it pretty quickly because the first of the five Tennant children was conceived on the honeymoon. What has made this book such a hit, however, is not the rolling out of anecdotes about saucy toffs, but rather the access it provides to the workings of the royal family in the second half of the 20th century. In 1971 Anne was appointed lady-in-waiting to her childhood friend Princess Margaret. The two little girls who had delighted in jumping out from behind the curtains at the footmen in wartime Holkham Hall now spent their adult days together, opening hospitals, looking interested in prisoners\u2019 artwork, and trying not to yawn when seated next to a particularly boring bishop. They would also share off-duty times on Mustique, the midgy Caribbean island which Tennant had bought for a song in 1958 and turned into a playground for millionaires. Cue some larky tales about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bianca-jagger\" title=\"\">Bianca Jagger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a> with sand between their toes.</p> <p>Anne even has a stake in season three of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-crown\" title=\"\">The Crown</a></em>, where she is played by Nancy Carroll as the counsellor and confidante of Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s Margaret. In an oddly dreamlike merging of memoir and dramatic narratives, Anne recently found herself sitting side by side with Bonham Carter on Graham Norton\u2019s sofa promoting their parallel projects. Naturally the two women knew each other already, Bonham Carter being cousin to Tennant, AKA Lord Glenconner.</p> <p>This makes the upper class sound like a cosy tight-knit clan, but one of the chief revelations of <em>Lady in Waiting</em> is just how cruel and wasteful the aristocratic system has historically been to women. Because of the cast-iron rule of male primogeniture, Lady Anne and Princess Margaret were obliged to spend their entire lives as left-overs \u201cwaiting\u201d for someone to decide what to do with them. When Anne Coke was born in 1932 as the first child of a man who would become the fifth Earl of Leicester she was a \u201cbig disappointment\u201d, who \u201cbroke the line\u201d by being a girl, the first of three sisters. As a result of her wrongness the magnificent Holkham Hall and the earldom passed on her father\u2019s death to her male second cousin. Margaret too was hexed by her gender: if the clever, headstrong girl had been born a boy she would have leapfrogged our present Queen to succeed their father in 1952. Instead of useful, purposeful public lives, the mischievous best friends found themselves entirely surplus to requirements.</p> <p>This sense of being in the way was compounded when both women were disqualified from marrying the men they loved. Before her marriage to Tennant, Glenconner was blissfully engaged to \u201cJohnnie\u201d Althorp, who would later go on to father Diana, Princess of Wales. But as a result of Johnnie\u2019s father Earl Spencer muttering about Anne having some distant mentally \u201cdefective\u201d cousins (who also happened to be first cousins to Princess Margaret and Queen Elizabeth), the dashing cavalry officer slunk away without telling his fiancee that the match was off because of her \u201cmad blood\u201d. Princess Margaret, meanwhile, was famously not permitted to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend on the grounds that his earlier divorce was incompatible with her sister\u2019s position as head of the Church of England. Instead, both women accepted men on the rebound whom their families considered distinctly below the salt. Margaret married \u201cTony Snapshot\u201d, as Glenconner\u2019s father wittily called Antony Armstrong-Jones. Meanwhile, Glenconner insisted that his own daughter\u2019s fiance, Tennant, whose family fortune was far too recently based on bleach, line up with the beaters rather than the guns when attending a shoot at Holkham Hall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99ef80ae5849049e4e90c97162d71735e67711e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99ef80ae5849049e4e90c97162d71735e67711e4/26_64_2187_1311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne with her father, Lord Glenconner, in 1953.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne with her father, Lord Glenconner, in 1953.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Len Cassingham/ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps both young men were cross about having such non-U names (\u201cColin\u201d and \u201cTony\u201d sound as if they belong at a Rotary Club social rather than Buckingham Palace).

      "bodyText": "Nothing goes down better with a section of the British public than a posh old lady who isn\u2019t afraid to talk dirty. It\u2019s the contrast between the drawling vowels, blossomy complexion, sculpted cheekbones and sexual frankness that turns us into what Nanny would probably call \u201cgiggling ninnies\u201d. Anne Glenconner, who at the age of 87 has published a bestselling memoir, was a big hit this autumn on The Graham Norton Show, Loose Women and all manner of breakfast television sofas. One of her plummiest anecdotes concerns her mother, Lady Coke, trying to explain sexual intercourse in terms of canine coupling. \u201cDo you remember Daddy\u2019s labrador getting on top of Biscuit? Well, that\u2019s what happens when you get married and have sex, except you will probably be lying down in a bed.\u201d Cue peals of shocked laughter from the studio audience. In fact, there\u2019s nothing especially odd or even socially elevated about Lady Coke\u2019s advice to her eldest girl on the eve of her 1956 marriage. Anne belonged to the generation of girls who were too young to have served in the WAAF and, instead of jitterbugging with young men, spent their chaste teenage years knitting socks for them. You didn\u2019t need to have been brought up on the 27,000 acre Holkham Hall estate, nor been crowned \u201cDeb of the Year\u201d by Tatler, to have arrived at your courtship years without knowing much about men beyond a vague rule of thumb that some were \u201csafe in taxis\u201d while others most definitely were not. Colin Tennant, the man Anne was marrying, really wasn\u2019t safe anywhere, which doubtless explains his appeal. The evening after her disastrous wedding night to the mercurial banker, the blushing bride found herself whisked through Paris for a \u201csurprise\u201d. This turned out not to be dinner at the Ritz, but rather a seedy brothel where she was forced to watch a couple have sex, as if performing a public service. When they asked if Anne would like to join in, she replied politely: \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, but no thank you.\u201d Cue more studio laughter. She must have got the hang of it pretty quickly because the first of the five Tennant children was conceived on the honeymoon. What has made this book such a hit, however, is not the rolling out of anecdotes about saucy toffs, but rather the access it provides to the workings of the royal family in the second half of the 20th century. In 1971 Anne was appointed lady-in-waiting to her childhood friend Princess Margaret. The two little girls who had delighted in jumping out from behind the curtains at the footmen in wartime Holkham Hall now spent their adult days together, opening hospitals, looking interested in prisoners\u2019 artwork, and trying not to yawn when seated next to a particularly boring bishop. They would also share off-duty times on Mustique, the midgy Caribbean island which Tennant had bought for a song in 1958 and turned into a playground for millionaires. Cue some larky tales about Bianca Jagger and David Bowie with sand between their toes. Anne even has a stake in season three of The Crown, where she is played by Nancy Carroll as the counsellor and confidante of Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s Margaret. In an oddly dreamlike merging of memoir and dramatic narratives, Anne recently found herself sitting side by side with Bonham Carter on Graham Norton\u2019s sofa promoting their parallel projects. Naturally the two women knew each other already, Bonham Carter being cousin to Tennant, AKA Lord Glenconner.

I\u2019m all right, Emma. Keep it for yourself.</p> <p>Last Christmas is one of those films that is so deranged it feels like a strange fever dream. In this sense, it\u2019s like the 80s comedy <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093493/\" title=\"\">Mannequin</a>, a charming romantic comedy about a man finding true love with a plastic doll. Or maybe it\u2019s closer to <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091991/\" title=\"\">Soul Man</a> \u2013 another movie, like Last Christmas, that ruined a good song by stealing its title \u2013 in which a white kid takes a load of tanning pills in order to baggsie a Harvard scholarship for African Americans. Yes, this is a movie that actually exists.</p> <p>Unlike Soul Man, Last Christmas does not feature \u201ccomedy\u201d blackface. But on the bus home afterwards, I had a debate with myself about which was its most bonkers moment: Thompson casting herself as a depressed former Yugoslavian immigrant? The faintly depressing onslaught of cameos from people who are really too good for the script? (Patti LuPone, for God\u2019s sake. <em>Patti LuPone</em>.) In fact, never mind Soul Man, Last Christmas is more reminiscent of those bewildering comedies that were once the mainstay of the British film industry before Four Weddings And A Funeral made everyone up their game. Ever seen Wilt, starring Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith? Or Blame It On The Bellboy, featuring Dudley Moore, Richard Griffiths and Patsy Kensit? No? Don\u2019t worry too much about it.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the plot twist.

      "bodyText": "So I\u2019ve finally seen Last Christmas, the critically panned rom (ummm) com (errrr) written by Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings, and the first thing to say is, \u201cHooo boy.\u201d The second thing is, \u201cWhatever Emma was smoking when she came up with that movie\u2019s plot twist, which has now ruined Wham! for ever, well, I\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having.\u201d Actually, you know what? I\u2019m all right, Emma. Keep it for yourself. Last Christmas is one of those films that is so deranged it feels like a strange fever dream. In this sense, it\u2019s like the 80s comedy Mannequin, a charming romantic comedy about a man finding true love with a plastic doll. Or maybe it\u2019s closer to Soul Man \u2013 another movie, like Last Christmas, that ruined a good song by stealing its title \u2013 in which a white kid takes a load of tanning pills in order to baggsie a Harvard scholarship for African Americans. Yes, this is a movie that actually exists. Unlike Soul Man, Last Christmas does not feature \u201ccomedy\u201d blackface. But on the bus home afterwards, I had a debate with myself about which was its most bonkers moment: Thompson casting herself as a depressed former Yugoslavian immigrant? The faintly depressing onslaught of cameos from people who are really too good for the script? (Patti LuPone, for God\u2019s sake. Patti LuPone.) In fact, never mind Soul Man, Last Christmas is more reminiscent of those bewildering comedies that were once the mainstay of the British film industry before Four Weddings And A Funeral made everyone up their game. Ever seen Wilt, starring Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith? Or Blame It On The Bellboy, featuring Dudley Moore, Richard Griffiths and Patsy Kensit? No? Don\u2019t worry too much about it. And then there\u2019s the plot twist. Regular readers will know that I have very strong feelings about what constitutes a good Christmas movie, and I have similarly firm ideas about plot twists. A good twist will make everything in the movie come together. A bad one makes the entire film fall apart. Despite Last Christmas\u2019 best attempts to copy the \u201cChazz Palminteri dropping his coffee cup as he realises the truth about Keyser S\u00f6ze\u201d moment in The Usual Suspects, you cannot jazzhands away the fact that the plot twist is the most ludicrously WTF moment in a film since Donald Trump strolled up to have a chat with Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2.

But as a shitposter, as a sort of eyes-open hyper-aware bizarro-world reflection of the current say-without-checking news cycle, he was a creator of masterpieces. Putin, sign him up. Putin, Putin, sign him up. Putting the \u2018defect\u2019 into \u2018defecting\u2019 To be fair to Sam Gyimah, he\u2019s had a big year of defecting from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats and getting reported to the police for \u201cinaccurate and dangerous\u201d accusations about his Labour rival\u2019s role in Grenfell, so it\u2019s to be expected that he won\u2019t keep up with everything and know every bit of news, because he\u2019s been too busy swapping out all his blue ties for yellow and Googling \u201chow survive prison?\u201d That said \u2026 he does know Melania Trump is, like, married to the world\u2019s biggest rightwing nationalist hero, yes? And that his new party (you\u2019re in the Lib Dems now, Sam. Check your Wikipedia) is \u2013 until election day early-morning negotiations get started, anyway \u2013 supposed to be opposed to things like Donald Trump? And so that maybe tweeting, \u201cMelania Trump sends coded message: VOTE LIBDEMS this December 12th\u201d alongside a picture of her in a yellow dress is perhaps, as we say, \u201cnot the one\u201d? And some might even say, perhaps, \u201ca guaranteed vote killer\u201d? Swings and roundabouts It is 13 seconds in, if you are interested. Thirteen seconds into this video is the exact moment when Johnny Mercer \u2013 former army officer, Plymouth Moor View Conservative candidate, former Ministry of Defence minister and the answer to the question \u201cwhat if Bear Grylls never got his insatiable taste for piss?\u201d \u2013 has his heart visibly broken. \u201cHey folks, so we\u2019re at Manadon roundabout where one of the signs is in Plymouth, and, yeah, I\u2019ve got something to show you,\u201d he says, before creaking the camera around to a canvas sign where someone\u2019s daubed \u201cTWAT\u201d in large red letters over Mercer\u2019s name. \u201cNow that\u2019s not very nice, is it?\u201d In a week when Mercer deleted a tweet that contained a joke about Diane Abbott\u2019s intelligence, which leaned on a trope that many people condemned as being, well, if not fully racist then at least misogynist (which Mercer denies was his intention), it\u2019s a bit rich to talk about being \u201cnice\u201d in politics. But now we know the rules \u2013 making fun of the most abused politician online: good. Calling Johnny Mercer a roundabout twat: not on. \u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant",

      "body": "<p>Daisy Ridley\u2019s earliest childhood memory is of a party hosted by her parents at their family home in west London, when she was three, maybe four. She was surrounded by grownups, towering above her, when she abruptly and dramatically declared: \u201cI\u2019m shy!\u201d before running out of the room. \u201cMy mum told me I did that, so maybe I\u2019m remembering half an imprint of someone else\u2019s memory,\u201d she says, laughing at the irony of both commanding attention from her audience and then immediately rejecting it. It\u2019s a trait that has somehow stuck.</p> <p>At 27, Ridley finds herself at the centre of the universe. With three Star Wars films under her belt, the actor is adjusting to multiple layers of fame: there\u2019s the gilded A-list Hollywood kind that comes with red carpets, stylists and outfits gifted by the most sought-after designers; then the sort of fame that has tabloids tracking her most mundane moves, breathlessly documenting Ridley\u2019s \u201cbrave\u201d trip to the dry cleaner\u2019s (with no makeup!) or strolling through London wearing \u2013 gasp \u2013 a daisy print skirt. And then, of course, there\u2019s the fierce, cult-like superfan fame, where the force of millions of Star Wars obsessives will always be with her, the legacy of being plucked, as a fresh-faced 21-year-old unknown, by director JJ Abrams to play Rey, the scrappy scavenger mentored by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).</p> <p>We meet on a late autumn afternoon in one of London\u2019s grandest hotels. The Star Wars press campaign has occupied an entire floor and a corridor of suites is taken up by publicists, assistants and executives fixed on their phone screens. Ridley, wearing a dark denim Ulla Johnson boilersuit, cinched in at the waist and tucked into Christian Louboutin mesh ankle boots, takes a seat on a beige chaise longue in a very beige room, expertly low lit for movie stars. Her dark bob is slicked back, her cheekbones wide and high. She looks terrific \u2013 and when I say so, she immediately credits her stylist (Samantha McMillen, whose longest-standing clients are Johnny Depp and Elle Fanning), and a new trainer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the strongest and healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I didn\u2019t get injured once [on set]. I actually got my kickboxing green belt during filming, which really felt like something.\u201d Ridley mugs a goofy face at her achievement. \u201cIt was honestly the best thing ever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2b648fa7938ba96edce0e58404a39b4e535c79f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b648fa7938ba96edce0e58404a39b4e535c79f6/553_0_2443_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actors Daisy Ridley and Carrie Fisher in Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With the late Carrie Fisher in new film Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lucasfilm/Walt Disney Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The daughter of a communications director and a photographer, Ridley had done a few bit parts on TV (Toast Of London, Casualty, Mr Selfridge) and was working in a pub when she got the part of Rey six years ago. She was an ideal blank canvas for Abrams who, Ridley has said, wanted to project \u201cvulnerable and tough, sweet and terrified\u201d on to the character. Although comparisons to a young Keira Knightley were swift \u2013 the two look remarkably alike \u2013 Ridley held her own with fans and critics, and was heralded as \u201cterrific in a doozy of a breakout role\u201d by Variety. It\u2019s obvious Ridley enjoys an ease on screen; it helps, perhaps, that she was never really a Star Wars fan \u2013 like the then-unknown Mark Hamill in the original films, she was able to play her part unburdened by the weight of the franchise. Whether this delicate alchemy works in The Rise Of Skywalker remains to be seen: nobody gets to watch the new film until its premiere.</p> <p>From the start, Abrams warned her to understand the scale of what she was taking on: \u201cThis is not a role in a movie. This is a religion for people. It changes things on a level that is inconceivable,\u201d she recalls him telling her. But Ridley, who won a scholarship to boarding school in Hertfordshire and grew up with her older sisters Kika-Rose (a former model who works in production) and Poppy Sophia (a reiki instructor) in a pretty cobbled street in west London, radiates a natural charm and confidence. She is chatty, sitcom-expressive and enthusiastic; life right now is \u201cso amazing\u201d, \u201cglorious\u201d, \u201cfabulous\u201d. I can see how she won Abrams over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0c7a6f60de863ec1918eda0bbe26c5cfac4dc4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c7a6f60de863ec1918eda0bbe26c5cfac4dc4f/0_1824_5504_5209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Daisy Ridley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"946\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Above and top: <a href=\"https://www.rheacosta-shop.com/\">Rhea Costa</a> dresses. <a href=\"https://www.giuseppezanotti.com/uk?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2Z-I69uM5gIViZntCh2REQDDEAAYASAAEgKm_vD_BwE\">Giuseppe Zanotti</a> shoes. <a href=\"https://saraweinstock.com/\">Sara Weinstock</a> earrings. <a href=\"https://anitako.com/\">Anita Ko</a> ear cuff. <a href=\"https://www.mishodesigns.com/\">Misho</a> ring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been hard at points,\u201d she says of the attention that followed the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii\" title=\"\">The Force Awakens</a> in 2015, fiddling with her earring. \u201cI have a thing with control, but it does get a bit easier. I texted my friend the other day and I was, like: \u2018Dude, please don\u2019t put pictures of me online.\u2019 Because it\u2019s that weird disconnect, that people don\u2019t ask people\u2019s permission before they post things.\u201d</p> <p>Ridley began therapy and binned social media two years ago, considering it an unnecessary invasion of her now closely guarded privacy. She is reportedly engaged to her boyfriend, the English actor Tom Bateman, whom she met while filming Murder On The Orient Express two years ago (a ring is on her finger, but she won\u2019t talk about her love life). Friends are reminded to put their phones away when they go to dinner together. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018You can\u2019t say where we are, not just because it\u2019s me \u2013 because it\u2019s not safe.\u2019 My friend has 50,000 followers and you\u2019re telling 50,000 people where you are right at that moment? That\u2019s scary.\u201d</p> <p>Was that an awkward conversation? Did she worry her friends would think she was becoming grand, or difficult? \u201cI\u2019ve never had an issue with saying things like that,\u201d Ridley says. \u201cI\u2019m not passively aggressive \u2013 I\u2019m just directly aggressive. It is a bit uncomfortable, because obviously I don\u2019t want to say to my friend, \u2018Please don\u2019t do that.\u2019 But I\u2019m not the one who should be feeling uncomfortable.\u201d She pauses to sip on a juice shot we\u2019ve both been given. \u201cFucking hell, is that <em>just </em>ginger?

Recently, I met someone that knew of someone I vaguely knew that knew something about me they shouldn\u2019t have known. I was, like, \u2018Yeah, please don\u2019t talk about stuff like that.\u2019\u201d She exhales, before continuing.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think they know things about you, and that they know you \u2013 it\u2019s a constant imbalance. I wish people sometimes would go: \u2018Hey, what do you do?\u2019 so I can say it, but people see me and are, like, \u2018A-haaa!\u2019\u201d She is careful to add the caveat that she is \u201cof course, grateful and lucky\u201d. It gets to her most when the fame affects those closest to her. \u201cRecently, my family went to a wedding and it was really uncomfortable, because people assumed they knew me and only directed questions to me. My sister who was with me was basically ignored. I cannot stand that. It\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she thinks it has been easier to be confident and navigate her celebrity because of the privilege in her life \u2013 of boarding school, her upbringing and so on? Ridley is suddenly incredulous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"50c456865bec40989fe2705deba69603d4069eae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50c456865bec40989fe2705deba69603d4069eae/0_0_3000_2004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Daisy Ridley playing Mary Debenham in Murder On The Orient Express.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Mary Debenham in Murder On The Orient Express.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe privilege I have \u2013 how? No, genuinely, how?\u201d</p> <p>Well, I say, in terms of wealth, class, education \u2013 that kind of privilege, in knowing how to decode the rules in certain spaces. As a caveat, I add that both of us have privilege, and it\u2019s not a criticism; I was simply curious to know what she thought. Things take an awkward turn.</p> <p>\u201cWell no, because, no\u2026 \u201d There is a very long and tense pause, before she insists that, actually, there is little difference between her experience and that of her co-star John Boyega, who grew up in south London to British Nigerian immigrant parents. \u201cJohn grew up on a council estate in Peckham and I think me and him are similar enough that\u2026 no... Also, I went to a boarding school for performing arts, which was different.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0b628fce37f45c471bd48dea371fdb5b31b5e4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0b628fce37f45c471bd48dea371fdb5b31b5e4d/0_1591_5504_6029/913.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Daisy Ridley\" width=\"913\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"https://www.augustgetty.com/\">August Getty</a> suit. <a href=\"https://www.sophiawebster.com/\">Sophia Webster</a> shoes. <a href=\"https://saraweinstock.com/\">Sara Weinstock</a> earrings. <a href=\"https://www.mishodesigns.com/\">Misho</a> ring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But surely nine years of private education gave her some additional confidence?</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ridley leans on her elbow while twirling a small knot in her hair. \u201cNo. I think, also, it has taken me a little while to be OK with it. I was always fairly confident, and I think that comes from being part of a big family who are all quite chatty.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an unexpectedly defensive detour, as if the mere mention of privilege is an attempt to diminish Ridley\u2019s hard work or talent. I try to change the subject but get the distinct feeling that her publicist, sitting behind me in Ridley\u2019s eyeline, has made some sort of silent intervention. \u201cI\u2019m not saying what you\u2019re saying is wrong,\u201d Ridley adds. \u201cI\u2019ve just never been asked that before, so I\u2019m like, oh. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d We move on.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite starring in one of the biggest film franchises in history, Ridley didn\u2019t know much about cinema while growing up and is still working through lists of \u201cmust-sees\u201d that have been passed on to her by friends. Her cultural touchstones were the film Matilda, Disney, Pink and the Spice Girls, and musicals such as Chicago. At the wrap party for the final instalment of the sequel\u2019s trilogy, Abrams gifted her a Lion King score signed by Elton John, \u201cbecause me and John [Boyega] were always messing about re-enacting the, \u2018Waahh, Simba!\u2019 scene\u201d. But for the most part, growing up she was, \u201cI don\u2019t know, just hanging out. I worked in Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as a mere T-shirt folder.\u201d She says this meant she was able to gatecrash nights out with the models who worked there, \u201cgoing to fancy places like [Mayfair private members\u2019 club] Maddox where I\u2019d be on the fringes of their table, sipping my free vodka cranberry\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d53559b98f9c32ccbabba46de8d7fc7078e96a9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d53559b98f9c32ccbabba46de8d7fc7078e96a9d/0_14_3504_2225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Daisy Ridley in Ophelia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Ophelia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dusan Martinicek/Allstar/IFC Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Parties aren\u2019t her thing anyway.

He\u2019s great at parties and had a great time. I\u2019m more of a dinner person, I was never really a partier.\u201d Has she ever been out until lunchtime the next day? \u201cNo!\u201d Ridley gags and laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t take drugs, so if I make it past 2am, I\u2019m like, \u2018Look at me! This is only life and a little bit of alcohol, and I am still going!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ridley is vegan and doesn\u2019t drink often \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about not letting go, I just don\u2019t like being drunk\u201d \u2013 but did revel in the wild anecdotes that Carrie Fisher would let slip on set. \u201cOh my God, she was so sassy and had all these amazing stories. I can\u2019t mention any names but things that only happen with Americans who live in big houses in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ad4f20d89e598e6a3de2e6d6f70b39d0804f892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ad4f20d89e598e6a3de2e6d6f70b39d0804f892/614_563_3277_7693/426.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Daisy Ridley\" width=\"426\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"https://www.augustgetty.com/\">August Getty</a> suit. <a href=\"https://saraweinstock.com/\">Sara Weinstock</a> earrings. <a href=\"https://www.danarebeccadesigns.com/\">Dana Rebecca Designs</a> ring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fisher famously told Ridley to be careful about who she dated after Star Wars because, as in her case, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give people the ability to say, \u2018I slept with Princess Leia.\u2019\u201d Were they particularly close on set? \u201cOh, she was so smart and so funny. She went through things, like wearing the gold bikini [in Return Of The Jedi], so I didn\u2019t end up having to do those things, and I\u2019m so grateful.\u201d</p> <p>Ridley was in the cinema when she got the phone call telling her that Fisher had died. \u201cI spoke to [my publicist] Heidi, and went to the bathroom and wailed. Someone sweetly came up to me and asked if I wanted a refund for my ticket. I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m fine\u2019 and then I wailed more, and then I had a parking ticket and was, like, this is all awful.\u201d Fisher had played Leia as a general leading the Resistance against the First Order in the last two films. How did they work around the loss in The Rise Of Skywalker?</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is really happy with the way the footage has been used, even though it\u2019s difficult to do and watch. Billie [Lourd, Fisher\u2019s daughter] is in the film, and she says it was a way of working with her mum again. It\u2019s one of those weird things where it\u2019s as satisfying as can be, even amid all the trauma.\u201d</p> <p>As for what comes next, Ridley says she\u2019s \u201csadly unemployed, but I have itchy feet\u201d. There are projects she can\u2019t talk about yet, \u201cthings that are almost ready\u201d. She is full of praise for her agent who she says deserves a producer credit on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/23/ophelia-review-daisy-ridley-stranded-in-disastrous-hamlet-reimagining\" title=\"\">Ophelia</a> (Ridley\u2019s last major film, a reimagining of Hamlet also starring Naomi Watts and Clive Owen), as \u201cshe practically made that happen\u201d. For the most part, she is now sifting through scripts. \u201cI had an amazing script and then a meeting with the director and it was just really weird, like, a really weird vibe.\u201d She grins. \u201cThen Hylda had a conversation with the director and was, like, \u2018Nope \u2013 no, you\u2019re not doing it.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cStar Wars has given me the opportunity to do smaller things and allowed me to say no, which is glorious. I don\u2019t talk a lot about various things because there are people fighting the good fight, and I know I have safety in that the people I have worked with have loud voices.\u201d It\u2019s an elliptical allusion to \u2013 I think \u2013 equal pay and #MeToo in the industry. She rubs her nose, before explaining some more. \u201cWell, there was another film I really wanted to do, but there were a number of factors that meant I didn\u2019t believe it was right.\u201d How so? \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t equal and all that stuff, so I said no, even though that\u2019s really scary. But how much of a blessing is it to be able to say no?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/31/rise-of-skywalker-is-star-wars-saga-nearly-at-an-end\">Spent force: why is making a good Star Wars film so hard?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given that Disney owns Star Wars, is she conscious of what issues she can talk about publicly?

      "bodyText": "Daisy Ridley\u2019s earliest childhood memory is of a party hosted by her parents at their family home in west London, when she was three, maybe four. She was surrounded by grownups, towering above her, when she abruptly and dramatically declared: \u201cI\u2019m shy!\u201d before running out of the room. \u201cMy mum told me I did that, so maybe I\u2019m remembering half an imprint of someone else\u2019s memory,\u201d she says, laughing at the irony of both commanding attention from her audience and then immediately rejecting it. It\u2019s a trait that has somehow stuck. At 27, Ridley finds herself at the centre of the universe. With three Star Wars films under her belt, the actor is adjusting to multiple layers of fame: there\u2019s the gilded A-list Hollywood kind that comes with red carpets, stylists and outfits gifted by the most sought-after designers; then the sort of fame that has tabloids tracking her most mundane moves, breathlessly documenting Ridley\u2019s \u201cbrave\u201d trip to the dry cleaner\u2019s (with no makeup!) or strolling through London wearing \u2013 gasp \u2013 a daisy print skirt. And then, of course, there\u2019s the fierce, cult-like superfan fame, where the force of millions of Star Wars obsessives will always be with her, the legacy of being plucked, as a fresh-faced 21-year-old unknown, by director JJ Abrams to play Rey, the scrappy scavenger mentored by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). We meet on a late autumn afternoon in one of London\u2019s grandest hotels. The Star Wars press campaign has occupied an entire floor and a corridor of suites is taken up by publicists, assistants and executives fixed on their phone screens. Ridley, wearing a dark denim Ulla Johnson boilersuit, cinched in at the waist and tucked into Christian Louboutin mesh ankle boots, takes a seat on a beige chaise longue in a very beige room, expertly low lit for movie stars. Her dark bob is slicked back, her cheekbones wide and high. She looks terrific \u2013 and when I say so, she immediately credits her stylist (Samantha McMillen, whose longest-standing clients are Johnny Depp and Elle Fanning), and a new trainer. \u201cI\u2019m the strongest and healthiest I\u2019ve ever been. I didn\u2019t get injured once [on set]. I actually got my kickboxing green belt during filming, which really felt like something.\u201d Ridley mugs a goofy face at her achievement. \u201cIt was honestly the best thing ever.\u201d The daughter of a communications director and a photographer, Ridley had done a few bit parts on TV (Toast Of London, Casualty, Mr Selfridge) and was working in a pub when she got the part of Rey six years ago. She was an ideal blank canvas for Abrams who, Ridley has said, wanted to project \u201cvulnerable and tough, sweet and terrified\u201d on to the character. Although comparisons to a young Keira Knightley were swift \u2013 the two look remarkably alike \u2013 Ridley held her own with fans and critics, and was heralded as \u201cterrific in a doozy of a breakout role\u201d by Variety. It\u2019s obvious Ridley enjoys an ease on screen; it helps, perhaps, that she was never really a Star Wars fan \u2013 like the then-unknown Mark Hamill in the original films, she was able to play her part unburdened by the weight of the franchise. Whether this delicate alchemy works in The Rise Of Skywalker remains to be seen: nobody gets to watch the new film until its premiere. From the start, Abrams warned her to understand the scale of what she was taking on: \u201cThis is not a role in a movie. This is a religion for people. It changes things on a level that is inconceivable,\u201d she recalls him telling her. But Ridley, who won a scholarship to boarding school in Hertfordshire and grew up with her older sisters Kika-Rose (a former model who works in production) and Poppy Sophia (a reiki instructor) in a pretty cobbled street in west London, radiates a natural charm and confidence. She is chatty, sitcom-expressive and enthusiastic; life right now is \u201cso amazing\u201d, \u201cglorious\u201d, \u201cfabulous\u201d. I can see how she won Abrams over. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard at points,\u201d she says of the attention that followed the release of The Force Awakens in 2015, fiddling with her earring. \u201cI have a thing with control, but it does get a bit easier. I texted my friend the other day and I was, like: \u2018Dude, please don\u2019t put pictures of me online.\u2019 Because it\u2019s that weird disconnect, that people don\u2019t ask people\u2019s permission before they post things.\u201d Ridley began therapy and binned social media two years ago, considering it an unnecessary invasion of her now closely guarded privacy. She is reportedly engaged to her boyfriend, the English actor Tom Bateman, whom she met while filming Murder On The Orient Express two years ago (a ring is on her finger, but she won\u2019t talk about her love life). Friends are reminded to put their phones away when they go to dinner together. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018You can\u2019t say where we are, not just because it\u2019s me \u2013 because it\u2019s not safe.\u2019 My friend has 50,000 followers and you\u2019re telling 50,000 people where you are right at that moment? That\u2019s scary.\u201d Was that an awkward conversation? Did she worry her friends would think she was becoming grand, or difficult? \u201cI\u2019ve never had an issue with saying things like that,\u201d Ridley says. \u201cI\u2019m not passively aggressive \u2013 I\u2019m just directly aggressive. It is a bit uncomfortable, because obviously I don\u2019t want to say to my friend, \u2018Please don\u2019t do that.\u2019 But I\u2019m not the one who should be feeling uncomfortable.\u201d She pauses to sip on a juice shot we\u2019ve both been given. \u201cFucking hell, is that just ginger? Oww, it\u2019s just ginger.\u201d She winces. \u201c Everybody needs to be more accountable for what they post and what they share. Recently, I met someone that knew of someone I vaguely knew that knew something about me they shouldn\u2019t have known. I was, like, \u2018Yeah, please don\u2019t talk about stuff like that.\u2019\u201d She exhales, before continuing. \u201cPeople think they know things about you, and that they know you \u2013 it\u2019s a constant imbalance. I wish people sometimes would go: \u2018Hey, what do you do?\u2019 so I can say it, but people see me and are, like, \u2018A-haaa!\u2019\u201d She is careful to add the caveat that she is \u201cof course, grateful and lucky\u201d. It gets to her most when the fame affects those closest to her. \u201cRecently, my family went to a wedding and it was really uncomfortable, because people assumed they knew me and only directed questions to me. My sister who was with me was basically ignored. I cannot stand that. It\u2019s just rude.\u201d I ask if she thinks it has been easier to be confident and navigate her celebrity because of the privilege in her life \u2013 of boarding school, her upbringing and so on? Ridley is suddenly incredulous. \u201cThe privilege I have \u2013 how? No, genuinely, how?\u201d Well, I say, in terms of wealth, class, education \u2013 that kind of privilege, in knowing how to decode the rules in certain spaces. As a caveat, I add that both of us have privilege, and it\u2019s not a criticism; I was simply curious to know what she thought. Things take an awkward turn. \u201cWell no, because, no\u2026 \u201d There is a very long and tense pause, before she insists that, actually, there is little difference between her experience and that of her co-star John Boyega, who grew up in south London to British Nigerian immigrant parents. \u201cJohn grew up on a council estate in Peckham and I think me and him are similar enough that\u2026 no... Also, I went to a boarding school for performing arts, which was different.\u201d But surely nine years of private education gave her some additional confidence? \u201cNo.\u201d Ridley leans on her elbow while twirling a small knot in her hair. \u201cNo. I think, also, it has taken me a little while to be OK with it. I was always fairly confident, and I think that comes from being part of a big family who are all quite chatty.\u201d It\u2019s an unexpectedly defensive detour, as if the mere mention of privilege is an attempt to diminish Ridley\u2019s hard work or talent. I try to change the subject but get the distinct feeling that her publicist, sitting behind me in Ridley\u2019s eyeline, has made some sort of silent intervention. \u201cI\u2019m not saying what you\u2019re saying is wrong,\u201d Ridley adds. \u201cI\u2019ve just never been asked that before, so I\u2019m like, oh. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d We move on. * * * Despite starring in one of the biggest film franchises in history, Ridley didn\u2019t know much about cinema while growing up and is still working through lists of \u201cmust-sees\u201d that have been passed on to her by friends. Her cultural touchstones were the film Matilda, Disney, Pink and the Spice Girls, and musicals such as Chicago. At the wrap party for the final instalment of the sequel\u2019s trilogy, Abrams gifted her a Lion King score signed by Elton John, \u201cbecause me and John [Boyega] were always messing about re-enacting the, \u2018Waahh, Simba!\u2019 scene\u201d. But for the most part, growing up she was, \u201cI don\u2019t know, just hanging out. I worked in Abercrombie &amp; Fitch as a mere T-shirt folder.\u201d She says this meant she was able to gatecrash nights out with the models who worked there, \u201cgoing to fancy places like [Mayfair private members\u2019 club] Maddox where I\u2019d be on the fringes of their table, sipping my free vodka cranberry\u201d. Parties aren\u2019t her thing anyway. She got invited to an Oscars one hosted by \u2013 she thinks \u2013 Madonna. \u201cI want to say Madonna? Anyway, I was so tired and didn\u2019t go, so my dad went. He\u2019s great at parties and had a great time. I\u2019m more of a dinner person, I was never really a partier.\u201d Has she ever been out until lunchtime the next day? \u201cNo!\u201d Ridley gags and laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t take drugs, so if I make it past 2am, I\u2019m like, \u2018Look at me! This is only life and a little bit of alcohol, and I am still going!\u2019\u201d Ridley is vegan and doesn\u2019t drink often \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about not letting go, I just don\u2019t like being drunk\u201d \u2013 but did revel in the wild anecdotes that Carrie Fisher would let slip on set. \u201cOh my God, she was so sassy and had all these amazing stories. I can\u2019t mention any names but things that only happen with Americans who live in big houses in the middle of nowhere.\u201d Fisher famously told Ridley to be careful about who she dated after Star Wars because, as in her case, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give people the ability to say, \u2018I slept with Princess Leia.\u2019\u201d Were they particularly close on set? \u201cOh, she was so smart and so funny. She went through things, like wearing the gold bikini [in Return Of The Jedi], so I didn\u2019t end up having to do those things, and I\u2019m so grateful.\u201d Ridley was in the cinema when she got the phone call telling her that Fisher had died. \u201cI spoke to [my publicist] Heidi, and went to the bathroom and wailed. Someone sweetly came up to me and asked if I wanted a refund for my ticket. I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m fine\u2019 and then I wailed more, and then I had a parking ticket and was, like, this is all awful.\u201d Fisher had played Leia as a general leading the Resistance against the First Order in the last two films. How did they work around the loss in The Rise Of Skywalker? \u201cEveryone is really happy with the way the footage has been used, even though it\u2019s difficult to do and watch. Billie [Lourd, Fisher\u2019s daughter] is in the film, and she says it was a way of working with her mum again. It\u2019s one of those weird things where it\u2019s as satisfying as can be, even amid all the trauma.\u201d As for what comes next, Ridley says she\u2019s \u201csadly unemployed, but I have itchy feet\u201d. There are projects she can\u2019t talk about yet, \u201cthings that are almost ready\u201d. She is full of praise for her agent who she says deserves a producer credit on Ophelia (Ridley\u2019s last major film, a reimagining of Hamlet also starring Naomi Watts and Clive Owen), as \u201cshe practically made that happen\u201d. For the most part, she is now sifting through scripts. \u201cI had an amazing script and then a meeting with the director and it was just really weird, like, a really weird vibe.\u201d She grins. \u201cThen Hylda had a conversation with the director and was, like, \u2018Nope \u2013 no, you\u2019re not doing it.\u2019 \u201cStar Wars has given me the opportunity to do smaller things and allowed me to say no, which is glorious. I don\u2019t talk a lot about various things because there are people fighting the good fight, and I know I have safety in that the people I have worked with have loud voices.\u201d It\u2019s an elliptical allusion to \u2013 I think \u2013 equal pay and #MeToo in the industry. She rubs her nose, before explaining some more. \u201cWell, there was another film I really wanted to do, but there were a number of factors that meant I didn\u2019t believe it was right.\u201d How so? \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t equal and all that stuff, so I said no, even though that\u2019s really scary. But how much of a blessing is it to be able to say no?\u201d Given that Disney owns Star Wars, is she conscious of what issues she can talk about publicly? Does she have to modify, say, her politics? \u201cNo. I don\u2019t feel I have to edit what I say \u2013 the things that make me angry are the things that make everyone angry. Everyone is annoyed with BoJo. Everyone has an issue with Trump \u2013 every sane person anyway.\u201d She smiles brightly at me, almost apologetic, reluctant to expand. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t talk about this stuff, but other people are so much more articulate than me and say it better.\u201d Our time is being signalled to a close. She bounces up from the stiff-looking chaise longue, still lively and energetic. \u201cThis [was] starting to feel like a therapy session,\u201d she jokes, exhaling. A buzz of voices breaks out in the corridor, as the line of people looking to speak to Ridley, or get a picture of her, to find out what it\u2019s like to be her, gets imperceptibly smaller, interview by interview. I wonder where she\u2019s at her happiest. \u201cOn my parents\u2019 sofa,\u201d she replies without hesitating. \u201cI\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m having a nap on their sofa, because there\u2019s always a murmur of their voices. I find that very, very comforting.\u201d \u2022 Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is out on 19 December. Styling: Samantha McMillen/The Wall Group. Hair: Mara Roszak/SWA.

Of course, \u201cthe bankers and the larger businessmen, the landowners and dividend-drawers, the officials with their prehensile bottoms, will obstruct for all they are worth\u201d. But, never mind: \u201cif the rich squeal audibly, so much the better\u201d.</p> <p>One measure of how little has changed is that Orwell\u2019s diagnosis of the country he called a \u201crich man\u2019s paradise\u201d \u2013 and even his specific prescriptions: nationalisation of basic industries, abolition of hereditary privilege, educational reform and punitive taxation of offensively unequal incomes \u2013 still resonates, almost eight decades later, as the United Kingdom goes to the polls. The long English past of entrenched privilege and extreme inequality is back, if it ever went away. The problems stemming from archaic political and social structures, and an economy geared to further enriching the rich, seem even more intractable.</p> <p>At the same time, the wartime English patriotism that Orwell tried to alchemise into socialism as highly intelligent Germans tried to kill him has degenerated into self-destructive nihilism during the Tory onslaught on a German-dominated European Union \u2013 which countenances even the breakup of the UK.</p> <p>Fragmentation of the UK would of course leave the Welsh and the Scottish with a sharper sense of their political and cultural identity. Englishness, on the other hand, appears as foggy as ever. As the hunters of an authentic English national identity lurch towards a political climax, it seems worth asking: what is it all about?</p> <p>Englishness was always a form of theatre, first staged in overseas colonies. Discovering its traces in Rudyard Kipling and India, VS Naipaul remarked on how, \u201cat the height of their power, the British gave the impression of a people at play, a people playing at being English, playing at being English of a certain class\u201d. Today, in a post-imperial Britain run by half-witted public schoolboys, the English character seems even more, as Naipaul wrote, \u201ca creation of fantasy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a52625697aded859078c263bbef8c87ef73a6c0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a52625697aded859078c263bbef8c87ef73a6c0e/0_0_2573_3570/721.jpg\" alt=\"Dock workers outside the House of Commons in 1968.\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dock workers outside the House of Commons in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those such as Orwell, who saw through the fantasy, were usually mortified. He was born in Bihar in India to an opium agent, with a Caribbean slave-owner as an ancestor. While working as a colonial policeman in Burma, he discovered imperialism to be an \u201cevil despotism\u201d and Englishness to be a humiliating act: a pose of masculine authority and racial superiority necessary to keep volatile natives in their place. Others such as Enoch Powell, a lower middle-class native of the West Midlands, were seduced by this posture of stiff-upper-lipped preeminence. Powell became a classicist at Cambridge, taught himself fox-hunting, and wrote highly wrought Georgian verse; he exulted, as a brigadier, in the hierarchies of empire in India. Then, like Curzon, Milner, Cromer and other purveyors of an Englishness made in India and Egypt, he came to develop a certain rather fierce idea of England and its destiny.</p> <p>Orwell, on the other hand, was an archetype of the unpatriotic leftwinger on his return home \u2013 until he found a lodestone of native English genius in the \u201cred wall\u201d of northern England. The spirited English response to Hitler\u2019s vicious assault deepened his conviction of having discovered a new \u201cemotional unity\u201d in England \u2013 one that a socialist revolution could turn in favour of its downtrodden people. He persuaded himself that \u201cEngland, together with the rest of the world, is changing\u201d, and a new middle class blending in with the old working class would bring forth \u201cnew blood, new men, new ideas\u201d.</p> <p>War did indeed awaken a spirit of social egalitarianism, leading to Conservative defeat in 1945. Some of Orwell\u2019s proposals were partially implemented by the Attlee government. Still, there was always something too sanguine about the homecoming scenario of a deracinated intellectual. For, if England was a family, as Orwell claimed, with \u201crich relations who have to be kowtowed to, and poor relations who are horribly sat upon\u201d, then, as a range of foreign and English observers noted at the time, it was a family marked to an unusual degree by sadomasochistic relationships.</p> <p>JG Ballard, another disaffected child of imperialism, who arrived in England in 1946 after three years in a Japanese internment camp in Shanghai, was not only appalled by his country\u2019s \u201cgrotesque social division\u201d; he also marvelled at the \u201csystem of self-delusions\u201d that enabled a people comparable in their poor education, diet and grim housing to the menial toilers of Shanghai to give their lives to \u201can empire that had never been of the least benefit to them\u201d. \u201cThe English class system, which everyone secretly accepted, for reasons I have never understood,\u201d Ballard later wrote, was an \u201cinstrument of political control\u201d. Far from collaborating on revolution, the straitened middle class feared and despised the working classes, especially organised labour, and was obsessed with enforcing codes of behaviour that were \u201ccalculated to create a sense of overpowering deference\u201d.</p> <p>As for the upper class, the American critic Edmund Wilson noted in 1945 how its members manifested the \u201cappalling\u201d traits he had found in novels such as Thackeray\u2019s <em>Vanity Fair</em> and Butler\u2019s <em>The Way of All Flesh</em>: \u201cpassion for social privilege\u201d and \u201cdependence on inherited advantage\u201d. The great New Zealand memoirist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/30/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Janet Frame</a>, discussing the seemingly unbreakable social hierarchy of England\u2019s natives with other indigent New Zealanders and Australians in London in the 1950s, concluded: \u201cThey\u2019re in the Middle Ages.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Though as exploited as Indians, the English people, Orwell wrote, 'manifestly tolerated' their selfish, incompetent and often 'silly' ruling class</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cChange, I felt, was what England desperately needed,\u201d Ballard, reminiscing about the 1940s, wrote two years before his death in 2009, \u201cand I still feel it\u201d. Yet England\u2019s political and social system had long been premised on regulating change when it favoured the middle class, neutralising it when it was demanded by the working class, all the while safeguarding the unteachably stupid upper class. Walter Bagehot, the Economist editor with an acute phobia for England\u2019s poor and disenfranchised, put it frankly in 1867: the unwritten \u201cEnglish constitution in its palpable form is this \u2013 the mass of the people yield obedience to the select few\u201d; they \u201cdefer to what we may call the theatrical show of society\u201d.</p> <p>Discussing the role of the monarchy in this show, Bagehot was equally blunt: \u201cWe must not let in daylight upon magic.\u201d In other words, the masses of England were to be ruled by almost the same combination of pomp, bluff and repression that the natives of India were. The fossilised politics enjoyed greater legitimacy at home because the English had lived through much of the modern era as its winners, innovating industrially and expanding commercially before other countries; the mystique of British power commanded deference, while perpetuating such archaisms as a single parliament representing four nationalities. Though as exploited and defrauded as Indians, the English people, Orwell wrote, \u201cmanifestly tolerated\u201d their selfish, incompetent and often \u201csilly\u201d ruling class; the \u201cpost-war development of cheap luxuries\u201d in particular averted revolution.</p> <p>The Economist reassured itself in 1977: \u201cBritain\u2019s very stability, the beguiling flummery attending its institutions, hold most of its citizens in a trance of acceptance.\u201d But the trance had begun to break after 1945 when, instead of enlarging the realm on which the sun never set, the English began to retreat and, simultaneous with the loss of colonial territories, the colonised started to arrive in a war-ravaged England. Powell, among others, had cherished a starry-eyed notion of the empire as a large multiracial family (with white males on top). But the unstated proviso for the imperialist paterfamilias was always that the dark-skinned family members stay in their respective countries and not seek to live, work and marry white people in England. The new arrivals, prompted by the postwar need for NHS nurses, bus drivers and other workers, quickly exposed this separate-but-equal chicanery of the \u201cCommonwealth\u201d. Writing in 1953 to his wife, Naipaul summed up the hostile environment the British empire\u2019s previously invisible citizens confronted in England. Considered only \u201cfor jobs as porters in kitchens, and with the road gangs\u201d, the Oxford-educated Trinidadian had been reduced, he claimed, to a \u201cpoor wog, literally starving, and very cold\u201d with \u201cno fire in my room for two days and only tea &amp; toast in my stomach\u201d. \u201cThese people want to break my spirit,\u201d Naipaul wrote. \u201cThey want me to forget my dignity as a human being.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that most people from the colonies inhabited even lower depths of poverty, humiliation and despair had little effect on public opinion and policy. Racialised immigration acts were passed throughout the 60s; the poor \u201cwogs\u201d were also repeatedly put in their place by the police, the media and politicians. A Tory candidate in Powell\u2019s own stomping ground, the West Midlands, won his election in 1964 with the campaign slogan: \u201cIf you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.\u201d</p> <p>Still, those accustomed to lording it over dark-skinned natives in the outposts of empire could not be appeased. If, as Naipaul wrote, \u201cto be English in India was to be larger than life\u201d, then, to be English in multiracial England after 1945 was to know a devastating loss of manliness. Decolonisation had been outrageous enough for Powell, who had hoped as late as 1951 for Churchill to reconquer his great love, India. The appearance on English streets of dangerous savages against whom Englishness had been defined on the imperial frontier was just too much. The racial hierarchy in which he had forged his self was in danger of recalling the outbreak of virulent prejudice against Jewish immigrants of the period 1890-1905. As he put it in his 1968 \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech (quoting an unnamed, \u201cquite ordinary\u201d person), \u201cin this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man\u201d. There was also something intolerable about the fact that imperialism had become, if not a source of shame and embarrassment, then a subject for comedy and satire among a younger generation \u2013 summed up by the album cover of the Beatles\u2019 <em>Sgt</em><em> Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. Upstart darkies and cheekily androgynous Liverpudlians turned the 1960s into a hellish time for Powell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8026ad662ceffd63a5b952719a8b7785c95f20c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8026ad662ceffd63a5b952719a8b7785c95f20c/0_283_4798_2877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enoch Powell speaking at the 1968 Conservative Party Conference In Blackpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enoch Powell speaking at the 1968 Conservative Party conference in Blackpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dennis Hart/ANL/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat sort of people do we think we are?\u201d he thundered in 1967. One self-pitying answer was: a \u201cnation of ditherers\u201d. The following year, Powell mutated into a ventriloquist for the silent majority \u2013 members of the white working class who worried about immigration, and were denounced for their honesty as racist, and ignored by \u201cacademics, journalists, politicians and parties\u201d. In a classic sleight-of-hand of intellectual demagoguery, the former professor of ancient Greek claimed to be only articulating \u201cplain truths and commonsense\u201d that decent, ordinary people, bullied by a politically correct establishment, did not dare express.</p> <p>The usual temptation to hold foreigners and immigrants responsible for decline and stagnation was strong in England as postwar economic growth tapered off. In Kamala Markandaya\u2019s outstanding, recently republished novel <em>The Nowhere Man</em> (1972), which is set in the weeks around Powell\u2019s speech in April 1968, a white Londoner reduced to living with his wife\u2019s mother is greatly relieved to discover that black people are to blame for his luckless existence. \u201cA great light bursts upon\u201d him as he receives Powell\u2019s newly respectable wisdom: \u201cThey came in hordes, occupied all the houses, filled the hospital beds, and their offspring took all the places in schools.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in 1970, the journalist Paul Foot pointed out: \u201call that has changed is that new scapegoats must be found for the homelessness, the bad hospital conditions, and the overcrowded schools\u201d. Political theorist Tom Nairn cautioned, however, against the then common tendency to dismiss Powell as a posh race-baiter, or a moustached blast from the imperial past. Nairn pointed out that Powell, turning his back on an irretrievably lost empire, had set out to construct a post-imperial English nationalism with a mass base. The problem with English identity always was that it consisted of little more than a theatrical performance of brute power abroad by men of the imperial ruling class. It had lacked any broad content at home (notwithstanding Orwell\u2019s infusions of socialism and his belated patriotism). More ambitiously and successfully than Orwell, Powell was now forging a native English genius at home by defining it, initially at least, against emasculating foreigners.</p> <p>Nairn predicted a long-term future for Powellism, which, he wrote in 1970, \u201cactively stirs up conflict instead of conspiring to stifle or ignore it\u201d and in an existential crisis \u201ccan pull the whole of the official structure of British politics in his direction\u201d. In retrospect, Powell himself charted the high English road to Powellism, as he invested his zeal for stark antagonism in Ulster Unionism, neoliberalism and, finally, Europhobia: \u201cBelonging to the common market,\u201d he wrote in 1975, \u201cspells living death, the abandonment of all prospect of national rebirth, the end of any possibility of resurgence.\u201d</p> <p>\u00b6</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"640dc9f65b9cb9602a6fee97ef15f26e8b841098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/640dc9f65b9cb9602a6fee97ef15f26e8b841098/0_94_8767_5260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"School children playing together in Southall, London, in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">School children playing together in Southall, London, in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Henshaw/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A very different destiny for England, which did not involve quacks vending pills for imperial-era virility, was always likely. The possibilities lay in its multi-racial experience \u2013 something genuinely new in England since Orwell\u2019s time. Some of the early arrivals were deeply damaged by it, such as Naipaul, who escaped from the humiliations of \u201cwog-hood\u201d into the company of those gratified by his scorn for \u201cwogs\u201d. But many others came to attest to the potential of much more fluid post-imperial identities. \u201cI am an Englishman, born and bred almost,\u201d the protagonist Karim Amir declares in Hanif Kureishi\u2019s <em>The Buddha of Suburbia</em> (1990).</p> <p>Yet it was, significantly, Powellism that steadily built up to its present political apotheosis in Brexit \u2013 through the Thatcher-Blair years of deregulation and privatisation, a hardening political consensus against immigration, a tabloidised culture of journalism and demented Tory EU-baiting, all assisted by the propaganda empire of an Australian media tycoon almost as committed to a politics of xenophobia as his father, a stalwart of Keep Australia White.</p> <p>Until such time it could hunker down in Westminster, Powell\u2019s hyperbolic Englishness renovated its original home in the realm of kitsch. In Julian Barnes\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1998/aug/30/fiction.julianbarnes1\" title=\"\">England, England</a></em>, a marketing company desperate to make money out of a country in rapid decay decides to build a theme park of Englishness on the Isle of Wight. A tycoon modelled on Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell persuades the royal family to move to a more up-to-date copy of Buckingham Palace as real England collapses into pre-industrial squalor.</p> <p><em>England, England</em>, published a year after Princess Diana died and the Millennium Dome began construction, now seems a timely meditation on the fate of English identity. Englishness had descended deeper into parody throughout the 80s and 90s, as a Sloane Ranger princess let in too much daylight on the magic of the monarchy, and the devolutionary demands of Scotland and Wales uncovered the many faultlines in the notion of Britishness. Many a cultural and intellectual entrepreneur emerged during these decades, ranging from St George flag manufacturers to Churchill fanboys, hectically retailing Englishness, and elaborating Powellism in highbrow as well as lowbrow modes.</p> <p>Roger Scruton, the philosopher and author of <em>England: An Elegy</em>, took up Powell\u2019s lament about the despoliation of England, giving it a neo-pastoralist orientation. Scruton, who shared Powell\u2019s ancestry in northern England\u2019s lower middle class, reinvented himself as a fox-hunting squire, as prone to defend public schools from his own Labour-voting father\u2019s \u201cresentment\u201d as to sneer at the people who \u201clitter the country with their illegitimate, uncared for and state-subsidised offspring\u201d. As Tory-New Labour free-marketeering eviscerated traditional communities and social bonds, Scruton chose to deplore the loss of the stiff upper lip that \u201cwent with imperial pride\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ecab6fcff9401fdf10962c7ee108ef138843114\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ecab6fcff9401fdf10962c7ee108ef138843114/1_36_1316_1572/837.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited (1981)\" width=\"837\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Andrews and Jeremy Irons in <em>Brideshead Revisited</em> (1981).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scruton in this mode embodied two of the \u201cquintessences\u201d of Englishness identified by Barnes in <em>England, England</em>: \u201csnobbery\u201d and \u201cwhingeing\u201d. Nevertheless, the vendors of Englishness had judged their market well in the age of Reagan and Thatcher, when the passion for social privilege became <em>de rigeur</em>. A televised version of <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>, a novel breathless in its adoration of the well born, and contempt for everyone else, became one of the biggest British cultural exports to the US since the Beatles. Bedazzled by Jeremy Irons and Castle Howard, Ralph Lauren repackaged country-house <em>poshlost</em> for Americans, and even sold it back to the already Barboured English.</p> <p>The Raj<em>,</em> lavishly filmed in the 1980s, reappeared in the English imagination as an aesthetic spectacle, provoking awe rather than embarrassment. Many Americans succumbed to this imperial chic as well; and made it more lucrative. Emerging just in time to cash in on empire-mania, Banana Republic\u2019s range of khaki colonial wear offered an opportunity to vicariously quell, in jodhpurs and pith helmets, the mutinous natives of Sind and Punjab. In this sense, those British chancers who later crossed the Atlantic to exhort Americans to re-establish empire, and offer their expertise in governing Basra and Helmand, were only following the money.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like Enoch Powell, Boris Johnson presents himself as the saviour of England\u2019s matchless destiny against the ditherers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Arguments for carnage in Mesopotamia certainly sounded more persuasive when made with the Oxbridge cocksureness of a Christopher Hitchens, the Orwell du jour. Indeed, Englishness as a mode of glamorously aloof and omnisciently clever elitism became one of England\u2019s chief exports. Orwell had railed against England\u2019s \u201cidle rich\u201d, \u201cliving on money that was invested they hardly knew where\u201d, and \u201cwhose photographs you can look at in the Tatler \u2026 always supposing that you want to\u201d. Benefiting from a zeitgeist of feeling intensely relaxed about the filthy rich, Tatler\u2019s circulation rose, and international editions bloomed, ushering the tuxedoed and begowned demi-monde of Jakarta and Manila into the pleasures of Cool Britannia.</p> <p>Old English nurseries of the imperial ruling class such as Harrow and Wellington opened franchises in Thailand and China, offering to transmit solemn lessons of white supremacy to crazy rich Asians. Two London-based publications run by the Oxbridge elite, the Economist and Financial Times, became the most widely consulted how-to manuals of financial globalisation, sagely instructing wannabes how to think and feel like the filthy rich, and even how to spend it.</p> <p>\u00b6</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c66409c186b17c39f415ad224c1891aac66b1db8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c66409c186b17c39f415ad224c1891aac66b1db8/185_234_4941_2964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-Brexit protesters demonstrating in Westminster on 31 October 2019 in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-Brexit protesters demonstrating in Westminster on 31 October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Ballard\u2019s last novels, England is reduced to offering up its cultural icons for Disneyfication to the world while preparing itself for authoritarian populism. The reality now seems to have closely approximated Ballard\u2019s dystopic fiction all along. For, while Hugh Grant\u2019s dimpled grin advertised the charms of the English family, its precious silver was being sold off. In a process witnessed in no other major western country, many great emblems of national power, prestige and glamour \u2013 British Steel, Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin, Bentley, Jaguar, Debenhams, British Home Stores, HMV, Cadbury, Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Hamleys \u2013 have either disappeared or gone into foreign hands since the 1980s. In September Thomas Cook, which once sold holidays to Churchill, became insolvent, stranding thousands of customers abroad and forcing the government to mount its biggest civilian rescue operation since Dunkirk.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With Brexiters in the ascendant, politically as well as culturally, the triumph of Powellism is complete</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is only in such a \u201cstagnant, involuted atmosphere of a world near the end of its tether\u201d that Powellism would become hegemonic, Tom Nairn predicted in 1970, healing wounded English pride with reactionary balm, and appealing \u201cto the (perfectly justified) national feeling of frustration and anger\u201d. More importantly, \u201cbecause this feeling is so inarticulate, and so divorced from the genteel cliches of the establishment\u201d, Powellism could \u201csuggest convincingly that something is profoundly wrong and that something must be done about it\u201d.</p> <p>As Boris Johnson never tires of repeating: Get Brexit Done. Nothing like a dose of hard Brexit, he suggests, to toughen the national mind and body for the bracing climb to the sunny uplands of Empire 2.0. Like Powell, he presents himself as the saviour of England\u2019s matchless destiny against the ditherers. And, election rhetoric notwithstanding, he shares Powell\u2019s and the Brexiters\u2019 conviction that a higher dose of deregulation and privatisation will make England great again. More disingenuously than Powell, he ridicules the piccaninnies as well as the aliens in black letterboxes, and reaches out to the Home Counties colonels with promises to lock up swarthy criminals and throw away the key. There should be no mistaking the neo-fascistic cults of unity and potency he promotes, and the insidious forms they assume in England\u2019s tabloidised media.</p> <p>In Ballard\u2019s last novel, <em>Kingdom Come</em> (2006), which drew inspiration from Robert O Paxton\u2019s classic book <em>The Anatomy of Fascism</em>, English nationalism turns sadistically against those Powell stigmatised as hostile aliens. However, violent racism, which has exploded in recent years, is not nearly as sinister as the steady hardening of Powellite verities into bien pensant opinion. Centrist dads as much as unteachable Brexiters are likely to invoke his much victimised silent majority of ordinary, decent men, dispossessed by immigrants and then gagged by politically correct academics and journalists. Thus, as Simon Jenkins recently stated in the Guardian, Brexit \u201cwas about how far Britons can define and protect the character of where they live\u201d.</p> <p>With Brexiters in the ascendant, politically as well as culturally, the triumph of Powellism is complete. But we may be looking at an instance, to borrow a term from the Bush administration, of \u201ccatastrophic success\u201d. For Powellism remains, in its moment of hegemony, a symptom of rather than a cure for the seemingly insoluble crisis that Orwell diagnosed: the dwindling material basis of an ex-imperialist country that is unable to break, in a globalised world, with its antique assumptions of power and self-sufficiency, and whose fundamentally cynical Bagehotian mode of politics, in which the will of the few was passed off as the will of the many, is broken, unable to innovate and deal with change, or defuse the anger of those victimised for so long by social and economic inequity.</p> <p>\u201cThe life of nations,\u201d Powell argued, \u201cno less than that of men is lived largely in the imagination.\u201d But nations that are too extravagantly imagined eventually pay a steep price for their system of self-delusions. Postcolonial India turns on itself in fury and frustration as its dream of power and glory explodes. England\u2019s post-imperial self-reckoning feels harsher, largely because it has been postponed for so long, and the memories of power and glory are so ineradicable. In the meantime, the most important elections of our lifetime approach, and, as Orwell warned, \u201ca generation of the unteachable is hanging upon us like a necklace of corpses\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe have got to fight against privilege,\u201d George Orwell exhorted in 1941, \u201cagainst the notion that a half-witted public schoolboy is better for command than an intelligent mechanic.\u201d England, he wrote, is governed by an \u201cunteachable\u201d ruling class that too frequently escapes into \u201cstupidity\u201d, failing to see \u201cthat an economic system in which land, factories, mines and transport are owned privately and operated solely for profit ... does not work.\u201d Only a socialist revolution, he continued, could unleash the \u201cnative genius of the English people\u201d. Of course, \u201cthe bankers and the larger businessmen, the landowners and dividend-drawers, the officials with their prehensile bottoms, will obstruct for all they are worth\u201d. But, never mind: \u201cif the rich squeal audibly, so much the better\u201d. One measure of how little has changed is that Orwell\u2019s diagnosis of the country he called a \u201crich man\u2019s paradise\u201d \u2013 and even his specific prescriptions: nationalisation of basic industries, abolition of hereditary privilege, educational reform and punitive taxation of offensively unequal incomes \u2013 still resonates, almost eight decades later, as the United Kingdom goes to the polls. The long English past of entrenched privilege and extreme inequality is back, if it ever went away. The problems stemming from archaic political and social structures, and an economy geared to further enriching the rich, seem even more intractable. At the same time, the wartime English patriotism that Orwell tried to alchemise into socialism as highly intelligent Germans tried to kill him has degenerated into self-destructive nihilism during the Tory onslaught on a German-dominated European Union \u2013 which countenances even the breakup of the UK. Fragmentation of the UK would of course leave the Welsh and the Scottish with a sharper sense of their political and cultural identity. Englishness, on the other hand, appears as foggy as ever. As the hunters of an authentic English national identity lurch towards a political climax, it seems worth asking: what is it all about? Englishness was always a form of theatre, first staged in overseas colonies. Discovering its traces in Rudyard Kipling and India, VS Naipaul remarked on how, \u201cat the height of their power, the British gave the impression of a people at play, a people playing at being English, playing at being English of a certain class\u201d. Today, in a post-imperial Britain run by half-witted public schoolboys, the English character seems even more, as Naipaul wrote, \u201ca creation of fantasy\u201d. Those such as Orwell, who saw through the fantasy, were usually mortified. He was born in Bihar in India to an opium agent, with a Caribbean slave-owner as an ancestor. While working as a colonial policeman in Burma, he discovered imperialism to be an \u201cevil despotism\u201d and Englishness to be a humiliating act: a pose of masculine authority and racial superiority necessary to keep volatile natives in their place. Others such as Enoch Powell, a lower middle-class native of the West Midlands, were seduced by this posture of stiff-upper-lipped preeminence. Powell became a classicist at Cambridge, taught himself fox-hunting, and wrote highly wrought Georgian verse; he exulted, as a brigadier, in the hierarchies of empire in India. Then, like Curzon, Milner, Cromer and other purveyors of an Englishness made in India and Egypt, he came to develop a certain rather fierce idea of England and its destiny. Orwell, on the other hand, was an archetype of the unpatriotic leftwinger on his return home \u2013 until he found a lodestone of native English genius in the \u201cred wall\u201d of northern England. The spirited English response to Hitler\u2019s vicious assault deepened his conviction of having discovered a new \u201cemotional unity\u201d in England \u2013 one that a socialist revolution could turn in favour of its downtrodden people. He persuaded himself that \u201cEngland, together with the rest of the world, is changing\u201d, and a new middle class blending in with the old working class would bring forth \u201cnew blood, new men, new ideas\u201d. War did indeed awaken a spirit of social egalitarianism, leading to Conservative defeat in 1945. Some of Orwell\u2019s proposals were partially implemented by the Attlee government. Still, there was always something too sanguine about the homecoming scenario of a deracinated intellectual. For, if England was a family, as Orwell claimed, with \u201crich relations who have to be kowtowed to, and poor relations who are horribly sat upon\u201d, then, as a range of foreign and English observers noted at the time, it was a family marked to an unusual degree by sadomasochistic relationships. JG Ballard, another disaffected child of imperialism, who arrived in England in 1946 after three years in a Japanese internment camp in Shanghai, was not only appalled by his country\u2019s \u201cgrotesque social division\u201d; he also marvelled at the \u201csystem of self-delusions\u201d that enabled a people comparable in their poor education, diet and grim housing to the menial toilers of Shanghai to give their lives to \u201can empire that had never been of the least benefit to them\u201d. \u201cThe English class system, which everyone secretly accepted, for reasons I have never understood,\u201d Ballard later wrote, was an \u201cinstrument of political control\u201d. Far from collaborating on revolution, the straitened middle class feared and despised the working classes, especially organised labour, and was obsessed with enforcing codes of behaviour that were \u201ccalculated to create a sense of overpowering deference\u201d. As for the upper class, the American critic Edmund Wilson noted in 1945 how its members manifested the \u201cappalling\u201d traits he had found in novels such as Thackeray\u2019s Vanity Fair and Butler\u2019s The Way of All Flesh: \u201cpassion for social privilege\u201d and \u201cdependence on inherited advantage\u201d. The great New Zealand memoirist Janet Frame, discussing the seemingly unbreakable social hierarchy of England\u2019s natives with other indigent New Zealanders and Australians in London in the 1950s, concluded: \u201cThey\u2019re in the Middle Ages.\u201d \u201cChange, I felt, was what England desperately needed,\u201d Ballard, reminiscing about the 1940s, wrote two years before his death in 2009, \u201cand I still feel it\u201d. Yet England\u2019s political and social system had long been premised on regulating change when it favoured the middle class, neutralising it when it was demanded by the working class, all the while safeguarding the unteachably stupid upper class. Walter Bagehot, the Economist editor with an acute phobia for England\u2019s poor and disenfranchised, put it frankly in 1867: the unwritten \u201cEnglish constitution in its palpable form is this \u2013 the mass of the people yield obedience to the select few\u201d; they \u201cdefer to what we may call the theatrical show of society\u201d. Discussing the role of the monarchy in this show, Bagehot was equally blunt: \u201cWe must not let in daylight upon magic.\u201d In other words, the masses of England were to be ruled by almost the same combination of pomp, bluff and repression that the natives of India were. The fossilised politics enjoyed greater legitimacy at home because the English had lived through much of the modern era as its winners, innovating industrially and expanding commercially before other countries; the mystique of British power commanded deference, while perpetuating such archaisms as a single parliament representing four nationalities. Though as exploited and defrauded as Indians, the English people, Orwell wrote, \u201cmanifestly tolerated\u201d their selfish, incompetent and often \u201csilly\u201d ruling class; the \u201cpost-war development of cheap luxuries\u201d in particular averted revolution. The Economist reassured itself in 1977: \u201cBritain\u2019s very stability, the beguiling flummery attending its institutions, hold most of its citizens in a trance of acceptance.\u201d But the trance had begun to break after 1945 when, instead of enlarging the realm on which the sun never set, the English began to retreat and, simultaneous with the loss of colonial territories, the colonised started to arrive in a war-ravaged England. Powell, among others, had cherished a starry-eyed notion of the empire as a large multiracial family (with white males on top). But the unstated proviso for the imperialist paterfamilias was always that the dark-skinned family members stay in their respective countries and not seek to live, work and marry white people in England. The new arrivals, prompted by the postwar need for NHS nurses, bus drivers and other workers, quickly exposed this separate-but-equal chicanery of the \u201cCommonwealth\u201d. Writing in 1953 to his wife, Naipaul summed up the hostile environment the British empire\u2019s previously invisible citizens confronted in England. Considered only \u201cfor jobs as porters in kitchens, and with the road gangs\u201d, the Oxford-educated Trinidadian had been reduced, he claimed, to a \u201cpoor wog, literally starving, and very cold\u201d with \u201cno fire in my room for two days and only tea &amp; toast in my stomach\u201d. \u201cThese people want to break my spirit,\u201d Naipaul wrote. \u201cThey want me to forget my dignity as a human being.\u201d The fact that most people from the colonies inhabited even lower depths of poverty, humiliation and despair had little effect on public opinion and policy. Racialised immigration acts were passed throughout the 60s; the poor \u201cwogs\u201d were also repeatedly put in their place by the police, the media and politicians. A Tory candidate in Powell\u2019s own stomping ground, the West Midlands, won his election in 1964 with the campaign slogan: \u201cIf you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.\u201d Still, those accustomed to lording it over dark-skinned natives in the outposts of empire could not be appeased. If, as Naipaul wrote, \u201cto be English in India was to be larger than life\u201d, then, to be English in multiracial England after 1945 was to know a devastating loss of manliness. Decolonisation had been outrageous enough for Powell, who had hoped as late as 1951 for Churchill to reconquer his great love, India. The appearance on English streets of dangerous savages against whom Englishness had been defined on the imperial frontier was just too much. The racial hierarchy in which he had forged his self was in danger of recalling the outbreak of virulent prejudice against Jewish immigrants of the period 1890-1905. As he put it in his 1968 \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech (quoting an unnamed, \u201cquite ordinary\u201d person), \u201cin this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man\u201d. There was also something intolerable about the fact that imperialism had become, if not a source of shame and embarrassment, then a subject for comedy and satire among a younger generation \u2013 summed up by the album cover of the Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Upstart darkies and cheekily androgynous Liverpudlians turned the 1960s into a hellish time for Powell. \u201cWhat sort of people do we think we are?\u201d he thundered in 1967. One self-pitying answer was: a \u201cnation of ditherers\u201d. The following year, Powell mutated into a ventriloquist for the silent majority \u2013 members of the white working class who worried about immigration, and were denounced for their honesty as racist, and ignored by \u201cacademics, journalists, politicians and parties\u201d. In a classic sleight-of-hand of intellectual demagoguery, the former professor of ancient Greek claimed to be only articulating \u201cplain truths and commonsense\u201d that decent, ordinary people, bullied by a politically correct establishment, did not dare express. The usual temptation to hold foreigners and immigrants responsible for decline and stagnation was strong in England as postwar economic growth tapered off. In Kamala Markandaya\u2019s outstanding, recently republished novel The Nowhere Man (1972), which is set in the weeks around Powell\u2019s speech in April 1968, a white Londoner reduced to living with his wife\u2019s mother is greatly relieved to discover that black people are to blame for his luckless existence. \u201cA great light bursts upon\u201d him as he receives Powell\u2019s newly respectable wisdom: \u201cThey came in hordes, occupied all the houses, filled the hospital beds, and their offspring took all the places in schools.\u201d Writing in 1970, the journalist Paul Foot pointed out: \u201call that has changed is that new scapegoats must be found for the homelessness, the bad hospital conditions, and the overcrowded schools\u201d. Political theorist Tom Nairn cautioned, however, against the then common tendency to dismiss Powell as a posh race-baiter, or a moustached blast from the imperial past. Nairn pointed out that Powell, turning his back on an irretrievably lost empire, had set out to construct a post-imperial English nationalism with a mass base. The problem with English identity always was that it consisted of little more than a theatrical performance of brute power abroad by men of the imperial ruling class. It had lacked any broad content at home (notwithstanding Orwell\u2019s infusions of socialism and his belated patriotism). More ambitiously and successfully than Orwell, Powell was now forging a native English genius at home by defining it, initially at least, against emasculating foreigners. Nairn predicted a long-term future for Powellism, which, he wrote in 1970, \u201cactively stirs up conflict instead of conspiring to stifle or ignore it\u201d and in an existential crisis \u201ccan pull the whole of the official structure of British politics in his direction\u201d. In retrospect, Powell himself charted the high English road to Powellism, as he invested his zeal for stark antagonism in Ulster Unionism, neoliberalism and, finally, Europhobia: \u201cBelonging to the common market,\u201d he wrote in 1975, \u201cspells living death, the abandonment of all prospect of national rebirth, the end of any possibility of resurgence.\u201d \u00b6 A very different destiny for England, which did not involve quacks vending pills for imperial-era virility, was always likely. The possibilities lay in its multi-racial experience \u2013 something genuinely new in England since Orwell\u2019s time. Some of the early arrivals were deeply damaged by it, such as Naipaul, who escaped from the humiliations of \u201cwog-hood\u201d into the company of those gratified by his scorn for \u201cwogs\u201d. But many others came to attest to the potential of much more fluid post-imperial identities. \u201cI am an Englishman, born and bred almost,\u201d the protagonist Karim Amir declares in Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia (1990). Yet it was, significantly, Powellism that steadily built up to its present political apotheosis in Brexit \u2013 through the Thatcher-Blair years of deregulation and privatisation, a hardening political consensus against immigration, a tabloidised culture of journalism and demented Tory EU-baiting, all assisted by the propaganda empire of an Australian media tycoon almost as committed to a politics of xenophobia as his father, a stalwart of Keep Australia White. Until such time it could hunker down in Westminster, Powell\u2019s hyperbolic Englishness renovated its original home in the realm of kitsch. In Julian Barnes\u2019s England, England, a marketing company desperate to make money out of a country in rapid decay decides to build a theme park of Englishness on the Isle of Wight. A tycoon modelled on Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell persuades the royal family to move to a more up-to-date copy of Buckingham Palace as real England collapses into pre-industrial squalor. England, England, published a year after Princess Diana died and the Millennium Dome began construction, now seems a timely meditation on the fate of English identity. Englishness had descended deeper into parody throughout the 80s and 90s, as a Sloane Ranger princess let in too much daylight on the magic of the monarchy, and the devolutionary demands of Scotland and Wales uncovered the many faultlines in the notion of Britishness. Many a cultural and intellectual entrepreneur emerged during these decades, ranging from St George flag manufacturers to Churchill fanboys, hectically retailing Englishness, and elaborating Powellism in highbrow as well as lowbrow modes. Roger Scruton, the philosopher and author of England: An Elegy, took up Powell\u2019s lament about the despoliation of England, giving it a neo-pastoralist orientation. Scruton, who shared Powell\u2019s ancestry in northern England\u2019s lower middle class, reinvented himself as a fox-hunting squire, as prone to defend public schools from his own Labour-voting father\u2019s \u201cresentment\u201d as to sneer at the people who \u201clitter the country with their illegitimate, uncared for and state-subsidised offspring\u201d. As Tory-New Labour free-marketeering eviscerated traditional communities and social bonds, Scruton chose to deplore the loss of the stiff upper lip that \u201cwent with imperial pride\u201d. Scruton in this mode embodied two of the \u201cquintessences\u201d of Englishness identified by Barnes in England, England: \u201csnobbery\u201d and \u201cwhingeing\u201d. Nevertheless, the vendors of Englishness had judged their market well in the age of Reagan and Thatcher, when the passion for social privilege became de rigeur. A televised version of Brideshead Revisited, a novel breathless in its adoration of the well born, and contempt for everyone else, became one of the biggest British cultural exports to the US since the Beatles. Bedazzled by Jeremy Irons and Castle Howard, Ralph Lauren repackaged country-house poshlost for Americans, and even sold it back to the already Barboured English. The Raj, lavishly filmed in the 1980s, reappeared in the English imagination as an aesthetic spectacle, provoking awe rather than embarrassment. Many Americans succumbed to this imperial chic as well; and made it more lucrative. Emerging just in time to cash in on empire-mania, Banana Republic\u2019s range of khaki colonial wear offered an opportunity to vicariously quell, in jodhpurs and pith helmets, the mutinous natives of Sind and Punjab. In this sense, those British chancers who later crossed the Atlantic to exhort Americans to re-establish empire, and offer their expertise in governing Basra and Helmand, were only following the money. Arguments for carnage in Mesopotamia certainly sounded more persuasive when made with the Oxbridge cocksureness of a Christopher Hitchens, the Orwell du jour. Indeed, Englishness as a mode of glamorously aloof and omnisciently clever elitism became one of England\u2019s chief exports. Orwell had railed against England\u2019s \u201cidle rich\u201d, \u201cliving on money that was invested they hardly knew where\u201d, and \u201cwhose photographs you can look at in the Tatler \u2026 always supposing that you want to\u201d. Benefiting from a zeitgeist of feeling intensely relaxed about the filthy rich, Tatler\u2019s circulation rose, and international editions bloomed, ushering the tuxedoed and begowned demi-monde of Jakarta and Manila into the pleasures of Cool Britannia. Old English nurseries of the imperial ruling class such as Harrow and Wellington opened franchises in Thailand and China, offering to transmit solemn lessons of white supremacy to crazy rich Asians. Two London-based publications run by the Oxbridge elite, the Economist and Financial Times, became the most widely consulted how-to manuals of financial globalisation, sagely instructing wannabes how to think and feel like the filthy rich, and even how to spend it. \u00b6 In Ballard\u2019s last novels, England is reduced to offering up its cultural icons for Disneyfication to the world while preparing itself for authoritarian populism. The reality now seems to have closely approximated Ballard\u2019s dystopic fiction all along. For, while Hugh Grant\u2019s dimpled grin advertised the charms of the English family, its precious silver was being sold off. In a process witnessed in no other major western country, many great emblems of national power, prestige and glamour \u2013 British Steel, Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin, Bentley, Jaguar, Debenhams, British Home Stores, HMV, Cadbury, Gieves &amp; Hawkes, Hamleys \u2013 have either disappeared or gone into foreign hands since the 1980s. In September Thomas Cook, which once sold holidays to Churchill, became insolvent, stranding thousands of customers abroad and forcing the government to mount its biggest civilian rescue operation since Dunkirk. It is only in such a \u201cstagnant, involuted atmosphere of a world near the end of its tether\u201d that Powellism would become hegemonic, Tom Nairn predicted in 1970, healing wounded English pride with reactionary balm, and appealing \u201cto the (perfectly justified) national feeling of frustration and anger\u201d. More importantly, \u201cbecause this feeling is so inarticulate, and so divorced from the genteel cliches of the establishment\u201d, Powellism could \u201csuggest convincingly that something is profoundly wrong and that something must be done about it\u201d. As Boris Johnson never tires of repeating: Get Brexit Done. Nothing like a dose of hard Brexit, he suggests, to toughen the national mind and body for the bracing climb to the sunny uplands of Empire 2.0. Like Powell, he presents himself as the saviour of England\u2019s matchless destiny against the ditherers. And, election rhetoric notwithstanding, he shares Powell\u2019s and the Brexiters\u2019 conviction that a higher dose of deregulation and privatisation will make England great again. More disingenuously than Powell, he ridicules the piccaninnies as well as the aliens in black letterboxes, and reaches out to the Home Counties colonels with promises to lock up swarthy criminals and throw away the key. There should be no mistaking the neo-fascistic cults of unity and potency he promotes, and the insidious forms they assume in England\u2019s tabloidised media. In Ballard\u2019s last novel, Kingdom Come (2006), which drew inspiration from Robert O Paxton\u2019s classic book The Anatomy of Fascism, English nationalism turns sadistically against those Powell stigmatised as hostile aliens. However, violent racism, which has exploded in recent years, is not nearly as sinister as the steady hardening of Powellite verities into bien pensant opinion. Centrist dads as much as unteachable Brexiters are likely to invoke his much victimised silent majority of ordinary, decent men, dispossessed by immigrants and then gagged by politically correct academics and journalists. Thus, as Simon Jenkins recently stated in the Guardian, Brexit \u201cwas about how far Britons can define and protect the character of where they live\u201d. With Brexiters in the ascendant, politically as well as culturally, the triumph of Powellism is complete. But we may be looking at an instance, to borrow a term from the Bush administration, of \u201ccatastrophic success\u201d. For Powellism remains, in its moment of hegemony, a symptom of rather than a cure for the seemingly insoluble crisis that Orwell diagnosed: the dwindling material basis of an ex-imperialist country that is unable to break, in a globalised world, with its antique assumptions of power and self-sufficiency, and whose fundamentally cynical Bagehotian mode of politics, in which the will of the few was passed off as the will of the many, is broken, unable to innovate and deal with change, or defuse the anger of those victimised for so long by social and economic inequity. \u201cThe life of nations,\u201d Powell argued, \u201cno less than that of men is lived largely in the imagination.\u201d But nations that are too extravagantly imagined eventually pay a steep price for their system of self-delusions. Postcolonial India turns on itself in fury and frustration as its dream of power and glory explodes. England\u2019s post-imperial self-reckoning feels harsher, largely because it has been postponed for so long, and the memories of power and glory are so ineradicable. In the meantime, the most important elections of our lifetime approach, and, as Orwell warned, \u201ca generation of the unteachable is hanging upon us like a necklace of corpses\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "December has always felt like a month for movie musicals. The TV schedules start filling up with them as the year winds down, while in cinemas, lavish new musicals almost always wait until the final month of the year to spring themselves on tipsy, receptive audiences. This year, Cats fills the noble Christmas-time slot previously taken by the likes of Les Miserables and The Greatest Showman. The British Film Institute\u2019s blockbuster musicals season (titled simply, but with apt jazz-hands punctuation, \u201cMusicals!\u201d), has been well timed, beginning in October but crescendoing just as everyone kicks back for Christmas. For those who can\u2019t get to participating cinemas, however, the BFI Player offers a generous slice of the programme to stream at home \u2013 a cosier option that, for one thing, allows you to sing along as lustily as you like. The selection ranges from obvious big, sparkly Hollywood extravaganzas to more lateral, independent interpretations. Tsai Ming-liang\u2019s dreamily unclassifiable object The Wayward Cloud, with its shuffling kaleidoscope of erotica, watermelon fetishism and sprightly choreographed numbers, is several planets apart from An American in Paris, for example, but they fall under the same bright umbrella here. BFI Player subscribers get exclusive access to the more leftfield selections, but the bulk of the films are available on an inexpensive pay-per-view basis. (A selection of curios and British musical shorts, furthermore, can be streamed free.) The real star attraction here \u2013 assuming you don\u2019t need to be pointed once more to deathless favourites like Singin\u2019 in the Rain \u2013 is Gold Diggers of 1933, the ne plus ultra in Busby Berkeley-choreographed spectacle, with its vast, meringue-like arrangements of whirling, wide-skirted dancers, marching soldiers and shimmering, gold-plated showgirls. The production numbers for the Shadow Waltz or We\u2019re in the Money are more eye-poppingly elaborate than almost any from its era, to say nothing of now: it makes Chicago look positively Loachian by comparison. The joy of it, though, goes past the sizzle and dazzle. Made in Hollywood\u2019s more permissive pre-Code age, its story of women on the hunt for rich husbands \u2013 amid the usual \u201clet\u2019s put on a show\u201d shenanigans \u2013 is bracing in its tart, cynical sexual and economic politics, and wickedly funny too. It would make an amusing double bill with The Boy Friend, Ken Russell\u2019s typically full-tilt-bananas go at capturing the spirit and decadence of Berkeley\u2019s musicals, albeit with fumes of its own era\u2019s psychedelia. It\u2019s doting pastiche that is now its own kitsch 1971 time capsule, staged with hilarious vampy excess throughout \u2013 with Twiggy sweetly and surprisingly radiant as a flip-haired flapper. Or for a more bittersweet take on postmodern musical nostalgia, try Herbert Ross\u2019s eternally underrated and under-screened version of Dennis Potter\u2019s Pennies from Heaven, with a brilliantly cast Steve Martin bringing just the right edge of wry, rueful darkness to its depression-era tale of a failing sheet music salesman escaping into showbiz delusions: exquisitely shot and staged, it\u2019s the rare Americanisation of a British property that enriches its source. (They also have the leaden, Robert Downey Jr-starring film version of Potter\u2019s The Singing Detective: watch only for morbid comparison, if at all.) Still, as the holiday nears, you\u2019ll probably want less compromised musical pleasures, which the programme offers in spades. The Judy Garland retrospective we began in October can continue with the fizzy delights Ziegfeld Follies and Summer Stock, another fleet-footed Gene Kelly collaboration. Otherwise, Lena Horne singing Honey in the Honeycomb is a transcendent vision in the it\u2019s-a-wonderful-afterlife romp Cabin in the Sky, a rare all-black musical from the studio era. Or bring things up to date with John Cameron Mitchell\u2019s vibrant, punkish, life-giving East Germany-era transgender rock opera Hedwig and the Angry Inch: if telly falls back on failsafes like Mary Poppins this festive season, it\u2019s good to have alternative musical options. Also new to streaming and DVD Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (Sony, 18) Quentin Tarantino\u2019s sun-gilded Los Angeles memory piece is a rambling, roving, shaggy-dog delight for two hours, with a brash, clock-stopping finale that aims to divide opinion: I checked out, but others will ride with it. Blinded By the Light (Universal, 12) Gurinder Chadha\u2019s bouncily nostalgic jukebox comedy is an appealing concept \u2014 a British-Pakistani kid\u2019s coming of age in Thatcher-era Luton, set to the roaring Americana of Springsteen \u2014 in search of slightly snappier execution. Now, Voyager (Sony, E) The grandmama of golden-age Hollywood weepies, following Bette Davis\u2019s trajectory from hard-up spinster to elegantly lovelorn society lady, gets a fully varnished Criterion Collection release: that swooning, iconic Max Steiner score couldn\u2019t sound crisper. Hail Satan? (Netflix, 15) Some canny seasonal counter-programming by Netflix: Penny Lane\u2019s playful but penetrating documentary takes the devout eccentrics of the Satanic Temple quite seriously, probing the liberal ideals beneath the sinister theatre of it all. Dora and the Lost City of Gold (Universal, PG) File under \u201cwow, this is surprisingly un-terrible\u201d: this live-action adaptation of the ubiquitous kids\u2019 cartoon has been aged up a bit into a sweet-natured family adventure with some gusto and gumption. Blue Collar (Powerhouse, 18) A sharp Blu-ray rerelease for Paul Schrader\u2019s lean, still-powerful directorial debut, a working-class crime drama from the American rust belt that makes particularly vivid, cast-against-type use of comedian Richard Pryor.",

      "body": "<p>As the body politic convulses, as the abyss avoids our gaze, we near the end of another election at the behest of a political class that has paid as much attention to David Cameron\u2019s fixed terms as he did to people with emphysema slowly dying over a wood lathe. Christmas seems a strange time for a Tory government to call an election; possibly they guessed that it would be hard for Labour to sell hope in winter; possibly they judged that goodwill to all men would be at its lowest after people had endured a December of accidentally answering the door to a canvasser because they thought it was an Amazon package. Then again, Conservatives would say that the story of Christmas chimes with their values, as it involves a pregnant refugee being treated quite badly.</p> <p>Brexit supporters are surely among the most likely to get out and vote, especially now Jeremy Kyle isn\u2019t on in the daytime any more. It was impossible to predict that the whole country would be thrown into crisis by middle-aged men outraged about Europe making decisions for them (these are people whose wives buy their socks), but I can understand their subsequent disillusionment. If <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/early-election\" title=\"\">434 MPs vote for a general election</a>, we instantly get one; if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/a-new-prime-minister-is-forced-upon-us\" title=\"\">0.14% of the populace</a> vote for Boris Johnson, we instantly get him; but if 52% of the electorate vote for Brexit, they get three years of what feels like trying to shit out a pool table. Essentially, Brexit has proved impossible to deliver: turns out it\u2019s tricky for English voters to take back control of their borders when one of them is in someone else\u2019s country. Many people wish David Cameron had never called the referendum in the first place. It says a lot about how badly the last couple of years have gone, that there\u2019s a guy who destroyed Libya, presided over needless austerity and fucked a pig, and we wish that he\u2019d just used his own judgment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"493a80cd7080c397bfafd739bb1d313f33596cd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/493a80cd7080c397bfafd739bb1d313f33596cd7/764_117_1297_1620/801.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In any other era Michael Gove would be seen as a uniquely unctuous, unlikable and profoundly talentless figure.

The cabinet is Dickensian in the purest sense: the sort of people who would need more than two ghosts to change their behaviour. After an uncertain start, Jacob Rees-Mogg has had a pretty good campaign, onboard an Arctic clipper ship, nailed into a coffin of earth from his constituency. It\u2019s interesting that someone who thinks ordinary people lack common sense is so heavily invested in upholding the result of a referendum, but like so many lesser ironies in this election, we simply don\u2019t have the time. When people say \u201cThe mask has slipped!\u201d after various cabinet gaffes, there must be a moment when the minister wonders whether they have accidentally come out wearing one of the actual masks they wear to the various <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/29/eyes-wide-shut-review-stanley-kubrick-tom-cruise-nicole-kidman\" title=\"\">Eyes Wide Shut</a>-style parties that dot their social calendar at this time of year; their fingers moving reflexively towards their face to see if they\u2019ve worn the head of a golden ibis to talk to Phillip Schofield.</p> <p>The Conservatives seem to have focused on the phrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/boris-johnson-get-brexit-done-lies\" title=\"\">\u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d</a>, which has all the conviction of your dad hitting the arms of his chair and saying, \u201cRight\u2026\u201d We also seem to be hearing a lot about \u201cUnleashing Britain\u2019s potential\u201d, despite most of our potential being for food riots, and perhaps some kind of race war. The Conservative manifesto contains elements of both Thatcherism and Reaganism, in that it seems to have been written by someone with dementia. There was probably a discussion about whether to release a manifesto at all or simply airdrop scratchcards over key marginals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Boris Johnson's bumbling posho shtick almost resembles buffering, a kind of 3G Wodehouse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boris Johnson, who looks like something you\u2019d keep your pyjamas in, and who no reasonable person would choose to lead them into a chorus, has a strangely hunched demeanour; perhaps from all the time he spends crammed inside married women\u2019s wardrobes, like a randy jack-in-the-box. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/29/boris-johnson-scone-video-dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">confused sex yeti</a> has been booed by nurses: people who can remove a dressing, examine a festering wound, and still look up at you with a smile.

Usually people with levels of mental activity as low as Johnson\u2019s aren\u2019t surrounded by advisers, but their weeping parents and a member of their favourite boy band. Dominic Cummings looks like he works in television (which I think might be the worst thing you can say about anyone), has the air of a startled testicle, and the name of a character in a porn parody of The Talented Mr Ripley (\u201cThe Talentless Fister Ripped Me\u201d). Everyone who\u2019s bored with Johnson pretending to be an idiot should look at Cummings and realise these people are far more dangerous when they pretend to be clever.</p> <p>It\u2019s perfectly obvious why Johnson has been able to take power: he has an instinctive grasp on Brexit as rightwing eschatology, and he\u2019s used to getting his own way, be it in the halls of Westminster or elbowing siblings off of nanny\u2019s nipples. It\u2019s only when you look at the hideous Tarot formed by his cabinet that you get a true picture of the depravity into which we are sinking. Take Michael Gove, a revanchist endorsement of the science of physiognomy. In any other era Gove would be seen as a uniquely unctuous, unlikable and profoundly talentless figure. Now he\u2019s hardly even remarkable. Gove \u2013 looking like someone took all the flesh out of a serial killer\u2019s drains and forced it into some brogues; like Davros fell out of his Dalek; like a rushed cartoon of a horny snail \u2013 is somehow not the worst person in cabinet, or even his own marriage. Against pushback from Sajid Javid and Priti Patel, Dominic Raab is attempting to get up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/some-british-citizens-in-syria-to-be-repatriated-within-days\" title=\"\">60 British children back from camps in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/some-british-citizens-in-syria-to-be-repatriated-within-days\" title=\"\">northern Syria</a> before they freeze to death over the winter.

Of course, it would have been nice to see him actually running in the election, particularly from a pack of wild dogs. As for the Lib Dems \u2013 well, I thought we\u2019d really miss Tim Farron, bumping around the country on a deserted coach and performing Blue Peter tasks in front of people terrified that he might start talking about gay sex. Jo Swinson has grown on me, and seems to exist as a satisfying, subtle and damning satire of humanity. Swinson\u2019s election started out relatively positively, possibly because people hadn\u2019t heard her speak yet. It quickly became clear that she had the gravitas of a re-education camp supply teacher, and was launching a kind of charm retreat that seemed to involve loans for renting flats and permanent austerity. Some might see misogyny in this reaction to her, but I\u2019m fairly sure I just hate her for being from Milngavie.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Corbyn thing is a sort of Ealing comedy about a bloke who gets called off his allotment to try to form a government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Labour\u2019s idea to run an election campaign on policy in the middle of all this is a little bit like reciting your poetry at an orgy.

Instead, I\u2019d like to share with you my two favourite quotes. The first, is a really famous one. Kurt Vonnegut asked his adult son what he thought the meaning of life was, and his son replied: \u201cWe are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.\u201d The second is what David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, said about the ending of the final episode:</p> <p>\u201cWell, what Tony should have been thinking, I guess, and what we all should be thinking \u2013 although we can\u2019t live that way \u2013 is that life is really short. And there are good times in it and there are bad times in it. And that we don\u2019t know why we\u2019re here, but we do know that 20 miles up it\u2019s freezing cold, it\u2019s a freezing cold universe, but here we have this thing called love, which is our only defence, really, against all that cold, and that it\u2019s a very brief interval and that, when it\u2019s over, I think you\u2019re probably always blindsided by it.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty miles up, it\u2019s a freezing cold universe, we only have the human connections we make here, nothing is permanent, and love is our only defence. I suggest we all vote accordingly, and try to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

I don\u2019t know how anyone votes for that, or what happens after they do. British people don\u2019t get on well enough to form militia. I don\u2019t want to end on a note of pessimism. Instead, I\u2019d like to share with you my two favourite quotes. The first, is a really famous one. Kurt Vonnegut asked his adult son what he thought the meaning of life was, and his son replied: \u201cWe are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.\u201d The second is what David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, said about the ending of the final episode: \u201cWell, what Tony should have been thinking, I guess, and what we all should be thinking \u2013 although we can\u2019t live that way \u2013 is that life is really short. And there are good times in it and there are bad times in it. And that we don\u2019t know why we\u2019re here, but we do know that 20 miles up it\u2019s freezing cold, it\u2019s a freezing cold universe, but here we have this thing called love, which is our only defence, really, against all that cold, and that it\u2019s a very brief interval and that, when it\u2019s over, I think you\u2019re probably always blindsided by it.\u201d Twenty miles up, it\u2019s a freezing cold universe, we only have the human connections we make here, nothing is permanent, and love is our only defence. I suggest we all vote accordingly, and try to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>A week to go before the election and the Conservative vote appears to have peaked. The party\u2019s share hit 42% about a fortnight ago and has not advanced since \u2013 a level that is intriguingly similar to the 42.34% result achieved by Theresa May in the last general election.</p> \n<p>The party now dominates the leave vote \u2013 with a 69% share according to ICM\u2019s analysis published this week \u2013 following the effective surrender of Nigel Farage in the early part of the campaign. Essentially, the Conservatives\u2019 five-point improvement during the campaign has been almost entirely at the Brexit party\u2019s expense.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, it is during this peak Tory period that YouGov carried out the fieldwork (20 to 26 November) for the most high-profile poll of the campaign \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/mrp-poll-conservatives-on-course-for-68-seat-majority\">the MRP survey that models a result from every constituency</a> \u2013 which forecast a Tory majority of 68, with Labour losing a string of seats in leave areas.</p> \n<p>No wonder then that the Conservative message from that point has been to warn against complacency \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/dominic-cummings-tells-brexiters-election-is-tighter-than-it-looks\">\u201cthings are MUCH tighter than they seem\u201d Dominic Cummings wrote</a> \u2013 with memories of Labour\u2019s late recovery in 2017 lingering in the minds of party insiders.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/06/john-major-conservative-general-election-vote-head-heart\">I\u2019m a Conservative. But it is time to vote with your head as well as your heart | John Major</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Their fears appear to have been partially justified as the last two weeks has seen Labour gradually squeeze the Liberal Democrat vote, a process that began after Jo Swinson\u2019s appearance on Question Time on 22 November \u2013 where the hostility from the studio audience was unexpectedly pronounced \u2013 and continued as Boris Johnson\u2019s poll lead lengthened the following week.</p> \n<p>As a result, since then Labour has picked up nearly three points in the averages from 29.5% to 32.3%, mostly from the Lib Dems, and the overall Conservative poll lead is back down to 10 points from a 13-point peak.</p> \n<p>It is a noticeable shift, but in another sense it changes nothing: wind back to the start of the election campaign, in late October, and the Conservative poll lead was \u2026 you can probably guess: 10 points. So, on the face of it, two squeezes in, and nothing much has changed.</p> \n<p>Well, not quite. The fall in the Lib Dem vote, from 18% at the start of the campaign to 13% now, helps Labour in particular and the opposition parties overall, as the remain vote is less split in constituencies where third-party support was a factor.</p> \n<p>The effect on the Commons arithmetic <a href=\"https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html\">could leave the Conservatives with a majority of 28</a> on the Electoral Calculus Model. Compare that with the start of the campaign, when the same forecaster was predicting a Tory majority of 76.</p> \n<p>Can Labour go further? The obvious place to start is with the Lib Dems. But it will be challenging for Labour to erode Lib Dem support by the 3 to 4 points it needs to even have a chance of depriving Johnson of an overall majority, not least because the Lib Dems\u2019 clear anti-Brexit position appears to have boosted their core vote.</p> \n<p>Labour really needs to seize votes and seats from the Conservatives, although the momentum is, if anything, the other way. In Scotland, where the party had feared a wipeout, a YouGov poll this week <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/scotland/snp-s-grip-on-scotland-will-be-crucial-in-deciding-election-pw0sqhkqw\">has the Tories losing just five of its 13 seats</a>. Even <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-has-begun-general-election-fightback-in-london-new-poll-reveals-a4302986.html\">in </a><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-has-begun-general-election-fightback-in-london-new-poll-reveals-a4302986.html\">London, where Labour is improving</a>, the party could still gain Kensington and Battersea from Labour, because the remain vote is split with the Lib Dems.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"35793271-2c2a-4b80-af29-587378b37767\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SZThRJ9pflc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, Labour continues to struggle for credibility among leave supporters. And, if anything, Labour has become pinned down defending its leave seats rather than going on the attack: there are <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/02/04/labours-path-to-vicotry-is-through-leave-voting-conservative-marginals/\">a dozen seats where Labour has a majority of under 2,000 votes and which voted 55% or more for leave</a> \u2013 from Dudley North to Ipswich.</p> \n<p>All of which sets up a nervy final stretch for Johnson. The Tories have a little more that they need to do which is why, exhibiting uncharacteristic discipline, the party leader keeps trying to hammer home the \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d message, while avoiding his most obvious point of danger: an interview with Andrew Neil.</p> \n<p>Remember that under Theresa May, the Conservatives came so close in 2017. The party was nine seats from an overall majority and Labour only 2.35 points behind. At the moment Labour is 10 points down and the Tory poll share shows no signs of slipping. To stop Johnson walking into Downing Street, something needs to shift soon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A week to go before the election and the Conservative vote appears to have peaked. The party\u2019s share hit 42% about a fortnight ago and has not advanced since \u2013 a level that is intriguingly similar to the 42.34% result achieved by Theresa May in the last general election. The party now dominates the leave vote \u2013 with a 69% share according to ICM\u2019s analysis published this week \u2013 following the effective surrender of Nigel Farage in the early part of the campaign. Essentially, the Conservatives\u2019 five-point improvement during the campaign has been almost entirely at the Brexit party\u2019s expense. Interestingly, it is during this peak Tory period that YouGov carried out the fieldwork (20 to 26 November) for the most high-profile poll of the campaign \u2013 the MRP survey that models a result from every constituency \u2013 which forecast a Tory majority of 68, with Labour losing a string of seats in leave areas. No wonder then that the Conservative message from that point has been to warn against complacency \u2013 \u201cthings are MUCH tighter than they seem\u201d Dominic Cummings wrote \u2013 with memories of Labour\u2019s late recovery in 2017 lingering in the minds of party insiders. Their fears appear to have been partially justified as the last two weeks has seen Labour gradually squeeze the Liberal Democrat vote, a process that began after Jo Swinson\u2019s appearance on Question Time on 22 November \u2013 where the hostility from the studio audience was unexpectedly pronounced \u2013 and continued as Boris Johnson\u2019s poll lead lengthened the following week. As a result, since then Labour has picked up nearly three points in the averages from 29.5% to 32.3%, mostly from the Lib Dems, and the overall Conservative poll lead is back down to 10 points from a 13-point peak. It is a noticeable shift, but in another sense it changes nothing: wind back to the start of the election campaign, in late October, and the Conservative poll lead was \u2026 you can probably guess: 10 points. So, on the face of it, two squeezes in, and nothing much has changed. Well, not quite. The fall in the Lib Dem vote, from 18% at the start of the campaign to 13% now, helps Labour in particular and the opposition parties overall, as the remain vote is less split in constituencies where third-party support was a factor. The effect on the Commons arithmetic could leave the Conservatives with a majority of 28 on the Electoral Calculus Model. Compare that with the start of the campaign, when the same forecaster was predicting a Tory majority of 76. Can Labour go further? The obvious place to start is with the Lib Dems. But it will be challenging for Labour to erode Lib Dem support by the 3 to 4 points it needs to even have a chance of depriving Johnson of an overall majority, not least because the Lib Dems\u2019 clear anti-Brexit position appears to have boosted their core vote. Labour really needs to seize votes and seats from the Conservatives, although the momentum is, if anything, the other way. In Scotland, where the party had feared a wipeout, a YouGov poll this week has the Tories losing just five of its 13 seats. Even in London, where Labour is improving, the party could still gain Kensington and Battersea from Labour, because the remain vote is split with the Lib Dems. Meanwhile, Labour continues to struggle for credibility among leave supporters. And, if anything, Labour has become pinned down defending its leave seats rather than going on the attack: there are a dozen seats where Labour has a majority of under 2,000 votes and which voted 55% or more for leave \u2013 from Dudley North to Ipswich. All of which sets up a nervy final stretch for Johnson. The Tories have a little more that they need to do which is why, exhibiting uncharacteristic discipline, the party leader keeps trying to hammer home the \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d message, while avoiding his most obvious point of danger: an interview with Andrew Neil. Remember that under Theresa May, the Conservatives came so close in 2017. The party was nine seats from an overall majority and Labour only 2.35 points behind. At the moment Labour is 10 points down and the Tory poll share shows no signs of slipping. To stop Johnson walking into Downing Street, something needs to shift soon.",

They refuse to return it, and the bank washes its hands of the matter, blaming you for the mistake.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s what happened to Peter Teich in a case that reveals shocking lapses in Britain\u2019s banking system. Just hours after a solicitor sent the Cambridge resident his \u00a3193,000 inheritance after the death of his 100-year-old father, it became apparent that a terrible mistake had been made.</p> \n<p>Teich had given his correct name, address and Barclays account number in Cambridge to his solicitor \u2013 but the wrong sort code. The money went straight to another Barclays customer, also in the Cambridge area who, alarmingly, had an account with the same number as Teich, though a slightly different sort code. Worse, the person refused to return the money. Barclays knew where his \u00a3193,000 was sitting and, Teich says, knew when the recipient dishonestly began to withdraw the cash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4707c38a-3e1a-4622-8aa0-cc88ddd85d17\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>From the end of March next year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/18/banks-to-check-account-names-to-beat-transfer\">name checks will be carried out</a> when UK bank customers send money to other people.</p>\n    <p>The move is designed to tackle the rapidly-growing problem of bank transfer fraud.

They can then update the details and try again, or contact the intended recipient to check the details.</p>\n    <p>But if the customer enters the wrong name for the account holder, they will be told the details do not match and advised to contact the person they are trying to pay.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The mistaken transfer \u2013 called \u201cmisapplied funds\u201d in banking parlance \u2013 could not have occurred if UK banks matched up sort codes and account numbers with the account holder\u2019s name. But they do not. A recipient\u2019s name could be given as Mickey Mouse and the bank would still process the payment, using the sort code and account number alone.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/18/banks-to-check-account-names-to-beat-transfer\" title=\"\">banking industry promised</a> that from mid-2019 name checks would be carried out when customers sent money to other people, largely to halt a rising tide of bank transfer fraud. But the timetable was delayed, and it will now not come into force until the end of March next year.</p> \n<p>An oddity in Teich\u2019s case is that Barclays also appeared to have identical account numbers for two different customers, both in the Cambridge area.</p> \n<p>Teich realised the error almost immediately. His father\u2019s estate was divided with his sister, who emailed him at noon on the day of the transfer, 26 April, to say she had received her \u00a3193,000. Teich checked his account, found nothing there, and contacted his solicitor. Only then did he discover he had given the solicitor the wrong sort code. The solicitor immediately contacted Barclays, which said the money would be restored within a week, according to Teich. But in late May, Teich received a bombshell letter from Barclays: \u201cDue to an error on your part, the funds were applied to another customer \u2026 clearly you were mis-advised about the funds being restored to your account, and in recognition of this, I have credited your account with a small token gesture of \u00a325.\u201d</p> \n<p>Barclays said it asked the person who received the cash for permission to return the money, but he refused. In a letter a few days later to Teich\u2019s solicitor, it said: \u201cRegrettably we have not been able to gain permission from the recipient of these funds for them to be returned to you. As there has been no error here on the part of the bank, we cannot just simply return the funds.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eb83c1e4b116593410d799f9f2bd3756ceb1bec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eb83c1e4b116593410d799f9f2bd3756ceb1bec/0_22_4440_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barclays bank branch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barclays would not provide the name of the person who received the cash.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>No one is legally entitled to keep money that has been wrongfully credited to their account. But compelling them to return the money, particularly if it is spent, is another matter. Barclays, in common with other banks, will not even provide the name of the person who has received the cash, unless it is instructed by a court.</p> \n<p>Some Guardian readers may recognise Teich\u2019s surname, as his father, Mikul\u00e1\u0161 \u2013 from whom he inherited the \u00a3193,000 \u2013 was the subject of an obituary in the paper in April. Mikul\u00e1\u0161 escaped from Nazi-held Czechoslovakia in 1939, although his parents perished in the Holocaust. He later became a renowned historian of science at Cambridge.</p> \n<p>Despite being 74 and disabled, Peter Teich was left on his own to recover his father\u2019s \u00a3193,000. \u201cBarclays insisted that I bear the full and sole responsibility of pursuing their own dishonest customer,\u201d he says. He hired lawyers and went through an expensive and laborious two-stage legal process. In June, after \u00a312,000 in legal and court fees, he got the other Barclays customer\u2019s name. Armed with this, he then went to the high court to obtain a freezing injunction \u2013 at a cost of \u00a334,000. Finally, after an \u201cunnecessary, expensive and stressful process\u201d, the court order forced the other Barclays customer to repay the cash.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It would\u2019ve taken Barclays a few days to recover the misdirected funds, but they did nothing</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Peter Teich</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI freely acknowledge my mistake in this unhappy saga: I provided the sort code of the wrong Barclays branch. But my error fades into near insignificance when considered in the context of Barclays\u2019 conduct,\u201d says Teich.</p> \n<p>The saga did not stop there. Teich asked Barclays to refund the \u00a346,000 in legal costs he racked up simply to recover his own money. Barclays refused. Angered by the bank\u2019s reply, Teich contacted the Guardian for help.

      "bodyText": "It is the stuff of financial nightmares. You get one digit wrong on the sort code, and send a huge amount of cash to the wrong person. They refuse to return it, and the bank washes its hands of the matter, blaming you for the mistake. That\u2019s what happened to Peter Teich in a case that reveals shocking lapses in Britain\u2019s banking system. Just hours after a solicitor sent the Cambridge resident his \u00a3193,000 inheritance after the death of his 100-year-old father, it became apparent that a terrible mistake had been made. Teich had given his correct name, address and Barclays account number in Cambridge to his solicitor \u2013 but the wrong sort code. The money went straight to another Barclays customer, also in the Cambridge area who, alarmingly, had an account with the same number as Teich, though a slightly different sort code. Worse, the person refused to return the money. Barclays knew where his \u00a3193,000 was sitting and, Teich says, knew when the recipient dishonestly began to withdraw the cash. The mistaken transfer \u2013 called \u201cmisapplied funds\u201d in banking parlance \u2013 could not have occurred if UK banks matched up sort codes and account numbers with the account holder\u2019s name. But they do not. A recipient\u2019s name could be given as Mickey Mouse and the bank would still process the payment, using the sort code and account number alone. The banking industry promised that from mid-2019 name checks would be carried out when customers sent money to other people, largely to halt a rising tide of bank transfer fraud. But the timetable was delayed, and it will now not come into force until the end of March next year. An oddity in Teich\u2019s case is that Barclays also appeared to have identical account numbers for two different customers, both in the Cambridge area. Teich realised the error almost immediately. His father\u2019s estate was divided with his sister, who emailed him at noon on the day of the transfer, 26 April, to say she had received her \u00a3193,000. Teich checked his account, found nothing there, and contacted his solicitor. Only then did he discover he had given the solicitor the wrong sort code. The solicitor immediately contacted Barclays, which said the money would be restored within a week, according to Teich. But in late May, Teich received a bombshell letter from Barclays: \u201cDue to an error on your part, the funds were applied to another customer \u2026 clearly you were mis-advised about the funds being restored to your account, and in recognition of this, I have credited your account with a small token gesture of \u00a325.\u201d Barclays said it asked the person who received the cash for permission to return the money, but he refused. In a letter a few days later to Teich\u2019s solicitor, it said: \u201cRegrettably we have not been able to gain permission from the recipient of these funds for them to be returned to you. As there has been no error here on the part of the bank, we cannot just simply return the funds.\u201d No one is legally entitled to keep money that has been wrongfully credited to their account. But compelling them to return the money, particularly if it is spent, is another matter. Barclays, in common with other banks, will not even provide the name of the person who has received the cash, unless it is instructed by a court. Some Guardian readers may recognise Teich\u2019s surname, as his father, Mikul\u00e1\u0161 \u2013 from whom he inherited the \u00a3193,000 \u2013 was the subject of an obituary in the paper in April. Mikul\u00e1\u0161 escaped from Nazi-held Czechoslovakia in 1939, although his parents perished in the Holocaust. He later became a renowned historian of science at Cambridge. Despite being 74 and disabled, Peter Teich was left on his own to recover his father\u2019s \u00a3193,000. \u201cBarclays insisted that I bear the full and sole responsibility of pursuing their own dishonest customer,\u201d he says. He hired lawyers and went through an expensive and laborious two-stage legal process. In June, after \u00a312,000 in legal and court fees, he got the other Barclays customer\u2019s name. Armed with this, he then went to the high court to obtain a freezing injunction \u2013 at a cost of \u00a334,000. Finally, after an \u201cunnecessary, expensive and stressful process\u201d, the court order forced the other Barclays customer to repay the cash. \u201cI freely acknowledge my mistake in this unhappy saga: I provided the sort code of the wrong Barclays branch. But my error fades into near insignificance when considered in the context of Barclays\u2019 conduct,\u201d says Teich. The saga did not stop there. Teich asked Barclays to refund the \u00a346,000 in legal costs he racked up simply to recover his own money. Barclays refused. Angered by the bank\u2019s reply, Teich contacted the Guardian for help. We asked it to reconsider his case, and in an almost immediate U-turn, it has now agreed to pay all his legal fees, and has offered him \u00a3750 in compensation. In a statement the bank said: \u201cIt is evident that on this occasion we have failed to meet the high standards that Mr Teich can expect to receive from Barclays, and for this we have offered our sincere apologies. After taking a closer look at this situation, we can confirm that Mr Teich can expect the fees he has incurred to be refunded in full with interest, together with a payment for the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused.\u201d Teich is jubilant he will now no longer be out of pocket. But he regrets Barclays\u2019 behaviour. \u201cIt could have taken Barclays a few days to recover the misdirected funds, but instead they did nothing. They could have saved me and everyone else all this stress and anxiety.

      "bodyText": "In the same month that Greta Thunberg addressed a UN summit and millions of people took part in a global climate strike, lawmakers in America\u2019s leading oil- and gas-producing state of Texas made a statement of their own. Texas\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Act went into effect on 1 September, stiffening civil and criminal penalties specifically for protesters who interrupt operations or damage oil and gas pipelines and other energy facilities. Within a couple of weeks, two dozen Greenpeace activists who dangled off a bridge over the Houston ship channel became the first people charged under the new law, which allows for prison sentences of up to 10 years and fines of up to $500,000 for protest groups. The new Texas law is emblematic of the unyielding loyalty of conservative lawmakers to the fossil fuel industry in a state stacked with influential climate science deniers or sceptics such as the US senator and former Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz and which named a pipeline tycoon to its parks and wildlife conservation commission. With kindred spirits in the Trump White House, Texas is now intensifying its support of the fossil fuel industry and, pipeline by pipeline, literally laying the groundwork for production to ramp up even more in the next decade. The scale of new production is \u201cstaggering\u201d, according to an analysis by Global Witness, a campaign group, with Texas leading the way as US output of oil and gas is forecast to rise by 25% over the next decade. This makes it a \u201clooming carbon timebomb\u201d, the group believes, in a period when global oil and gas production needs to drop by 40% to mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \u201cThe sheer scale of this new production dwarfs that of every other country in the world and would spell disaster for the world\u2019s ambitions to curb climate change,\u201d the report states. The US is already the planet\u2019s leading producer of oil and gas and central to its rise is the Permian Basin, a shale region of about 75,000 sq miles extending from west Texas into New Mexico. Despite the oil price crash of 2014, the Permian\u2019s oil production has soared from about a million barrels a day in 2011 to about 4.5m this autumn, while natural gas production has trebled since 2013, according to US government figures. In March, the Permian overtook Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ghawar to become the world\u2019s most productive oilfield. While Saudi Arabia\u2019s overall production remains far higher, predictions that the Permian\u2019s output will continue to grow at a similar rate \u2013 doubling by 2023 as pipeline capacity expands and major oil companies increase their presence \u2013 are alarming environmentalists. \u201cHaving some kind of wild west boom going on in Texas where it\u2019s every man for himself drilling as quickly as possible and trying to pull the stuff out of the ground in a kind of frenzy, that\u2019s just the precise opposite to what should be going on,\u201d said Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at Oil Change International, a clean energy advocacy group.

The Permian\u2019s fortunes are not dependent on the whims of one or two dominant companies \u2013 there are hundreds of operators, from tiny independents to huge multinationals such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips, many of the corporations which, as the Guardian has reported, are behind a large proportion of the planet\u2019s carbon emissions and are poised to flood markets with an additional 7m barrels per day over the next decade.

A report last May by the Environmental Integrity Project, a not-for-profit group, cited a lack of air quality monitoring in west Texas, with only one station to track sulphur dioxide levels, and limited regulatory oversight which relies on companies to self-report unauthorised emissions.

      "bodyText": "The construction of a private border wall partially funded by rightwing allies of Donald Trump continued with vigor in south Texas this week, seemingly in blatant violation of a court injunction ordering work to be suspended. On Thursday and Friday, within three days of a temporary restraining order being issued, the Guardian found construction crews with at least 10 heavy machinery vehicles moving soil, digging trenches and positioning tall metal posts along the US bank of the Rio Grande in Hidalgo county, which forms the border with Mexico. A 3.5-mile, privately-funded concrete barrier is planned on the site, near Mission, Texas. The state court order was served to We Build the Wall (WBTW), an anti-migrant group founded by military veteran Brian Kolfage, and the landowners, Neuhaus and Sons LLC, whose land is situated between Trump\u2019s proposed wall and the Mexican border. WBTW is a not-for-profit group that has crowd-funded millions of dollars by tapping into anti-migrant fervor and is led by the former White House advisor Steve Bannon as chairman of its advisory board. Kolfage has described some people crossing the southern border without documents as terrorists and drug traffickers, and accuses border wall critics as being cartel collaborators. The injunction, issued on Tuesday by a state judge, was granted citing potential \u201cimminent and irreparable damage\u201d to the National Butterfly Center, a popular 100-acre riverfront nature reserve adjacent to the Neuhaus property. The wall could act as a dam and redirect floodwater and debris to the sanctuary, destroying an ecosystem which sustains hundreds of native butterfly species and birds, the center said. Shortly after the ruling, Kolfage posted a video on Twitter of a man standing on the riverbank wearing a fluorescent vest, identified only as \u201cForeman Mike\u201d, who said that thanks to \u201cpatriotic donors\u201d a mile and a half of land had been cleared, and steel bollards and panels would be installed within 48 hours. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be putting this up,\u201d said the foreman, Mike, asking for more donations, while promising to have the barrier built by mid-January 2020. \u201cWe have to supercharge it now. It\u2019s time to get really moving.\u201d On Wednesday, Kolfage said that construction work continued as neither he, or the group, had been physically served with the order. Work was still going on on Friday afternoon when the Guardian was given access to an adjacent private plot, and witnessed crews moving soil, excavating a trench on a vast stretch of cleared riverbank, and preparing it for concrete foundations and metal posts. A border patrol vehicle was parked close to the bulldozers, partially hidden by lofty sugar cane. An employee of the construction company Fisher Industries, who identified himself as Sean, confirmed that work had continued uninterrupted \u2013 despite the injunction. \u201cThey [the construction workers] have told us they are not going to stop,\u201d Sam Pena from the local sheriff\u2019s office said on Thursday. The sheriff\u2019s deputies filed reports documenting the ongoing construction work that appeared to be in violation of the court order. And, on 5 December, the federal government launched separate legal action to stop the construction, on the grounds that it violated binational treaty obligations with Mexico. A temporary injunction was granted by the US district judge Randy Crane. That federal lawsuit, filed on behalf of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IWBC), states that required hydraulic studies proving that the wall would not worsen flooding on the river had not been completed, and scant detail about the planned work had been submitted. \u201cAt last the federal government is doing what it should be doing,\u201d said Sarah Burt, a lawyer from EarthJustice, a not-for-profit legal group, which is suing the government over the border wall. \u201cThere is still a rule of law in this country, and everyone should be subject to it.\u201d But, in a twist, judge Crane agreed to dismiss WBTW as a defendant after its lawyer and prominent conservative, Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, claimed the group mostly handled \u201csocial media cheerleading\u201d for the project and was nothing more than a passive investor, providing only 5% of the funding. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any control over the project or the machinery or what\u2019s going on,\u201d Kobach said in court in the southern district of Texas. The removal of WBTW from the lawsuit raised questions about the group\u2019s finances, which has attracted scrutiny from the authorities \u2013 and supporters who have donated at least $25m to build a wall. \u201cWhere is the money?\u201d said Javier Pe\u00f1a, a lawyer acting for the National Butterfly Center. \u201cThey use fear and anger to divide people and convince them to give money for a wall which they now say they are not funding.

The North Dakota-based Fisher companies are owned by Tommy Fisher, who has made regular appearances on Trump\u2019s favorite TV channel, Fox News, to boast about how he could build the wall, faster, better and cheaper than anyone else. Earlier this week, Fisher Sand and Gravel was awarded a $400m Pentagon contract to build 31 miles of wall in Arizona \u2013 despite a history of environmental and tax violations The chair of the House committee on homeland security, Bennie Thompson, has called for an investigation to determine whether Trump unduly influenced the military\u2019s decision to award the contract to Fisher. Multiple requests to Tommy Fisher for comment have not received a response. The Trump administration has suspended 28 laws relating to clean water, public lands, endangered species and the rights of Native Americans in order to speed up construction of the border wall. But such waivers only apply to the official government wall; rogue private projects must obey all laws and treaties. The Texas lawsuit in which the butterfly center is a plaintiff also includes a defamation claim, because Kolfage has repeatedly accused Marianna Trevi\u00f1o-Wright, the head of the butterfly center, of criminality. Kolfage responded: \u201cThere\u2019s no defamation. The open border policies of the butterfly people 100% enable the cartels and humanitarian crisis. No one crosses the border without paying the cartels.\u201d This article was amended on 9 December to give greater clarity to Kolfage\u2019s description of people crossing the border.",

The trip was cancelled because of the hepatitis, which had not been diagnosed before they bought the insurance.</p> <p>After taking several further weeks to re-examine the case, InsureandGo told Money it stands by the decision. It said paying out \u201cwould be highly unethical and unfair to other customers\u201d.</p> <p>The Bennetts had hoped to spend August on a two-week independent tour of Uganda. After making several bookings, including the flights, in June, they did the prudent thing, and bought an InsureandGo \u201csilver\u201d travel policy. Tom was meticulous in filling in the application form, disclosing a pre-existing cardiovascular condition, and the cost was adjusted upwards to \u00a3110.</p> <p>\u201cIn April our son, who was to join us on the trip, had seen the dermatology team in our local hospital to explore a potential treatment for his acne. Further tests followed, but there was no indication that anything serious was wrong \u2013 until late July, when a liver biopsy was carried out, and he was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. This meant he had to be admitted to hospital immediately and the trip was off,\u201d says Tom.</p> <p>Most of the hotel and other bookings were cancellable, he says, but the \u00a31,440 cost of the flights was not, so they claimed.

The boards are a lot smaller than conventional surfboards, and that\u2019s where the skill set changes. Don\u2019t move your upper body It\u2019s all about the balance of weight on your feet. If you put more weight on your backfoot you\u2019re going to travel upwards. If you put more weight on the front foot you\u2019re going to travel downwards. You really need to work hard to understand how to shift your weight. You will wipe out... ...and your friends will laugh. It doesn\u2019t matter how good you are \u2013 you\u2019re coming off the board. You\u2019re surfing a sheet wave of water about two inches thick, and the surface underneath is fairly similar to a trampoline.

      "bodyText": "Stirling Central Scotland Most visitors go to Scotland for the scenery, the culture, eventful history and the cold-Caribbean-like coast. As a base for exploring the Highlands, with shops and society yet no city throngs, Stirling is a bonny option. The dramatic castle towering above the town nudges into every view, ensuring no visitor forgets to visit, but book ahead for special Christmas lunches in the intimate Green Room, and carols on 15 Dec, and the play A Christmas Carol (20-22 Dec). Stirling Winter Festival has a long list of events, from a Family Ceilidh on 14 Dec to children\u2019s show Snow Play on 20 Dec. It would be rude not to go for a hike, so choose your Ben \u2013 Ben A\u2019an and Ben Lomond are goodies (but make sure you are properly prepared for the likely conditions). Less taxing is the climb to the Wallace Monument for views over the city. After dark, you could target Andy Scott\u2019s illuminated equine sculptures, the Kelpies, south of Stirling at Falkirk, for a night walk \u2013 take a head torch to follow the Forth and Clyde canal. Less challenging is Stirling Reindeer Trail, where kids can spot 20 colourful reindeer statues around town, while parents nip into House of Henderson for kilts, tweed hip flasks and blankets, and the smart clothes and jewellery stores of the 19th-century Stirling Arcade. A fair selling handmade Scottish arts and crafts runs until 5 Jan at the Macrobert Arts Centre, part of the University of Stirling, and the centre is also screening the Royal Opera House Live\u2019s Nutcracker on 17 and 18 Dec, and has some availability for an interactive family show, Santa\u2019s Sleigh Light Keeper (until 24 Dec, \u00a310). Reboot your evening with a tot of nettle gin infused at the new Stirling Distillery, in a prime location at the foot of the castle. Arran Aromatic toiletries, natty William Morris wallpapers, sleigh beds and silent fridges lend comfort at the Victoria Square hotel (doubles from \u00a395 B&amp;B), a grand Victorian mansion close to the castle with a relaxed new Orangery Restaurant in a period conservatory with decorative tiled floor. Corfe Dorset You\u2019d be reluctant to stop in Corfe in summer, when it\u2019s clogged with traffic and visitors. In winter, though, you can have the 1,000-year-old ruins of Corfe Castle almost to yourself before buying presents from the Boilerhouse Gallery, Corfe Castle Pottery and Seasons Green gift shop, all in the grounds. The castle runs weekend crafting sessions till 22 Dec, and carol singing on 7 and 13 Dec. Then, on 11 dates between 14 and 31 Dec, a revival of the medieval Christmas tradition of the Lord of Misrule \u2013 the person appointed by Tudor noblemen to manage Christmas activities at court \u2013 with games, dances and entertainment. Larks might enjoy an early opening to watch the sunrise on the winter solstice (7.15am, 21 Dec, \u00a312.50). All this fun works up an appetite, so trot over the road to the Greyhound Inn for a hearty pie, wild boar faggots or something vegan. Mortons House Hotel (doubles from \u00a3140 B&amp;B), a 16th-century manor house with panelled walls and huge fireplaces, has an Elizabethan suite with a four-poster among its guest bedrooms. Next morning, stomp the Purbeck coast and wide beach of Studland Bay, where brent geese overwinter and sika deer roam at dawn and dusk. At the National Trust\u2019s Knoll Beach cafe, festive cheer comes in the form of a pizza, topped with turkey and cranberry, and mulled wine. Last stop is the Purbeck Artisan Yard in nearby Wareham, for handmade artworks, vintage and upcycled bits and bobs. Richmond North Yorkshire Richmond Castle (\u00a36.50/\u00a33.90), at the heart of the town, is one of England\u2019s oldest stone-built castles, matched only by those at Durham and Colchester, with a 30-metre keep and fantastic views of the Dales. Built in 1071 on land gifted to Alan the Red of Brittany by William the Conqueror as a reward for his part in the victory over Harold, it was intended as a base for controlling the unruly north. A millennium later they\u2019re pretty civilised. Richmond is a refined, Regency sort of place, with Georgian buildings, cobbled market place and attention-grabbers such as the 15th-century Friary tower. The Station, a gallery and cafe in the old Victorian railway building, hosts a festive brocante on 7 Dec, selling salvage, curios and festive foliage; on 15 Dec there\u2019s live music on the platform from Reeth Brass Band, plus a Christmas table decoration workshop with Chatsworth\u2019s florist (\u00a330). For shopping, drive a few miles to the Teesdale market town of Barnard Castle, clustered around a 12th-century ruin spectacularly situated above the Tees gorge, with a sloping central street of cute antiques stores and cafes. Appetites piqued, it\u2019s time to head for a rural gastro pub, of which there are several greats. The Fox Hole in the Roman village of Piercebridge, has put a rocket under the local dining scene, with cool interiors of dark aubergine, copper pots and log fires, and Insta-friendly dishes of Chateaubriand steak and crispy cod cheeks. The Black Bull at Moulton has also moved with the times, serving chicken breast with truffle pancakes; or wood pigeon with celeriac, pickled blackberry and nasturtium. A bonus of staying at Millgate House (doubles from \u00a3125 B&amp;B), a Richmond townhouse crammed with elegant antiques, oriental rugs and paintings, is the walled garden, still glorious in winter. Clitheroe Lancashire With the Forest of Bowland to the north, the rambling moorland and glorious gastro pubs of the Ribble Valley at its feet, and the smallest Norman castle in England (woohoo!), the hilltop town of Clitheroe is a proper charmer. The Forest of Bowland is one of the few truly dark sky areas of the UK, so perfect for stargazing \u2013 as authentic a Christmassy activity as you can get. There are five designated Dark Sky Discovery Sites within this Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, each with a car park, and over a dozen local businesses are credited as \u201cdark sky friendly\u201d, having had training with an astronomer that they can pass on to guests. Among them are the Spread Eagle Inn (doubles from \u00a395 B&amp;B), in the shadow of Pendle Hill, with a log fire and festive menu to warm up with after a jaunt. This is a great town for supplies. Load up at the Christmas-themed Great British Food Festival (14-15 Dec, adult day ticket \u00a35.40) at Stonyhurst College, a Grade I-listed building in the forest, hosting 70 traders and TV chefs. Stock up on wines from the vast underground cellar of D Byrne &amp; Co, maybe even this year\u2019s 12-bottle connoisseur\u2019s case (\u00a3152) for the oenophile in your life. Take a cool bag for bangers from Cowmans Famous Sausage Shop, whose 75 varieties include Ted\u2019s Christmas Special (turkey), and pork with cranberry and rosemary. This butcher is old-school (120 years) so there\u2019s no vegan option on the menu \u2013 not a sausage! Lovely Ribchester, west along the Ribble Valley, is worth a snoop for its Roman Museum, shops (try the Wine Shed, and Potters Barn for vintage toys, paint-your-own pottery and homewares) and art gallery Ascot Studios, with great landscapes, abstracts and still-lifes to buy. For pub grub (and sleepovers), there\u2019s plenty of choice: the Assheton Arms in Downham (doubles from \u00a399 B&amp;B) and Freemasons at Wiswell (doubles from \u00a3160 B&amp;B) are well-regarded. If you\u2019re there on a Thursday night, don\u2019t miss Emporium bar\u2019s Christmas gin and jazz nights, showcasing local musical talent in an old chapel. Sherborne Dorset Straight off the lid of a biscuit tin, pretty Sherborne has streets of butter-toned local stone and one of England\u2019s most decorative abbeys, with an ornate vaulted ceiling and 13 centuries of history. Here, on 9 Dec, a Christmas variety show unites musical acts including the Abbey Choir and Sherborne Town Band. Plenty of other carol services burst into the falalalalas there throughout the run-up to Christmas. Alas, both the town\u2019s castles (Sir Walter Raleigh so loved the ruins of the 12th-century Old Castle he bought the grounds and built another next to it, now known as the New Castle) are closed in winter, but there\u2019s still the Sherborne Museum for eyeing local relics, from Georgian silk shoes made in the town, to a letter from Thomas Hardy. The high street is no common Superdrug/Dorothy Perkins/Clinton Cards line-up; instead find posh coffee and wine shops aplenty, plus the likes of Molecula, a vast retail outlet connected to design and antiques magazine, Vintage Explorer, with a wildly eclectic range of sculpture, 20th-century design, vintage motorbikes and art. If any of your family would welcome a mounted taxidermied fish in their stocking this year, or a 1970s space-age Danish lamp, this is your place. For further purse shaking, head to Circus Boutique for cashmere jumpers with skull patterns, Bella Freud knits and Penelope Chilvers boots, or the shelves of Chapter House Books. There\u2019s a late-night shopping event across the town on 11 Dec, also the date of a one-off comedy night called Sherborne\u2019s Big One! (tickets \u00a312, eventbrite.com), with craft beers, dancing and comedians including former dentist Michael Hackett. Thirsty yet? The White Hart, with beams and flagstone floors, is a good shout, and the Queens Arms (doubles from \u00a3100 room-only) does fancy nibbles such as citrus courgette with ricotta and chilli, sushi nori scallops, then hefty mains of white truffle gnocchi or West Country ribeye steak with charred Spanish onion. For the type of nosh that comes with dots and smears of sauce, head to The Green, in a scrumptious, honeyed Grade-II, whose small gallery shows work from Bruton\u2019s Moorwood Art gallery. Try root vegetable kimchi with pumpkin pesto, or guinea fowl supreme with bronze turkey stuffing. Or stay in a sweet little thatched cottage for two at Munden House (from \u00a395 a night) three miles out of town. Part of a collection of farm cottages, it\u2019s perfect for forays into Thomas Hardy country, carrying a copy of his Christmas poem The Oxen to recite on the way. Shrewsbury Shropshire Is Shrewsbury the Tokyo of Shropshire? The fact that it\u2019s home to a cat cafe, Paws Cafe, and gaming coffee shop Nerdy Coffee Co (board rather than computer, though) might suggest so. But in every other sense it\u2019s the antithesis of the hi-tech Japanese capital, full of old-world charm, ancient churches, and wonky half-timbered Tudor buildings. Tucked under their overhanging floors are interesting, arty shops, where panicking Christmas shoppers can rejoice at not being in some Bluewater hell. The street to target is sloping Wyle Cop, home to White Lotus, for bed linen, artwork and fashion; Tanners Wines, for prize-winning bottles to complement the turkey; and year-round festive shop Christmas Perks. More gems are tucked between the big brands of the High Street and Milk Street, along Butcher Row and Fish Street, where proceedings can be jollied along in the indecent number of pubs. If champagne\u2019s more you, Ten and Six is a fizz-focused, Alice in Wonderland-themed bar in a topsy-turvy building, where super-keen Christmas hosts could prep with a cocktail masterclass (\u00a325pp). Find peace at the Abbey, the red sandstone castle and the walkway along the town walls. On 11 Dec, Shrewsbury Rock Choir is performing at St Mary\u2019s Church, while a week later on 18 Dec, there\u2019s a festive night market at the Shrewsbury Market Hall, and Aladdin at the new Theatre Severn. Shrewsbury is well-supplied with good places to eat and sleep, and the best of both are frequently under one roof. Drapers Hall (doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B) has a great reputation for stylish bedrooms and smart, creative dining: wrap your chops round loin of red deer with chanterelle pithivier, wild mallard with physalis, or Wigmore brie tortellini in brown onion consomm\u00e9. Darwin\u2019s Kitchen (doubles from \u00a3115 B&amp;B), named after the town\u2019s most famous son, is another gourmet option, with a vegan/vegetarian options and a Wednesday jazz club. Also worth trying are: the Boathouse, a foodie pub on the Severn with splendid river views; its sister venue, the Lion + Pheasant (doubles from \u00a3130 B&amp;B) with smart, minimalist rooms; and the colourful, whimsical, medieval mishmash that is the Golden Cross Hotel (doubles from \u00a385 B&amp;B), which dates from 1428. For value and atmosphere, there\u2019s the St Nicholas (doubles from \u00a369), a converted church that\u2019s a cafe by day and a grill restaurant at night, with a cocktail bar upstairs on Saturdays and five luxury bedrooms with beautiful stained glass windows. Petworth West Sussex This arty market town is a gorgeous little enclave of well-preserved Tudor buildings, cobbled streets and interiors stores, all within the South Downs national park. To start, take a frosty walk through the Capability Brown-designed grounds and deer park at the National Trust\u2019s Petworth House and Park, bang in the middle of town. Inside it has an incredible art collection and, until 5 Jan, selected rooms are dressed for Christmas in Georgian style \u2013 before turkey and tinsel gained favour \u2013 with talks in the medieval chapel, parlour games, and costumes to try on. There\u2019s a cafe in the former servants\u2019 quarters, and the shop is selling Georgian Christmas foods such as venison pithivier and Petworth crumb pudding, which is a Petworth variation on a traditional Bread pudding \u2013 and mistletoe grown in Petworth Park. Christmas shoppers could pick up champagne flutes and oven gloves at Tallulah Fox, a nude oil painting for grandma in Timothy Langston Fine Art and Antiques, stocking-fillers at the Petworth Bookshop or smalls in Guilt Lingerie, or stock up on goodies for the festive table at the Hungry Guest Foodshop and Butcher. On a chilly day, go for a curry at Indian restaurant Meghdoot\u2019s Mystique Masala; one of chef Mili\u2019s private or group cookery demonstrations would make a great gift for a foodie friend (group class from \u00a335). For a quirky treat of a place to stay, choose a converted Pullman carriage or room in the main building of the Old Railway Station (doubles from \u00a3204 B&amp;B), where teas and mulled wine are served in the old waiting room. Just outside Petworth in the village of Balls Cross, Stag Cottage (doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B) is well-placed for walks across Ebernoe Common nature reserve, and also two doors down from the traditional Stag Inn. Stratford-upon-Avon Warwickshire Christmas was not really a thing in Shakespeare\u2019s day. There\u2019s Twelfth Night of course, and a line in Hamlet (and did you know that Falstaff\u2019s red-nosed drinking buddy, Bardolph, is believed to be the model for Rudolph?) ... yet the Bard only used the C word three times in his writing. How we celebrate today (or did before Black Friday and vegan wellington) is really Charles Dickens\u2019 doing, with roots dating back no further than the 1840s. But that won\u2019t stop Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace going full throttle on the festivities. The house where he was born, now the Shakespeare\u2019s Birthplace museum (\u00a317.50/\u00a311.50) is draped in winter foliage by local floral designers until 5 Jan, with exhibits telling how Tudors spent the 40 days prior to Christmas fasting and praying, with houses only decorated on Christmas Eve. Tudor Wassailing is revived from 30 Dec-1 Jan, with cups of traditional hot spiced cider to try. Tudor World (\u00a36/\u00a33), an interactive museum, has Christmas quizzes and atmospheric evening Christmas carol tours with (not Tudor but Victorian) \u201cEbeneezer\u201d. Further Tudor and medieval traditions, local history and more Bard facts than you can shake a spear at are covered on a town tour with Stratford Town Walk (\u00a36/\u00a33, daily, even on Christmas Day). Stallholders dress the part at the Victorian Christmas market today and tomorrow, with funfair and light displays. Pick up gifts Uncle Drosselmeyer would approve of at the Nutcracker, a year-round Christmas shop on Henley Street; vinyl and collectibles at Henley Street Antiques Centre; and artisan cheese from Paxton and Whitfield. You should probably see some theatre. A Christmas Carol at the Attic Theatre (9 Dec), The Nutcracker, or comic show Did We Mention the Free Mince Pies? at the Bear Pit (19-20 Dec) are good options. Where to eat? All ingredients come from within Warwickshire at 33 The Scullery, where December\u2019s menu has roasted vegetable and walnut crumble or slow-braised local game with mulberry gin and puff pastry topping. Former OFM young chef of the year Paul Foster is chef-patron of Salt, doing clever cooking such as partridge with parsley ketchup and cured halibut with pear, kohlrabi, buttermilk and dill. Three miles out of town, well-regarded Baraset Barn Restaurant (doubles from \u00a3140 room-only) added 16 bedrooms (neutral but with wild fabrics) this year. Portree Isle of Skye Skye\u2019s landscape is an otherworldly realm of mountains, frozen pools and jagged coastline \u2013 but as eye-spanglingly beautiful as it is, on a moody winter\u2019s day it could be considered intimidating. Who could be blamed, then, for forgoing winter wild camping to hole up, cosy as a Hobbit, in a twinkling enclave like Portree instead? The island\u2019s capital offers the benefit of classic treks up the Old Man of Storr, Fingal\u2019s Seat and Ben Tianavaig, with Christmassy mini-break essentials: supping a pint of Skye Gold in the Isles Inn, nibbling a sweet cranberry bannock bread at the Isle of Skye Baking Company, buying turquoise prints of Hebridean rock pools at the Skye Blue Gallery Shoppers should also look out for toiletries from Island Botanics, whose bog myrtle exfoliating massage bar will banish your winter troll skin, and buy whisky lovers a single malt at source at the Talisker Distillery, half an hour away on the shores of Loch Harport, with grand views south to the Cuillins. Oysters may not be the best stomach-liner, but with Carbost\u2019s Oyster Shed so close, its salty shucked and cooked temptations are not to be missed. You\u2019re spoilt for accommodation across Skye \u2013 try Portree\u2019s, slick-but-hygge-filled Bosville Hotel (doubles from \u00a3127 B&amp;B) opposite the harbour, which has 20 rooms in cool, muted shades. Abergavenny Monmouthshire Another of those arty Welsh enclaves, border town Abergavenny has carved a niche with its locavore shops, cheesemongers and gourmet markets, but it remains down to earth, with lots more going for it besides food. The spectacular Brecon Beacons are close at hand, so it\u2019s worth getting any Christmas shopping out of the way quickly so you can tramp the hills. Fab independent shops include Mockingbird for jewellery, homewares and interesting kids\u2019 bits, from glow-in-the-dark jigsaw puzzles to wooden arks. There\u2019s also the Wool Croft, selling supplies for crafters, and Cuddle and Cwtch for unusual, green children\u2019s brands such as Little Green Radicals and Frugi Organic, and rails of \u201cpre-loved\u201d and \u201cgently used\u201d secondhand kids\u2019 clothes. Dozens of makers sell jewellery, pots, toiletries and other crafts at Talgarth Mill (admission \u00a35/\u00a31), a beautiful community-owned watermill, whose flour is turned into additive-free deliciousness in the traditional bakery. The scones, sourdough breads, cakes and Bara Brith can be wolfed down in the cafe or stuffed into your knapsack for a picnic lunch as spectacular as any of the mountain paths you tread (Sugar Loaf and Little Skirrid are classics). Where and what to eat is going to cause some Fobo (fear of a better option) here. Michel Roux is a fan of the Hardwick (doubles from \u00a3139 B&amp;B), which has a great vegetarian menu (breadcrumbed butternut arancino, salt-roast beetroot on winter leaves) and a Christmas one (stone bass with winter chicories and Christmas pudding cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e please). The Michelin-starred Walnut Tree is where renowned chef Shaun Hill has been \u201cshaking the pans\u201d, as he has it, for a decade (go for sea bass with dashi broth; rabbit loin with leg bolognese; banana and peanut ice-cream sandwich). The inn has a couple of smart cottages (night in December from \u00a3150, with DIY breakfast). Its sister hotel, the Angel (doubles from \u00a3105 room-only in December), features devilishly tempting bites such as pappardelle with mushrooms and chestnuts. There\u2019s a pop-up apr\u00e8s ski bar in the courtyard, and the rustic-glam Foxhunter bar for cocktails. It\u2019s not all swank and glory, though. Takeaway nibbles can be foraged on the shelves of Marches Deli, whose seasonal treats include pheasant liver pate with sloe mulberry gin, local cheeses and Hay charcuterie, which can be packed into Christmas hampers or devoured on the spot in the Monmouth coffeeshop. Likewise, Carpannini\u2019s has Italian-style hampers, liqueurs, wines and homeware to take back. Helmsley North Yorkshire Few places do good old-fashioned English \u201cscran\u201d as well as rural Yorkshire, and Helmsley \u2013 arguably the most charming of all the friendly towns around the North York Moors \u2013 does it better than most. It boasts a triumphant deli, Hunters of Helmsley, on the square. Once your basket is loaded with scrumptious Yorkshire hams and cheeses, pat\u00e9s and pies, jars of posh handmade horseradish, peach chutney and sloe gin, treat yourself to a \u201cchubby hunter\u201d (the local equivalent of a Betty\u2019s fat rascal), a cherry-topped squidgy biscuit. Use the energy boost to dash around Helmsley Traditional Sweet Shop and Cut Price Book Shop, Libby Butler for jewellery \u2013 before exploring 900-year-old Helmsley Castle (\u00a37.20/\u00a34.30), an impressive medieval fortress with tower. From here a lovely 2\u00bd-mile hike leads to Rievaulx Abbey (\u00a39.40/\u00a35.60), the astonishingly beautiful ruins of a Cistercian monastery founded in 1130, which is holding a carol concert from 1-3pm on 8 Dec. Alas Helmsley Walled Garden, where much of next year\u2019s Secret Garden film was shot, doesn\u2019t reopen until March, but there\u2019s the opportunity for a blustery blast of fine Yorkshire air in the tree-filled Duncombe Park, which sells Christmas trees grown on the estate, and along the 109-mile Cleveland Way, which begins in the town, heads north across country to Saltburn-by-the-Sea then back south along the coast. Even if you only manage a mile, reward yourself with a pint of Striding Riding pale ale \u2013 the official beer of the Way \u2013 at the Helmsley Brewery Co tap room. An annual Christmas Tree festival is in full swing at All Saints Church until 15 Dec, with decorated trees, music, mince pies and hot drinks, plus a panto-influenced Beanstalk Window Trail around town, in part to promote Helmsley Arts Centre\u2019s show (until 15 Dec, \u00a315/\u00a37.50). It also has a screening of the Bolshoi Ballet\u2019s Nutcracker (17 Dec, \u00a315/\u00a37.50). After all that excitement, relax at the Feathers (doubles from \u00a390), with a festive menu and coffeeshop. Rather less affordable is the Feversham Arms (doubles from \u00a3250), though the latter is good for spa treatments or dinner (mine\u2019s the treacle-cured salmon, then onion tarte tatin with goat\u2019s curd). Bamburgh Northumberland Its setting, on a volcanic outcrop by the sea, has made Bamburgh Castle (\u00a311.25/\u00a35.50) one of England\u2019s most iconic, and it\u2019s a dramatic starting point for hiking the great sweep of beach, perhaps down to the fishing village of Seahouses. Though it was the first castle in the world to fall to gunpowder, in 1464 during the War of the Roses, it has been restored to Kevin McCloud-pleasing standard, with towers, battlements, grand panelled state rooms and a spectacular King\u2019s Hall, where recitals by pianists, harpists and Northumbrian pipers rattle the tapestries through December. Kids can lay down their demands at meet and greets with Father Christmas in the Victorian stables. That other Northumbrian honeypot, Alnwick Garden, hosts a spectacular Winter Light Trail (\u00a38.95, under-4s free) this month, Christmas gift stalls every weekend and, until 5 Jan, an indoor playroom filled with real snow (\u00a33pp) where kids can build snowmen and chuck snowballs even if a white Christmas fails to materialise. A few miles inland, the vast Ford and Etal country estate, with trails, railway, mills and art, hosts a Christmas Fayre on 22 Dec. Nearby, the Old Dairy gathers antiques and vintage sellers under one roof, with a coffee shop and monthly suppers in the old milking parlour. Bamburgh has some interesting shops, but there\u2019s more unusual treasure-hunting over on Holy Island, where the Celtic Crafts sells traditional, Celtic-influenced jewellery and Game of Thrones-y pewter goblets. Stop for a pie and a pint at the Ship Inn, or coffee and a cinnamon bun at Pilgrims Coffeehouse and Roastery \u2013 proof that there is now a hipster coffee shop in absolutely every corner. In Alnwick, Barter Books, in an old Victorian railway station, is considered one of the world\u2019s most exceptional bookshops, with open fires in winter, cosy armchairs and a working model railway chuntering round the ceiling. Stay in the middle of everything at the Lord Crewe (doubles from \u00a390 B&amp;B), a tarted-up pub with simple, tartan-y rooms, opposite the castle. All manner of gourmet treats can be found at The Potted Lobster in Bamburgh: Lindisfarne oysters, haddock chowder, seafood platters and whole lobster, then a Pimm\u2019s jelly knickerbocker glory to top things off. Faversham Kent What a joyful Kentish town Faversham is. Best-known for its constant stream of farmers\u2019, artisan and food markets, harvest and hop festivals, and lashings of ale, it\u2019s plonked amid some of the county\u2019s richest farmland, and liberally peppered with perfect pubs. The Shepherd Neame brewery, Britain\u2019s oldest, is a draw for many, where a tour (book in advance, \u00a318pp) offers a chance to taste this season\u2019s festive ales, Northern Lights or Rudolph\u2019s Reward. Through December, the cheery central streets, home to a handful of interesting independent retailers, are illuminated by thousands of bulbs, while Standard Quay, by Oare Creek, just north of the town centre, has a winning combination of treasure-filled antiques stores in old black timber warehouses, plus the cosy, low-ceilinged Shipwrights Arms. This is a good starting point for a reviving hike along the Oare Creek to the marshes. Just to the south, Macknade Fine Foods is possibly the country\u2019s, if not the world\u2019s, greatest food hall. I\u2019d get absolutely everything for Christmas lunch there if possible, from Colston Basset stilton to sprouts, plus basics from lentils to muesli from its Unpackaged plastic-free dispenser system. Sadly, Faversham\u2019s dining options don\u2019t live up to that standard, but lunch at the Hot Tin Cafe is fab, for amazing dhal, sarnies and cocktails in a tin chapel that doubles as an arts venue with films and music. Faversham Christmas Sunday Market comes to the pretty Guildhall on Market Place on 22 Dec, for unusual ingredients to pep up a festive feast, and last-minute gifts, toys, jewellery and crafts. Creek Creative, an old Victorian brewery housing artists\u2019 studios and non-profits, has a Christmas Emporium selling handmade goods daily, except Mondays, until 20 Dec. Stay at the central 14th-century Sun Inn (doubles from \u00a385 B&amp;B), in smart rooms with exposed rafters. Llangollen Denbighshire On the banks of the River Dee, wreathed in pretty woodland and with a definite creative bent, Llangollen is a perky little Welsh gem. Transport fans, prepared to be thrilled: not only is the town home to the impressive Pontcysyllte aqueduct, the UK\u2019s largest stone and cast iron aqueduct no less, with festive canal boat rides at weekends through December (\u00a314/\u00a312 with mulled wine), but there\u2019s also the Llangollen steam railway, dolled up with Chrimbo razzle-dazzle. Rides upriver to the village of Carrog are themed as Santa\u2019s Christmas Specials (\u00a320), with gifts for kids and a tipple for grownups, daily until Christmas Eve; then, when Santa\u2019s resting, \u201cmince pie specials\u201d (\u00a318/\u00a310) run from 26 Dec until 1 Jan. Those who prefer the brooding aspect of winter can climb up to the crumbling walls of Castell Dinas Br\u00e2n (Crow Castle), on a hill above the town, for spectacular views. Next weekend, an International Christmas event at Llangollen Pavilion (15 Dec, llangollen.net, \u00a313/\u00a35) includes a \u201creverse grotto\u201d, where guests can donate to the local food bank, plus world music, carols and mince pies. The town\u2019s shopping options include trendy outlets (Ty Nook for cactus pots, plant books, statement earrings and bags made from Welsh blankets; Gwalia Ceramics for funky vases and milk jugs; teddies and bunting from Lily Rose Interiors) among the more traditional (see the Welsh Love Spoon store for sentimental stocking-fillers). In the Memorial Hall, Llangollen Country Market sells foodie gifts, plants and crafts on Friday mornings. For face-stuffing, try smart new bakery and cafe M\u2019eating Point, and just outside town, cosy coaching inn the West Arms (doubles from \u00a3135 B&amp;B) for a mean afternoon tea, dinner (goat\u2019s cheese tart with micro herbs or organic Berwyn mountain lamb) and somewhere to sleep it off. Buxton Derbyshire Take a romantically rugged setting, mix in lots of gorgeous Edwardian and Victorian architecture, a dab of historic grandeur, some sprinkles of contemporary culture, then just add water (from a thermal spring, if you please) and you have cooked up one of the north\u2019s most evocative towns. On a December weekend, take a tour (\u00a316pp) on Discover Buxton Tours\u2019Victorian-style tram, jazzed up with festive fripperies such as blankets, hot water bottles, truffles and mugs of hot chocolate to keep passengers frostbite-free. Now that bottled water is a no-no, fill your sustainable one from the source, at St Anne\u2019s Well, near the Georgian Pump Room and Crescent. These buildings, which earned Buxton the moniker \u201cBath of the North\u201d, are being turned into a luxury hotel with spa (the famous water bubbles up at 27C beneath the building), due to open in early 2020. The opulent Buxton Opera House is another big draw. This month Cinderella (until 1 Jan, from \u00a320.50/\u00a318.50) is providing panto fun, and the Buxton Studio Choir (12 Dec, \u00a37/\u00a35) mixes festive pop from the 1960s onwards with choral favourites. Too high brow? The Pavilion Arts Centre screens corny Christmassy flicks, from the nostalgic (Home Alone) to the new (Last Christmas and Frozen 2). Jump-start a shopping spree with a quick sharpener at Buxton Brewery Tap House, which serves a creative range of freshly released beers in the renovated Old Court House. Independent makers form a permanent artisan market at The Arches at Hogshaw Mill; there are plenty of independent stores across town in Higher Buxton, and on 15 Dec Pavilion Gardens hosts one of its regular bazaars, with crafts and bites. If that doesn\u2019t hit the mark, the nearby Staffordshire town of Leek \u2013 where William Morris studied dyeing and bought silk \u2013 is renowned for its well-priced antique stores, such as Odeon Antiques, and the extensive Leek Antiques Centre. Gift list ticked, it\u2019s time for a frosty walk in the gritstone ruffles and folds of the Peak District. One superbly atmospheric hike is to Lud\u2019s Church, a spooky mossy dripping chasm where persecuted church reformers of the 15th century used to meet (park at Gradbach); or blast the cobwebs away with a trek up Kinder Scout, Derbyshire\u2019s highest peak. Back in Buxton, stick to the wintry theme for dinner at St Moritz, which serves Italian favourites in an Alpine-themed interior , and sleep in historical surroundings at the Old Hall Hotel (doubles from \u00a370 B&amp;B), whose 35 rooms have four-posters and opulent fabrics. It claims to be the oldest hotel in England: there\u2019s evidence a building existed on the site for over 3,000 years, and it\u2019s where Mary Queen of Scots spent summers while held captive, under the care of the building\u2019s owner, George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 December 2019 because Petworth House and Park is no longer selling hackin (a sweet haggis-like pudding of minced beef with oats), as an earlier version said.",

      "body": "<p>Next week, when Britain goes to the polls, the crucial battlegrounds will be in the Midlands and the north of England, where traditional working-class Labour voters who support Brexit are being lured by Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Many are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/29/politicians-liars-boris-johnson-voters-prime-minister-brexit\">considering voting Tory for the first time</a>.</p> <p>As someone raised in a northern working-class town and whose dad was white and working-class, I understand the frustrations that led to Brexit (if my dad was still alive he may well have voted leave), and why so many people want the referendum result to be swiftly enforced. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve read a lot of articles where remainers talk to remainers and leavers to leavers. So let me reach out, respectfully, from a remainer to a leaver, and ask that you think twice about casting your vote for the Conservatives.</p> <p><strong>1. \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Really?</strong> It\u2019s a comforting thought that, after this Christmas election, Britain will have left the European Union within weeks. But what kind of nation will we be after that? Division will run deep in our society, with the 48% (16 million) remain voters believing the Boris Johnson Brexit is very different to that promised back in 2016: out of the single market, out of the customs union, and a border down the Irish sea. None of this was on the side of the bus. And that\u2019s not even to mention the fact the Brexit isn\u2019t even \u201cdone\u201d till a trade agreement is reached, which will likely take years. No deal could well be back on the table in a year\u2019s time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Though a swift end seems appealing, remember: Brexit is for life, not just for Christmas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>2. Brexit is for life \u2026</strong> Yes, the years of negotiation have been agonising. But there are two main reasons for this: first, Theresa May drew up contradictory red lines that required a hard border in Ireland. And second, leaving the EU after more than 40 years was always going to be a complex process.<strong> </strong>Think of it like buying a home: if the property survey shows up unforeseen problems, the answer is to resolve them first, rather than press ahead for a move on an arbitrary date regardless of the consequences. From chlorinated chicken to medical supplies, to ferry companies with no ships, there has been no shortage of unforeseen problems. It\u2019s not surprising there have been delays. Though a swift end seems appealing, remember: Brexit is for life, not just for Christmas.</p> <p><strong>3. The Tories have a record for cheap slogans.</strong> Only two years ago Theresa May went into the election saying: \u201cI\u2019ll deliver Brexit.\u201d How did that go? Before that, David Cameron pledged to eradicate the deficit and to slash immigration. Both targets are now scrapped.<strong> </strong>Johnson has said: \u201cWe\u2019ll leave Europe on 31 October, no ifs or buts.\u201d He said he\u2019d rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d. Slogans are simple \u2013 reality is a lot more difficult.</p> <p><strong>4. Johnson despises people like you.</strong> In a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-poor-working-class-chav-loser-burglar-drug-addict-a9227941.html\">Spectator article</a> he wrote that working-class men are \u201clikely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless\u201d. Johnson is not your friend, your ally, or someone who\u2019s looking out for you. In the same article he attacked single mothers and their \u201cill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate\u201d children. When challenged, he says dismissively: \u201cI\u2019ve written millions of words.\u201d But those words had the clear aim of holding up the working-class and single mothers to ridicule and moral condemnation in a magazine catering for the rich and powerful.</p> <p><strong>5. Johnson picks on the weak.</strong> His attacks on black people (\u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/23/london.race\">piccaninnies</a>\u201d), Muslims (niqab wearers look like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbankrobbers\u201d) and gay people (\u201cbumboys\u201d) are now well known.

In contrast, Corbyn always fights for the underdog.</strong> While Johnson was smashing up restaurants with his Bullingdon mates knowing he\u2019d never have to worry about the law, Jeremy Corbyn was campaigning to make life better for ordinary working people of all backgrounds. For a fair tax system in which the rich pay their share; against factory and pit closures; and against the sell-off of Britain\u2019s national assets. And he went further: he spoke out for the rights of black people and ethnic minorities facing discrimination and harassment; for women\u2019s rights; for gay rights; and for dialogue with Northern Ireland\u2019s republicans. All of these, at the time, were unpopular causes and were pilloried in the press as \u201cloony left\u201d. Yet all, today, are accepted as mainstream \u2013 some even lauded as a sign of \u201cBritish values\u201d.</p> <p><strong>7. Labour and antisemitism.</strong> Corbyn\u2019s critics are right to say the party should have handled its complaints better and faster. But paradoxically, what\u2019s given antisemitism such a high media profile over the past couple of years (compared to Tory party Islamophobia, which is widespread but barely receives any coverage), is that fact that Labour members care so much about it and will not stop until it is driven out of the party.</p> <p><strong>8. How to unite the country.</strong> If Britain is to leave Europe then let it at least be done in a way the nation can unite behind. We now know far more about what it really means than we did in June 2016. If it really is still the will of the people, there should be no problem in getting another majority for it. But this time, it would be on the basis of a clear outcome that has been negotiated in advance. A Corbyn-negotiated Brexit (the basics of which have already, in principle, been met warmly by EU leaders) would protect jobs, protect trade, and protect workers\u2019 rights. Johnson\u2019s deal does none of those things. Remainers would still regret a vote for Brexit, but would abide by it and move on. The Tories call this \u201cdithering\u201d. Yet they\u2019ve bungled Brexit for three and a half years, and we\u2019ve still not left the EU. Corbyn could resolve this Tory-created crisis within six months.</p> <p><strong>9. Remember why you\u2019ve always voted Labour.</strong> If Britain leaves with Johnson\u2019s deal on 31 January there\u2019ll certainly be a strong sense of relief. But it will be short-lived. Because then we\u2019ll face five more years of Conservative government, and let\u2019s not forget what that means: more cuts (the Tories say they\u2019ll protect the NHS and the police but almost everything else will likely be slashed back); more job insecurity; more homelessness; more demand for foodbanks; fewer local services; no plan for social care; tax cuts for the richest; and no investment in the green economy of the future. If Johnson\u2019s elected, we\u2019ll be back in a harsh, Tory Britain. Don\u2019t forget what that feels like.</p> <p><strong>10. A question of character.</strong> Who do you trust? One of the candidates for prime minister has a decades-long track record of campaigning for those the powerful don\u2019t care about: working people, sick and disabled people, minorities, and the weakest and most marginalised. The other has a decades-long record of looking out for himself, vilifying the vulnerable, lying and cheating. He won\u2019t even say how many kids he has. If you think the second of these is the man who can unite Britain and lead us into a brighter future then, once more, I respectfully urge you: please think again.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph Harker is the Guardian\u2019s deputy Opinion editor.

      "body": "<p>A money-making scheme being promoted by Joanna Lumley says it can help people achieve a \u201clife-changing\u201d income \u2013 and claims those who climb to the top of the \u201cStairway to Success\u201d can earn up to \u00a31m a year. Yet Guardian Money found that the average amount being earned is less than \u00a312 a week \u2013 and that\u2019s before costs are taken into account.</p> <p>This \u201copportunity of a lifetime\u201d is offered by energy and communications company Utility Warehouse, which says it has enabled many people \u201cto be their own boss, give up their job and even retire early with complete financial security\u201d. A template letter that the firm\u2019s representatives can print off and send to would-be recruits asks: \u201cWant to take control of your life?\u201d and then says tantalisingly: \u201cI\u2019ll show you how to make a lot of money.\u201d But do the claims stack up?</p> <p>So-called \u201cmulti-level marketing\u201d (MLM) schemes such as this are controversial, particularly in the US. One critic of this type of scheme told Guardian Money that, in his opinion, they are \u201ceconomic cults\u201d.</p> <p>But Utility Warehouse says it is very different to some other network marketing businesses that rely on their distributors to buy stock from them, in that its \u201cpartners\u201d (the name for its representatives/agents) incur very little cost aside from their time and a small joining fee.</p> <p>It adds: \u201cThe important thing to understand is that we are presenting illustrations of what is achievable by potential new partners, as opposed to any form of guaranteed income.\u201d</p> <p>Utility Warehouse is the trading name of FTSE 250 firm Telecom Plus, and provides a range of services \u2013 gas, electricity, home phone, broadband and so on \u2013 to more than 600,000 UK homes and businesses. Joanna Lumley promotes the brand and has fronted a series of short films, including one where she talks about how people can earn money. It is pretty much exclusively promoted by its army of self-employed partners, who earn commission by encouraging friends, family and others to sign up to its products.</p> <p>In simple terms, you earn money from the customers you sign up, plus you can recruit other partners.</p> <p>And when they sign people up, you earn a small share of the money they spend, too.</p> <p>Flick through the latest edition of Utility Warehouse\u2019s \u201cThe Opportunity\u201d booklet, which explains how people get paid, and you will see tables and diagrams that highlight the money that can be made. For example, there is one showing an individual at the top of a structure, then below him or her are the people he or she recruited, and then below them are the people they recruited.</p> <p>There is a complex system of payments and bonuses, including \u201cpersonal residual income\u201d (ongoing commission from the people you sign up) and \u201cgroup residual income\u201d (ongoing commission from customers that those in your \u201cteam\u201d sign up). This residual income is payable on all your group customers \u201cdown to infinity\u201d.</p> <p>One document on the company\u2019s website states that you could earn \u00a32,340 a month in group residual income \u2013 or just over \u00a328,000 a year \u2013 which it says is \u201cmore than the average salary in the UK\u201d. This assumes you receive 30p per person per month commission from 7,800 customers signed up by your team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b4ae92f27ffe58ebe0ff7ee7c4f6f4dbda5fe0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b4ae92f27ffe58ebe0ff7ee7c4f6f4dbda5fe0f/152_91_2170_1302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joanna Lumley in a Utility Warehouse advert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joanna Lumley in a Utility Warehouse advert</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Utility Warehouse</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there\u2019s the Stairway to Success, which has eight steps. \u201cThe higher up you climb, the greater your monthly and annual earnings could be \u2013 up to a maximum of \u00a31m a year as a five-star NNL national network leader,\u201d says the booklet.</p> <p>On reading that, some will say: \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d But do many really earn such large amounts? It turns out you need to amass a small country\u2019s worth of people \u2013 500,000 group customers \u2013 to become a five-star NNL. Utility Warehouse has about 645,000 customers.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t much information in <a href=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/whitepapers.utilitywarehouse.co.uk/telecom-plus-plc-half-yearly-report-september-2019-final.pdf\" title=\"\">its latest results</a> \u2013 covering the six months to 30 September \u2013 about payments to partners. However, they do disclose that there were 43,111 partners. Meanwhile, \u201cdistribution expenses\u201d, which includes the share of the revenue paid as commission to partners, totalled \u00a313.2m for the six months.</p> <p>Dividing that pot between the 43,111 partners gives an average of \u00a3306 per person for the period \u2013 which is \u00a351 a month, or \u00a311.80 a week.

      "bodyText": "A money-making scheme being promoted by Joanna Lumley says it can help people achieve a \u201clife-changing\u201d income \u2013 and claims those who climb to the top of the \u201cStairway to Success\u201d can earn up to \u00a31m a year. Yet Guardian Money found that the average amount being earned is less than \u00a312 a week \u2013 and that\u2019s before costs are taken into account. This \u201copportunity of a lifetime\u201d is offered by energy and communications company Utility Warehouse, which says it has enabled many people \u201cto be their own boss, give up their job and even retire early with complete financial security\u201d. A template letter that the firm\u2019s representatives can print off and send to would-be recruits asks: \u201cWant to take control of your life?\u201d and then says tantalisingly: \u201cI\u2019ll show you how to make a lot of money.\u201d But do the claims stack up? So-called \u201cmulti-level marketing\u201d (MLM) schemes such as this are controversial, particularly in the US. One critic of this type of scheme told Guardian Money that, in his opinion, they are \u201ceconomic cults\u201d. But Utility Warehouse says it is very different to some other network marketing businesses that rely on their distributors to buy stock from them, in that its \u201cpartners\u201d (the name for its representatives/agents) incur very little cost aside from their time and a small joining fee. It adds: \u201cThe important thing to understand is that we are presenting illustrations of what is achievable by potential new partners, as opposed to any form of guaranteed income.\u201d Utility Warehouse is the trading name of FTSE 250 firm Telecom Plus, and provides a range of services \u2013 gas, electricity, home phone, broadband and so on \u2013 to more than 600,000 UK homes and businesses. Joanna Lumley promotes the brand and has fronted a series of short films, including one where she talks about how people can earn money. It is pretty much exclusively promoted by its army of self-employed partners, who earn commission by encouraging friends, family and others to sign up to its products. In simple terms, you earn money from the customers you sign up, plus you can recruit other partners. And when they sign people up, you earn a small share of the money they spend, too. Flick through the latest edition of Utility Warehouse\u2019s \u201cThe Opportunity\u201d booklet, which explains how people get paid, and you will see tables and diagrams that highlight the money that can be made. For example, there is one showing an individual at the top of a structure, then below him or her are the people he or she recruited, and then below them are the people they recruited. There is a complex system of payments and bonuses, including \u201cpersonal residual income\u201d (ongoing commission from the people you sign up) and \u201cgroup residual income\u201d (ongoing commission from customers that those in your \u201cteam\u201d sign up). This residual income is payable on all your group customers \u201cdown to infinity\u201d. One document on the company\u2019s website states that you could earn \u00a32,340 a month in group residual income \u2013 or just over \u00a328,000 a year \u2013 which it says is \u201cmore than the average salary in the UK\u201d. This assumes you receive 30p per person per month commission from 7,800 customers signed up by your team. Then there\u2019s the Stairway to Success, which has eight steps. \u201cThe higher up you climb, the greater your monthly and annual earnings could be \u2013 up to a maximum of \u00a31m a year as a five-star NNL national network leader,\u201d says the booklet. On reading that, some will say: \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d But do many really earn such large amounts? It turns out you need to amass a small country\u2019s worth of people \u2013 500,000 group customers \u2013 to become a five-star NNL. Utility Warehouse has about 645,000 customers. There isn\u2019t much information in its latest results \u2013 covering the six months to 30 September \u2013 about payments to partners. However, they do disclose that there were 43,111 partners. Meanwhile, \u201cdistribution expenses\u201d, which includes the share of the revenue paid as commission to partners, totalled \u00a313.2m for the six months. Dividing that pot between the 43,111 partners gives an average of \u00a3306 per person for the period \u2013 which is \u00a351 a month, or \u00a311.80 a week. And that\u2019s before their own costs, the joining fee and tax. The joining fee has been halved to \u00a3100 for non-customers and \u00a350 for customers. Meanwhile, partners are responsible for paying their own tax. Utility Warehouse is quick to sing the praises of its partners, and the competitive advantage they give the firm, but their \u00a313.2m represents only 3.7% of the company\u2019s total revenue for the half year, which was \u00a3353m. The trade body for this sector, the Direct Selling Association, says that while multi-level marketing structures \u201cmay seem similar to pyramid schemes,\u201d which are illegal in the UK, \u201cin reality they are substantially different and are more similar to a conventional corporate business model\u201d. David Brear, who describes himself as an author who has studied cults, says of MLM schemes: \u201cThey are economic cults.\u201d He says one of the key issues is the \u201cchurn rate\u201d \u2013 how many partners leave the business each year, often because they can\u2019t make money from it?

On the issue of commission, Utility Warehouse told us that its partners\u2019 earning potential \u201cis based on the time and effort they put into the business.

We also consider important but lesser-known details from accusers and witnesses.</p> \n<h2><strong>How did Jeffrey Epstein meet the Duke of York?</strong></h2> \n<p>Prince Andrew said in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/prince-andrew-denies-sex-with-teenager-as-at-home-after-pizza-party\">his interview with BBC Newsnight</a> last month he met Epstein in 1999, through Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.</p> \n<p>Maxwell, the socialite daughter of the disgraced press baron Robert Maxwell, has been accused by a number of women of being complicit with Epstein in sex trafficking and abuse and, in some cases, partaking in it. She has denied all allegations against her.</p> \n<p>While it is not disputed that Prince Andrew met Epstein through Maxwell, some have suggested they met earlier than 1999. A 2011 <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-20/prince-andrew-and-jeffrey-epstein-met-in-early-1990s-not-1999-as-claimed-in-interview/\">letter to the Times of London</a> from the prince\u2019s then private secretary, Alastair Watson, suggests the pair knew each other from the early 1990s.</p> \n<h2><strong>How close were Andrew and Epstein?</strong></h2> \n<p>Prince Andrew says he and Epstein were \u201cnot that close\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, the pair attended several private dinners, parties and fundraisers together, including a birthday party the prince threw for Maxwell at Sandringham House, the private residence of the Queen, in 2000. The same year, Epstein and the prince partied <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-claims-he-doesn-t-know-prince-andrew-once-called-n1096081\">with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago</a>, his residence in Palm Beach, Florida.</p> \n<p>The following year, Andrew and Epstein went on holiday together and were pictured on a yacht in Phuket, Thailand, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/andrew-relaxes-on-epsteins-yacht-after-hard-year-on-holiday-5qjz0nh0rkz\">surrounded by topless young women</a>.

The prince said he was unaware of the warrant and that Epstein attended as Maxwell\u2019s guest.</p> \n<p>The prince told the BBC he did not regret his friendship with Epstein, because \u201cthe people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>How significant is Andrew\u2019s relationship with Maxwell?</strong></h2> \n<p>Prince Andrew is alleged to have had sex with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/02/prince-andrew-accuser-virginia-giuffre-asks-uk-public-to-stand-by-her-in-bbc-interview\">Virginia Roberts Giuffre</a> for the first time at Maxwell\u2019s London home.</p> \n<p>The prince and Maxwell are known to have been together at least a dozen times between 1999 and 2001. For instance, they were pictured at Heidi Klum\u2019s \u201chookers and pimps\u201d <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7695307/Prince-Andrew-partied-Heidi-Klum-Ghislaine-Maxwell-New-York-Exclusive-photos.html\">fancy dress party in October 2000</a>, a month after being pictured at the wedding of a mutual friend. There was speculation the pair were dating.</p> \n<p>Maxwell is reported to have introduced the prince to at least one person he dated.</p> \n<p>An email exchange between Andrew and Maxwell, days after the prince was named in US court documents submitted by Roberts Giuffre, suggests he was asking for help in responding to the allegations.</p> \n<p>In the 2015 emails, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/12/02/email-from-prince-andrew-seems-to-show-he-does-remember-virginia-giuffre/\">unearthed in a BBC Panorama investigation</a>, the prince writes: \u201cLet me know when we can talk.

He \u201ccategorically\u201d denies ever having sex with Roberts Giuffre.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, a woman came forward to claim she saw the prince and Roberts Giuffre \u201cfeet away\u201d from each other on the dancefloor at the club.</p> \n<p>The prince told Newsnight \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to forget\u201d having sex with someone, because it\u2019s a \u201cpositive act for a man\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about the second alleged incident?</strong></h2> \n<p>Roberts Giuffre alleges she had sex with Andrew a second time at Epstein\u2019s New York mansion, while she was Epstein\u2019s \u201csex slave\u201d. Andrew says this cannot be true because he was busy on official duties.</p> \n<p>However, a former aide told the Telegraph Andrew had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7705753/Questions-raised-gaps-Prince-Andrews-New-York-charity-trip.html\">gaps</a>\u201d in his diary and was allegedly unaccompanied for several hours in New York at a time when Roberts Giuffre was in the US and says they had sex.</p> \n<p>She says: \u201cI was very surprised to see him again. Epstein and Maxwell were making lewd jokes about \u2018Randy Andy\u2019 \u2026 I had sex with Andy there. I was only paid $400 from Epstein for servicing Andy that time.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>And the third alleged incident on Epstein\u2019s Island, Little St James?</strong></h2> \n<p>In evidence to a Florida court in 2015, Roberts Giuffre wrote: \u201cThe third time I had sex with Andy was in an orgy on Epstein\u2019s private island in the US Virgin Islands.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was around 18 at the time. Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together.

      "bodyText": "Analysis of legal papers, 20 years of newspaper reports and Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s flight logs shows that the deceased financier and convicted sex offender\u2019s friendship with Prince Andrew may have been closer than formerly realised. Here, the Guardian answers some of the key questions about the allegations against the Duke of York and his relationship with Epstein. We also consider important but lesser-known details from accusers and witnesses. How did Jeffrey Epstein meet the Duke of York? Prince Andrew said in his interview with BBC Newsnight last month he met Epstein in 1999, through Epstein\u2019s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell, the socialite daughter of the disgraced press baron Robert Maxwell, has been accused by a number of women of being complicit with Epstein in sex trafficking and abuse and, in some cases, partaking in it. She has denied all allegations against her. While it is not disputed that Prince Andrew met Epstein through Maxwell, some have suggested they met earlier than 1999. A 2011 letter to the Times of London from the prince\u2019s then private secretary, Alastair Watson, suggests the pair knew each other from the early 1990s. How close were Andrew and Epstein? Prince Andrew says he and Epstein were \u201cnot that close\u201d. However, the pair attended several private dinners, parties and fundraisers together, including a birthday party the prince threw for Maxwell at Sandringham House, the private residence of the Queen, in 2000. The same year, Epstein and the prince partied with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Palm Beach, Florida. The following year, Andrew and Epstein went on holiday together and were pictured on a yacht in Phuket, Thailand, surrounded by topless young women. The Times of London reported that the prince\u2019s holiday was paid for by Epstein. A Channel 4 Dispatches programme discovered that over 12 years, from 1999, Epstein and Andrew met on at least 10 occasions, the prince staying for several days at a time at Epstein\u2019s residences in New York, Palm Beach and the Virgin Islands. Epstein even attended an 18th birthday party for Andrew\u2019s daughter, Princess Beatrice, at Windsor Castle in 2006, two months after he had been issued an arrest warrant for sexual assault of a minor. The prince said he was unaware of the warrant and that Epstein attended as Maxwell\u2019s guest. The prince told the BBC he did not regret his friendship with Epstein, because \u201cthe people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful\u201d. How significant is Andrew\u2019s relationship with Maxwell? Prince Andrew is alleged to have had sex with Virginia Roberts Giuffre for the first time at Maxwell\u2019s London home. The prince and Maxwell are known to have been together at least a dozen times between 1999 and 2001. For instance, they were pictured at Heidi Klum\u2019s \u201chookers and pimps\u201d fancy dress party in October 2000, a month after being pictured at the wedding of a mutual friend. There was speculation the pair were dating. Maxwell is reported to have introduced the prince to at least one person he dated. An email exchange between Andrew and Maxwell, days after the prince was named in US court documents submitted by Roberts Giuffre, suggests he was asking for help in responding to the allegations. In the 2015 emails, unearthed in a BBC Panorama investigation, the prince writes: \u201cLet me know when we can talk. Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts.\u201d Maxwell replies: \u201cHave some info. Call me when you have a moment.\u201d Is it possible Andrew did not meet accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, as he claims? Andrew claims to have \u201cno recollection\u201d of meeting Roberts Giuffre, despite being pictured with his arm around her in a now notorious photograph said to have been taken by Epstein. Two men who say they saw the original picture say it is genuine, but friends of Andrew told the London Evening Standard they thought it was fake, claiming Andrew\u2019s fingers are \u201cmuch chubbier\u201d in real life. In an interview with BBC Panorama, Roberts Giuffre insisted the photo was real, saying she gave the original to the FBI in 2001 and adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a date on the back of it from when it was printed.\u201d How many times does Roberts Giuffre allege she and Andrew had sex? Three times. What is Andrew\u2019s response to the first alleged incident with Roberts Giuffre, in London on 10 March 2001? Roberts Giuffre claims she was first trafficked by Epstein to have sex with the prince in Maxwell\u2019s London home after dancing with him at Tramp nightclub. Prince Andrew told BBC Newsnight he was not at Tramp but at a children\u2019s birthday party at a Pizza Express restaurant. He \u201ccategorically\u201d denies ever having sex with Roberts Giuffre. Earlier this week, a woman came forward to claim she saw the prince and Roberts Giuffre \u201cfeet away\u201d from each other on the dancefloor at the club. The prince told Newsnight \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to forget\u201d having sex with someone, because it\u2019s a \u201cpositive act for a man\u201d. What about the second alleged incident? Roberts Giuffre alleges she had sex with Andrew a second time at Epstein\u2019s New York mansion, while she was Epstein\u2019s \u201csex slave\u201d. Andrew says this cannot be true because he was busy on official duties. However, a former aide told the Telegraph Andrew had \u201cgaps\u201d in his diary and was allegedly unaccompanied for several hours in New York at a time when Roberts Giuffre was in the US and says they had sex. She says: \u201cI was very surprised to see him again. Epstein and Maxwell were making lewd jokes about \u2018Randy Andy\u2019 \u2026 I had sex with Andy there. I was only paid $400 from Epstein for servicing Andy that time.\u201d And the third alleged incident on Epstein\u2019s Island, Little St James? In evidence to a Florida court in 2015, Roberts Giuffre wrote: \u201cThe third time I had sex with Andy was in an orgy on Epstein\u2019s private island in the US Virgin Islands. \u201cI was around 18 at the time. Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together. The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d Roberts Giuffre\u2019s allegations were struck from the US court record in 2015. Prince Andrew denies all the allegations. Are there other allegations? Johanna Sjoberg claims Prince Andrew fondled her breast at Epstein\u2019s New York home on the same night as Roberts Giuffre\u2019s second allegation, when she was 21. The prince has denied any sexual contact with Sjoberg. In a defamation suit filed against Maxwell by Roberts Giuffre in 2015, Sjoberg says she, Roberts Giuffre and another female were invited to sit on Andrew\u2019s lap to pose for a photo with him and his Spitting Image puppet. She said: \u201cVirginia \u2026 sat on a chair and had the puppet on her lap. Andrew sat on another chair, I sat on his lap \u2013 and he put his hand on my breast. Ghislaine put the puppet\u2019s hand on Virginia\u2019s breast, then Andrew put his hand on mine. It was a great joke.\u201d Differences between Giuffre and Sjoberg\u2019s recollections of this night have been noted. Asked about accusations of inconsistency during her BBC Panorama interview, Roberts Giuffre said: \u201cYou are left with a foggy memory sometimes, you really are. I might be wrong on dates absolutely and I might be wrong on places even, sometimes \u2026 But one thing that I can tell you is you never forget the face of someone who has heaved over you.\u201d Last month, Sjoberg said she was prepared to share her claims with the FBI. What do others say who witnessed Andrew and Epstein together? Prince Andrew was seen inside the New York home of Epstein getting a foot massage from a young woman, according to emails between a literary agent, John Brockman, and author Evgeny Morozov. Brockman is reported to have said: \u201cLast time I visited his house, I walked in to find him in a sweatsuit and a British guy in a suit with suspenders [braces], getting foot massages from two young well-dressed Russian women.\u201d Brockman writes that the prince complained about his public profile. \u201cIn Monaco, Albert works 12 hours a day but at 9pm, when he goes out, he does whatever he wants, and nobody cares. But, if I do it, I\u2019m in big trouble,\u201d the emails describe him as saying. At that point, Brockman writes: \u201cI realized that the recipient of Irina\u2019s foot massage was his Royal Highness, Prince Andrew, Duke of York.\u201d What can we learn from Epstein\u2019s flight logs? Prince Andrew flew on Epstein\u2019s private plane at least four times, once to Edinburgh, once to the Virgin Islands and twice to Palm Beach. Six weeks after Epstein was arrested for sex offences on 1 September 2006, the prince flew from London Luton to Edinburgh on Epstein\u2019s plane with Maxwell. An analysis of the flight logs by Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches found that on 16 April 1998, Epstein met \u201cPrincess Sarah Ferguson and kids\u201d on the ground in Nassau in the Bahamas. The flight logs also confirm that Roberts Giuffre was in London on the night of her first alleged meeting with the prince. How does Andrew\u2019s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, fit into all this? In December 2010, the Duchess of York was given \u00a315,000 by Epstein to help pay off her debts, just 18 months after he was released from jail for soliciting prostitution from underage girls. The Duchess later claimed her judgment had been \u201cclouded\u201d by her desperation to get out of her \u00a35m debt and vowed to repay the money. She is understood to have visited Epstein\u2019s properties several times. The Duchess told the Evening Standard: \u201cI personally, on behalf of myself, deeply regret that Jeffrey Epstein became involved in any way with me.\u201d What now for Andrew? The prince has stepped down from official duties. Five Epstein accusers want him to give evidence in US courts, saying he must talk to the FBI. Their lawyer, David Boies, claims Andrew witnessed men being given massages at the financier\u2019s homes. Pre-trial witness subpoenas have been prepared for the five cases and could be served on the prince if he sets foot in the US again.",

He boasted about the video he made on 17 November, writing on the Facebook group that he would not house the tenants, whom he described as \u201cidiots\u201d, and it was \u201ctime to get tough\u201d. Celebrating the publicity he got for the video, he said of Labour supporters: \u201cThey are so daft. It\u2019s gone from 2,000 views to 6,000 views in two hours because they are all sharing it. That\u2019s brilliant publicity. Wait till Corbyn gives them free internet. I will be a megastar.\u201d Ashfield is a key target for the Tories, having been won by Labour last time by just 441 votes. Labour\u2019s Gloria de Piero announced she was standing down as the constituency\u2019s MP this year. Anderson has actively encouraged people to join the Ashfield Backs Boris Facebook group. Short\u2019s tweet from 2013 was directed at Melanie Phillips, who was appearing on the BBC\u2019s Question Time. He wrote: \u201cBeing a bit zionist is her allegiance to UK or Israel.\u201d St Helens South and Whiston is a safe seat for Labour with a 24,000 majority.",

Certain directors have that eye where something is beautiful as well as funny. And it feels like it\u2019s not just surface-level. Comedy can be quite stark. If you\u2019re just making people laugh, that can be one-dimensional. You have to bring something artistic into it, so it\u2019s working on another plane or is more complex.</p> <p>Making comedy is a privilege, so you should be doing something no one else can do. That\u2019s when it feels like art; it\u2019s a personal expression and it\u2019s being done in a unique way.</p> <h2>Josie Long<br>Natalie Helped Him</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c6f71d4d306263e7b9ee3e297e4df777703859b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c6f71d4d306263e7b9ee3e297e4df777703859b/0_0_3420_2391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josie Long\u2019s Natalie Helped Him\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josie Long\u2019s Natalie Helped Him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been trying to copy surrealist collages since I was a teenager, mainly to try and make my friends laugh. The best one I ever did is still mixing up a textbook on cathedral architecture and an annotated picture of the body\u2019s organs. For me, the pleasure in doing art is the process. Sometimes cutting up and rearranging text is the funniest thing in the world because it feels so naughty.</p> <p>The musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jeffrey-lewis\">Jeffrey Lewis</a> is my inspiration when it comes to comics. He works them into his live shows and writes about all kinds of subjects and styles. When I started out telling stories on stage, I used to have big A2 comic books to illustrate. I only stopped because they were so heavy and I wanted to see if I could do standup with no props. Some comics are definitely \u201cartistic\u201d in what they do: Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr, Bryony Kimmings, Harry Hill. James Acaster has a very pure and artistic approach to his work but, God dammit, we are all artists as well as silly clowns!</p> <p>As for my favourite artists, I love Marc Chagall\u2019s beautiful spirit and loving energy, and Dorothy Iannone is beautiful, loving and vibrant beyond belief. At home, we have a lot of really silly art: a picture of Simon and Garfunkel where one is saying: \u201cIs this art?\u201d; another one says, \u201cSpeaking!\u201d \u2013 the comedian Caroline Mabey made it for a party about 15 years ago where everyone had to bring a painting. But my sister is the real artist in my family, and she drew a portrait of my daughter which has pride of place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a4e07ff05797f9a3aa39255e2467bdb1e1a0fb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a4e07ff05797f9a3aa39255e2467bdb1e1a0fb5/15_13_931_1181/788.jpg\" alt=\"Vic Reeves\u2019s Batman at Ease\" width=\"788\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vic Reeves\u2019s Batman at Ease.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Vic Reeves<br>Batman at Ease</h2> <p>I did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/batman\">Batman</a> on the toilet<strong> </strong>for Big Night Out; we animated it for the show.

I reckon he\u2019s thinking about his life: \u201cIs it really worth it, what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m Bruce Wayne, I\u2019ve got a big mansion, do I wanna be doing this?\u201d</p> <p>I paint celebrities, too, but I don\u2019t think of myself as a famous person, I\u2019m detached from it all. I\u2019ve only ever thought of myself as an onlooker. I really like the human body so I paint a lot of nudity; that comes from going to life classes. Basically, I like muscle formation but I also like Jimmy Tarbuck and taking the piss out of The X Factor.</p> <p>There\u2019s not really a gap between my comedy and my art; it\u2019s all the same thing. The comedy I do on TV came from me being at art school and seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gilbertandgeorge\">Gilbert and George</a> films, thinking they were hilarious. I was trying to do that, a sketch version of art, and it ended up on TV. Comedy and art go hand in hand, even if it\u2019s not laugh-out-loud. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney\">David Hockney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/peter-blake\">Peter Blake</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/basquiat\">[Jean-Michel] Basquiat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/25/john-currin-review-sadie-coles-gallery-london\">John Curr</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/25/john-currin-review-sadie-coles-gallery-london\">in</a>. I want that in my art, too; the way I allow myself into other people is with humour, so it comes out in my art. I\u2019ve got notebooks of ideas but I tend to really keep things in my head. And when you have an idea, you have to act on it or it\u2019ll drift away. I paint or sketch for two, three hours every day. It keeps me sane. Bob [Mortimer]\u2019s painting is absolutely diabolical. Honestly, it\u2019s like a six-year-old child. He did a drawing of a frog once for me on a train, and I laughed all the way from Birmingham to the capital.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.fiumanoclase.com/exhibitions/16/overview/\">Art Is the Best Medicine is at Fiumano Clase, WC1, Friday 13 to 20 December</a></em></p>",

And David Shrigley, with his barbed whimsy, is often laugh-out-loud funny. It works the other way, too.

In standup, the relationship between the jokes and art is more subtle. An hour in Maria Bamford\u2019s company is a positively cubist experience in its disjointedness, and Simon Munnery errs towards the abstract (see his routine about his act belonging somewhere between unfunny comedy and bad art). Now, today\u2019s crop of standups are showing off their artistic chops, with an exhibition raising money for Mental Health UK. It\u2019s been curated by comic and artist Annie McGrath, and is quite the showcase: behold Harry Hill\u2019s take on Leonardo, and Josie Long\u2019s comic strips and collages. Joe Lycett plays it for laughs with his painting of a baby with the slogan \u201cWear a condom\u201d, while Eleanor Thom speaks about how art helps her cope with the \u201cconsistent pain\u201d of endometriosis.

I thought: \u201cIf this was my career I\u2019d be so happy.\u201d I like art that\u2019s simple but feels kind of genius \u2013 like David Shrigley or David Hockney. I like things with bright colours [that] aren\u2019t too stressful to look at, blues and yellows. That\u2019s my very intellectual art review! I don\u2019t really love looking at people on my walls; it\u2019s like people are in your house. I think [US comedy-drama] Atlanta is a work of art. Certain directors have that eye where something is beautiful as well as funny. And it feels like it\u2019s not just surface-level. Comedy can be quite stark. If you\u2019re just making people laugh, that can be one-dimensional. You have to bring something artistic into it, so it\u2019s working on another plane or is more complex. Making comedy is a privilege, so you should be doing something no one else can do. That\u2019s when it feels like art; it\u2019s a personal expression and it\u2019s being done in a unique way. Josie Long Natalie Helped Him I\u2019ve been trying to copy surrealist collages since I was a teenager, mainly to try and make my friends laugh. The best one I ever did is still mixing up a textbook on cathedral architecture and an annotated picture of the body\u2019s organs. For me, the pleasure in doing art is the process. Sometimes cutting up and rearranging text is the funniest thing in the world because it feels so naughty. The musician Jeffrey Lewis is my inspiration when it comes to comics. He works them into his live shows and writes about all kinds of subjects and styles. When I started out telling stories on stage, I used to have big A2 comic books to illustrate. I only stopped because they were so heavy and I wanted to see if I could do standup with no props. Some comics are definitely \u201cartistic\u201d in what they do: Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr, Bryony Kimmings, Harry Hill. James Acaster has a very pure and artistic approach to his work but, God dammit, we are all artists as well as silly clowns! As for my favourite artists, I love Marc Chagall\u2019s beautiful spirit and loving energy, and Dorothy Iannone is beautiful, loving and vibrant beyond belief. At home, we have a lot of really silly art: a picture of Simon and Garfunkel where one is saying: \u201cIs this art?\u201d; another one says, \u201cSpeaking!\u201d \u2013 the comedian Caroline Mabey made it for a party about 15 years ago where everyone had to bring a painting. But my sister is the real artist in my family, and she drew a portrait of my daughter which has pride of place. Vic Reeves Batman at Ease I did Batman on the toilet for Big Night Out; we animated it for the show. I\u2019ve done loads of superheroes having a dump, simply because that\u2019s not what you expect them to be doing. I reckon he\u2019s thinking about his life: \u201cIs it really worth it, what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m Bruce Wayne, I\u2019ve got a big mansion, do I wanna be doing this?\u201d I paint celebrities, too, but I don\u2019t think of myself as a famous person, I\u2019m detached from it all. I\u2019ve only ever thought of myself as an onlooker. I really like the human body so I paint a lot of nudity; that comes from going to life classes. Basically, I like muscle formation but I also like Jimmy Tarbuck and taking the piss out of The X Factor. There\u2019s not really a gap between my comedy and my art; it\u2019s all the same thing. The comedy I do on TV came from me being at art school and seeing Gilbert and George films, thinking they were hilarious. I was trying to do that, a sketch version of art, and it ended up on TV. Comedy and art go hand in hand, even if it\u2019s not laugh-out-loud. David Hockney, Peter Blake, [Jean-Michel] Basquiat, John Currin. I want that in my art, too; the way I allow myself into other people is with humour, so it comes out in my art. I\u2019ve got notebooks of ideas but I tend to really keep things in my head. And when you have an idea, you have to act on it or it\u2019ll drift away. I paint or sketch for two, three hours every day. It keeps me sane. Bob [Mortimer]\u2019s painting is absolutely diabolical. Honestly, it\u2019s like a six-year-old child. He did a drawing of a frog once for me on a train, and I laughed all the way from Birmingham to the capital.

Six wickets down with two overs left looks closer than it was. Melbourne suffered the loss of Danni Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont, but made enough runs anyway. Or it should have been enough, with Brisbane\u2019s bowlers collared late and unable to break through in the middle. But the Renegades bowled and fielded atrociously through the first Powerplay and gave away 70 runs for the opening partnership without one of the league\u2019s biggest stars, Beth Mooney, even having to do much. </p> <p>For Brisbane\u2019s part, they were ruthless. When both openers fell in consecutive balls, other teams might have been rattled. But Jonassen and Grace Harris kept the foot down, and got their team close enough that the result was never really in doubt.</p> <p>Brisbane won last year, now they\u2019ll try to go back to back. Adelaide have the player of the year in Sophie Devine, and should be a sterner test than Melbourne were today. We\u2019ll have that game for you tomorrow on the Guardian\u2019s over-by-over report.

The umpires check the replay for no-ball though, and rule it illegitimate. I\u2019m not sure about that: it was above waist high when Harris made contact, but it was dipping sharply and would have been below that height when it reached the body.

Wareham flights a leg-break beautifully. It dips on Harris. It lands well short of her. Harris follows through with the shot anyway. She has no right to make contact. Certainly not to control it. But somehow she drives it on the up, meeting it at around hip height, and <strong>skyscrapers it down the ground for six. </strong>Next ball, fuller, more conventionally <strong>swept for six more!</strong> Harris is mauling the Renegades now.

That\u2019s when she showed she could be more than a lower-order type. She\u2019s usually still stuck down there for Australia, but has made matchwinning runs often in the past few years. But rarely has she made powerful fast runs like she has this WBBL season. Her evolution is fascinating.

Duffin plays Kimmince differently, waiting back, dropping her weight onto the back foot, then slapping her cut shot over cover for four. Top shot against this style of bowling. Duffin backs away again but this time DK bowls fuller and at her legs, resulting in a push to Jonassen at backward point. No run. Kimmince again, on the pads, full toss, <strong>whacked away to deep backward square and dropped!</strong> Amelia Kerr spills it, a fairly straightforward chance though it would have been spinning, curving in the air a bit, and flat.

Mooney walks up to the stumps so that Duffin might think twice before leaving her crease, so Duffin drops deeper and forces away a run to cover. Dooley cuts one more run. <strong>Beam ball from Johnson!</strong> Slips out of the hand and nearly hits Duffin on the badge. She manages to knock the ball away, just, and falls over in the process.

But she goes to the well once too often, trying to loft on the up over cover, and getting a thick outside edge taken at backward point.<strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5deb23918f08bacaf000bc05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-07T04:01:23.323Z\">4.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>3rd over: Melbourne Renegades 12-0 (Lanning 8, Atapattu 3)</strong> The Sri Lankan skipper off strike again early, then there\u2019s a misfield from Short that allows Lanning\u2019s off-drive to get through for four!

      "bodyText": "Brisbane win, which wasn\u2019t unexpected, but the Renegades should have run them closer. Six wickets down with two overs left looks closer than it was. Melbourne suffered the loss of Danni Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont, but made enough runs anyway. Or it should have been enough, with Brisbane\u2019s bowlers collared late and unable to break through in the middle. But the Renegades bowled and fielded atrociously through the first Powerplay and gave away 70 runs for the opening partnership without one of the league\u2019s biggest stars, Beth Mooney, even having to do much. For Brisbane\u2019s part, they were ruthless. When both openers fell in consecutive balls, other teams might have been rattled. But Jonassen and Grace Harris kept the foot down, and got their team close enough that the result was never really in doubt. Brisbane won last year, now they\u2019ll try to go back to back. Adelaide have the player of the year in Sophie Devine, and should be a sterner test than Melbourne were today. We\u2019ll have that game for you tomorrow on the Guardian\u2019s over-by-over report. Till then. 18th over: Brisbane Heat 166-6 (Johnson 6, Short 4) Carly Leeson was supposed to have the dubious honour of conceding the winning runs, but she picks up Grace Harris first. Kirby Short comes in, the skipper, and after a few nervous dots and a single to Johnson, Short cuts four through cover point to seal the win! Another late one for the Gades! What they could have done if they hadn\u2019t conceded so many in the first five or six overs. Leeson isn\u2019t expecting much, but Harris lofts her down the ground to a catch at long-on. 17th over: Brisbane Heat 160-5 (Grace Harris 42, Johnson 5) What an eventful over from Kershaw. Mostly full tosses. The overruled wicket. The other wicket. Some near boundaries that aren\u2019t collared properly. Then when she lands her last ball on the pitch, Harris sweeps it for four! Life, hey. A boundary needed to win it. I\u2019ll try to catch you up here. Erica Kershaw on to bowl, just to wrong-foot everyone and she has Grace Harris caught at deep midwicket! Off a high full toss. The umpires check the replay for no-ball though, and rule it illegitimate. I\u2019m not sure about that: it was above waist high when Harris made contact, but it was dipping sharply and would have been below that height when it reached the body. Anyway, she\u2019s reprieved, then when Kershaw lands one of her leg-breaks, Kerr slices it to point. 16th over: Brisbane Heat 151-4 (Grace Harris 41, Kerr 1) Strano\u2019s spell ends with 4 for 28. She\u2019s done her part, but her teammates have left her down. Two in three balls now for Strano! The Harris sisters are only together in the middle for a moment, as Laura gets down and tries to sweep and misses. She would be plumb lbw, but she\u2019s saved from that fate as the ball trickles back between her legs and bowls her. Too little too late, but Strano lands this one gorgeously. From around the wicket, it dips, lands on the crease and gets under Jonassen\u2019s shot. Hitting the stumps helps. \u201cStop bowling full tosses,\u201d was Jess Duffin\u2019s answer on the player mic a few overs ago when asked what her bowlers needed to do to get back in the game. 15th over: Brisbane Heat 149-2 (Jonassen 38, Grace Harris 40) Well, when you\u2019re hot you\u2019re hot. Wareham flights a leg-break beautifully. It dips on Harris. It lands well short of her. Harris follows through with the shot anyway. She has no right to make contact. Certainly not to control it. But somehow she drives it on the up, meeting it at around hip height, and skyscrapers it down the ground for six. Next ball, fuller, more conventionally swept for six more! Harris is mauling the Renegades now. Brisbane are 15 runs from the final. 14th over: Brisbane Heat 134-2 (Jonassen 36, Grace Harris 27) Lea Tahuhu. Nearly drags an over back. Bowls four dots. A couple of leg byes from another. But Harris is confident, and the one short ball is nailed on the pull for four. 13th over: Brisbane Heat 128-2 (Jonassen 36, Grace Harris 23) Leeson. Length. Jonassen under it. Say no more. Six over midwicket. Jonassen\u2019s journey as a top-tier batting talent began with her 99 in the Canterbury Ashes Test of 2015. That\u2019s when she showed she could be more than a lower-order type. She\u2019s usually still stuck down there for Australia, but has made matchwinning runs often in the past few years. But rarely has she made powerful fast runs like she has this WBBL season. Her evolution is fascinating. Grace enjoyed that from the far end, then enjoys it even more when she gets on strike and cracks six of her own over midwicket. A full toss. They only need 36 now from seven overs. 12th over: Brisbane Heat 113-2 (Jonassen 29, Grace Harris 15) How often would Harris be the junior player in a partnership? She was the first to ever make a Big Bash hundred back in the first season. She\u2019s got 4 to Jonassen\u2019s 24 now, and make that 25 as Jonassen works a single. Harris fixes that now, dragging six over midwicket! Powerful hitter. Atapattu the bowler, with her offies. Goes with a wider line next ball and Harris cuts four! Flicks square, wants a second but can\u2019t get back. No matter, Jonassen goes over cover for four more. 16 from the over. Barely a run a ball needed for 51 from 48. 11th over: Brisbane Heat 97-2 (Jonassen 24, Grace Harris 4) Carly Leeson on to bowl, an interesting action, head down and a tangle of limbs and hair. A couple of singles are a decent start, then Jonassen lifts her over wide long-on for six! Wareham down on the rope is leaping like a salmon, trying to get fingertips on that, but it just carries her. Timing from Jonassen, who is not a heavily built of powerful player, but has a lovely eye. The Heat are on track. 67 from 54 needed. 10th over: Brisbane Heat 86-2 (Jonassen 15, Grace Harris 2) Jonassen has been batting beautifully this whole season. Shows that touch against Strano, just gliding her with the left-hander\u2019s angle for two behind point. Driving two wide of mid-off. Lofting on the bounce to long-off. 9th over: Brisbane Heat 80-2 (Jonassen 10, Grace Harris 1) It helps build a new stand when you get a big full toss. Floated up from Wareham, and Jonassen puts it away. Lands them better thereafter, but JJ drags away a streaky boundary through midwicket from the last ball of the over. Not letting up. 8th over: Brisbane Heat 70-2 (Jonassen 1, Grace Harris 0) Jonassen survives the hat-trick ball from Strano, but suddenly Brisbane have to form a new partnership. The fast opening stand though has still left them in best position. That\u2019s the first thing they needed to do just that. Two in two balls! The batters crossed so Mooney was on strike. She lofts Strano down the ground, straight to long-off! At last for the Renegades, a wicket! Maddy Green has done a huge job for her team. Molly Strano buys the wicket in the end. A massive six down the ground, four more from the outside edge, then finally Green goes once too often and clouts the ball miles into the air but Wareham settles under it to take the catch. Brisbane need 95 off 74, a comparatively modest ask. Can Melbourne try to pull back control? 7th over: Brisbane Heat 59-0 (Mooney 15, Green 36) With the Powerplay done, Wareham the leg-spinner from country Vic is on strike. Did her job and more with the bat, but the Renegades need her even more with the ball. It\u2019s been a disaster so far and they have to pull something from the fire. Nice loop and flight from Wareham, landing them well, but there\u2019s another mistake in the field. Anna Lanning running around at long-off reaches the ball but lets it through her hands for four. More charity runs. 6th over: Brisbane Heat 50-0 (Mooney 13, Green 30) The near misses keep coming for Green. A little glove that falls short of the keeper, an attempted loft that skews up high but just clears mid-on and plugs. Tahuhu keeps Mooney quiet in between times, round the wicket to the left-hander to do her for bounce. 5th over: Brisbane Heat 45-0 (Mooney 11, Green 26) Clean hitting from Green so far today. Maitlan Brown bowls length on her pads, Green gets under it and clouts it into the midwicket gap for four. A few singles and it\u2019s 8 more from the over. 4th over: Brisbane Heat 37-0 (Mooney 9, Green 20) Tahuhu, zeroing in on the pads, tangling up Green. Scrambles a single. Atapattu came flying in to attack that ball, trying to impose herself on the game. Mooney strikes nicely to cover but it\u2019s well stopped. Then more overthrows! Four of them! That\u2019s horrible backing up at fine leg, it might have been Kershaw there. Mooney chops to point, sets off, Green would have been short at the striker\u2019s end by a distance, but the throw misses and there\u2019s no one at backward point to stop the boundary. Plus the run the batters took, that makes it a five. Then another wide from Tahuhu, the Renegades are just donating runs. The final ball is top-edged by Green to deep third, where Kerhshaw tries to make amends by diving and taking a hard fall to stop the boundary. Good effort, but a horrible start from the Gades all round. Brisbane at better than 9 an over. 3rd over: Brisbane Heat 27-0 (Mooney 3, Green 17) Molly Strano now, the off-spinner who has played for Australia. Trots up to the crease. Bowls short and Green cuts. Bowls full and Green carts her across the line, landing just inside the rope. Two boundaries. The Heat are flying out of the blocks and Mooney has barely hit a ball! 2nd over: Brisbane Heat 18-0 (Mooney 2, Green 9) Another close one for Green, who tries to pull the Kiwi quick Lea Tahuhu and gets a big top edge that lands safely. Then Mooney charges, misses as Tahuhu carves the ball off the seam, and from an angle around the wicket to the left-hander it pitches outside off and misses leg stump, beats Dooley, and goes for four byes. Lots of freebies for Brisbane, but it\u2019s not like the Renegades have done a lot wrong. Just bad luck. 1st over: Brisbane Heat 9-0 (Mooney 1, Green 7) The first over is a bit of a shambles for all concerned. Maitlan Brown bowls a wide, Mooney pulls to get off strike, then there\u2019s a pie that Green cuts for four. Green then nearly chops on, edging past her stumps, and Lanning really puts in some effort to make a diving stop at fine leg. Atapattu makes a good stop at cover, then botches her throw to the keeper and gives away a run. Everyone is edgy. That\u2019s a fine total for a final, where pressure does a lot extra. The Renegades have handled this well without Danni Wyatt, who can so often make a fast 50 to start an innings off. Anna Lanning struggled early but made up her deficit with a couple of boundaries before getting out. Atapattu did the same and was unlucky, but her dismissal brought in Melbourne\u2019s clutch player in Duffin. She did the bulk of the work with Dooley, who picked a great time for a personal best score, then Wareham iced the cake. For Brisbane, Beth Mooney will be the trump card after her outstanding year, then there are plenty of fast-scoring types through the line-up. But a few quiet overs can do wonders... 20th over: Melbourne Renegades 163-4 (Dooley 50) Kimmince bowls short, Dooley pulls hard for a single, and that\u2019s her first WBBL fifty. She\u2019s played a key role against her old team. Wareham on strike, swats it for four! Across the line and flat-bats it through square leg! Kimmince digs deep, channels her younger days, and cranks up the bouncer! On around off stump, and Wareham reaches for it but can\u2019t make contact! Full goes Kimmince next ball, and Wareham lofts it into the gap at wide midwicket, racing back for the second. Two balls to go. Length ball. Wareham gets under it! Lofts it straight! For six! She has 21 from 7 balls! What a cameo this is. Final ball of the innings, very slow, Wareham waits, drags a pull across the line, races back in a gamble for a second run, hoping the throw is bad, but it isn\u2019t. She\u2019s run out from the last ball, but she\u2019s done a wonderful job for her team. Wareham run out 22 (8 balls) 19th over: Melbourne Renegades 149-3 (Dooley 49, Wareham 9) Alternatively, Georgia Wareham could add 20 at the death. She skips down and cleans up Jonassen over midwicket for four. Then kneels and slots her sweep shot for four more! Lovely hitting. Winds up and absolutely murders the next ball, but Harris right on the paint at midwicket gets down to keep it to one. Wareham has 9 from 3 balls. Dooley walks down and misses but gets it off her toe away for a leg bye. Jonassen has a typically frugal 1 for 25 from her four overs despite a final over costing 14 with several extras that don\u2019t go against the bowler. Second time lucky! First ball of the over, Duffin slaps and misses and is probably out of her crease as Mooney misses the take and concedes four byes. Second ball, Jonassen bowls fast and zips it through, Duffin plays the same sort of way, and is miles out after missing the ball. That\u2019s huge for Brisbane, could be worth 20 runs at the death. 18th over: Melbourne Renegades 135-2 (Dooley 49, Duffin 44) Prestwidge to bowl with 18 balls remaining. Make that 17, as Dooley charges and misses her attempted drive. Even a run a ball here takes them to 150, which would have to be competitive. Dooley advances again, pulls, big top edge but it lands safely around mid-on. Duffin backs away, tries to slam over point, but also gets a big top edge that carries backward point but only yields a run. Prestwidge bowls a wide, then a couple more singles. Only 5 from the over. No, 4. The wide wasn\u2019t called I don\u2019t think? Did it flick the pad? 17th over: Melbourne Renegades 131-2 (Dooley 47, Duffin 42) Another half chance from Duffin, as she mows Grace Harris back past the bowler. I don\u2019t know if Harris got a touch on it, but you could hear her in the stump mic yelling \u201cThat was a catch!\u201d Dooley goes big next ball, really walloping but it lands short of the boundary at midwicket, netting her two. Then when Duffin gets on strike she hits the same shot but much better, flat rather than high, and nails the gap for four! That\u2019s gorgeous contact. Harris\u2019 last ball for the day, a full toss, and Duffin sweeps it for six! Flat over square leg! This is some knock. 14 from the over! 16th over: Melbourne Renegades 117-2 (Dooley 44, Duffin 31) Kimmince is back with her lack of pace, and it nearly brings results immediately. A sliced edge that lands safely at cover point, between two players in the ring. Dooley gets one and gets off strike. Duffin plays Kimmince differently, waiting back, dropping her weight onto the back foot, then slapping her cut shot over cover for four. Top shot against this style of bowling. Duffin backs away again but this time DK bowls fuller and at her legs, resulting in a push to Jonassen at backward point. No run. Kimmince again, on the pads, full toss, whacked away to deep backward square and dropped! Amelia Kerr spills it, a fairly straightforward chance though it would have been spinning, curving in the air a bit, and flat. Duffin nailed the strike, just hit it airborne. Takes a run, Dooley reciprocates, then Duffin walks at Kimmince and nails a pull shot to deep midwicket, but straight to the sweeper. Great shot for one run. Eight from that over. 15th over: Melbourne Renegades 109-2 (Dooley 42, Duffin 25) Kerr to Duffin, full toss, slapped over mid-off for four! Backs away leg side of the ball, and for a minute it looks like it might be caught, but there\u2019s enough on it. Duffin gets down to sweep but doesn\u2019t get much of it, only a single. Dooley drops to a knee and laps Kerr away for two runs to fine leg. It\u2019s been quite the hand from Dooley. Down the wicket again and drives to long-on for one. Four in the ring on the off side and one sweeping at cover. Duffin drives back to the bowler, no run. But the last of the over Duffin hangs back in her crease again, waits, gets under the ball and lofts it for four! A cross-bat whack, not much subtlety about it but it gets the job done. A dozen runs from the over. They need five more like it. 14th over: Melbourne Renegades 97-2 (Dooley 39, Duffin 16) Sammy-Jo Johnson is back, straight in at the stumps but Duffin gets bat on it, one run. Floats up a slower ball and Dooley picks it to drive, but the cover sweeper gets in the way. Mooney walks up to the stumps so that Duffin might think twice before leaving her crease, so Duffin drops deeper and forces away a run to cover. Dooley cuts one more run. Beam ball from Johnson! Slips out of the hand and nearly hits Duffin on the badge. She manages to knock the ball away, just, and falls over in the process. So she doesn\u2019t take the run to deep backward square. But she can\u2019t take anything off the free hit, slamming it straight to mid-off. To follow that comes a wide, bouncing off the keeper for another extra, and nearly a run out with a direct hit. Then Dooley walks across and finishes the over with a six, launched over long-on and banging off the roof of the stand. 13th over: Melbourne Renegades 84-2 (Dooley 31, Duffin 14) Grace Harris bowling really nicely, and also commentating her own overs on the TV broadcast. This is great viewing, she\u2019s talking through her plans to both batters and then delivering. Except for one ball that she drags down to Duffin, who puts away her cut shot for four. 12th over: Melbourne Renegades 76-2 (Dooley 29, Duffin 8) Jonassen darts in at the stumps, Duffin skips and lumps it over the bowler\u2019s head for four. Simple game. Advances again but this time the length isn\u2019t there, and Duffin has to open the face and push to point for one. Dooley goes hard across her pads to deep midwicket but won\u2019t chance the second with Prestwidge bearing down. Duffin cuts, only for one with backward point set deep. Dooley charging now, driving over mid-off, just clearing the field, and they only get one. Should have perhaps hustled a second. 11th over: Melbourne Renegades 67-2 (Dooley 26, Duffin 2) Amelia Kerr is back. Such a remarkable career already for one so young. Was a bowler to watch in NZ domestic cricket from the age of 14, then battered the highest ever score in women\u2019s ODIs with a double ton against Ireland. Dooley sweeps a run, then Duffin finally gets her first, chopping one square. HawkEye suggests that Duffin should have been out \u2013 she moved across her stumps so it did create the illusion that she was hit outside the line. So the Gades got unlucky with Atapattu, and lucky with Duffin. Dooley drives gorgeously to deep midwicket but Kimmince dives for a corking save on the line, with Grace Harris backing her up for the one-two throw. 10th over: Melbourne Renegades 60-2 (Dooley 21, Duffin 0) Gorgeous over from Jess Jonassen, the left-arm orthodox. Dooley gets a run first ball, then Duffin is becalmed for the next five. There\u2019s a raucous appeal for a ball that was angled at the stumps, maybe just outside the line? Then Duffin backs away, swings hard, takes the ball off her stumps but lumps it straight to mid-off on the bounce. That\u2019s drinks. 9th over: Melbourne Renegades 59-2 (Dooley 20, Duffin 0) Jess Duffin, the Renegades\u2019 key, is out to the middle now. HawkEye suggests that the ball to Atapattu was the googly, and therefore would have missed the left-hander\u2019s off stump by about a metre. It pitched so close to the pad that it was impossible to read the turn. Them\u2019s the breaks, I guess. Duffin blocks out a couple of dot balls to close the over. Very positive play from Josie Dooley. Gets across to Kerr first ball of the over and sweeps hard but only finds the sweeper. Kerr bowls a filthy full toss, real moon ball, and Atapattu tried to hit it so hard at head high that she can only drag it for one. It\u2019s called a no-ball, and Dooley clips the on-drive nicely but finds Harris on the rope. Atapattu charges and doesn\u2019t pick the googly, but gets bat on it to save herself from a stumping. Thick outside edge. But she can\u2019t save herself from the lbw. Atapattu thinks she hit the ball as she came across the line. Huge flight on that once again, it dipped, it landed in front of her pads, she tried to sweep but it was so full that it burrowed under her gloves. She thinks she made some contact, the umpire has a long think and decides not. 8th over: Melbourne Renegades 55-1 (Atapattu 20, Dooley 18) Georgia Prestwidge to bowl next, medium pace over the wicket. Dooley gets a single thanks to an overthrow. The left-handed Sri Lankan on strike now, walks at Prestwidge but drives to cover, then wafts at a wider one and misses. Back on leg stump and Atapattu jams a single off her pads. Dooley skips at the bowler and drives her for four! Lovely contact on the off-drive, wide of the fielder! Created a half volley for herself. Then advances again but the line is at her pads, and she gets a fat leading edge through backward point, lucky to hit a gap there. 7th over: Melbourne Renegades 48-1 (Atapattu 19, Dooley 12) Amelia Kerr is on, the New Zealand leg-spinner. Bowling with a lot of loop in this over. Beth Mooney is very confident in appealing for a stumping, but Atapattu\u2019s foot had never dragged out of the crease. After a few singles, Chamari sweeps hard behind square for four. 6th over: Melbourne Renegades 41-1 (Atapattu 14, Dooley 10) Delissa Kimmince on to bowl, the Australian all-rounder who played a key role in the Women\u2019s Ashes mid-year. She basically bowls about nine different slower balls and rarely gives away runs. She gives Dooley a boundary first ball though, on the pads and easily driven through midwicket. Kimmince turns the screws after that, her unhittable length that sees Dooley face a few dots and then squeeze a single. But Chamari Atapattu has a way of doing things that other players can\u2019t. Leg stump line, she gets under it, flicking to leg, and top edges a six! That was all edge, but it soars away, miles in the air, and carries the fence! What a strike. 5th over: Melbourne Renegades 30-1 (Atapattu 8, Dooley 5) A good over from Harris, especially to Dooley, who survives a tight lbw appeal. But right at the end Harris gets a bit short, Atapattu carves away behind point, and another misfield gives a bit of oxygen back to the Renegades innings. 4th over: Melbourne Renegades 24-1 (Atapattu 3, Dooley 4) Next in is Josie Dooley, who normally bats down the order, but she\u2019s eased into her work with a full toss on the pads from Sammy-Jo, and Dooley flicks it behind square for four. Cheers. That over starts better from Lanning \u2013 she seens width, knows she can throw her hands at it, and gets a thick top edge through the empty slips for four. Then gets a short ball and cleans it up with a pull shot for four more! But she goes to the well once too often, trying to loft on the up over cover, and getting a thick outside edge taken at backward point. 3rd over: Melbourne Renegades 12-0 (Lanning 8, Atapattu 3) The Sri Lankan skipper off strike again early, then there\u2019s a misfield from Short that allows Lanning\u2019s off-drive to get through for four! A lucky accident. Jess Jonassen the bowler, and she follows up with a beauty! That turned appreciably and goes past the outside edge! She\u2019s getting lovely bounce too from this surface and she skips over Lanning\u2019s attempted cut shot. Lanning struggling early, 8 from 14 balls, and four of those runs from fortune. 2nd over: Melbourne Renegades 6-0 (Lanning 3, Atapattu 2) Sammy-Jo Johnson at the other end, bowls rapidly at times, and she\u2019s right on top of Lanning early. Atapattu gets off strike, there\u2019s a wide, then Lanning is stuck there, mis-hitting, finding the field, and then being startled by a bouncer that she can\u2019t get hear. Good variation. 1st over: Melbourne Renegades 4-0 (Lanning 3, Atapattu 1) The Heat opening their bowling with Grace Harris today, a tall off-spinner, giving these batters no pace to work with. Some bounce too, enabling Atapattu to jab away a single off her hip. Lanning flicks nicely square a couple of times, getting an extra run thanks to a boundary line fumble. Melbourne Renegades Anna Lanning Chamari Atapattu Jess Duffin * Josie Dooley + Courtney Webb Erica Kershaw Georgia Wareham Maitlan Brown Carly Leeson Molly Strano Lea Tahuhu Brisbane Heat Beth Mooney + Jess Jonassen Maddy Green Grace Harris Laura Harris Kirby Short * Amelia Kerr Delissa Kimmince Sammy-Jo Johnson Mikayla Hinkley Georgia Prestwidge So the chasing will be done by the home side. The Renegades, without Danni Wyatt thanks to her England duties, will have to pile up something bit. Two of the comp\u2019s form batters will go head to head, with Jess Duffin for the Gades befor Beth Mooney for the Heat. The Renegades chased 180-odd here against the Heat only a few days ago. Sri Lanka\u2019s big hitter Chamari Atapattu has been drafted in, and she made a blazing hundred at this ground against Australia in an ODI in early October, after another in a T20 at North Sydney. Anna Lanning, sister of the GOAT, will be at the top of the order in red too, having made some recent runs. Should be a belter. Hello gang. I\u2019ve just finished doing the Adelaide-Perth OBO, where the Strikers have won through to the WBBL final over the Scorchers. Check that out here if you\u2019re not up to speed.",

And not just on those iconic species like koalas. You have to think of this in terms of how it affects the entire ecosystem.</p> <p>You have animals relying on the eucalyptus trees for their primary diet - greater gliders are another example of that. Then you have a whole range of other species living off nectar or the insects in that environment, and there\u2019s going to be a considerable loss of insect life in those fires.</p> <p> You\u2019ve got issues with nesting areas lost in fires\u2026 often [animals] prefer old trees.</p> <p>And then with fires that have been burning even at low intensity, leaf litter and all the understorey is gone. That\u2019s providing food and refuge to animals there and the animals they would eat.</p> <p>So if you look at the overall picture\u2026 the damage has been so extensive, it\u2019s going to have a major impact on biodiversity.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jones\u2019s own property near Braidwood is around 600 hectares and she\u2019s been developing large parts as wildlife reserve with Bush Heritage. It was lost to the fires this week. </p> <p>Her property and the bush heritage reserve joins a state forest, which joins a national park.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this point almost all of that has been burnt, all of that forest, up to 31,000 hectares.</p> <p>The big trees are still there, and we have greater gliders that live in the forest, as well as powerful owls. So I\u2019m hoping that they\u2019ll be OK. They\u2019ll have lost nesting holes because the many big trees have fallen and it\u2019s the big old trees that have the nesting holes.</p> <p>We have a huge range of birds, eastern grey kangaroos, swamp wallabies, red wallabies. We were going out and meeting kangaroos and red neck wallabies that were moving away from the fire. A lot of wombats - I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re going to eat. All of the forest floor, any grass any shrubs, are gone.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jones said their rainfall records show it to be the driest in 40 years.

It was not injured, yet seemed abandoned, so we placed it in the open storage area behind the truck cab.</p> <p>Advice from others is that there are many lone fawn in the parched country up in the area.</p> <p>The female red deer fawn has now received veterinary care and advice is that it is a number of weeks old. It is now being cared for and fed formula from a bottle every three to four hours.</p> <p>For our brigade members, it was very satisfying to see something positive come from the utter devastation the fires have caused in the area.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a0a9d4994699a714dee1b084419b4a84ac1993c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a0a9d4994699a714dee1b084419b4a84ac1993c/0_151_1632_979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The fawn rescued by the Stanmore Rural Fire Brigade\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fawn rescued by the Stanmore Rural Fire Brigade</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8c15c07d2b46c4a23b0f7b147e9fd726f005d23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8c15c07d2b46c4a23b0f7b147e9fd726f005d23/42_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Canning (l), Michael Tiley and the rescued fawn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Canning (l), Michael Tiley and the rescued fawn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re out there Michael and Joe, firstly, well done, such a heart-warming story.

      "bodyText": "We are going to close this blog now. So far today, fire crews have fought back blazes, and containment lines have held. But there are still more than 100 fires burning across New South Wales and 45 in Queensland, some of them posing immediate risk to lives and homes. Crews face a difficult night ahead. There are hopes for some brief respite: a cool change on Sunday might give firefighters a chance to prepare for worsening conditions early next week. Temperatures are forecast to soar above 40C across NSW by Tuesday. The largest fire, the Gospers Mountain fire north of Sydney (larger than Sydney in area), won\u2019t be extinguished any time soon. It is too large to fight, and will likely burn for weeks until there is decent rain. Australia\u2019s brutal fire season will only continue I am sorry to report. But I leave with some joyous news from earlier. You may recall our post about the orphaned fawn rescued by fire crews in Queensland. They\u2019ve given her a name: Ember. A shipping container full of fireworks? Really? This is from AAP: A shipping container loaded with fireworks has exploded and residents have been warned to flee as an unpredictable fire closes in on homes in south-east Queensland. The fast-moving blaze is burning in bushland at Bundamba, west of Brisbane, and travelling in a northerly direction from White Street towards the Warrego Highway. Police have declared an emergency situation for the area bound by Keith Street to Bognuda Street and Nelson Street to the Bremer River and Warrego Highway. Residents within the exclusion zone are being ordered to evacuate as the fire closes in. It should be noted there is significant debate in New South Wales suggesting Sydney should cancel its spectacular, but spectacularly expensive, harbour fireworks display this New Year\u2019s Eve, and instead dedicate the millions of dollars saved to those who have lost homes in the bushfires. The NSW government has said the show will go on. Karma may have cast its vote here. This, I fear, will be the trend for the afternoon. Across the east coast of Australia, fires worsening with strengthening winds, no respite in temperatures. The Bundamba fire near Ipswich in Queensland is posing a threat to homes and lives. Police have declared an emergency situation. See here: http://bit.ly/38b6gNT Properly scary ... this is how much of Australia is burning Fire activity is increasing across a number of fires in NSW. Fires in Queensland are choking the state, hope lies in a cool change. AAP reports: Queensland is choking on NSW\u2019s bushfire smoke as a southerly change sweeps across the state bringing testing conditions for firefighters. The south-east corner of the state is shrouded in smoke, with the World Health Quality index showing unhealthy levels of air quality across parts of Queensland. \u201cWe have seen a southerly change move up from NSW and with it bringing more smoke from the NSW fires, so we actually have seen an increase in the smoke haze,\u201d said Rosa Hoff from the Bureau of Meteorology. Fire danger in the southeast corner continues to trouble authorities as Brisbane swelters in 39C heat with the mercury hitting 40.7C at Amberley near Ipswich. Scorching dry winds conditions have pushed temperatures up and created challenging conditions for firefighters. The hot and dry weather that has been sparking and encouraging fires has been unrelenting, but a cool change is expected on Sunday. \u201cThis southerly change means we will see temperatures ease down, however it will still be above average. It is a relief from the severe heatwave conditions, but it still not business as usual. \u201cOur fire danger ratings will ease back to very high from severe.\u201d Firefighters are pinning their hopes on that cool change for a desperately needed reprieve. Of the 45 fires burning across the state, fires at Redbank Creek near Esk, Millmerran on the Darling Downs and Wivenhoe remain at advice levels. A conservative estimate of 207,000 hectares of land burnt out since the start of the bushfire season is expected to rise, with 22 homes lost. This morning I travelled up the Hawkesbury river and Mangrove Creek. The smoke was incredibly thick and getting heavier with little wind yet. The Three Mile fire earlier crossed a narrow part of the creek at Upper Mangrove, and the fire front is just behind some riverside properties where we find Geoff Newlyn, who\u2019s come up to defend his 23 acres at Lower Mangrove. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for two days, I came up by boat so I\u2019d have a way out if the roads shut, but I think we\u2019re through the worst of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was looking pretty ugly yesterday evening then that wind blew up and it sounded like a freight train coming. \u201cWe\u2019ve had weeks to prepare. Anyone who tells you, \u2018Oh I didn\u2019t know this was going to happen\u2019, it\u2019s not true. \u201cWe\u2019re just smashing down stuff and clearing around structures.\u201d He points at properties across the river where houses which were previously hidden in the trees, just as the owners liked it in this remote bit of river country, are now visible with metres and metres of cleared land around them. Had the fire hit the river here, where it can stretch a hundred metres or more across, firefighters might have been able to hold it off, Newlyn says. But it didn\u2019t and now it\u2019s joined with the Wrights Creek fire which still threatens homes around Kulnura. \u201cThey just can\u2019t put it out because it\u2019s on such a big fire front,\u201d Newlyn suggests. \u201cTrying to get access to the bush is impossible \u2026 and this one will backfill [around here]. \u201cBut we\u2019re not worried at the moment because it\u2019s so slow burning. We sort of want it. It\u2019s going to come, so it\u2019s better now while you\u2019ve got a chance of controlling it \u2026 so this is actually quite a good scenario.\u201d As Australia burns, it is worth remembering that the annual UN climate change talks are underway at #COP25 in Madrid. Australia\u2019s record on emissions, and its role as a major exporter of fossil fuels, has not gone unnoticed by some. Community meetings for those affected by the Gospers Mountain fire... Dr Bidda Jones is the chief scientist at the RSPCA, and told me the NSW fires, which have burned through thousands of hectares of land, including national parks and adjoining forest, would have a \u201cmajor impact on biodiversity\u201d. Depending on the intensity of the fire, it will have had a massive impact on wildlife. And not just on those iconic species like koalas. You have to think of this in terms of how it affects the entire ecosystem. You have animals relying on the eucalyptus trees for their primary diet - greater gliders are another example of that. Then you have a whole range of other species living off nectar or the insects in that environment, and there\u2019s going to be a considerable loss of insect life in those fires. You\u2019ve got issues with nesting areas lost in fires\u2026 often [animals] prefer old trees. And then with fires that have been burning even at low intensity, leaf litter and all the understorey is gone. That\u2019s providing food and refuge to animals there and the animals they would eat. So if you look at the overall picture\u2026 the damage has been so extensive, it\u2019s going to have a major impact on biodiversity. Jones\u2019s own property near Braidwood is around 600 hectares and she\u2019s been developing large parts as wildlife reserve with Bush Heritage. It was lost to the fires this week. Her property and the bush heritage reserve joins a state forest, which joins a national park. At this point almost all of that has been burnt, all of that forest, up to 31,000 hectares. The big trees are still there, and we have greater gliders that live in the forest, as well as powerful owls. So I\u2019m hoping that they\u2019ll be OK. They\u2019ll have lost nesting holes because the many big trees have fallen and it\u2019s the big old trees that have the nesting holes. We have a huge range of birds, eastern grey kangaroos, swamp wallabies, red wallabies. We were going out and meeting kangaroos and red neck wallabies that were moving away from the fire. A lot of wombats - I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re going to eat. All of the forest floor, any grass any shrubs, are gone. Jones said their rainfall records show it to be the driest in 40 years. November is normally the wettest month with more than 100ml, but this year they\u2019ve had 18ml. \u201cAnytime I hear \u2018don\u2019t talk about climate change\u2019,\u201d she says trailing off. \u201cAnyone in my situation has absolutely no doubt these conditions are extreme and are connected to climate change.\u201d Good news in Queensland, a string of fires being downgraded, fire crews no longer needed ... A helicopter involved in firefighting efforts has crashed on the mid north coast of New South Wales. Emergency services says the pilot was the only person on board and he is unharmed. It\u2019s not clear at the moment if it was a water-bombing helicopter or if it was being used for surveillance, but it was assisting firefighting efforts on the Jarrah Road bushfire, near Girvan, north of Newcastle. Emergency services has grounded all other aircraft working in the area while safety checks are carried out, and more information about the cause of the crash is ascertained. It\u2019s being reported the \u201chard landing\u201d caused the helicopter\u2019s engine to catch fire \u2013 this was put out by fire crews. The pilot has been taken to hospital. I\u2019m out on the Hawkesbury River, where the heavy smoke has reduced visibility to dangerously low levels. The Three Mile fire - which last night joined with the Wrights Creek fire - is just up Mangrove Creek, and I\u2019ve watched several Marine Rescue vessels head up that way in the last half an hour. There is very little wind and locals who stuck around to defend property are hoping it stays that way and the fire front burns slowly past them. NSW Fire and Rescue have set up a water pump outside the shop at Spencer, on the Hawkesbury River, for crews to refuel as the battle bushfires just to the north. Geoff Newlyn is staying to defend his 23 acre property near Lower Mangrove, NSW where a large fire is burning through bushland. Roads in bushfire areas will be affected all day. The situation can change quickly, so please check conditions before setting out. Amid the chaos and the destruction, this is just a lovely story, as told by volunteer firefighter Michael Tiley: My name is Michael Tiley and I am from the Stanmore Rural Fire Brigade. Our brigade is part of the Stanley Rivers Group, located west of Caboolture. Last Sunday 1/12/19, the Stanmore Brigade (myself and Joe Canning) together with Hazeldean (three fire fighters) were deployed to a flare up of the fires, up near Jimna. The country up there is devastated by the past fire activity. During the mopping up activity, I heard a noise that sounded like a small child crying. I turned around to see this baby fawn (a few weeks old) walking straight towards me. It was very distressed and overheated, yet I picked it up and we cooled it down with water. It was not injured, yet seemed abandoned, so we placed it in the open storage area behind the truck cab. Advice from others is that there are many lone fawn in the parched country up in the area. The female red deer fawn has now received veterinary care and advice is that it is a number of weeks old. It is now being cared for and fed formula from a bottle every three to four hours. For our brigade members, it was very satisfying to see something positive come from the utter devastation the fires have caused in the area. If you\u2019re out there Michael and Joe, firstly, well done, such a heart-warming story. But have you given her a name yet? This was the situation early this morning in NSW: 94 fires, 11 at Watch and Alert... And a reminder on total fire bans: the Shoalhaven is the eighth region in NSW under a ban for today. My colleague Lisa Cox has written this most excellent, timely and sobering piece: climate experts bewildered by government \u201cburying their heads in the sand\u201d and say the bushfires on Australia\u2019s east coast should be a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. If you read nothing else today (save for this blog, obviously), read this. Behind all of those out there on the firefront, there is an army of support. This vision, broadcast on ABC, demonstrates what volunteer fire crews have been up again, and will face again today. Good morning, welcome to Guardian Australia\u2019s rolling coverage of the bushfire crisis. Australia is on fire, and the country\u2019s east coast, in particular NSW and southern Queensland, faces a brutal day of hot weather, strong winds and no rain in sight. This morning, the NSW Rural Fire Service has warned the Gospers Mountain \u2018mega fire\u2019 north of Sydney will burn for many weeks. The fire has already burned more than 300,000 hectares and has a front more than 60 kilometres. Around 1000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by fire this season. Nearly 100 fires are burning across the state Saturday morning. In Queensland, 40 fires are burning, and temperatures are expected to soar \u2013 up to 12C above December averages \u2013 in coming days. Temperatures are forecast to reach 39C in Brisbane on Saturday, and above 40C inland, in Gatton and Ipswich. The Bureau of Meteorology has painted a grim picture for the coming week, with winds forecast to whip dangerous fire grounds and no rain relief in sight. Some fires are generating plumes of smoke that are so vast, they appear as rain on the bureau\u2019s radar. \u201cThe massive NSW fires are in some cases just too big to put out at the moment,\u201d the Bureau of Meteorology said on social media. \u201cThey\u2019re pumping out vast amounts of smoke, which is filling the air, turning the sky orange and even appearing like significant rain on our radars.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This summer I took my daughter to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue\" title=\"\">Kylie Minogue</a> concert in Edinburgh and, as a reward for a good school report, let her choose what I\u2019d wear. She put me in a fit and flare polka-dot dress and black Dolce heels studded with lipsticks. I couldn\u2019t explain that I didn\u2019t want to wear their clothes any more because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/may/24/the-trumps-visual-diplomacy-hand-slaps-amid-a-dolce-campaign-bid\" title=\"\">they dress the Trump women</a> and so she was dismayed when I wore brown wedges, both PC and wrong with the outfit.</p> <p>Walking up the cobbled streets to the castle, she kept urging me to go back to the room and change so Kylie wouldn\u2019t see and have to stop the show.</p> <p>I tried to deflect: \u201cThe other heels would be too difficult to walk in on cobblestones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could try! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/rupaul\" title=\"\">RuPaul</a> could do it.\u201d</p> <p>Both very tired and aware I was wearing ugly shoes, I snapped: \u201cI\u2019m not RuPaul! I\u2019m never going to be RuPaul!\u201d</p> <p>My daughter is only six. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/06/notes-from-hollywood-divorce-emma-forrest-ben-mendelsohn\" title=\"\">her father and I divorced</a>, she decided to start honing my style for me and, with the concentration of a small child newly entranced by Lego, became determined to build me into a brighter, tighter shape, as if that might somehow draw her dad back. She hid my trousers and nixed sensible shoes by saying, \u201cOh sorry, too small\u201d, operatically miming a failure to fit them to my foot, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/oj-simpson-prison-release-america-race-debate\" title=\"\">OJ trying on the glove</a> in the witness stand.</p> <p>RuPaul had emerged as her inspiration one day at the bus stop, when we couldn\u2019t get her dad on FaceTime. She tried to channel her disappointment with the phone by asking that we use it to find \u201cpictures of the beautiful black woman\u201d.</p> <p>Which one, I asked. \u201cThe most beautiful one.\u201d I pulled up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae\" title=\"\">Janelle Mon\u00e1e</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/dec/26/eartha-kitt-youtube\" title=\"\">Eartha Kitt</a>. Logically, I knew my daughter was not asking to look at photographs of Eartha Kitt, but her unhappiness was about to spill over into rage and I was rifling through the internet as if digging in a cluttered purse for my asthma inhaler.</p> <p>\u201cThe black lady with a boy living inside her!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. RuPaul.\u201d Of course.</p> <p>I suspected she loved Ru so much because he is, like her father, a gigantic personality, who also takes up physical space with his height.

      "bodyText": "This summer I took my daughter to a Kylie Minogue concert in Edinburgh and, as a reward for a good school report, let her choose what I\u2019d wear. She put me in a fit and flare polka-dot dress and black Dolce heels studded with lipsticks. I couldn\u2019t explain that I didn\u2019t want to wear their clothes any more because they dress the Trump women and so she was dismayed when I wore brown wedges, both PC and wrong with the outfit. Walking up the cobbled streets to the castle, she kept urging me to go back to the room and change so Kylie wouldn\u2019t see and have to stop the show. I tried to deflect: \u201cThe other heels would be too difficult to walk in on cobblestones.\u201d \u201cYou could try! RuPaul could do it.\u201d Both very tired and aware I was wearing ugly shoes, I snapped: \u201cI\u2019m not RuPaul! I\u2019m never going to be RuPaul!\u201d My daughter is only six. After her father and I divorced, she decided to start honing my style for me and, with the concentration of a small child newly entranced by Lego, became determined to build me into a brighter, tighter shape, as if that might somehow draw her dad back. She hid my trousers and nixed sensible shoes by saying, \u201cOh sorry, too small\u201d, operatically miming a failure to fit them to my foot, like OJ trying on the glove in the witness stand. RuPaul had emerged as her inspiration one day at the bus stop, when we couldn\u2019t get her dad on FaceTime. She tried to channel her disappointment with the phone by asking that we use it to find \u201cpictures of the beautiful black woman\u201d. Which one, I asked. \u201cThe most beautiful one.\u201d I pulled up Beyonc\u00e9, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Eartha Kitt. Logically, I knew my daughter was not asking to look at photographs of Eartha Kitt, but her unhappiness was about to spill over into rage and I was rifling through the internet as if digging in a cluttered purse for my asthma inhaler. \u201cThe black lady with a boy living inside her!\u201d \u201cOh. RuPaul.\u201d Of course. I suspected she loved Ru so much because he is, like her father, a gigantic personality, who also takes up physical space with his height. Struggling with how to enforce rules as we set up a new home in a new country, I also wondered if she was drawn to the boundaries he sets each week, the calm, confident reprimand he issues his \u201cchildren\u201d when they are crossed. Half our clothing was still in boxes, but with what we could access, my daughter guided me towards emulating RuPaul: high heels, hyper-feminine dresses with defined waists. It didn\u2019t matter that her dad couldn\u2019t see us because he was still in Los Angeles, nor that when we were in the same place he could barely \u2013 for nearly a year \u2013 look at me. This was the style she needed me to project in order for the family to reconfigure. In the end, she surrendered the fantasy of her parents reuniting once she understood RuPaul was a man. Now she hastens me towards high heels and long lashes so RuPaul will want to marry me, in the manner, I suppose, of two teens in Clash T-shirts, drawn to each other as they pass on the street. As she was honing her sense of what my style should be post-divorce, I was letting her down by pulling in the opposite direction and wearing a parade of vintage kids\u2019 shirts from her closet. I\u2019ve sourced them at thrift stores worldwide for her but ended up wearing them myself, for the playground and school drop-off, warping the line of Rugrats, Fraggle Rock, The Simpsons with my breasts.

The event featured an Italian-American inspired banquet called the Feast of Seven Fishes for which I\u2019d select seven lesser known, sustainably sourced fish species such as hake, gurnard and megrim sole, and use them to cook up a zero-waste feast. However, the best dish was always served on the second night, when we\u2019d make a kedgeree out of all the scraps.</p> <p>Now that more than 90% of our fish stocks are depleted, it\u2019s vital that we stop wasting our oceans and diversifying the fish we do eat.

      "bodyText": "Each Christmas, I used to create a gargantuan banquet out of food that would otherwise be wasted to raise funds for the food waste-redistribution charity Fareshare. The event featured an Italian-American inspired banquet called the Feast of Seven Fishes for which I\u2019d select seven lesser known, sustainably sourced fish species such as hake, gurnard and megrim sole, and use them to cook up a zero-waste feast. However, the best dish was always served on the second night, when we\u2019d make a kedgeree out of all the scraps. Now that more than 90% of our fish stocks are depleted, it\u2019s vital that we stop wasting our oceans and diversifying the fish we do eat. To help you buy fish more sustainably, the Marine Conservation Society has a brilliant app called the Good Fish Guide, while the Marine Stewardship Council has a certification stamp used by many major supermarkets that\u2019s worth looking out for.

      "bodyText": "Bolivia\u2019s recently toppled president, Evo Morales, has left Mexico for Cuba as part of what some observers suspect is the first step in a bid to stage a dramatic political comeback. On Friday night, less than a month after being forced into exile in Mexico, Morales flew out of the country on a plane bound for Havana. Mexico\u2019s foreign relations ministry confirmed that Morales had left for Cuba on Friday, on what it called a temporary visit. The Mexican newspaper El Universal said official sources had confirmed Morales\u2019 departure for the communist-run Caribbean island. Last month a commentator from the same newspaper, Salvador Garc\u00eda Soto, had predicted Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president would relocate to another Latin American country \u201cwhere he would be able to organise his resistance plan and strategy to attempt to return to Bolivia to recover power in the near future\u201d. Morales touched down in Mexico on 12 November after Mexico\u2019s leftist leader, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, sent an airforce plane to rescue him from the South American country he had governed since 2006. Morales fled Bolivia after being forced to resign on 10 November in what political foes celebrated as a popular uprising against an increasingly authoritarian leader but which Morales\u2019 supporters branded a right-wing coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. \u201cIt is a racist coup,\u201d Sacha Llorenti, Morales\u2019 former ambassador to the United Nations, said in a recent interview. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration had welcomed Morales to Mexico and offered him political asylum. However, Garc\u00eda Soto, the Mexican commentator, argued that a lengthy stay in Mexico would have damaged already fragile US-Mexico ties. Donald Trump\u2019s White House would not have appreciated seeing Mexico\u2019s government \u201csupport, and much less finance, a campaign by the deposed president to retake power in Bolivia\u201d, he argued. \u201cThat is why Evo\u2019s presence cannot last too long ... because the more time that passes the more likely it is to become a source of tension between Mexico and the US.\u201d On Friday, Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds reported that Morales was also unlikely to spend much time in Cuba and instead planned to relocate to Argentina once that country\u2019s new leftist leader, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, took office next week. The Mexican newspaper Reforma said Morales had travelled to Cuba with his former vice president, \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera, and his former health minister, Gabriela Monta\u00f1o. \u201cPresident Evo Morales is in Cuba for a medical appointment with the Cuban medical team that treated him in Bolivia,\u201d Montano told Reuters. In a recent interview with the Guardian in Mexico City, Morales hinted that his political aspirations had not ended with exile. \u201cStruggle, struggle, struggle, struggle, that is where I come from,\u201d he said. For now, a return to Bolivia looks highly unlikely. Morales has ruled out taking part in a fresh round of presidential elections, called as a result of suspicions of vote rigging in his favour. Last month the interior minister of Bolivia\u2019s rightwing interim government vowed to jail Morales for the rest of his life for allegedly inciting anti-government protests that he claimed amounted to terrorism. \u201cAny terrorist should spend the rest of their life in prison \u2013 any terrorist \u2013 Evo Morales or whoever. It\u2019s not about whether you\u2019re an ex-president or white or black or a campesino \u2026 In fact, it\u2019s even worse when it\u2019s an ex-president,\u201d Arturo Murillo said.",

She\u2019s such a likeable character \u2013 that dry New Zealand sense of humour, always self-deprecating, straight talking, unflappable. She just goes out there and gets the job done, and she\u2019s done that this season time and time again. </p> <p>She has 764 runs now for the season! So if she gets 14 more in the final, she\u2019ll pass Ellyse Perry\u2019s record for a WBBL season. She has 18 wickets now for the season as well. But most importantly of all, she\u2019s in the final. Adelaide have been underachievers in several seasons of this competition but not this year. One more win to go.</p> <p>It all went wrong for Perth from the start. They lost the toss, meaning they had to bat first where they would usually prefer to chase. They lost Meg Lanning early, then two more. They had already lost Nat Sciver and Amy Jones to England duty. Then despite some spade work from Redmayne and Barsby to build a decent total, it wasn\u2019t nearly big enough after the early setbacks. <br></p> <p>Their bowling didn\u2019t fare much better, never able to build enough pressure over enough time. A few big overs took the air out of the innings, then the dropped catches deflated them further. They weren\u2019t up to the mark, and the Strikers took the game away.</p> <p>Next it will be the Brisbane Heat versus the Melbourne Renegades, with me, over on the other OBO.

A big square drive from Devine, but lofted, reaching for it and getting it towards the toe. The ball is just above Bolton\u2019s head, but not far. Gets both hands to it and only parries it away. She\u2019s had a nightmare of a game. Two runs from the richochet, and Peschel loses her cool thereafter to bowl a couple of leg-side wides. Devines taps her 50th run to midwicket, and raises <strong>her ninth half-century for the season.</strong> That\u2019s 749 runs so far. Incredible.</p> <p>Patterson chips a couple of runs over mid-on, up in the circle. Gets away with it.

Patterson tries a lap shot, Graham bowls wider of off stump, Patterson switches to a reverse lap aiming over short third but can\u2019t make contact. </p> <p><strong>Adelaide need 40 from 30 balls. </strong>Just increasing the tension a bit.

In the end Bates decides to walk at the bowler to negate the swing. Slides the ball straight to backward point and just sets off. But Bates could set off because she\u2019s already halfway down. Devine was never going to make it to the striker\u2019s end in time. So Devine sends her partner back, and Bates can\u2019t make it back in. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5deb06fc8f08e7796de8e4e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-07T01:59:47.437Z\">1.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1st over: Adelaide Strikers 3-0 (Bates 1, Devine 1) </strong>The reply is underway, with the New Zealand duo opening up for the Strikers.

McGrath\u2019s slower ball turns into a loopy full toss, but Barsby is advancing and it ends up too high to hit easily. She can only take a single. Redmayne nails a cut shot but only for one. Barsby misses another reverse, but nearly takes out the keeper standing up to the stumps, so the ball gets through everone for a couple of extras. McGrath, annoyed, throws in a bouncer, and it also beats batter and keeper for four more byes. Not the smartest delivery with your keeper up to the stumps.

Bolton to face the last, and it beats her top edge for bounce after an attempted cut. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5deaebf78f08bacaf000bb26\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-07T00:09:28.653Z\">12.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So to start with, it\u2019s all about the Adelaide bowlers and whether they can rein in Meg Lanning and company. A massive loss for Perth with England keeper and opening bat Amy Jones now missing for Three Lions duties. She\u2019s a double value player and one of the fastest scorers in the world at the top of the order. Lanning\u2019s quality is known, Bolton has a lot of experience but is more naturally at home in the longer forms than the 20-over stuff and has recently been eased out of the Australian team. A career T20 strike rate of less than a run a ball speaks to that. There are a few question marks around the rest of the top order as we get quickly into the all-rounders.</p> <p>Adelaide, meanwhile, have a varied and threatening bowling attack. Megan Schutt rarely gives away more than a run a ball, Amanda Wellington can shred her leg-breaks more than anyone in the country, and Sarah Coyte is a real clutch player with her seamers.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-07T00:10:26.431Z\">at 12.10am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5deaead18f08e7796de8e477\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-07T00:01:00.543Z\">12.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Teams</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Perth<br></strong>Nicole Bolton<br>Meg Lanning *<br>Chloe Piparao<br>Georgia Redmayne +<br>Jemma Barsby<br>Heather Graham<br>Kim Garth<br>Mathilda Carmichael<br>Samantha Betts<br>Taneale Peschel<br>Kath Hempenstall<strong> </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Adelaide Strikers<br></strong>Suzie Bates *<br>Sophie Devine<br>Tahlia McGrath<br>Bridget Patterson<br>Katie Mack<br>Tegan McPharlin +<br>Annie O\u2019Neil<br>Amanda Wellington<br>Sarah Coyte<br>Megan Schutt<br>Alex Price</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-07T00:07:55.620Z\">at 12.07am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5deae8ff8f08eef22867f06b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-06T23:51:09.325Z\">11.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Adelaide Strikers win the toss and bowl</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The women in blue will take the ball first, and let Sophie Devine unleash later in a run chase.

It\u2019s been a long season, games ahoy, and the frantic final stages where the perennial contenders the Sixers were knocked out, and Adelaide nearly won the hosting rights for the finals weekend but stumbled at the last hurdle. So Brisbane have the matches and the home advantage, as well as being the table-topping side and the only team not to lose English players who have had to take off for national duties. But before the Heat contest their right to appear in another final, the Strikers and Scorchers will go first. <br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "What a performance from Sophie Devine. She\u2019s such a likeable character \u2013 that dry New Zealand sense of humour, always self-deprecating, straight talking, unflappable. She just goes out there and gets the job done, and she\u2019s done that this season time and time again. She has 764 runs now for the season! So if she gets 14 more in the final, she\u2019ll pass Ellyse Perry\u2019s record for a WBBL season. She has 18 wickets now for the season as well. But most importantly of all, she\u2019s in the final. Adelaide have been underachievers in several seasons of this competition but not this year. One more win to go. It all went wrong for Perth from the start. They lost the toss, meaning they had to bat first where they would usually prefer to chase. They lost Meg Lanning early, then two more. They had already lost Nat Sciver and Amy Jones to England duty. Then despite some spade work from Redmayne and Barsby to build a decent total, it wasn\u2019t nearly big enough after the early setbacks. Their bowling didn\u2019t fare much better, never able to build enough pressure over enough time. A few big overs took the air out of the innings, then the dropped catches deflated them further. They weren\u2019t up to the mark, and the Strikers took the game away. Next it will be the Brisbane Heat versus the Melbourne Renegades, with me, over on the other OBO. Come over. 18.1 overs: Adelaide Strikers 130-2 (Devine 65, Patterson 16) First ball of Graham\u2019s over, driven straight for four! Devine does it again. She has batted through the innings so many times this season. 18th over: Adelaide Strikers 126-2 (Devine 61, Patterson 16) Getting into the act now is Patterson, with mid-on and mid-off up. Bashes four back down the ground. Kim Garth the bowler, and why she decides to dig one in short I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s wide too, takes off over the keeper, and goes away for five extras. Then a sixth, as she follows with another wide. That\u2019s almost game over at the Scorchers\u2019 own hand. They haven\u2019t helped themselves. Patterson gets off strike, Devine opens the face and glides the ball away for four! Lovely touch. Takes a single off her toes to level the scores. Garth finishes with a dot, hitting Patterson\u2019s pads, but the over cost her 16 runs. 1 run to win. 17th over: Adelaide Strikers 110-2 (Devine 56, Patterson 11) Bolton back on with the ball, and she\u2019s denied a stumping! That wasn\u2019t Nicole Bolton\u2019s fault. Flights the ball, Patterson skips and slogs and misses it by a mile, and Redmayne doesn\u2019t take the ball cleanly. Bounces off her gloves and away. Next ball, short, and Patterson rocks back to cut four. Then darts a single to mid-on. Devine back at the business end. Good ball right on off stump, blocked back. And that\u2019s the last blocking she\u2019ll do. Walks at the bowler and clubs her for six! Over long-on now. I think that\u2019s her 29th for the season. But after hitting that one straight, she goes across the line next ball, a sort of sweep, and misses. Adelaide need 17 from 18 balls. 16th over: Adelaide Strikers 99-2 (Devine 50, Patterson 6) Here comes that bigger over! Peschel gives her width, and Devine cuts her for four! Peschel bowls width again, but fuller, and Devine is dropped! She\u2019s dropped! That\u2019s the semi-final, and it\u2019s Bolton again! This time off the boundary, in at backward point. A big square drive from Devine, but lofted, reaching for it and getting it towards the toe. The ball is just above Bolton\u2019s head, but not far. Gets both hands to it and only parries it away. She\u2019s had a nightmare of a game. Two runs from the richochet, and Peschel loses her cool thereafter to bowl a couple of leg-side wides. Devines taps her 50th run to midwicket, and raises her ninth half-century for the season. That\u2019s 749 runs so far. Incredible. Patterson chips a couple of runs over mid-on, up in the circle. Gets away with it. Dips her knees to drag a pull shot square for a single to close the over. A dozen runs from it. Adelaide need 28 from 24. 15th over: Adelaide Strikers 87-2 (Devine 43, Patterson 3) Heather Graham is back with the ball, the lucky charm. The bellwether. Got tapped in her last over. Could still turn things around with a wicket here. Run, dot, run, run, run. Devine not playing any big shots, getting off strike as soon as she gets on. Patterson tries a lap shot, Graham bowls wider of off stump, Patterson switches to a reverse lap aiming over short third but can\u2019t make contact. Adelaide need 40 from 30 balls. Just increasing the tension a bit. They need one bigger over. 14th over: Adelaide Strikers 83-2 (Devine 41, Patterson 1) Two runs and the wicket from Garth\u2019s over, and Bridget Patterson is the new player in. Off the mark with a scurried single to cover, Garth has to run and field herself. There\u2019s the breakthrough! Barsby puts her body on the line, literally, as McGrath\u2019s pull shot nails her in the sternum. Garth dropped short, McGrath pounded it flat to deep midwicket, and this time a Scorchers outfielder hangs on at the cost of a large bruise. Barsby has worked like a Trojan today, you can\u2019t fault her. 13th over: Adelaide Strikers 81-1 (Devine 40, McGrath 36) Barsby gets through another tidy over for five singles, but that\u2019s just about enough for Adelaide. At one point McGrath shapes to lap the ball, and Barsby pulls out of delivery. Not playing that shot, champ. Adelaide need 46 from 42 balls. 12th over: Adelaide Strikers 76-1 (Devine 37, McGrath 34) Samantha Betts back on to bowl, and McGrath smokes her straight for six! Sashays down the track, makes it into a length ball, gets under it and gives it a ride! Allll the way down into the crowd, huge hit. And some more sharp calling from Devine gets McGrath another brace to midwicket. Big ground here on the leg side, which is something the women\u2019s game is often denied: the space to create twos. Adelaide need 51 from 48 balls. 11th over: Adelaide Strikers 65-1 (Devine 35, McGrath 25) Bolton is back to bowl. She hasn\u2019t provided with the bat today, or in the field. Has to do it with the ball. A few singles worked square. A dot dug back to the bowler. A quick call from Devine to get McGrath back for a second run. 10th over: Adelaide Strikers 59-1 (Devine 33, McGrath 21) Graham is back as the bowlers keep swapping. In at the pads and McGrath can\u2019t make contact. Makes contact with the next one, whacked down the ground and dropped! Dropped by Nicole Bolton at long-on. Bolton didn\u2019t have to move. Those ones look easier than they are though. That was nailed, flat and straight at her. Hit the hands hard with her fingers pointing up, and bounced out. Couldn\u2019t grab it on the rebound either. It\u2019s Bolton straight back into the fray a couple of balls later too, as Devine muscles another fully back down the ground, wide of long-on for four! Then gets another poor ball on her leg stump and flicks it fine for four more. The over costs 11, and Perth could ill afford that. Drinks. Adelaide need 68 from 60 balls. 9th over: Adelaide Strikers 48-1 (Devine 24, McGrath 19) Barsby is on to bowl her off-breaks. Very first ball of her spell, McGrath is kneeling and lapping it over her own shoulder for a couple. Modern styles. A couple of dots, then McGrath shuffles and flicks a run to midwicket. Devine advances to drive one straight. McGrath walks across rather than down to shovel another run square. Adelaide need 79 from 66 balls. 8th over: Adelaide Strikers 43-1 (Devine 23, McGrath 15) Peschel to continue. Devine smashes another cut shot but it gets slapped down at cover, richocheting for a single but saving three. McGrath defends off the back foot as Peschel drops back of a length. Overpitches and McGrath cover-drives cleanly but the sweeper saves four. Devine finds the cover fielder in the circle, so after that she opens the face rather than driving and gets two fine of backward point. Last ball of the over... full toss, muscled down the ground for four! Just forced through the line of the ball, back the way it came. A good over from Peschel comes undone, and Devine has 23 from 20 balls without really having played a big shot or taken a risk. That\u2019s what she can do. 7th over: Adelaide Strikers 35-1 (Devine 16, McGrath 14) Samantha Betts continues the holding pattern, bowling tight at the stumps with her mediums and conceding four singles. The Strikers pair happy to take their time. 6th over: Adelaide Strikers 31-1 (Devine 14, McGrath 12) Heather Graham comes on with her slippery deceptive mediums. She just collects wickets by the bushel in this comp. Her team needs three or four from her today. Just the four singles from her first over, one from the outside edge. 5th over: Adelaide Strikers 27-1 (Devine 12, McGrath 10) Time for Nic Bolton, the classic left-handed bat who bowls filthy off-breaks. Loops one in that McGrath tonks with a pull shot, it nearly carries to Barsby at deep backward square but bounces in front. Devine defends Bolton on the front foot. You won\u2019t see that too often. It lasts exactly one ball, as the next is short and wide and Devine crashes it through the covers. Four. So that\u2019s 710 season runs for Devine now. I thought no one would ever break Ellyse Perry\u2019s 777 from last season, but with this innings and possibly a final to come, Devine could be the one. She adds another single here. 4th over: Adelaide Strikers 21-1 (Devine 7, McGrath 9) Peschel is all over the Strikers at the moment. McGrath swinging and missing a couple of times, skewing another couple away for streaking runs. A double then a one. Devine drives nicely to mid-off but only gets one. McGrath gets a full toss but can only clip it straight for the same result. They\u2019re going at five an over despite that big over from Garth. 3rd over: Adelaide Strikers 16-1 (Devine 6, McGrath 5) Garth\u2019s second over starts with a couple of wides, which helps the Strikers on the scoreboard. Devine gets a single. Tahlia McGrath is in at first drop, and she absolutely laces a cut shot for four! Hit as cleanly as Bolton, but into the ground and into the gap. Another wide for Garth follows. Nine-ball over thus far. Lanning runs over to pat her on the back and have a calming word. McGrath edges just wide of the keeper! Dropped! Got gloves to it but Redmayne hadn\u2019t moved quickly enough. It was more a first slip catch, and Lanning did have a slip in place a few balls earlier but had just taken her out. Now puts her back in, but more at second slip than first. That\u2019s no use when Garth bowls wide of off stump and Devine nails another cut for four! 13 runs from the over. 2nd over: Adelaide Strikers 3-1 (Devine 1) The pressure tells! Taneale Peschele bowls a maiden to Bates, who just could not lay bat on the swinging ball. Beat the outside edge time and again. In the end Bates decides to walk at the bowler to negate the swing. Slides the ball straight to backward point and just sets off. But Bates could set off because she\u2019s already halfway down. Devine was never going to make it to the striker\u2019s end in time. So Devine sends her partner back, and Bates can\u2019t make it back in. 1st over: Adelaide Strikers 3-0 (Bates 1, Devine 1) The reply is underway, with the New Zealand duo opening up for the Strikers. Kim Garth is on the money straight away, a bit of swing, a couple of singles, a leg bye. Devine doesn\u2019t always open up blazing, often this season she\u2019s taken her time, batted slowly through a chunk of the innings before exploding late. She\u2019ll probably bat that way given it\u2019s a modest target. The innings swung one way and then the other. First the Scorchers were in dire trouble. Then they recovered well enough that they might have posted 140. Then their innings tailed off late. But from their early slump, to post a target above a run a ball is some achievement. Redmayne was excellent, Barsby battled but found a way to support her, and together they dragged their team towards competitiveness. Graham has a wicket-taking knack every year in this competition, Garth has the proven skills, Barsby can chip in, but there\u2019s a lack of frontline experience after that with the ball. 20th over: Perth Scorchers 126-7 (Garth 2) Sarah Coyte finished the innings off. A sweep for a single from Garth. A meaty slog from Graham that only got one to the midwicket sweeper. Into the pads for a leg bye from Garth. Perfect yorker that Graham digs straight, then sprints back for a second run. Just makes it. Then the attempt to do the same when there was no time to do it. Wickets from the fifth and sixth balls. Mathilda Carmichael faces the last ball of the innings. On a hiding to nothing. Steps across to the off side, misses her shot, and accepts a Golden Globe award. Can\u2019t keep Sophie out of the game. A wipe down the ground from Graham, there was only ever one run there but they were probably hoping for an errant throw. In fact they got one, but it still wasn\u2019t enough to save Graham. 19th over: Perth Scorchers 120-5 (Graham 2, Garth 1) Heather Graham with the Irish bowler Kim Garth after the run-out. Schutt does her job: no wicket for her from the over, but only 5 runs at the death. Misunderstanding. Graham strikes the ball away deep on the leg side. Redmayne takes the first, turns for the second then has to turn back. Price\u2019s throw is on the money and the keeper takes the stumps. The umpire doesn\u2019t bother with a TV replay. Refreshing. Megan Schutt returns, on a hat-trick, but Redmayne punches it down the ground for one. That\u2019s her fifty \u2013 she\u2019s only hit three fours and a six, but still gone at a strike rate of 122. So she\u2019s been very efficient. 18th over: Perth Scorchers 115-4 (Redmayne 49, Graham 1) A second wicket for Devine, who also bowls her fourth wide and her first no-ball in this over, then her fifth wide trying to avoid the free hit going for runs. She bowls it again, full and straight and it only costs a single. 2 for 23 from Devine\u2019s four overs, so you\u2019ll take the extras if it results in those figures. Barsby goes! She\u2019s battled hard in the heat, but she knew it was time to move, one way or the other. Three singles from Devine\u2019s over to that point, Heather Graham\u2019s hitting ability to come in next, and only a couple of overs to go. So Barsby, who was flagging, knew it pretty much had to be six or out for her. She advances at Devine, looking to get under the length and lift it over the leg side, but misses the chance of pace and loses her off stump. She\u2019s done a decent job to get the Scorchers something to bowl at. 17th over: Perth Scorchers 107-3 (Redmayne 46, Barsby 30) The luck is with Redmayne today, as she drops to one knee and tries to pound McGrath over midwicket with a slog-sweep, but lands it between the two boundary riders for a couple of runs. McGrath\u2019s slower ball turns into a loopy full toss, but Barsby is advancing and it ends up too high to hit easily. She can only take a single. Redmayne nails a cut shot but only for one. Barsby misses another reverse, but nearly takes out the keeper standing up to the stumps, so the ball gets through everone for a couple of extras. McGrath, annoyed, throws in a bouncer, and it also beats batter and keeper for four more byes. Not the smartest delivery with your keeper up to the stumps. Not many off the bat that over, but 11 to the team score. 16th over: Perth Scorchers 96-3 (Redmayne 42, Barsby 29) This Scorchers pair are running really well in this over. Twice what might have been singles become twos, as Redmayne finds gaps and Barsby rides shotgun beautifully, calling her partner through on both occasions by watching the ball and the fielders and gauging their pick-up times. With the pressure on Bates she bowls a wide, Redmayne gets a single, then Barsby plays another reverse swat for four! It\u2019s coming together late for Perth with 11 off the over. 15th over: Perth Scorchers 85-3 (Redmayne 37, Barsby 24) With Redmayne up and running, Barsby has decided it\u2019s time to hit out or get out. She\u2019s struggling with the heat out there today, given she has multiple sclerosis. She gets lucky with a couple of runs over cover when the catch doesn\u2019t go to hand, then nails a reverse sweep past a diving short third for four. Another decent over, eight from it. 14th over: Perth Scorchers 77-3 (Redmayne 36, Barsby 17) Sarah Coyte now, as the Strikers keep changing up their bowlers. Coyte bowls on middle stump, length ball, and Georgia Redmayne nails it for six! Great shot, clean out of the middle! Across the line, but not a slog, more of a clip shot, and it sails into the stands! What a hit. Her first WBBL six, I think. Then after a couple of singles she goes again, a similar middle stump line and it\u2019s there to be clipped again, this time one bounce for four out at midwicket. Coyte doesn\u2019t adjust her line well enough, bowls on leg stump, and Redmayne glances four! A single back past the bowler to keep the strike, and that makes 17 runs from the over. That was what the doctor ordered. 13th over: Perth Scorchers 60-3 (Redmayne 20, Barsby 16) A solid over for the Scorchers against Tahlia McGrath, finding a single from every ball with the field set back. But Adelaide would happily accept six per over from here. Perth have 42 balls remaining to get some sort of total. These two are set now, they have to go. 12th over: Perth Scorchers 54-3 (Redmayne 17, Barsby 13) Sophie Devine back for another bit of fun, and she could do it standing on her head. Three singles off the bat, and one wide for a bouncer that she fires in just for kicks. Accurate, at the stumps, and the Strikers\u2019 fielding has been smothering. 11th over: Perth Scorchers 50-3 (Redmayne 16, Barsby 11) Still struggling is Barsby. Beaten on the cut again, this time by the leg-spinner Amanda Wellington in her first over. Gets a single, then nearly runs herself out while ball-watching. Redmayne knocks the ball away and sets off for a run, and Barsby only notices and responds when her partner is halfway down. The throw is wide of the keeper, otherwise Barsby would have been gone. Redmayne cuts what should be four but Bridget Patterson does beautifully, sprinting back and sliding across the turf to knock it back and save two. 10th over: Perth Scorchers 45-3 (Redmayne 13, Barsby 9) Jemma Barsby\u2019s day is turning into a bit of a shocker. After a couple of singles to start the Coyte over well for the batting side, she gets a leg-stump pie and misses it completely, thudding into her pad. Those are the sort of missed chances that can make a batter feel like they have no control. Five singles from the over in the end, it would have been a team-lifting over with a boundary thrown in there. Drinks break given the extreme heat in Brisbane - 36 degrees today. 9th over: Perth Scorchers 40-3 (Redmayne 11, Barsby 6) Every dot ball increases the pressure. Barsby was cutting and missing at Bates last over, now Bates brings on Tahlia McGrath in her own place and Barsby keeps playing and missing the same shot. From the third ball she sprints a single to get off strike. McGrath pitches up and Redmayne gets a thick outside edge for four. Defends the last ball in Test match style. 8th over: Perth Scorchers 35-3 (Redmayne 7, Barsby 5) Sarah Coyte to bowl now, and that is gorgeous first up. Full, swinging, right in at the toes, floating in at the yorker zone on middle stump. Redmayne can do nothing with it. Manages to turn away a single next ball, then Barsby is the one becalmed by Coyte\u2019s perfect length. A third dot ball, into the pads. Too much on leg stump after that, but a single to deep backward is the only cost. But releases some pressure by bowling across the lefty Redmayne with the last ball, outside off, and only a good chase around the boundary keeps the cover drive to two runs. Four from the over in total, the total run rate is 4.38. Ouch. 7th over: Perth Scorchers 31-3 (Redmayne 4, Barsby 4) Schutt won\u2019t bowl out her spell. Interesting. Two left-handers at the crease, I wonder if that\u2019s a consideration? But she got Bolton. Keeping her on would have been the power move. But Suzie Bates is the captain, and she brings on her own workmanlike mediums. Redmayne takes a single, Barsby gets just enough width to carve a boundary through backward point. But she misses out on two similar balls afterwards, swishing at thin air both times, then tries to squeeze a single but runs it straight to backward point. Bates bowling around the wicket to angle in a bit. Tight in at the stumps and Barsby gets a fat inside edge past her leg stump, and again finds the field. Tidy over after that early boundary, pulled it back. 6th over: Perth Scorchers 26-3 (Redmayne 3, Barsby 0) The perfect chance for Tahlia McGrath to bowl, with two fresh players at the crease. Redmayne prods around for a two and a single, Barsby leaves her first ball alone. A delightfully cheap over for the Strikers. 5th over: Perth Scorchers 23-3 (Redmayne 0) Georgia Redmayne, former Hobart Hurricane but from New South Wales, now plays for Perth. She comes out to replace Piparo, then watches from the non-striker\u2019s end as Bolton is dismissed from the last ball of the over after the batters crossed. Jemma Barsby will be next in. Schutt is on a hat-trick! Two in two balls, bowled short outside off to Bolton. I wonder if that was deliberate, feeding the left-hander\u2019s pet shot while having a strong off-side field in place. Bolton takes it on, makes nice contact, looks great with her front foot up carving the cut away, but it\u2019s airborne and well caught! Another sub-100 strike rate innings from Bolton, and the senior player has given it away with her team in trouble. Megan Schutt bowls her third over, looking to keep the pressure on with the swinging ball rather than save her overs for the death when the ball might not be moving. Plenty of late-over bowling options for Adelaide. And it works! The right-handed Piparo tries to loft over mid-on, but the ball doesn\u2019t swing in this time! It skews off a leading edge high to mid-off where SJ Coyte takes the catch! 4th over: Perth Scorchers 21-1 (Bolton 11, Piparo 5) Overpitched from Devine and Bolton gets a nice simple off-drive down the ground for four. But when Devine gets the length right she\u2019s still swinging the ball and beating the bat. Only six from the over, which the Strikers won\u2019t mind. 3rd over: Perth Scorchers 15-1 (Bolton 7, Piparo 4) Schutt with the third over, and pressing home the advantage. Bolton can\u2019t get anything away and after three dot balls, starts playing loose. Slashes one over cover, mistimed for a couple, then so nearly gets caught at mid-on but it just lands wide and rolls away for four. 2nd over: Perth Scorchers 8-1 (Bolton 1, Piparo 4) Sophie Devine brings the magic. 16 wickets and 699 runs in her regular season, and now she starts with the most valuable wicket of all in her semi-final. Chloe Piparo comes in and smokes four through cover first ball, but Devine keeps swinging the ball and beating the bat thereafter. That\u2019s huge! Lanning caught at backward point. Well, the Strikers should have had her twice already. Schutt\u2019s lbw shout was hitting in line and hitting leg stump. Then Sophie Devine comes on to bowl the second over. Has Lanning plumb first ball after an opening wide, but the umpire doesn\u2019t give it. Nailed on the front pad near the knee roll. But Lanning might be a bit rattled by the close calls, and she just reaches for a wide one and steers it to backward! A bit of outswing helped get that edge. 1st over: Perth Scorchers 2-0 (Bolton 1, Lanning 1) We\u2019re underway at Allan Border Field. Flat pitch, plenty of runs in it. Megan Schutt opens the bowling to Nicole Bolton, with Lanning preferring not to face the ball swinging into her pads. Bolton a left-hander. Beaten first up as Schutt hoops one across her from over the wicket. The second is respectfully blocked. The third, just a single to cover. Lanning will have to face. Huge appeal first up! Swinging in and nailed on the pad! But maybe just an inside edge, and just outside the line. Lanning taking guard on off stump. Survives. Schutt just a touch too short next ball and Lanning gets under it to flip it away to deep backward for a run. Bolton to face the last, and it beats her top edge for bounce after an attempted cut. So to start with, it\u2019s all about the Adelaide bowlers and whether they can rein in Meg Lanning and company. A massive loss for Perth with England keeper and opening bat Amy Jones now missing for Three Lions duties. She\u2019s a double value player and one of the fastest scorers in the world at the top of the order. Lanning\u2019s quality is known, Bolton has a lot of experience but is more naturally at home in the longer forms than the 20-over stuff and has recently been eased out of the Australian team. A career T20 strike rate of less than a run a ball speaks to that. There are a few question marks around the rest of the top order as we get quickly into the all-rounders. Adelaide, meanwhile, have a varied and threatening bowling attack. Megan Schutt rarely gives away more than a run a ball, Amanda Wellington can shred her leg-breaks more than anyone in the country, and Sarah Coyte is a real clutch player with her seamers. Perth Nicole Bolton Meg Lanning * Chloe Piparao Georgia Redmayne + Jemma Barsby Heather Graham Kim Garth Mathilda Carmichael Samantha Betts Taneale Peschel Kath Hempenstall Adelaide Strikers Suzie Bates * Sophie Devine Tahlia McGrath Bridget Patterson Katie Mack Tegan McPharlin + Annie O\u2019Neil Amanda Wellington Sarah Coyte Megan Schutt Alex Price The women in blue will take the ball first, and let Sophie Devine unleash later in a run chase. That doesn\u2019t seem like too bad a plan. We\u2019re nearly there. It\u2019s been a long season, games ahoy, and the frantic final stages where the perennial contenders the Sixers were knocked out, and Adelaide nearly won the hosting rights for the finals weekend but stumbled at the last hurdle. So Brisbane have the matches and the home advantage, as well as being the table-topping side and the only team not to lose English players who have had to take off for national duties. But before the Heat contest their right to appear in another final, the Strikers and Scorchers will go first.",

The <strong>Voting Rights Advancement Act </strong>charges the Justice Department with greater oversight in states that repeatedly violate voting rights. It\u2019s unlikely that the measure will pass into law given Republican opposition in the Senate. </p> <p>Still, Democrats who have long-advocated for voting rights, and who are looking to demonstrate that they can still legislate while overseeing the impeachment inquiry, are celebrating today\u2019s incremental victory. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, who was beaten while demonstrating for voting rights in 1965, banged the gavel to mark the bill\u2019s passage.</p> <p>Alabama representative <strong>Terri Sewell</strong>, who introduced the bill, recently spoke with The Guardian about why voting rights are a priority. </p> <p><strong><em>In what ways is the issue of voting rights personal for you, especially as someone who is from Selma?</em></strong></p> <p><em>SEWELL: Growing up in Selma, Alabama, there was never a moment that I was not keenly aware of the sacrifice of those who came before me, and the pivotal role of my home in our nation\u2019s struggle for civil rights. Those stories did not have to be taught, as they are interwoven into the fabric of Selma. Their lessons of strength, resilience and deep patriotism have shaped me and opened doors of opportunity, for me and for so many others. For all of these reasons, voting rights are deeply personal to me. H.R. 4, which seeks to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965, remains my signature piece of legislation, and I will continue to fight tirelessly until it is passed. </em></p> <p><strong><em>In what ways are voting rights especially relevant now?</em></strong></p> <p><em> During this deeply sobering moment in our nation\u2019s history, as we protect against further foreign interference in our elections, I believe it is more important than ever that we, as elected officials, are doing everything possible to ensure that our elections are conducted fairly and that every single American is given equal opportunity to cast their vote. Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, and we must continue to invest in infrastructure and policies that help ensure that every single American can make their voice heard at the ballot box.</em></p> <p><strong><em>What are your biggest concerns going into the 2020 elections when it comes to voting rights, and what, if anything, do you anticipate can be done going into the upcoming election?</em></strong></p> <p><em>I am certainly concerned by the possibility of foreign interference and the Senate must take up the bills the House has passed to protect our election infrastructure from outside interference.

The House passed a voting rights bill, with all but one Republican opposing the measure. The Guardian spoke to Alabama representative Terri Sewell, who represents Selma and parts of Montgomery and Birmingham, about why she\u2019s prioritizing voting rights. Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds for personal expenses said he\u2019s resigning for Congress. 2020 Tidbits Pete Buttigieg released some details about his work at McKinsey amidst growing scrutiny of his time there. Michael Bloomberg apologized after he called Cory Booker \u201cwell-spoken\u201d. Elizabeth Warren was the first candidate to release her medical records, including a note from her doctor saying she was \u201cin excellent health\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story on the White House declining its impeachment hearing invitation: Pete Buttigieg has released some details about his work at the consulting firm McKinsey but did not disclose the names of his clients. The South Bend, Indiana mayor, and 2020 presidential candidate worked at McKinsey for three years. In response to criticism that he hasn\u2019t been forthcoming about his time there, Buttigieg said he has signed a non-disclosure agreement preventing him from sharing more details. McKinsey has come under increased scrutiny this week after a New York Times/ProPublica investigation found that the firm helped Immigration and Customs Enforcement find \u201cdetention savings opportunities\u201d that included cutting spending on food and medical care for detained migrants. Earlier reports found that the firm worked with authoritarian governments counter to US interests. In a statement, Buttigieg called for \u201cMcKinsey to do the right thing in the name of transparency\u201d and release the names of his clients. He provided some details about his work, writing that in 2007, he \u201cserved a nonprofit health insurance provider for approximately three months, undertaking on-the-job training and performing analytical work as part of a team identifying savings in administration and overhead costs.\u201d In 2008, he worked for a grocery chain in Toronto, \u201canalyzing the effects of price cuts\u201d and a consumer goods retailer in Chicago \u201cto investigate opportunities for selling more energy-efficient home products in their stores\u201d. Subsequently, he researched \u2018opportunities to combat climate change through energy efficiency\u201d for a group of organizations that included the US Environmental Protection Agency, and later did similar work for a non-profit in California. Finally, he said he worked with the US government researching ways to increase employment and entrepreneurship in Iraq and Afghanistan. Buttigieg has previously touted his work with McKinsey as an asset, and a way to show that he understands business. The House passed a bill to grant greater federal oversight over state elections, restoring a key provision of the 1956 Voting Rights Act which was weakened by a 2013 Supreme Court decision. The legislation was approved 228-187, along party lines -- with all the House Republicans, bar one, opposed to it. The Voting Rights Advancement Act charges the Justice Department with greater oversight in states that repeatedly violate voting rights. It\u2019s unlikely that the measure will pass into law given Republican opposition in the Senate. Still, Democrats who have long-advocated for voting rights, and who are looking to demonstrate that they can still legislate while overseeing the impeachment inquiry, are celebrating today\u2019s incremental victory. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, who was beaten while demonstrating for voting rights in 1965, banged the gavel to mark the bill\u2019s passage. Alabama representative Terri Sewell, who introduced the bill, recently spoke with The Guardian about why voting rights are a priority. In what ways is the issue of voting rights personal for you, especially as someone who is from Selma? SEWELL: Growing up in Selma, Alabama, there was never a moment that I was not keenly aware of the sacrifice of those who came before me, and the pivotal role of my home in our nation\u2019s struggle for civil rights. Those stories did not have to be taught, as they are interwoven into the fabric of Selma. Their lessons of strength, resilience and deep patriotism have shaped me and opened doors of opportunity, for me and for so many others. For all of these reasons, voting rights are deeply personal to me. H.R. 4, which seeks to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965, remains my signature piece of legislation, and I will continue to fight tirelessly until it is passed. In what ways are voting rights especially relevant now? During this deeply sobering moment in our nation\u2019s history, as we protect against further foreign interference in our elections, I believe it is more important than ever that we, as elected officials, are doing everything possible to ensure that our elections are conducted fairly and that every single American is given equal opportunity to cast their vote. Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, and we must continue to invest in infrastructure and policies that help ensure that every single American can make their voice heard at the ballot box. What are your biggest concerns going into the 2020 elections when it comes to voting rights, and what, if anything, do you anticipate can be done going into the upcoming election? I am certainly concerned by the possibility of foreign interference and the Senate must take up the bills the House has passed to protect our election infrastructure from outside interference. I am equally concerned by the steps state legislatures across the country have taken \u2014 both before and since the November 2018 midterm elections \u2014 to limit access to the ballot box. Voting is a right, not a privilege, and it is paramount that we ensure access to all Americans, without allowing economic indicators or other challenging circumstances be a barrier. Do you foresee the VRAA passing in time to take effect before the 2020 election? Historically, the VRA has been supported by both parties; President Bush was proud to sign an extension into law in 2006. My hope is that history will extend to the VRAA, too. *** Follow The Guardian\u2019s special coverage of the systemic ways that voting rights are denied to so many Americans and how this will impact the US presidential elections: On Monday, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to allow the federal government to carry out four scheduled executions by reinstating the federal death penalty after a 16-year old. The Supreme Court just rejected the request \u2014 which means there won\u2019t be an execution on Monday. More context from The AP: Attorney General William Barr announced during the summer that federal executions would resume using a single drug, pentobarbital, to put inmates to death. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C., temporarily halted the executions after some of the chosen inmates challenged the new execution procedures in court. Chutkan ruled that the procedure approved by Barr likely violates the Federal Death Penalty Act. The federal appeals court in Washington had earlier denied the administration\u2019s emergency plea to put Chutkan\u2019s ruling on hold and allow the executions to proceed. Federal executions are likely to remain on hold at least for several months, while the appeals court in Washington undertakes a full review of Chutkan\u2019s ruling. The Supreme Court has granted Donald Trump\u2019s request to block a congressional subpoena for his financial records from Deutsche Bank. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg delayed an appellate court\u2019s decision ordering Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to comply with subpoenas until 5pm on Friday, Dec. 13, giving the court considers granting an even longer delay and Trump\u2019s lawyers time to prepare a formal appeal. Trump has gone to great lengths to keep his financial records private. In a separate case, he\u2019s appealing to prevent the House Oversight Committee from obtaining financial records from his longtime accounting firm Mazars. Duncan Hunter, the Republican representative from California who plead guilty to misusing campaign funds, has announced he will be resigning from Congress. \u201cShortly after the Holidays, I will resign from Congress. It has been an honor to serve the people of California\u2019s 50th District, and I greatly appreciate the trust they have put in me over these last 11 years,\u201d Hunter said in a statement. Yesterday, the House Ethics Committee informed Hunter that he \u201cshould refrain from voting\u201d in the House of Representatives \u201cunless or until judicial or executive proceedings result in reinstatement of the presumption of innocence \u2026 or until the Member is reelected to the House after the date of such conviction.\u201d Hunter and his wife were charged with spending more $250,000 in campaign funds on personal costs including vacations, groceries and other bills. Michael Bloomberg apologized for calling Cory Booker \u201cwell-spoken\u201d. The late entrant to the 2020 presidential primaries said, \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have used the word, but I could just tell you he is a friend of mine. He is a Rhodes Scholar, which is much more impressive than my academic background. I envy him.\u201d In an interview with CBS This Morning\u2019s Gayle King, Bloomberg said, \u201cCory Booker endorsed me a number of times and I endorsed Cory Booker a number of times,\u201d Bloomberg told King. \u201cHe\u2019s very well-spoken. He\u2019s got some good ideas. It would be better the more diverse any group is. But the public is out there picking and choosing and narrowing down this field.\u201d That\u2019s it from me on the blog today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The White House announced it would not participate in Monday\u2019s impeachment hearing conducted by the House judiciary committee, slamming the inquiry as \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d Trump said he spoke to the Saudi king about the shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, which left four people dead. Authorities said the shooter was a Saudi national studying aviation at the naval base, raising potential terrorism concerns. Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a court ruling ordering Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to hand over the president\u2019s financial records to congressional investigators. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said in a New Yorker interview that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s good for our country\u201d as Democratic leadership moves toward drafting articles of impeachment. The House passed a measure endorsing a two-state Israeli-Palestinian solution, implicitly rebuking Trump\u2019s policies toward Israel. I will be away from the blog next week, so enjoy coverage from some of my wonderful Guardian colleagues. And stay tuned for more updates from Maanvi. The letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone to the House judiciary committee does not explicitly say Trump will not participate in Monday\u2019s impeachment hearing, but an administration official reportedly confirmed he would not be sending a representative. In his letter notifying the House judiciary committee of Trump\u2019s decision not to send a representative to Monday\u2019s hearing, White House counsel Pat Cipollone slammed the impeachment inquiry as \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d The letter concludes, \u201cWhatever course you choose, as the President has recently stated: \u2018if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business.\u2019\u201d The White House has decided it will not send a representative to the House judiciary committee\u2019s next impeachment hearing, which is scheduled for Monday. Trump\u2019s legal team was facing a 5 p.m. ET deadline to notify the committee of its decision. If the president had sent a representative, the lawyer would have been allowed to pose questions to those presenting the findings of the House intelligence committee, but some of Trump\u2019s allies have expressed concern about adding credibility to the proceedings. The White House is abour half an hour away from a 5 p.m. ET deadline to notify the House judiciary committee about whether Trump intends to send a representative to the panel\u2019s next impeachment hearing, which is taking place Monday. The hearing will allow the House intelligence committee to present the findings contained in its impeachment report, as well as the minority report compiled by the panel\u2019s Republican members. If Trump sends a representative, that lawyer would be allowed to pose questions to the staffers presenting the committee\u2019s findings. But sending a representative could also add credibility to the hearing, which the president is desperately trying to avoid. Trump was given the opportunity to send a lawyer to Wednesday\u2019s hearing featuring testimony from four legal experts, but he declined. As House Democrats move toward drafting articles of impeachment against Trump, the chamber\u2019s Democratic leadership is also advancing other measures, including a vote today on endorsing a two-state Israeli-Palestinian solution. The Washington Post reports: The measure was the latest example of House Democrats wading into the divisive realm of U.S.-Israel relations, an outgrowth of a broader controversy over the party\u2019s weakening support for Israel\u2019s right-wing government and its willingness to police seemingly anti-Semitic remarks by members of its ranks. The vote was 226 to 188, with five Republicans breaking ranks and joining Democrats in backing the resolution. The legislation declares that \u201conly the outcome of a two-state solution . . . can both ensure the state of Israel\u2019s survival as a Jewish and democratic state and fulfill the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own.\u201d The vote serves as an implicit rebuke of Trump\u2019s policies on Israel, coming a month after the president\u2019s administration announced the US would no longer consider Israeli settlements in the west bank to be illegal. But the vote was also notable for the four Democrats who opposed the measure from the left: congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, the four freshman lawmakers known as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d Earlier today, Elizabeth Warren became the first Democratic presidential candidate to release her medical records, which included a note from her longtime doctor saying she was \u201cin excellent health.\u201d \u201cIn summary, Senator Elizabeth Warren is a very healthy 70 year old woman,\u201d Dr Beverly Woo wrote. \u201cThere are no medical conditions or health problems that would keep her from fulfilling the duties of the President of the United States.\u201d According to Woo, Warren is 5\u20198\u201d and weighs 129 pounds. Her only medical condition is hypothyroidism, which is treated with daily medication. \u201cShe exercises regularly and follows a healthy diet despite her very busy schedule,\u201d Woo wrote, adding that Warren doesn\u2019t have a history of smoking or drug use. The health of the Democratic presidential candidates has come under renewed scrutiny since Bernie Sanders, 78, suffered a heart attack in October. Sanders has returned to the campaign trail, but the episode raised questions about the wisdom of nominating a candidate in their 70\u2019s -- as Sanders, Warren and Joe Biden all are. At an Iowa campaign event yesterday, an elderly voter pressed Biden on his age. \u201cI\u2019m not sedentary,\u201d the former vice president angrily replied. \u201cAnd you want to check my shape, man, let\u2019s do push-ups together here, man. Let\u2019s run. Let\u2019s do whatever you want to do. Let\u2019s take an IQ test. Okay?\u201d Taking questions from voters at a campaign event in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Warren addressed her past claims of Native American ancestry, which have sparked criticism from the president and others. Warren began by saying she had learned about her family history from her parents, who had told her about her alleged Native American ancestry. The Massachusetts senators also directed voters to a Boston Globe investigation that found Warren\u2019s ethnicity claims were not a factor in her successful legal career. But the presidential candidate acknowledged she regretted the mistake. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI am not a person of color, I am not a citizen of a tribe. And I have apologized for confusion I have caused.\u201d In addition to his complaints about water pressure, Trump also took aim at energy-efficient lightbulbs, which he said gave people an \u201corange look.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want an orange look,\u201d the president said. During Trump\u2019s roundtable on small businesses, the president also inexplicably touched on the issue of water pressure and complained about toilets not properly flushing. \u201cPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times as opposed to once,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey end up using more water.\u201d The president added he had asked the EPA to look into water standards. During Trump\u2019s roundtable on small businesses and his adminsitration\u2019s deregulation efforts, the president answered one question about the Naval Air Station shooting, declining to say whether authorities believed the incident was terrorism-related. \u201cThat\u2019s all being studied now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will be talking about it very soon. ...It will be a report and the report will come out very soon.\u201d The president ignored shouted questions about his response to the House judiciary committee on the impeachment inquiry, as his legal team faces a 5 p.m. ET deadline to let the panel know about participating in its Monday hearing. Donald Trump, fighting to keep details of his finances secret, asked the US Supreme Court this afternoon to prevent records held by Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp from being handed over to Democratic-led congressional panels. Trump\u2019s lawyers asked the high court to put a hold a December 3 ruling by the Manhattan-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals directing the two banks to comply with April subpoenas by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee and Intelligence Committee for the financial records, Reuters writes. The record requests relate to the president, three of his children and the Trump Organization. Lawmakers have said the requests are part of a wider investigation into money laundering and foreign influence over US politics, especially relating to Trump-owned hotels. Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump\u2019s real estate business. A 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to the bank. Congressional investigators have already identified possible failures in Deutsche Bank\u2019s money laundering controls in its dealings with Russian oligarchs, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Trump has sought to keep his financial and tax records private. He broke with tradition by not releasing his tax returns as a candidate in 2016 and as president. Trump began his roundtable discussion on small businesses and his administration\u2019s deregulation efforts by echoing his tweet about having just spoken to the Saudi king regarding the shooting in Pensacola. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing that took place, and we\u2019re getting to the bottom of it,\u201d the president told White House pool reporters. Authorities have said the attacker, who killed three people before being shot himself, was a Saudi national studying aviation at the naval base, raising possible terrorism concerns. Trump has just tweeted that he spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia following the shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, which officials said was carried out by a Saudi aviation student at the base. Speaking to reporters moments ago, Florida governor Ron DeSantis said, \u201cThe government of Saudi Arabia needs to make things better for these victims. I think they\u2019re gonna owe a debt here given that this is one of their individuals.\u201d The shooting left at least four dead, including the gunman. Three Republican senators -- Lindsey Graham, Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson -- have sent a letter requesting \u201cstaff-led transcribed interviews\u201d with former DNC consultant Alexandra Chalupa and Andrii Telizhenko, who was a political officer in the Ukrainian embassy. Chalupa\u2019s name came up repeatedly during the House intelligence committee\u2019s public impeachment trials because some of the president\u2019s Republican allies have tried to equate her work researching former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, which was aided by a handful of Ukrainian officials, with Russia\u2019s widespread efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s allies have pointed to Chalupa\u2019s work to bolster the baseless theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, despite the testimony from Fiona Hill, the former top White House expert on Russia, that the allegations against Ukraine are a \u201cfictional narrative\u201d peddled by the Kremlin. Taking questions from reporters, White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley said he believes Rudy Giuliani is still the president\u2019s personal lawyer, even as the former New York mayor traveled to Europe this week to meet with former Ukrainian officials who helped spread baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. As reports emerged that the shooter at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola was a Saudi aviation student, raising possible concerns of terrorism, Trump said he had just received a briefing on the situation and had spoken to the governor of Florida. But the president offered no additional details on the possible motivation for the attack. \u201cWe are continuing to monitor the situation as the investigation is ongoing,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, left at least four dead, including the gunman. Authorities believe the attacker was a Saudi aviation student at the base, sparking concerns that the shooting was terrorism-related. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said in a New Yorker interview that he believes Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s good for our country\u201d as Democratic leadership moves toward drafting articles of impeachment. Michael Bloomberg was criticized for referring to fellow Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker as \u201cwell spoken,\u201d which many commentators said promoted a racist trope and belittled the New Jersey senator\u2019s intelligence. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. The gunman who killed at least three people at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, was reportedly a Saudi national, which has sparked concerns that the attack may have been terrorism-related. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry, is now proposing a joint US-Ukrainian probe to investigate potential corruption by officials from both countries. The tweet, which is unlikely to generate any legitimate interest, comes the same week that Giuliani traveled to Europe to meet with former Ukrainian officials who helped spread baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. Congressman Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House judiciary and intelligence committees, said Democrats don\u2019t have a timeline for impeachment but want to \u201cmove as expeditiously as possible.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no timeline, and that\u2019s intentional,\u201d Swalwell said. \u201cWe want to move based on the evidence and what our duty calls us to do. And we don\u2019t want to set artificial timelines. But because the upcoming elections and to make sure the process is fair, we\u2019re trying to move as expeditiously as possible and give the president an opportunity to participate.\u201d But Democrats seem on track to hold an impeachment vote before recessing for Christmas, as they have reportedly intended since formally launching the inquiry. On which articles of impeachment Democrats will pursue, Swalwell said, \u201cWe have to consider the best articles to tell the American people, \u2018This president needs to be held accountable.\u2019\u201d Congressman Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan who left the Republican Party over his opposition to Trump, said he was ready to vote for three articles of impeachment against the president. At least one House Democrat, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, has said he plans to vote against the articles of impeachment, so Republicans will likely boast about their stance attracting (barely) bipartisan support. Joe Biden\u2019s super PAC, which just announced plans to air its first ad in Iowa this week, was formed in October as the former vice president struggled to keep up with the fundraising of fellow frontrunners like Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. When Biden\u2019s campaign announced it was no longer opposed to supporters forming super PACs, the reversal was quickly denounced by some of the former veep\u2019s opponents, who have relied on grassroots donations to finance their operations. \u201cI don\u2019t need a super PAC,\u201d Sanders said at an Iowa town hall shortly after Biden announced the change. \u201cI am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country.\u201d Unite the Country, the super PAC backing Joe Biden\u2019s presidential bid, plans to air its first ad in Iowa this week. The ad, entitled \u201cCourage,\u201d touts the former senator\u2019s work on the Violence Against Women Act and an assault weapons ban. \u201cMy mother had an expression. She used to say, \u2018Remember Joey, you\u2019re defined by your courage,\u2019\u201d Biden says in the ad. \u201dThe right to be educated. The right to marry who you choose. The right to live free from the threat of violence and fear. These are basic fundamental, universal human rights. Imagine. Imagine what we could build.\u201d The super PAC is spending at least $650,000 to air the ad in four major Iowa markets, with more buys expected later this month. Former secretary of state John Kerry, who endorsed Joe Biden\u2019s White House bid yesterday, is introducing the former vice president at a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \u201cThe only team that\u2019s worked more closely than us is Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin,\u201d Kerry joked. In his endorsement of Biden yesterday, Kerry argued the former veep had the character and experience needed to defeat Trump and reunite the country. \u201cThe world is broken. Our politics are broken. The country faces extraordinary challenges,\u201d Kerry told the Washington Post. \u201cAnd I believe very deeply that Joe Biden\u2019s character, his ability to persevere, his decency and the experiences that he brings to the table are critical to the moment. The world has to be put back together, the world that Donald Trump has smashed apart.\u201d More than 500 law professors have signed on to a letter accusing Trump of committing \u201cimpeachable conduct\u201d in his actions toward Ukraine. The Washington Post reports: The signers are law professors and other academics from universities across the country, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Michigan and many others. The open letter was published online Friday by the nonprofit advocacy group Protect Democracy. \u2018There is overwhelming evidence that President Trump betrayed his oath of office by seeking to use presidential power to pressure a foreign government to help him distort an American election, for his personal and political benefit, at the direct expense of national security interests as determined by Congress,\u2019 the group of professors wrote. \u2018His conduct is precisely the type of threat to our democracy that the Founders feared when they included the remedy of impeachment in the Constitution.\u2019 The letter comes two days after three legal experts testified to the House judiciary committee that Trump\u2019s actions met the constitutional standard for impeachment, although a law professor called by the panel\u2019s Republicans disagreed with them on that point. Congressman George Holding, a Republican on North Carolina, announced he would not seek reeelection next year, citing the state\u2019s newly redrawn congressional map as one reason for his departure. \u201cIt has also been gratifying to work for the ideals and values that I, like many other Americans, believe in,\u201d Holding said in a statement. \u201cAnd so it is with regret that I announce I will not be a candidate for Congress this election.\u201d North Carolina\u2019s new congressional map, which was approved this week by a three-judge panel after the previous map was thrown out for violating the state constitution, has made Holding\u2019s distruct a likely pick-up opportunity for Democrats next year. Holding becomes the 22nd House Republican to announce his departure amid a wave of retirements and campaigns for higher office. Fellow congressman Tom Graves, a Republican of Georgia, just announced his own retirement yesterday. Cory Booker said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by fellow Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg\u2019s comment that the New Jersey senator was \u201cwell spoken,\u201d which was wildly criticized for promoting a racist trope. \u201cMike and I have known each other for a long time,\u201d Booker told the podcast \u201cSignal Boost,\u201d adding that he has a \u201cgreat deal of regard\u201d for the former New York mayor. But Booker added, \u201cIt\u2019s sort of stunning at times that we are still revisiting these sort of tired tropes.\u201d The senator expressed hope Bloomberg would revisit the comments, but he said it was \u201cproblematic\u201d that so many people still did not see what was wrong with such language. Booker also made a point to return to his concerns about the Democratic Party taking black voters for granted, particularly in the wake of Kamala Harris\u2019 withdrawal from the presidential race. \u201cWe can\u2019t win without the enthusastic support of black voters, and we saw that between 2016 and 2012,\u201d Booker said. In an interview with the New Yorker, Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s good for our country\u201d. The New Yorker\u2019s Susan B Glasser asked Schiff whether he \u201chated\u201d Trump after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, shouted down a reporter who asked her the same question. \u201cNo,\u201d Schiff replied, \u201cbut I do hate what he is doing to the country.\u201d The California Democrat argued Trump\u2019s alleged actions toward Ukraine demonstrate an alarming tendency to prioritize his own interests over those of the nation. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s good for our country, what\u2019s good for Ukraine,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what\u2019s in it for him personally and for his re-election campaign.\u201d Schiff also justified House Democrats\u2019 timeline for moving forward with articles of impeachment, despite some Republicans\u2019 demands that they wait until courts rule on whether administration officials must comply with congressional subpoenas. \u201cThe long and the short of it is, though, given that the president is today trying to get foreign interference in the next election to help him, we do not feel that when we already have overwhelming evidence, we should wait any longer,\u201d Schiff said. Michael Bloomberg\u2019s ill-advised use of the phrase \u201cwell spoken\u201d to describe fellow Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker reminded some commentators of another controversy from the 2008 election involving Joe Biden. Running against future president Barack Obama, Biden said he believed voters were gravitating toward the then-senator beacuse of his \u201caticulate\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d image. \u201cI mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,\u201d Biden said in February 2007. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s a storybook, man.\u201d Biden later released a statement apologizing for the remark, and Obama, who went on to choose Biden as his running mate, said he didn\u2019t take the comment personally. But Obama also released a statement saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t take Sen. Biden\u2019s comments personally, but obviously they were historically inaccurate. African-American presidential candidates like Jesse Jackson, Shirley Chisholm, Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns, and no one would call them inarticulate.\u201d Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is receiving criticism for describing fellow Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker as \u201cwell spoken\u201d in an interview with CBS News. Bloomberg was asked about Booker\u2019s complaint that there are \u201cmore billionaires than Black people who\u2019ve made the December debate stage\u201d following the withdrawal of Kamala Harris. \u201cCory Booker endorsed me a number of times, and I endorsed Cory Booker a number of times,\u201d Bloomberg told Gayle King. \u201cHe\u2019s very well spoken; he\u2019s got some very good ideas. It would be better the more diverse any group is, but the public is out there picking and choosing and narrowing down this field.\u201d Bloomberg argued those who are complaining about the lack of diversity among the Democratic frontrunners should have fielded their own candidate. \u201cLots of people can enter,\u201d the former New York mayor said. \u201cIf you wanted to enter and run for president of the United States, you could have done that. But don\u2019t complain to me that you\u2019re not in the race. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d But Bloomberg\u2019s comments about Booker specifically quickly kicked off a round of criticism that he had promoted a racist trope that belittled the New Jersey senator\u2019s intelligence. The White House said in a statement that Trump was monitoring the situation at the naval air station in Pensacola after a shooter opened fired on multiple people. \u201cThe President has been briefed on the shooting at Pensacola Naval Air Station/Forest Sherman Field and is monitoring the situation,\u201d the statement said. According to the AP, at least one person was killed in addition to the shooter. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional Democrats who traveled to Madrid for an international climate meeting are insisting that their presence proved the US is still committed to its pledges. \u201cNot only are we saying that we as Democrats in the Congress are still in--America is saying that we are still in,\u201d Pelosi said in a press conference this morning. The United Nations, Chile and Spain are pushing countries to commit to new 2020 plans and goals to be carbon neutral by 2050. Most of the Democrats running for president have set similar targets, although to achieve them they would have to usher politically contentious climate proposals through a possibly divided Congress. Under Donald Trump, the federal government has fallen behind on its previous climate commitments, and advocates, states and localities have sought to fill the gap. The November jobs report was out this morning, and it showed the US economy created 266,000 jobs last month -- far excceeding the 186,000 forecasted by economists. Wage growth in some sectors has also hit its highest level since the financial crisis. The end of the General Motors strike certainly helped boost job creation, but the numbers are solid overall, indicating the US economy is strengthening despite Trump\u2019s trade war with China. For more analysis on the jobs numbers, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog. Authorities said a shooter who opened fire on multiple people at the naval air station in Pensacola, Florida, is now dead. The AP reports: News outlets are reporting that 10 people have been taken to area hospitals. Pensacola Police spokesman Mike Wood has confirmed that law enforcement responded to the active shooter. Base spokesman Jason Bortz said both gates are closed and the base is on lockdown. NAS Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to its website. One of the Navy\u2019s most historic and storied bases, it sprawls along the waterfront southwest of downtown Pensacola. The base dominates the economy of the surrounding area and includes the National Naval Aviation Museum, a popular regional tourist attraction. Good morning, live blog readers! After a historic day on Capitol Hill, Nancy Pelosi took questions from audience members last night at a CNN town hall, where the House speaker dubiously claimed the impeachment inquiry isn\u2019t political. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics at all. This is about patriotism,\u201d Pelosi said hours after announcing that Democratic leadership would move forward with drafting articles of impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s not about partisanship. It\u2019s about honoring our oath of office.\u201d Pelosi is fond of saying that Democrats are pursuing impeachment because, as Thomas Paine once wrote, \u201cthe time has found us\u201d, but it\u2019s undeniable that Americans have strong and opposing beliefs on Donald Trump\u2019s potential removal from office. According to the FiveThirtyEight polling average, 47.8% of Americans support impeachment, while 44% oppose it. Those numbers could affect Democrats\u2019 ability to maintain control of the House next year \u2013 and their hopes of taking back the White House. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Trump will hold a roundtable on administraiton accomplishments for small businesses at 2.15pm ET and then speak at a White House Christmas reception. Nancy Pelosi and the congressional delegation that travelled to Madrid for the UN climate conference will hold a press conference at 9am ET. House Democrats will hold a press event at 10.30am ET to tout their bill that would restore the full strength of the Voting Rights Act. The blog has more coming up, so stay tuned.",
