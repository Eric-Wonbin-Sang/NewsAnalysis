      "bodyText": "The federal and South Australian governments have demanded an urgent investigation into claims that unscrupulous private art dealers are exploiting frail and elderly Aboriginal artists in central Australia. At least three artists have been taken from their remote central Australian communities by a private art dealer who is forcing at least one of them to pay off debts of tens of thousands of dollars by producing new paintings, a leading Aboriginal art centre has alleged. In a letter obtained by the Guardian, the award-winning APY Artists collective from central Australia has spoken out about \u201cdamaging, dangerous, unscrupulous\u201d practices it says are happening in Alice Springs. The collective wrote to the federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, and the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, pleading for help to stamp out exploitative practices known as carpetbagging, which have plagued the Aboriginal art industry for decades but are re-emerging as desert artists enjoy a new wave of artistic and financial success. Marshall\u2019s office confirmed he had received the letter and said he was \u201cvery concerned of the potential for artists on the [Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara] lands to be exploited in this way.\u201d Police and the attorney general had been made aware of the allegations raised in the letter, an SA government spokesman said. \u201cThe South Australian government is acutely aware of such unethical practices, and wants to play a key role in preventing Aboriginal artists being exploited,\u201d the spokesman said. Marshall raised unethical practices associated with Aboriginal arts at a meeting with federal, state and territory cultural ministers in Adelaide last month. Marshall has directed Arts SA to convene a meeting to further explore potential solutions to these unethical practices, the government spokesman said. The APY artists\u2019 collective alleged that the dealer had at least three high-profile artists painting for him at a property in Alice Springs. All three had major health challenges, the letter said: one has an acquired brain injury, another has chronic asthma and the third is deaf. One of these artists, it is alleged, is acclaimed painter Yaritji Young, whose works can sell for as much as $45,000. According to the letter, Young was told she had to make paintings to service a $20,000 debt to the dealer, apparently accrued by her son. \u201cThis is common practice often used by unscrupulous private dealers, locking family members of high-profile artists into a debt, ensuring that the family member [of] the artist has no alternative but to paint their way out of the debt,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe family members that have been approached \u2026 are all compromised by their own challenges, which include substance abuse, health issues and family obligations.\u201d The carpetbaggers, usually non-Indigenous men, are well-known to locals and operate openly in central Australia.

But while it is the most famous example in our history there have been other more recent attempts to create projects that tick the three nation-building boxes.</p> <p>Take <a href=\"https://inlandrail.artc.com.au/\">Inland Rail</a>, for example. This project has been discussed for generations yet it wasn\u2019t until 2017 that the government committed $9.3bn over 10 years to build the additional 600km of freight rail tracks needed to connect the 1,700km Brisbane-to-Melbourne commercial railway line.</p> <p>But where the Snowy Hydro provided electricity and drought relief as well as jobs for 100,000 workers, Inland Rail will largely provide logistical efficiencies to companies in the resource, defence and agriculture industries and will create only an estimated 16,000 jobs.</p> <p>Another attempt at a nation-building project was the controversial <a href=\"https://www.communications.gov.au/what-we-do/internet/national-broadband-network\">national broadband network scheme</a>, or NBN as it is more commonly known. Proposed by the incoming Rudd government in 2007, it was changed by the Abbott government when Malcolm Turnbull was communications minister to deliver fibre-to-the-node internet.</p> <p>It\u2019s estimated to have cost about $30bn so far and created 16,000 jobs.</p> <p>Given that there are about 822,500 jobseekers in Australia, these projects have fallen far short of providing the essential employment aspect of a nation-building program.</p> <p>But while the transport and communications portfolios have failed to deliver on promised outcomes, housing stress and homelessness are an interconnected policy problem that could provide for a nation-building project \u2013 and the solution is deceptively simple: <a href=\"https://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article/look-to-finland-for-housing-solutions\">we need to build more houses</a>.</p> <p>It has been estimated that a minimum of approximately <a href=\"https://chp.org.au/100k-homes/\">100,000 public or community housing units are needed</a> to effectively eliminate rough sleeping in Australia. That doesn\u2019t even address the additional <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/housing-affordability-stress-affects-one-in-nine-households-but-which-ones-are-really-struggling-96103\">11% of households</a> experiencing housing stress, which means that they are spending more than 30% of their income on housing costs. Furthermore, the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute <a href=\"https://www.ahuri.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0023/14297/AHURI_Final_Report_287-Modelling-housing-need-in-Australia-to-2025v2.pdf\">estimates</a> there is a shortfall of approximately 525,000 affordable rental properties in Australia.</p> <p>This approach is known as a <a href=\"http://chp.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FINAL-180606-Housing-First-2018-6-June.pdf\">housing first</a> policy, which has been explored by governments around the world, as far away as Finland and as close as South Australia.</p> <p>Traditional approaches to housing are built around the idea that before people are offered housing, they must first show that they have dealt with the complex problems that contribute to housing problems and homelessness, from mental health through to employment.</p> <p>Housing first offers people experiencing homelessness or housing stress secure housing at the start of the process, as the name implies. This has a range of benefits for the individual and the community, increasing social inclusion and providing a safe, secure and stable foundation for people in crisis.</p> <p>The often untold part of this story is the significant potential for job creation. A <a href=\"https://providencehousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Housing-and-Economic-Development-Report-2011.pdf\">review of the literature</a> surrounding housing investment and job creation found that on average for every 100 units of public housing that were built, approximately 80 jobs were created in construction and an additional 30 ongoing jobs were created to support the people in the housing units.</p> <p>This would mean that an investment in 100,000 housing units would create an approximate 80,000 construction jobs and an additional 30,000 jobs to support those who go into public housing.</p> <p>While these are just estimates, when we add in the additional demand this creates up and down the supply chain, there is the potential for a nation building project to rival the Snowy Hydro scheme.</p> <p>While this idea fits the three essential criteria for a nation-building project, it will require something else. More than anything, these projects are about hope. They are about offering the public a future that they can hope for, and one that is better than the one they are experiencing.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shirley Jackson is an economist at Per Capita</p></li> </ul>",

Most concerningly, trust in our political system is at an all-time low, as voters feel increasingly disconnected and let down by the people who are supposed to give them hope. We need to look back to the Great Depression to find a time when the Australian public faced challenges of this scale \u2013 and also to find policy solutions that have the potential to inspire hope and trust in our system once more.

It\u2019s estimated to have cost about $30bn so far and created 16,000 jobs. Given that there are about 822,500 jobseekers in Australia, these projects have fallen far short of providing the essential employment aspect of a nation-building program. But while the transport and communications portfolios have failed to deliver on promised outcomes, housing stress and homelessness are an interconnected policy problem that could provide for a nation-building project \u2013 and the solution is deceptively simple: we need to build more houses. It has been estimated that a minimum of approximately 100,000 public or community housing units are needed to effectively eliminate rough sleeping in Australia. That doesn\u2019t even address the additional 11% of households experiencing housing stress, which means that they are spending more than 30% of their income on housing costs. Furthermore, the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute estimates there is a shortfall of approximately 525,000 affordable rental properties in Australia. This approach is known as a housing first policy, which has been explored by governments around the world, as far away as Finland and as close as South Australia. Traditional approaches to housing are built around the idea that before people are offered housing, they must first show that they have dealt with the complex problems that contribute to housing problems and homelessness, from mental health through to employment. Housing first offers people experiencing homelessness or housing stress secure housing at the start of the process, as the name implies. This has a range of benefits for the individual and the community, increasing social inclusion and providing a safe, secure and stable foundation for people in crisis. The often untold part of this story is the significant potential for job creation. A review of the literature surrounding housing investment and job creation found that on average for every 100 units of public housing that were built, approximately 80 jobs were created in construction and an additional 30 ongoing jobs were created to support the people in the housing units. This would mean that an investment in 100,000 housing units would create an approximate 80,000 construction jobs and an additional 30,000 jobs to support those who go into public housing. While these are just estimates, when we add in the additional demand this creates up and down the supply chain, there is the potential for a nation building project to rival the Snowy Hydro scheme. While this idea fits the three essential criteria for a nation-building project, it will require something else. More than anything, these projects are about hope. They are about offering the public a future that they can hope for, and one that is better than the one they are experiencing. Shirley Jackson is an economist at Per Capita",

Johnson\u2019s Trump-deal Brexit puts a price tag on our NHS. So we\u2019ll say it again and again until the message gets through to the White House: our NHS is not for sale.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson has highlighted the UK\u2019s ability to strike free trade deals with non-EU countries, including the US, as a key benefit of his Brexit agreement over Theresa May\u2019s, although Trump himself has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/trump-says-johnson-and-farage-could-form-unstoppable-force\">raised doubts about that</a>. </p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s deal also shifted assurances about labour laws and environmental standards from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement into the non legally-binding political declaration. Corbyn will warn that means the government is preparing to slash workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives want is to hijack Brexit to unleash Thatcherism on steroids,\u201d he will say. \u201cMargaret Thatcher\u2019s attack on the working people of our country left scars that have never healed and communities that have never recovered.</p> <p>\u201cThe Conservatives know they can\u2019t win support for what they\u2019re planning to do in the name of Thatcherism. So they\u2019re trying to do it under the banner of Brexit instead.\u201d</p> <p>Labour knows Brexit will be a key issue in the election on 12 December, but Corbyn is also seeking to shift the agenda on to other issues, including the climate emergency.</p> <p>Johnson has insisted he is the party leader who will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, with the \u201coven-ready\u201d Brexit deal he struck in Brussels last month.</p> <p>The prime minister wrote to Corbyn on Monday night, accusing the Labour leader of failing to make clear what his policy was on Brexit. \u201cYour current position seems to be that you want to go back to square one. You want to throw out the great new deal we have reached with our European friends, and instead negotiate a whole new treaty from scratch,\u201d Johnson wrote.</p> <p>\u201cEven assuming the EU agrees to go back to the very beginning, this will take months and possibly years to do \u2013 under your proposals, 2020 will be lost to more dither and delay over Brexit. Voters also have the right to know: what would your supposed Brexit \u2018deal\u2019 actually take back control of?\u201d</p> <p>He challenged Corbyn to rule out supporting revoking article 50 to cancel Brexit if the general election resulted in a hung parliament and Labour entered negotiations with the Lib Dems. Jo Swinson\u2019s party has said it would revoke article 50 if it formed a majority government.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn is to accuse Boris Johnson of seeking to \u201chijack\u201d Britain\u2019s exit from the EU in order to unleash \u201cThatcherism on steroids\u201d by slashing workers\u2019 rights and throwing the NHS open to US corporations. With Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit under intense scrutiny, Corbyn will promise an audience in the leave-supporting Tory-held seat of Harlow, Essex, on Tuesday that he will \u201cget Brexit sorted\u201d within six months. Labour is again trying to appeal to both leavers and remainers at this election by promising another referendum \u2013 but declining to say how a Labour government would campaign in it. Corbyn will be introduced by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who will explain how the party plans to renegotiate a Brexit deal within three months, which Labour says would then put to the public in a referendum by next June. Starmer is among those who had pushed for Labour to announce that it would campaign for remain in that vote \u2013 but that view did not prevail at the party\u2019s conference in September, and Corbyn insisted on Sunday: \u201cThe debate is over.\u201d Many Labour MPs in remain-supporting constituencies fear that the more ardently pro-remain Liberal Democrats could benefit at their expense. The Labour leader\u2019s address in Harlow will be his second major speech since the election was announced. Corbyn is to say: \u201cA vote for Johnson\u2019s Conservatives is a vote to betray our NHS in a sell-out to Trump. Johnson\u2019s Trump-deal Brexit puts a price tag on our NHS. So we\u2019ll say it again and again until the message gets through to the White House: our NHS is not for sale.\u201d Johnson has highlighted the UK\u2019s ability to strike free trade deals with non-EU countries, including the US, as a key benefit of his Brexit agreement over Theresa May\u2019s, although Trump himself has raised doubts about that. The prime minister\u2019s deal also shifted assurances about labour laws and environmental standards from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement into the non legally-binding political declaration. Corbyn will warn that means the government is preparing to slash workers\u2019 rights. \u201cWhat Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives want is to hijack Brexit to unleash Thatcherism on steroids,\u201d he will say. \u201cMargaret Thatcher\u2019s attack on the working people of our country left scars that have never healed and communities that have never recovered. \u201cThe Conservatives know they can\u2019t win support for what they\u2019re planning to do in the name of Thatcherism. So they\u2019re trying to do it under the banner of Brexit instead.\u201d Labour knows Brexit will be a key issue in the election on 12 December, but Corbyn is also seeking to shift the agenda on to other issues, including the climate emergency. Johnson has insisted he is the party leader who will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, with the \u201coven-ready\u201d Brexit deal he struck in Brussels last month. The prime minister wrote to Corbyn on Monday night, accusing the Labour leader of failing to make clear what his policy was on Brexit. \u201cYour current position seems to be that you want to go back to square one. You want to throw out the great new deal we have reached with our European friends, and instead negotiate a whole new treaty from scratch,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cEven assuming the EU agrees to go back to the very beginning, this will take months and possibly years to do \u2013 under your proposals, 2020 will be lost to more dither and delay over Brexit. Voters also have the right to know: what would your supposed Brexit \u2018deal\u2019 actually take back control of?\u201d He challenged Corbyn to rule out supporting revoking article 50 to cancel Brexit if the general election resulted in a hung parliament and Labour entered negotiations with the Lib Dems. Jo Swinson\u2019s party has said it would revoke article 50 if it formed a majority government.",

The termination was categorized as \u201cwithout cause\u201d, the Chicago-based firm said, signaling that the transgression wasn\u2019t so severe as the prevent him from receiving exit payments.</p> <p>The company said on Monday its global chief people officer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_davidfairhurst?lang=en\">David Fairhurst</a>, would also leave but did not give any reasons.</p> <p>Easterbrook, 52, was born in Watford and joined McDonald\u2019s in 1993. He left in 2011 to become chief executive of Pizza Express and later Wagamama, before rejoining McDonald\u2019s in its head office in Illinois as global chief brand officer in 2013. He became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/29/mcdonalds-new-chief-executive-steve-easterbrook\">chief executive two years</a> later. He also has <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/leadership/stephen-j-easterbrook\">a seat on the board at</a><a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/leadership/stephen-j-easterbrook\"> Walmart</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-fairhurst-403b961/\">According to his LinkedIn profile</a>, Fairhurst has been with McDonald\u2019s for nearly 15 years, holding key human resources positions. Like Easterbrook, he ascended to the upper reaches of McDonald\u2019s US operation <a href=\"https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/david-fairhurst-head-hr-mcdonalds-worldwide/\">via the UK office</a>.</p> <p>The termination of the two executives speaks to increasing pressure on large corporations to act decisively in instances where executives\u2019 conduct threatens the reputation of the company.</p> <p>\u201cCEOs are the face of the company, and stake holders expect them to be aligned with its core values,\u201d noted Jordan Cohen, marketing officer at <a href=\"http://www.n6a.com/\">North 6th Agency</a>. \u201cThis goes against the perception of the McDonald\u2019s brand identity and the company is going to need to navigate this carefully.\u201d</p> <p>The subsequent firing of the McDonald\u2019s head of HR, Cohen added, suggests a broader breakdown at executive levels of the company.</p> <p>\u201cThese types of scandals don\u2019t come out of nowhere so clearly there was a breakdown there. Someone was aware of the situation and did not act to address it, didn\u2019t surface it to the board, or was acting to protect the CEO and not the interests of the company.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald\u2019s response, Cohen added, \u201cshows the board took the misconduct seriously\u201d.</p> <p>News of Easterbrook\u2019s departure broke on Sunday afternoon in the US. At the close of trading yesterday, the company\u2019s shares had fallen by 2.7%.</p> <p>Given Easterbrook\u2019s 2018 base salary of $1.35m, his severance pay would amount to around $675,000. He received total compensation of $15.9m in 2018, according to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000089882219000080/mcdsepagmt.htm\">a regulatory filing</a> which showed he was also eligible for 18 months of health benefits.</p> <p>\u201cIn consideration for [severance] benefits, Mr Easterbrook has agreed to a release of claims in favour of the company,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000089882219000080/mcdsepagmt.htm\">the regulatory filing</a>.</p> <p>The new chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, would have an annual base salary of $1.25m, with a target-based bonus of 170% of his annual base salary, McDonald\u2019s said.</p> <p> Easterbrook\u2019s separation agreement contains a two-year post-termination non-competition clause, which is six months longer and more expansive in scope than his existing agreements.</p> <p>An exhaustive list of companies for which Easterbrook may not work in that period was included <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000089882219000080/mcdsepagmt.htm\">in the separation agreement</a>.

      "bodyText": "Steve Easterbrook, the British-born chief executive fired by McDonald\u2019s for having a consensual relationship with an employee, will be allowed to keep stock awards worth more than $37m as well as about $675,000 (\u00a3524,000) in severance pay, the fast food firm said on Monday. The relationship, about which little is known, contravened McDonald\u2019s company policy. The termination was categorized as \u201cwithout cause\u201d, the Chicago-based firm said, signaling that the transgression wasn\u2019t so severe as the prevent him from receiving exit payments. The company said on Monday its global chief people officer, David Fairhurst, would also leave but did not give any reasons. Easterbrook, 52, was born in Watford and joined McDonald\u2019s in 1993. He left in 2011 to become chief executive of Pizza Express and later Wagamama, before rejoining McDonald\u2019s in its head office in Illinois as global chief brand officer in 2013. He became chief executive two years later. He also has a seat on the board at Walmart. According to his LinkedIn profile, Fairhurst has been with McDonald\u2019s for nearly 15 years, holding key human resources positions. Like Easterbrook, he ascended to the upper reaches of McDonald\u2019s US operation via the UK office. The termination of the two executives speaks to increasing pressure on large corporations to act decisively in instances where executives\u2019 conduct threatens the reputation of the company. \u201cCEOs are the face of the company, and stake holders expect them to be aligned with its core values,\u201d noted Jordan Cohen, marketing officer at North 6th Agency. \u201cThis goes against the perception of the McDonald\u2019s brand identity and the company is going to need to navigate this carefully.\u201d The subsequent firing of the McDonald\u2019s head of HR, Cohen added, suggests a broader breakdown at executive levels of the company. \u201cThese types of scandals don\u2019t come out of nowhere so clearly there was a breakdown there. Someone was aware of the situation and did not act to address it, didn\u2019t surface it to the board, or was acting to protect the CEO and not the interests of the company.\u201d McDonald\u2019s response, Cohen added, \u201cshows the board took the misconduct seriously\u201d. News of Easterbrook\u2019s departure broke on Sunday afternoon in the US. At the close of trading yesterday, the company\u2019s shares had fallen by 2.7%. Given Easterbrook\u2019s 2018 base salary of $1.35m, his severance pay would amount to around $675,000. He received total compensation of $15.9m in 2018, according to a regulatory filing which showed he was also eligible for 18 months of health benefits. \u201cIn consideration for [severance] benefits, Mr Easterbrook has agreed to a release of claims in favour of the company,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in the regulatory filing. The new chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, would have an annual base salary of $1.25m, with a target-based bonus of 170% of his annual base salary, McDonald\u2019s said. Easterbrook\u2019s separation agreement contains a two-year post-termination non-competition clause, which is six months longer and more expansive in scope than his existing agreements. An exhaustive list of companies for which Easterbrook may not work in that period was included in the separation agreement. Burger King, Five Guys, Checker\u2019s, Tim Horton\u2019s, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle and Domino\u2019s Pizza were among fast food companies named. The list also included coffee outlets Starbucks, Caffe Nero and Costa. Easterbrook\u2019s time at the top of McDonald\u2019s has featured a drive to use more technology in restaurants and to offer customers more fresh ingredients. The company has faced challenges negotiating with franchisees and a push by employees for union rights and protection against such issues as sexual harassment and discrimination. Jonathan Maze, the editor of Restaurant Business magazine, told the Washington Post that Easterbrook had been \u201cpretty consequential\u201d to the business. In a note quoted by the Wall Street Journal, analysts at investment bank Piper Jaffray &amp; Co advised investors to look to other fast food stocks, because \u201cchanges of this magnitude tend to be disruptive\u201d. In an email to McDonald\u2019s staff, the divorced father of three acknowledged the relationship, and said it was a mistake. \u201cGiven the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,\u201d Easterbrook wrote. Desiree Moore, a Chicago-based lawyer acting as spokeswoman for Easterbrook, said he was \u201cdeeply grateful for his time at McDonald\u2019s\u201d and would not comment further.",

Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman, the current longest continuously serving female MP, was also expected to do well.

      "bodyText": "Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected as the new Speaker of the House of Commons on Monday, succeeding John Bercow who held the role for more than a decade. The 62-year-old Labour MP for Chorley, the only candidate who refused to say how he voted in the 2016 EU referendum, became the 158th Speaker after beating six others in a secret ballot of members. An avuncular Lancastrian, Hoyle has promised to bring calm to a chamber that has seen divisive and bad-tempered debates over the UK\u2019s failed attempts to depart from the European Union. Bercow, who stood down from the crucial position on Thursday, was accused by some Brexit supporters of favouring pro-EU politicians. In a fourth and final round of votes, Hoyle beat his fellow Labour MP Chris Bryant by 325 to 213. In keeping with tradition, fellow MPs Caroline Flint and Nigel Evans \u201cdragged\u201d Hoyle to the Speaker\u2019s chair after the result was announced. Historically, the powerful job on some occasions led to his predecessors\u2019 deaths on the orders of the monarch of the day. In a speech following his victory, Hoyle paid tribute to his daughter, Natalie, who took her own life in 2017, saying she would \u201calways be missed\u201d. Hoyle will take up the role on Tuesday for a single day before parliament dissolves for a general election on 12 December. The Speaker traditionally severs all ties with their political party and stands in their seat unopposed. He is expected to face a demand on Tuesday morning for an urgent question about the government\u2019s failure to publish a report by the intelligence committee on alleged Russian interference in the UK. His reaction would be seen as a litmus test by his critics, one MP said. \u201cHow he reacts will be important. There are concerns that Lindsay won\u2019t have the knowledge or the clout to take on the government. Let\u2019s see how he handles this,\u201d the MP said. Hoyle will return to the chair after the election when he will be also asked to address issues around the bullying and sexual harassment of staff within parliament and threats to the safety of MPs. Before the election, Hoyle was favourite to win, closely followed by his fellow deputy Speakers Eleanor Laing, a Tory, and Labour\u2019s Rosie Winterton. Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman, the current longest continuously serving female MP, was also expected to do well. The other candidates were Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier and the Tory Sir Edward Leigh, the current and former chairs of the public accounts committee, and self-confessed \u201cpolitical nerd\u201d Bryant. In an election presided over by Ken Clarke, the father of the house, Hillier and Leigh were eliminated in the first round, followed by Winterton in the second round when Harman withdrew. Laing, who was hoping to become the second female Speaker after Betty Boothroyd, came last in the third ballot, leaving the field open to Hoyle and Bryant. Hoyle, a twice-married former businessman whose father is the peer and former Labour MP Doug Hoyle, has promised to continue to support backbench causes, which Bercow was often praised for. However, he has promised to do so with \u201chumour and quiet words\u201d instead of adopting his predecessor\u2019s abrasive tone towards \u201cchuntering\u201d MPs and ministers. Some MPs fear Hoyle might not give ministers and the government as tough a time as Bercow. The former Speaker often allowed urgent questions which forced ministers to appear at short notice before MPs. In an acknowledgement that Bercow\u2019s final years had become rancorous, all seven candidates made speeches calling for greater respect and calm within the Commons. Winterton said if she got the job she would \u201cdouse the flames, not pour petrol on them\u201d. Bryant said he would be \u201ca Speaker who is an umpire, not a player.\u201d The eighth and ninth contenders, the Conservative MPs Shailesh Vara and Henry Bellingham, stood down before the ballot after failing to gain enough supporters to win. Bercow departed the Speaker\u2019s chair on 31 October. On Monday, he officially stepped down as an MP and was appointed steward and bailiff of the manor of Northstead. The archaic title is applied when an MP needs to disqualify themselves from the Commons, as parliamentarians are not technically able to resign. Bercow was accusing of scuppering Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal by stopping attempts to hold a third meaningful vote as Tories insisted she had gained enough support. He repeatedly clashed with Boris Johnson and described the decision to suspend parliament in early September \u2013 seen as a move to prevent MPs from questioning the prime minister\u2019s strategy to take the country out of the European Union \u2013 as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. He also denied Johnson a second vote in parliament on the deal he struck with Brussels earlier this month, arguing it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d.",

Downing Street indicated on Monday that it would not allow a 50-page dossier from the intelligence and security committee to be published before the election, prompting a string of complaints over its suppression. The committee\u2019s chairman, Dominic Grieve, called the decision \u201cjaw dropping\u201d, saying no reason for the refusal had been given, while Labour and Scottish National party politicians accused No 10 of refusing to recognise the scale of Russian meddling. Fresh evidence has also emerged of attempts by the Kremlin to infiltrate the Conservatives by a senior Russian diplomat suspected of espionage, who spent five years in London cultivating leading Tories including Johnson himself. It can now be revealed that Sergey Nalobin \u2013 who once described the future prime minister as \u201cour good friend\u201d \u2013 lives in a Moscow apartment block known as the \u201cFSB house\u201d because it houses so many employees from the Kremlin\u2019s main spy agency.

      "body": "<p>White nationalist Richard Spencer, who came to national prominence in the US through his efforts to lend a respectable face to a racist political movement dubbed the \u201calt-right\u201d, has apparently been caught on tape using racist slurs against African Americans and Jewish people.</p> <p>The expletive-laden audio recording was released on Sunday by former Breitbart writer, Milo Yiannopoulos, on YouTube amid deepening in-fighting on the far right.</p> <p>The leaked audio, supposedly recorded in the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the murder of anti-Nazi protester Heather Heyer, appears to feature an angry Spencer ranting against Charlottesville citizens and promising to return to the city for further protests.</p> <p>On the recording, the voice continues: \u201cLittle fucking kikes. They get ruled by people like me. Little fucking octaroons. My ancestors fucking enslaved those little pieces of fucking shit.\u201d</p> <p>Later, he continued, \u201cThose pieces of shit get ruled by people like me. They look up and see a face like mine looking down at them.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer popularized the term \u201calt right\u201d to describe a politics that combined racist white nationalism, isolationism and criticism of mainstream conservatism. Alt Right support for the 2016 Trump campaign, and Spencer\u2019s cultivation of a superficial civility \u2013 largely avoiding crude slurs and the markers of previous neo-Nazi subcultures \u2013 allowed Spencer to gain media coverage and a hearing in some mainstream outlets. As recently as July 2019 Spencer was interviewed on CNN.</p> <p>Presented with a partial transcript by the Guardian, Spencer claimed not to recall making any such remarks, and said he would issue a statement and \u201cget to the bottom of this\u201d on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve listened to it.

      "bodyText": "White nationalist Richard Spencer, who came to national prominence in the US through his efforts to lend a respectable face to a racist political movement dubbed the \u201calt-right\u201d, has apparently been caught on tape using racist slurs against African Americans and Jewish people. The expletive-laden audio recording was released on Sunday by former Breitbart writer, Milo Yiannopoulos, on YouTube amid deepening in-fighting on the far right. The leaked audio, supposedly recorded in the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the murder of anti-Nazi protester Heather Heyer, appears to feature an angry Spencer ranting against Charlottesville citizens and promising to return to the city for further protests. On the recording, the voice continues: \u201cLittle fucking kikes. They get ruled by people like me. Little fucking octaroons. My ancestors fucking enslaved those little pieces of fucking shit.\u201d Later, he continued, \u201cThose pieces of shit get ruled by people like me. They look up and see a face like mine looking down at them.\u201d Spencer popularized the term \u201calt right\u201d to describe a politics that combined racist white nationalism, isolationism and criticism of mainstream conservatism. Alt Right support for the 2016 Trump campaign, and Spencer\u2019s cultivation of a superficial civility \u2013 largely avoiding crude slurs and the markers of previous neo-Nazi subcultures \u2013 allowed Spencer to gain media coverage and a hearing in some mainstream outlets. As recently as July 2019 Spencer was interviewed on CNN. Presented with a partial transcript by the Guardian, Spencer claimed not to recall making any such remarks, and said he would issue a statement and \u201cget to the bottom of this\u201d on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to it. I\u2019ll be responding today in video form this afternoon. I\u2019m responding on my own. Not through the press,\u201d he said via text. He declined to deny that the voice in the video was his. Spencer also later tweeted a link to a rightwing video titled: Never Apologise. Asked how he came by the recording, Yiannopoulos said via email that: \u201cIt was recorded by someone whose identity I have verified, and who I have placed where/when they said they recorded it. A second witness remembers the rant and remembers that person being present, and three others who have known Spencer for years confirm the voice is unmistakably his.\u201d Asked if the Guardian could be put in touch with his sources to confirm this information, Yiannopoulos said: \u201cI\u2019m not inclined to go out of my way for a publication that lies so outrageously and so often about me and so many of my friends.\u201d Last year, the Guardian reported that Yiannopoulos was some $2m in debt. Unlike Spencer, who still has a Twitter account, Yiannopoulos has been deplatformed from many social media services. But on his channel on the messaging service, Telegram, Yiannopoulos repeated his claims about sourcing, and added: \u201cI have always publicly hated Spencer, and he has always publicly hated me.\u201d The recording, released on YouTube, is prefaced with an extract from a recent interview in which Spencer criticizes white nationalist YouTuber, Nick Fuentes.

      "body": "<p>It will probably come as a surprise to Maurizio Sarri to learn that Chelsea\u2019s fans have chants in celebration of Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic these days. That never happened during the Italian\u2019s solitary year at Stamford Bridge. Jorginho was often written off as everything wrong with Sarriball and there was little excitement when Chelsea made Kovacic\u2019s loan from Real Madrid permanent last summer.</p> <p>Kovacic was a bland presence last season. The midfielder\u2019s passing was too safe, he offered nothing in the way of a goal threat and he often looked choked on the left of Sarri\u2019s midfield three. Everything was too predictable and it hardly helped that the Croat seemed to be in a job-share with Ross Barkley. No substitution was more predictable than Barkley for Kovacic. Other, that is, than Kovacic for Barkley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/watford-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic help Chelsea see off winless Watford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It made for a monotonous trudge but Jorginho and Kovacic have both been liberated since Frank Lampard\u2019s appointment by Chelsea, who can take a big step towards the last 16 of the Champions League by beating Ajax at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening. The pair have stepped up in the absence of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who is back in the squad after shaking off a groin injury, and combined beautifully during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/watford-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-1 victory at Watford</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>Their crisp, inventive passing was a joy to behold, they matched Watford in the physical duels and, as a measure of how the mood has changed under Lampard, nothing sums it up better than Jorginho and Kovacic being serenaded by Chelsea\u2019s away support on a wet November evening in Hertfordshire.</p> <p>Lampard must have enjoyed those chants at Vicarage Road. He has urged Jorginho and Kovacic to take more risks and was delighted when the former conjured a stunning assist for Tammy Abraham\u2019s opener on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for them to be quite fluid,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cI also want them to be positive in their play and play forward passes, go by people if that\u2019s one of your attributes, as Mateo has, to travel with the ball at pace.\u201d</p> <p>Jorginho and Kovacic were vital to Chelsea maintaining their poise on the ball when they were under relentless pressure during the early stages of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/23/ajax-chelsea-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 victory over Ajax </a>in Amsterdam two weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important in how I want the team to play,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cWe are trying to be fluid in our movement of the ball and, of course, that really does mean moving in through central areas a lot. You\u2019ve got to be able to take balls in tight area.</p> <p>\u201cYou should be willing to accept the ball and be comfortable to at this level of football. Look at the first game against Ajax, the pace and speed of the game. If you are not ready to accept it, then it will find you out very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Chelsea have coped surprisingly well with Kant\u00e9\u2019s fitness problems this season. The French midfielder has been out for a month and Lampard is desperate to have him available on a regular basis. Yet with Kant\u00e9 out for the first Ajax game, Jorginho and Kovacic found the tactical discipline to frustrate the dangerous Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek.</p> <p>They are intelligent players, smart positionally and with their distribution, and they have played a part in Chelsea\u2019s recent defensive improvement in open play.</p> <p>Jorginho, who will serve a one-match ban when Crystal Palace visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday, has emerged as a popular leader and Kovacic looks settled now he is no longer at the club on loan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/chelsea-20-november-hearing-appeal-fifa-transfer-ban\">Lampard hints at recruitment pending appeal of Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nobody questions what Kovacic does now. Instead, it has become clear why the 24-year-old is a former Internazionale and Madrid player and part of the Croatia side that reached the 2018 World Cup final. He knows what to do in midfield and his smooth understanding with Jorginho has given Mason Mount the freedom to support the forwards.</p> <p>\u201cThey have been brilliant,\u201d Mount said. \u201cYou can see how they have been performing recently, keeping the team together, keeping the ball moving and that is what we need. Players like that keep us ticking, and when we get higher up the pitch we are the ones who need to put the ball in the back of the net. They keep us so strong together.\u201d</p> <p>That strength will be tested again by Ajax, even though Erik ten Hag\u2019s side could be without Edson \u00c1lvarez, Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Van de Beek. The Dutch champions, having beaten Feyenoord 4-0 and PEC Zwolle 4-2 since losing to Chelsea two weeks ago, are top and unbeaten in the Eredivisie and will pose problems in attack.</p> <p>Yet Chelsea will back themselves. The mood is light and Lampard is not even fretting about how to fit Kant\u00e9 into the starting lineup. He wants competition for places in every position and Jorginho and Kovacic have given him what he calls \u201ca nice problem\u201d. They have come a long way since last season\u2019s travails.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It will probably come as a surprise to Maurizio Sarri to learn that Chelsea\u2019s fans have chants in celebration of Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic these days. That never happened during the Italian\u2019s solitary year at Stamford Bridge. Jorginho was often written off as everything wrong with Sarriball and there was little excitement when Chelsea made Kovacic\u2019s loan from Real Madrid permanent last summer. Kovacic was a bland presence last season. The midfielder\u2019s passing was too safe, he offered nothing in the way of a goal threat and he often looked choked on the left of Sarri\u2019s midfield three. Everything was too predictable and it hardly helped that the Croat seemed to be in a job-share with Ross Barkley. No substitution was more predictable than Barkley for Kovacic. Other, that is, than Kovacic for Barkley. It made for a monotonous trudge but Jorginho and Kovacic have both been liberated since Frank Lampard\u2019s appointment by Chelsea, who can take a big step towards the last 16 of the Champions League by beating Ajax at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening. The pair have stepped up in the absence of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who is back in the squad after shaking off a groin injury, and combined beautifully during the 2-1 victory at Watford on Saturday. Their crisp, inventive passing was a joy to behold, they matched Watford in the physical duels and, as a measure of how the mood has changed under Lampard, nothing sums it up better than Jorginho and Kovacic being serenaded by Chelsea\u2019s away support on a wet November evening in Hertfordshire. Lampard must have enjoyed those chants at Vicarage Road. He has urged Jorginho and Kovacic to take more risks and was delighted when the former conjured a stunning assist for Tammy Abraham\u2019s opener on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for them to be quite fluid,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cI also want them to be positive in their play and play forward passes, go by people if that\u2019s one of your attributes, as Mateo has, to travel with the ball at pace.\u201d Jorginho and Kovacic were vital to Chelsea maintaining their poise on the ball when they were under relentless pressure during the early stages of their 1-0 victory over Ajax in Amsterdam two weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important in how I want the team to play,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cWe are trying to be fluid in our movement of the ball and, of course, that really does mean moving in through central areas a lot. You\u2019ve got to be able to take balls in tight area. \u201cYou should be willing to accept the ball and be comfortable to at this level of football. Look at the first game against Ajax, the pace and speed of the game. If you are not ready to accept it, then it will find you out very quickly.\u201d Chelsea have coped surprisingly well with Kant\u00e9\u2019s fitness problems this season. The French midfielder has been out for a month and Lampard is desperate to have him available on a regular basis. Yet with Kant\u00e9 out for the first Ajax game, Jorginho and Kovacic found the tactical discipline to frustrate the dangerous Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek. They are intelligent players, smart positionally and with their distribution, and they have played a part in Chelsea\u2019s recent defensive improvement in open play. Jorginho, who will serve a one-match ban when Crystal Palace visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday, has emerged as a popular leader and Kovacic looks settled now he is no longer at the club on loan. Nobody questions what Kovacic does now. Instead, it has become clear why the 24-year-old is a former Internazionale and Madrid player and part of the Croatia side that reached the 2018 World Cup final. He knows what to do in midfield and his smooth understanding with Jorginho has given Mason Mount the freedom to support the forwards. \u201cThey have been brilliant,\u201d Mount said. \u201cYou can see how they have been performing recently, keeping the team together, keeping the ball moving and that is what we need. Players like that keep us ticking, and when we get higher up the pitch we are the ones who need to put the ball in the back of the net. They keep us so strong together.\u201d That strength will be tested again by Ajax, even though Erik ten Hag\u2019s side could be without Edson \u00c1lvarez, Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Van de Beek. The Dutch champions, having beaten Feyenoord 4-0 and PEC Zwolle 4-2 since losing to Chelsea two weeks ago, are top and unbeaten in the Eredivisie and will pose problems in attack. Yet Chelsea will back themselves. The mood is light and Lampard is not even fretting about how to fit Kant\u00e9 into the starting lineup. He wants competition for places in every position and Jorginho and Kovacic have given him what he calls \u201ca nice problem\u201d. They have come a long way since last season\u2019s travails.",

The US has condemned Chinese \u201cintimidation\u201d in the South China Sea, alleging it has bullied smaller south-east Asian nations by militarising the resource-rich waters and seeking to control the global trade route. Greek police have found 41 people alive in a refrigerated truck. At least a third had developed breathing problems and seven were taken to a nearby hospital with respiratory problems. Recommended reads Lucy Clark has drawn back the curtain on Helen Garner\u2019s mind. \u201cMarry the forbidden, voyeuristic pleasure of reading a person\u2019s diaries with the well-known predilections of a writer like Garner, whose reputation for unflinching self-interrogation precedes her, and the anticipation is almost too much,\u201d she writes for Guardian Australia\u2019s The Unmissables. \u201cIs it safe to go in? Do you really want to see the things you will find here?\u201d The past year has been the worst for Australian retail since the 1990 recession, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cIt is clear the tax cuts and interest rate cuts alone are not enough. The latest retail figures are yet more evidence that if the Morrison government wants to have any economic credibility, the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook to be released next month must contain some fiscal stimulus measures. And really, given the state of the economy, the government shouldn\u2019t even wait that long.\u201d Listen At a BBC editorial meeting in the 80s, managers discussed how to approach the subject of David Attenborough\u2019s retirement. How would they replace the presenter who had become synonymous with their natural history programs but who was now in his 60s? They never found an answer and Attenborough has proved irreplaceable. On Today in Focus, The Guardian\u2019s Patrick Barkham speaks to David Attenborough before his major new series Seven Worlds, One Planet, and tells Anushka Asthana how he became such a cherished figure. Sport Lewis Hamilton\u2019s hunger for success is still nowhere near sated, even after passing Juan Manuel Fangio to become second in the all-time rankings, one shy of Michael Schumacher\u2019s seven titles. Hamilton will celebrate his 35th birthday in January then set his sights on matching the German\u2019s record. It\u2019s time for the all-important Guardian Rugby World Cup awards. From Japan\u2019s Michael Leitch and England\u2019s win over the All Blacks to TJ Perenara\u2019s try of the tournament, the Guardian\u2019s rugby experts deliver their verdicts. Media roundup Australia has joined the world\u2019s largest trade pact, with 15 countries agreeing to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, reports the Australian. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is planning to sue Google, according to the Australian Financial Review. And a list of buildings across NSW potentially clad in flammable material totals 444, but will be kept secret from the public, the Sydney Morning Herald reveals. Coming up It\u2019s the first Tuesday in November and that means it\u2019s time for the race that stops \u2013 and divides \u2013 a nation to take place at Flemington. The Reserve Bank will hold its monthly board meeting to decide on the cash rate. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 In the basement food halls of Japan\u2019s ritzy department stores you\u2019ll find some of the world\u2019s most expensive fruit \u2013 single melon can sell for upwards of 15,000 yen (about A$200) and a bunch of 15 or so grapes for 8,000 \u2013 writes Adam Liaw.

MPs from the cross-party group on gambling-related harm, who joined the successful campaign to cut stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) to \u00a32, recommended the same limit be applied to web-based slot machine games. The MPs, who include the former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith, are understood to be hopeful they can convince policymakers in No 10 to include tighter controls on gambling firms in the party\u2019s general election manifesto. Labour has already backed much tougher regulation of the gambling industry, indicating that its wings could be clipped regardless of the outcome of the election. If the proposals were adopted, it would threaten online casinos\u2019 take from slot-machine players, which accounts for more than a third of their income according to the Gambling Commission, the industry regulator. The \u00a32bn figure would rise to \u00a32.9bn if the limits were to include other casino games such as roulette, which was available at \u00a3100 a spin in high street bookmakers before the government agreed to rein in the machines after a campaign that united politicians and campaigners across the political spectrum.

Your call for a complete overhaul of the system is welcome, but it needs to be based on a rethink about the needs and rights of children. It would be counterproductive to put more resources into the youth offending industry when it is rotten at its heart. The problem is both structural and moral. Youth offending teams, youth courts and child jails have all contributed to a system that fails \u2013 and in some cases abuses \u2013 children.</p> <p>The dramatic fall in the number of children being arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated is welcome, and the Howard League has been working with the police for a decade to stem the flow of children into the toxic criminal justice system. A two-thirds cut to child arrests has reduced child imprisonment. But still too many children who have complex needs are pushed through a system totally unfit to respond to their behaviour.</p> <p>A new government has an opportunity to do things differently. I call on all political parties to work with the Howard League and base their policies on evidence. Children deserve better than they are getting now, as do victims and taxpayers.<br><strong>Frances Crook</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Howard League for Penal Reform</em></p> <p>\u2022 The youth courts have been falling short of supporting children for many years (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/03/children-in-handcuffs-month-reporting-from-youth-court\" title=\"\">A month in court: The young defendants behind bulletproof glass</a>, 4 November) despite repeated government attempts to reform the youth justice system. As the only charity with a legal aid contract to represent children in the criminal courts, we see daily how the justice system continually fails to resolve the behaviours of children with complex health and social problems.</p> <p>Unrecognised mental illness is common; so too are learning difficulties and disabilities, as well as long-term trauma and neglect due to being raised by parents who themselves haven\u2019t been given the support they desperately need. Failure to recognise and meet their needs often leaves children vulnerable to exploitation, all too easily falling into a current of crime from which it is difficult to escape.</p> <p>The shortcomings in the crown court are just as bad, with a regular failure to make child-friendly adjustments such as providing intermediaries. Children are left bewildered and confused, unable to understand what is happening, feeling no sense of justice.

      "bodyText": "Well done on your expose of the so-called youth justice system (Children suffer in \u2018chaotic\u2019 justice system, 4 November). Your call for a complete overhaul of the system is welcome, but it needs to be based on a rethink about the needs and rights of children. It would be counterproductive to put more resources into the youth offending industry when it is rotten at its heart. The problem is both structural and moral. Youth offending teams, youth courts and child jails have all contributed to a system that fails \u2013 and in some cases abuses \u2013 children. The dramatic fall in the number of children being arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated is welcome, and the Howard League has been working with the police for a decade to stem the flow of children into the toxic criminal justice system. A two-thirds cut to child arrests has reduced child imprisonment. But still too many children who have complex needs are pushed through a system totally unfit to respond to their behaviour. A new government has an opportunity to do things differently. I call on all political parties to work with the Howard League and base their policies on evidence. Children deserve better than they are getting now, as do victims and taxpayers. Frances Crook Chief executive, Howard League for Penal Reform \u2022 The youth courts have been falling short of supporting children for many years (A month in court: The young defendants behind bulletproof glass, 4 November) despite repeated government attempts to reform the youth justice system. As the only charity with a legal aid contract to represent children in the criminal courts, we see daily how the justice system continually fails to resolve the behaviours of children with complex health and social problems. Unrecognised mental illness is common; so too are learning difficulties and disabilities, as well as long-term trauma and neglect due to being raised by parents who themselves haven\u2019t been given the support they desperately need. Failure to recognise and meet their needs often leaves children vulnerable to exploitation, all too easily falling into a current of crime from which it is difficult to escape. The shortcomings in the crown court are just as bad, with a regular failure to make child-friendly adjustments such as providing intermediaries. Children are left bewildered and confused, unable to understand what is happening, feeling no sense of justice. What\u2019s more, the lawyers who represent children in both the youth and crown courts often have little specialist knowledge of the youth justice system or the competencies needed to work with vulnerable children. In no other area of the public realm would professionals who have no required training be working with them. It\u2019s one aspect of a broken system that needs urgent attention. More fundamentally we need a radical rethink of how the state responds to children who break the law. The system needs to recognise these children as deeply troubled rather than simply troublesome. Enver Solomon CEO, Just for Kids Law \u2022 I read with sadness and angry recognition your article about the crisis in children\u2019s criminal justice (Cost-cutting: Long delays after court closures, 4 November).

      "bodyText": "Goodbye to this most remarkable of parliaments, dissolving all too aptly on Guy Fawkes night. For all the extremes of abuse hurled at them, it has harboured the bravest and best MPs, who have broken ranks to defend the country against a Brexit disaster, putting conscience and honour before party, tribe or personal career. This departing Commons should be remembered as the parliament of conscience. These MPs were fortunate in a Speaker who rose to the great constitutional crisis with the vision and effrontery to break traditions, to protect parliament\u2019s sovereignty against an overreaching executive. With no Commons majority, Theresa May and Boris Johnson summoned unprecedented Henry VIII powers to try to sneak in shedloads of crucial legislation by statutory instrument, without votes. If taking back control was the purpose of Brexit, John Bercow seized it on behalf of citizens. Traditionally, people say they want MPs to speak their minds, not blindly follow party whips. Look how many MPs broke free. May lost an unheard-of 33 votes in the Commons, Johnson has already lost 12. In ministerial resignations, 36 walked out on May \u2013 including Johnson, who has already lost two. Even more momentous, an unprecedented 89 MPs left their parties, voluntarily or ejected. Johnson the autocrat purged 21 of his moderate MPs, including distinguished ex-chancellors and brightest sparks, causing most of their One Nation club to stand down tomorrow. Remember that purge whenever Johnson poses as a one-nationer. This parliament, says Gavin Freeguard of the Institute for Government, has seen its greatest cracking of the parties: only 28 Labour MPs split to form the SDP in 1981. If Change UK defectors were disappointed that their defections didn\u2019t set off a system-breaking avalanche, their insignificance did act as a deterrent: our abominable first-past-the-post system grinds up most who dare leave the rigid bondage of the two-and-half main English parties.

The decision has been criticised amid a tricky period for his new party.</p> \n<p>Formally launched in January amid the deadlock of Theresa May\u2019s premiership, the Brexit party took more than 30% of the vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/nigel-farage-brexit-party-win-big-wake-up-call-westminster\">in May\u2019s European </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/nigel-farage-brexit-party-win-big-wake-up-call-westminster\">elections</a>. But it has since slipped to as low as 10% in some polls, albeit with most showing it nearer 15%.</p> \n<p>After speculation that the party could field only a couple of dozen candidates in Labour leave seats, Farage instead said it would contest every seat outside Northern Ireland, following the Conservatives\u2019 dismissal of a pact based on pushing for a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fb78af15-bde8-4aae-9ff3-9e19e4242d4a\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(June 9, 1994)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Eastleigh</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Came fourth in a by-election for Ukip with 952 votes, edging out the Monster Raving Loony Party candidate who got 783.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(May 1, 1997)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Salisbury</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Came fourth for Ukip in the general election with 3,332 votes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(June 7, 2001)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Bexhill and Battle </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Came fourth of four candidates in the general election, with 3,474 votes for Ukip.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(May 5, 2005)</i>&nbsp;<strong> South Thanet</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In his first attempt to be elected in South Thanet, Farage secured 2,079 votes for Ukip.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(June 29, 2006)</i>&nbsp;<strong> Bromley and Chislehurst</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Following the death of Conservative MP Eric Forth, Farage contested the seat in the by-election.

They\u2019re not standing down, are they?\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are physically here today to sign their nomination papers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if a pact with the Tories was dead, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I have to take the attitude that I\u2019ve tried like crazy over week after week to put together a leave alliance that would win a huge majority, and all I get is abuse back. So in the end you begin to think \u2013 what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p> \n<p>But Farage said he felt the party\u2019s best chance would be in Labour-held seats in places like the Midlands, Wales and northern England, where an electorate who voted predominantly for Brexit in 2016 were represented by a pro-remain MP.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you go out to these Labour constituencies that voted leave and are now represented by remainer MPs there\u2019s more anger there about the lack of representation than in any other part of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no doubt about that after travelling round the country these last few months.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d3750423d7296daa5ef03be7296e09ad180775f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d3750423d7296daa5ef03be7296e09ad180775f/0_76_5081_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brexit party candidates pose with Farage and the party chairman, Richard Tice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brexit party candidates pose with Farage and the party chairman, Richard Tice.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The event was at once a media launch, a bonding and briefing session for candidates, and a logistical hub for processing would-be MPs.</p> \n<p>After Farage spoke, journalists were cleared from the hall in Westminster so candidates could be addressed privately on strategy by the party\u2019s head of media, and by the former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe, now a Brexit party MEP.</p> \n<p>In another room, officials had a table of nomination papers for candidates to fill in and sign. Nearby was a photographer with lights and a white backdrop to take official party photos. Candidates held a piece of paper showing their name and party number, so they could be correctly identified later.</p> \n<p>In a preview of the attack lines Farage will use during the campaign, he condemned Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal as a barely improved version of that agreed by May, which he called \u201ca document that you would only have signed if you were beaten in war\u201d.</p> \n<p>Referring to the Conservative catchphrase \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, Farage said: \u201cNow that is a very tempting slogan on a public who, after three and a half years of this process, have in many cases just about had enough. But the problem is, it doesn\u2019t get Brexit done. All it does is take us into another three years of agonising negotiations.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the new candidates, Inaya Folarin Iman, conceded after the speech that she faced an uphill task unseating Labour\u2019s Fabian Hamilton in Leeds North East, where in 2017 he won almost 50% of the votes.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cEven if I may not necessarily win that seat, I\u2019ve had so many people on the doorstep thanking me for standing, just so we can have a broader conversation, and not this typical two-party binary, when it\u2019s the lesser of two evils. Me standing gives people a choice.\u201d</p> \n<p>The broadcaster LBC confirmed on Monday that Farage will not host his five days a week radio show on the station during the general election campaign, in order to comply with Ofcom rules on impartiality for the election period.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is the Brexit party strategy?</strong></h2> \n<p>Farage is perfectly open about the fact that in an ideal world, the vast majority of the hundreds of keen, bright-eyed Brexit party candidates packed into a hall on Monday would have been stood down without a battle.</p> \n<p>The party leader\u2019s first choice was a pact with the Conservatives, under which he would focus the significant resources of his new organisation on 20 or so Labour-held seats with considerable pro-leave populations.</p> \n<p>Of course, the price of such a pact was one Johnson was never going to accept \u2013 dumping the PM\u2019s cherished Brexit plan for a commitment to a no-deal departure. While Farage claims this joint platform would deliver a \u201cmassive majority\u201d to Johnson, it would push the Tories into relying on the hardest of core Brexit voters.</p> \n<p>So does the decision to field 600-plus candidates automatically harm Johnson\u2019s cause by splitting the pro-Brexit vote? The answer could be yes and no.</p> \n<p>The textbook example of how the Conservatives could be adversely affected came in June\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/07/peterborough-byelection-result-labour-sees-off-brexit-party-threat-to-hold-seat\">Peterborough byelection</a>, where Labour retained a seat in a largely pro-Brexit area by 683 votes \u2013 and the Brexit party and Tories won more than 17,000 votes between them, compared with Labour\u2019s 10,484.</p> \n<p>But the picture is more complex. The Tory peer and psephologist Lord Hayward argues that in the sorts of northern, Midland and Welsh seats targeted by Farage, long-time Labour voters would generally \u201crather die in a ditch than vote Tory\u201d, but would be less tribal in switching their vote to the Brexit party.</p> \n<p>In his launch speech, Farage gleefully referred to what he said were 5 million Labour leave voters ripe for stealing.</p> \n<p>There are two caveats to this. One is that the real number of Labour leave voters is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48039984\">probably closer to 3 million or 4 million</a>. The other is that a number of them already stopped supporting Labour in the 2017 election.</p> \n<p>Where will it all end? What impact will the Brexit party have? As with so much connected to the election, it is almost impossible to know. But what seems clear is that Farage will relish the idea of wreaking chaos on both main parties.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage has committed the Brexit party to standing more than 600 candidates in the general election, dismissing Conservative warnings that this could split the pro-leave vote as \u201cconceited arrogance\u201d. At a lavish campaign launch in central London, at which hundreds of new parliamentary candidates were paraded before the media, the party leader insisted he mainly hoped to take votes \u2013 and potentially seats \u2013 in strongly pro-leave Labour areas. \u201cI think the Labour seats offer our best opportunity,\u201d he said. Farage will not stand for election, in what would have been his eighth attempt to win a Westminster seat. The decision has been criticised amid a tricky period for his new party. Formally launched in January amid the deadlock of Theresa May\u2019s premiership, the Brexit party took more than 30% of the vote in May\u2019s European elections. But it has since slipped to as low as 10% in some polls, albeit with most showing it nearer 15%. After speculation that the party could field only a couple of dozen candidates in Labour leave seats, Farage instead said it would contest every seat outside Northern Ireland, following the Conservatives\u2019 dismissal of a pact based on pushing for a no-deal Brexit. Addressing the noisy crowd of candidates at the launch event, Farage condemned calls from pro-leave Tories including Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg that the party should stand down to avoid allowing Labour into power. Rees-Mogg had suggested the Brexit party \u201cstand aside and leave it to the Conservatives\u201d, Farage said, adding: \u201cWhat kind of conceited arrogance is this?\u201d Farage later confirmed the party would compete for every seat. \u201cDid you see those people in the room. They\u2019re not standing down, are they?\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are physically here today to sign their nomination papers.\u201d Asked if a pact with the Tories was dead, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I have to take the attitude that I\u2019ve tried like crazy over week after week to put together a leave alliance that would win a huge majority, and all I get is abuse back. So in the end you begin to think \u2013 what\u2019s the point?\u201d But Farage said he felt the party\u2019s best chance would be in Labour-held seats in places like the Midlands, Wales and northern England, where an electorate who voted predominantly for Brexit in 2016 were represented by a pro-remain MP. \u201cWhen you go out to these Labour constituencies that voted leave and are now represented by remainer MPs there\u2019s more anger there about the lack of representation than in any other part of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no doubt about that after travelling round the country these last few months.\u201d The event was at once a media launch, a bonding and briefing session for candidates, and a logistical hub for processing would-be MPs. After Farage spoke, journalists were cleared from the hall in Westminster so candidates could be addressed privately on strategy by the party\u2019s head of media, and by the former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe, now a Brexit party MEP. In another room, officials had a table of nomination papers for candidates to fill in and sign. Nearby was a photographer with lights and a white backdrop to take official party photos. Candidates held a piece of paper showing their name and party number, so they could be correctly identified later. In a preview of the attack lines Farage will use during the campaign, he condemned Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal as a barely improved version of that agreed by May, which he called \u201ca document that you would only have signed if you were beaten in war\u201d. Referring to the Conservative catchphrase \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, Farage said: \u201cNow that is a very tempting slogan on a public who, after three and a half years of this process, have in many cases just about had enough. But the problem is, it doesn\u2019t get Brexit done. All it does is take us into another three years of agonising negotiations.\u201d One of the new candidates, Inaya Folarin Iman, conceded after the speech that she faced an uphill task unseating Labour\u2019s Fabian Hamilton in Leeds North East, where in 2017 he won almost 50% of the votes. She said: \u201cEven if I may not necessarily win that seat, I\u2019ve had so many people on the doorstep thanking me for standing, just so we can have a broader conversation, and not this typical two-party binary, when it\u2019s the lesser of two evils. Me standing gives people a choice.\u201d The broadcaster LBC confirmed on Monday that Farage will not host his five days a week radio show on the station during the general election campaign, in order to comply with Ofcom rules on impartiality for the election period. What is the Brexit party strategy? Farage is perfectly open about the fact that in an ideal world, the vast majority of the hundreds of keen, bright-eyed Brexit party candidates packed into a hall on Monday would have been stood down without a battle. The party leader\u2019s first choice was a pact with the Conservatives, under which he would focus the significant resources of his new organisation on 20 or so Labour-held seats with considerable pro-leave populations. Of course, the price of such a pact was one Johnson was never going to accept \u2013 dumping the PM\u2019s cherished Brexit plan for a commitment to a no-deal departure. While Farage claims this joint platform would deliver a \u201cmassive majority\u201d to Johnson, it would push the Tories into relying on the hardest of core Brexit voters. So does the decision to field 600-plus candidates automatically harm Johnson\u2019s cause by splitting the pro-Brexit vote? The answer could be yes and no. The textbook example of how the Conservatives could be adversely affected came in June\u2019s Peterborough byelection, where Labour retained a seat in a largely pro-Brexit area by 683 votes \u2013 and the Brexit party and Tories won more than 17,000 votes between them, compared with Labour\u2019s 10,484. But the picture is more complex. The Tory peer and psephologist Lord Hayward argues that in the sorts of northern, Midland and Welsh seats targeted by Farage, long-time Labour voters would generally \u201crather die in a ditch than vote Tory\u201d, but would be less tribal in switching their vote to the Brexit party. In his launch speech, Farage gleefully referred to what he said were 5 million Labour leave voters ripe for stealing. There are two caveats to this. One is that the real number of Labour leave voters is probably closer to 3 million or 4 million. The other is that a number of them already stopped supporting Labour in the 2017 election. Where will it all end? What impact will the Brexit party have? As with so much connected to the election, it is almost impossible to know. But what seems clear is that Farage will relish the idea of wreaking chaos on both main parties.",

He sounded like a bemused lottery winner still attempting to compute how much his life had just changed.</p> <p>The heartfelt roar from the entire South Africa squad when Rassie Erasmus was announced as the world coach of the year was equally endearing. As Erasmus admitted, the team did not arrive in Japan necessarily expecting a successful outcome; in his view three key things \u2013 hard work, luck and destiny \u2013 propelled them to victory. His squad, he said, did not just want to boost their country\u2019s spirits, they felt an absolute responsibility to do so. To paint their triumph merely as a nice rugby story ignores the inspirational bigger picture surrounding it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/04/rugby-world-cup-2019-best-player-best-match-our-verdicts\">Rugby World Cup awards: the best player, the best match \u2013 our verdicts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was no ordinary World Cup either. In years to come it might even be seen as the moment rugby union glimpsed a different, more fulfilling future for itself. Up to now \u2013 professional era or not \u2013 the game has had a tendency to stare more at its own navel than gaze up at the stars. The first World Cup to be staged in Asia \u2013 and what a welcoming host Japan proved to be \u2013 has altered all that. Far from saying <em>sayonara</em> to their supposed betters and reverting to bit-part status, there is already talk of the Japanese being keen to bid again for a tournament that, according to World Rugby, benefitted the local economy by \u00a33.1bn.</p> <p>Television audiences have also smashed all local records \u2013 even beating what one executive has confessed were artificially high old figures \u2013 and conservative estimates suggest 10 million people in Japan are now looking to watch more rugby, either live or on television. That instantly puts it among the sport\u2019s biggest markets and ensures the Japanese Rugby Football Union (JRFU) will not be short of new friends or suitors, particularly as the private equity firm CVC will be looking for swift returns from its soon-to-be-announced, multimillion pound investment in international rugby.</p> <p>All this comes at a time when, as well as Japan\u2019s possible admission to the Rugby Championship, other fresh frontiers are being examined. In the buildup to France staging the 2023 World Cup \u2013 and its organisers are already visibly excited about the possibilities \u2013 World Rugby intends to announce simultaneously the venues for both the next two tournaments.

      "bodyText": "On stage at the World Rugby awards ceremony on Sunday evening the extraordinary Siya Kolisi was asked what kind of public reaction he and his team were expecting on their return to South Africa. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d replied the Springbok captain, a note of uncertainty in his voice. He sounded like a bemused lottery winner still attempting to compute how much his life had just changed. The heartfelt roar from the entire South Africa squad when Rassie Erasmus was announced as the world coach of the year was equally endearing. As Erasmus admitted, the team did not arrive in Japan necessarily expecting a successful outcome; in his view three key things \u2013 hard work, luck and destiny \u2013 propelled them to victory. His squad, he said, did not just want to boost their country\u2019s spirits, they felt an absolute responsibility to do so. To paint their triumph merely as a nice rugby story ignores the inspirational bigger picture surrounding it. This was no ordinary World Cup either. In years to come it might even be seen as the moment rugby union glimpsed a different, more fulfilling future for itself. Up to now \u2013 professional era or not \u2013 the game has had a tendency to stare more at its own navel than gaze up at the stars. The first World Cup to be staged in Asia \u2013 and what a welcoming host Japan proved to be \u2013 has altered all that. Far from saying sayonara to their supposed betters and reverting to bit-part status, there is already talk of the Japanese being keen to bid again for a tournament that, according to World Rugby, benefitted the local economy by \u00a33.1bn. Television audiences have also smashed all local records \u2013 even beating what one executive has confessed were artificially high old figures \u2013 and conservative estimates suggest 10 million people in Japan are now looking to watch more rugby, either live or on television. That instantly puts it among the sport\u2019s biggest markets and ensures the Japanese Rugby Football Union (JRFU) will not be short of new friends or suitors, particularly as the private equity firm CVC will be looking for swift returns from its soon-to-be-announced, multimillion pound investment in international rugby. All this comes at a time when, as well as Japan\u2019s possible admission to the Rugby Championship, other fresh frontiers are being examined. In the buildup to France staging the 2023 World Cup \u2013 and its organisers are already visibly excited about the possibilities \u2013 World Rugby intends to announce simultaneously the venues for both the next two tournaments. The process is continuing but do not be too surprised if South Africa \u2013 outflanked at the last minute of the 2023 vote by France \u2013 win hosting rights for 2027 with the US to follow in 2031, by which time England\u2019s Tom Curry will only be a sprightly 33. Already the organisers of next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo expect interest in rugby sevens to soar even higher, despite the anticipated high temperatures that will require games to be played in the early morning and late afternoon. They also report sports fans in Japan have particularly loved the family-friendly, fun-loving ethos of rugby crowds, as well as being energised by the dazzling performances by their own team. Not everything in the garden is rosy \u2013 the JRFU still has much work to do in terms of giving more youngsters exposure to good rugby at school and youth level \u2013 but it was also instructive to hear the world female sevens player of the year, New Zealand\u2019s Ruby Tui, discussing her specialist area of the game. \u201cWhether you like watching women\u2019s rugby or not, sevens is growing at an insane rate,\u201d said Tui, who has herself had to overcome significant adversity to reach the top. There are plenty of excellent female role models out there, as the 2021 women\u2019s World Cup will underline. It is the same with the men. Michael Leitch, Alun Wyn Jones, Kieran Read, Kolisi \u2026 if rugby is to be judged by the inspirational leaders shaping the values and attitudes of the next generation, it is in decent shape.

The potential implications are tantalising: if injury rates can be reduced across the world and smaller players enjoy a renaissance \u2013 it was a pity in that regard that the diminutive Cheslin Kolbe did not pip his hulking teammate Pieter-Steph du Toit to the world player of the year award \u2013 the game\u2019s custodians could have all their ducks in a row as they continue to enhance player welfare.

Cuadrilla has said it would provide the oil and gas regulator with new data to address the concerns of communities near active fracking sites so the suspension of its operations can be lifted. The company said it would continue to make the case for fracking after a government U-turn last week sounded a potential death knell for the industry by halting fracking in England because of concerns about earthquakes. Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking has led to a number of tremors near its Preston New Road site in Lancashire, including a 2.9-magnitude quake in August. It was forced to stop work at the site just weeks before the licence was due to expire at the end of this month, and will not be allowed to apply for an extension. The government said ministers would not approve any new fracking permits after a report found that it was impossible to accurately predict the severity of any future seismic activity. The business and energy secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said the moratorium was based on current scientific information, and that it would remain in place \u201cuntil compelling new evidence is provided\u201d to allay concerns. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, described the decision as an election stunt. \u201cI think it sounds like fracking would come back on 13 December if they were elected back into office,\u201d he said on Saturday. Cuadrilla said it would review the report in detail, and would work with the Oil and Gas Authority so that its Bowland Shale reserves could be appraised and developed. The company is understood to have spent about \u00a3200m trying to lead a British shale gas revolution to rival the US, but has yet to produce any commercial gas. Its work in Lancashire has been slowed by tough government safety regulation which forces workers to down tools if the fracking causes tremorsgreater than magnitude 0.5. The process of extracting gas from shale formations beneath the earth\u2019s surface by hydraulic fracturing involves pumping in a mix of chemicals and sand to break up the rock and release the gas. Green groups welcomed the decision to halt fracking as a \u201cvictory for common sense\u201d, based on their concerns that it could contaminate underground water sources and will contribute to global heating. It is a blow to companies including the chemicals giant Ineos, which have spent hundreds of millions of pounds developing fracking sites with capital from their investors.

He said Traill \u201cconsciously took a risk. [That] decision had fatal consequences\u201d.</p> <p>The helicopter, which was carrying two police officers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/08/witnesses-tell-clutha-inquiry-of-helicopters-crash-into-glasgow-bar\">crash-landed</a> on the roof of the Clutha bar in Glasgow at 10.20pm on Friday 29 November 2013, before falling through the roof, killing its occupants and seven customers in the bar.</p> <p>Thomas, from Lochwinnoch in Renfrewshire, said Turnbull was wrong. She said the sheriff had failed to take proper account of the helicopter\u2019s history of faults with its caution advisory display, of \u201cerroneous or spurious fuel indications\u201d and problems such as fuel tank contamination.</p> <p>\u201cI find it distressing and incomprehensible that given months, not moments, to consider the facts, the sheriff principal has come to this conclusion,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cInstead, the sheriff principal has opted to sully the distinguished reputation of a pilot with an exemplary record who was renowned for his sense of responsibility and his regard for the safety of his crew.\u201d</p> <p>Traill\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/23/clutha-helicopter-crash-switched-off-fuel-pumps-report\">decision to keep flying</a> despite seeing the fuel warning flights was a key issue for the inquiry. Turnbull ruled the pilot should have had ample fuel for the journey back to base, and should have followed the warning lights by shifting fuel to the supply tanks.</p> <p>Turnbull decided it was \u201cmore likely than not that the quantities of fuel displayed on the fuel quantity indication system of [the helicopter] contradicted the low fuel warnings, in a manner that persuaded Captain Traill that it was safe to continue flying\u201d.</p> <p>Thomas said his findings insulted the intelligence of those who knew about the aircraft\u2019s history. She said the model\u2019s maintenance manual had wrongly said a flameout time between engines would be about three to four minutes.</p> <p>In fact, the correct time was more than one minute but, because of the design of the fuel tanks, Traill had only 32 seconds before flameout. In a statement, she said of the victims: \u201cThis has devastated the lives of all who surround them and impacted on so many more.\u201d </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office for Scotland said: \u201cThe sheriff principal carefully considered all the evidence put before the inquiry before making his determination which fully sets out the reasons for his decisions.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Airbus, which makes the Eurocopter, would not comment on her criticisms and reissued the statement it issued after Turnbull\u2019s ruling last week.</p> <p>The firm said it had cooperated with all the investigations into the crash and had taken note of the findings of the FAI and the previous investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.</p> <p>\u201cAll of us at the company remain deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the heavy loss of life. We would like to express once again our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe safety of our fleet remains our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything possible to ensure the safe operation of our helicopters by the thousands of operators whose crews and passengers rely on them every day all around the world.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fiancee of the pilot blamed for killing 10 people in the Clutha helicopter crash has criticised the findings of the fatal accident inquiry and claimed the sheriff downplayed evidence showing the manufacturer and aircraft were at fault. Dr Lucy Thomas, who was engaged to marry David Traill, the pilot, said there was clear evidence about the helicopter\u2019s record of faults and errors in its maintenance manuals that meant Traill was not to blame. After the fatal accident inquiry (FAI), Traill was blamed by the sheriff principal Craig Turnbull for failing to transfer more fuel into its supply tanks after fuel warning lights came on in the Eurocopter EC135. He said Traill \u201cconsciously took a risk. [That] decision had fatal consequences\u201d. The helicopter, which was carrying two police officers, crash-landed on the roof of the Clutha bar in Glasgow at 10.20pm on Friday 29 November 2013, before falling through the roof, killing its occupants and seven customers in the bar. Thomas, from Lochwinnoch in Renfrewshire, said Turnbull was wrong. She said the sheriff had failed to take proper account of the helicopter\u2019s history of faults with its caution advisory display, of \u201cerroneous or spurious fuel indications\u201d and problems such as fuel tank contamination. \u201cI find it distressing and incomprehensible that given months, not moments, to consider the facts, the sheriff principal has come to this conclusion,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, the sheriff principal has opted to sully the distinguished reputation of a pilot with an exemplary record who was renowned for his sense of responsibility and his regard for the safety of his crew.\u201d Traill\u2019s decision to keep flying despite seeing the fuel warning flights was a key issue for the inquiry. Turnbull ruled the pilot should have had ample fuel for the journey back to base, and should have followed the warning lights by shifting fuel to the supply tanks. Turnbull decided it was \u201cmore likely than not that the quantities of fuel displayed on the fuel quantity indication system of [the helicopter] contradicted the low fuel warnings, in a manner that persuaded Captain Traill that it was safe to continue flying\u201d. Thomas said his findings insulted the intelligence of those who knew about the aircraft\u2019s history. She said the model\u2019s maintenance manual had wrongly said a flameout time between engines would be about three to four minutes. In fact, the correct time was more than one minute but, because of the design of the fuel tanks, Traill had only 32 seconds before flameout. In a statement, she said of the victims: \u201cThis has devastated the lives of all who surround them and impacted on so many more.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office for Scotland said: \u201cThe sheriff principal carefully considered all the evidence put before the inquiry before making his determination which fully sets out the reasons for his decisions.\u201d A spokesman for Airbus, which makes the Eurocopter, would not comment on her criticisms and reissued the statement it issued after Turnbull\u2019s ruling last week. The firm said it had cooperated with all the investigations into the crash and had taken note of the findings of the FAI and the previous investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. \u201cAll of us at the company remain deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the heavy loss of life. We would like to express once again our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe safety of our fleet remains our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything possible to ensure the safe operation of our helicopters by the thousands of operators whose crews and passengers rely on them every day all around the world.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was billed as a single-issue election about Brexit. But less than a week after the 12 December poll was announced, it is the state of the NHS that has so far dominated media coverage of the nascent campaign.</p> <p>Back in September, Boris Johnson got an early taste of the risks that await any prime minister using a hospital visit to burnish their credentials as a staunch supporter of the NHS. During a tour of Whipps Cross hospital in east London, and with TV cameras rolling, Johnson was confronted by the father of a week-old baby girl who angrily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/18/nhs-destroyed-boris-johnson-father-sick-child-hospital-london\">challenged</a> him over the hospital\u2019s lack of staff. The parent, Omar Salem \u2013 who is also a Labour activist \u2013 said: \u201cThe NHS has been destroyed \u2026 and now you come here for a press opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>While staff at the many hospitals Johnson goes to see are often happy to meet him, his visit to Addenbrooke\u2019s in Cambridge last Thursday led to extensive media <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/cowardly-boris-johnson-booed-in-cambridge-hospital-trip\">coverage</a> of him being booed by medical student Julia Simons along with her claim that his presence was \u201ca PR stunt\u201d.</p> <p>However, the NHS issue that threatens to do Johnson the greatest damage is the suggestion that the health service could see its annual bill for drugs soar in future as the result of a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal.</p> <p>A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation last Monday into that subject initially received scant media attention despite it quoting an estimate of the bill for the NHS ballooning from \u00a318bn to \u00a345bn if the US government and drug firms got their way in trade negotiations. But the programme did lead to Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, becoming visibly awkward when challenged about it subsequently at prime minister\u2019s questions and in media interviews respectively.</p> <p>Hancock has stated categorically that the price the NHS pays for medicines will not go up. But Donald Trump has made it clear that in effect any country seeking a trade deal with the US will have to pay higher prices for American-made drugs. Johnson may continue to have trouble rebutting the charge, which Labour are making regularly, that he is prepared to leave the health service at the mercy of rapacious US pharma companies.</p> <p>However, the debate in the campaign so far about the NHS has not followed its usual pattern of Labour accusing the Conservatives of running the nation\u2019s most loved institution into the ground, and the Tories being stuck on the backfoot trying to convince voters that they are its resolute, generous and trustworthy protectors.</p> <p>Instead, unusually, the Tories see the NHS \u2013 one of Johnson\u2019s three key \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d \u2013 as a strong card. They are trumpeting record levels of funding, plans for 40 new hospitals in England and a further cash bonanza to buy new scanners and other vital equipment. Recent opinion polls have shown that the PM is trusted by more voters than Jeremy Corbyn on the NHS, which could be taken as evidence that this unlikely approach is paying off.</p> <p>The Tory attempt to get on the front foot over the health service is a surprising, and potentially reckless, strategy for them, given its safe stewardship is usually perceived as a surefire vote-winner for Labour.</p> <p>It is an approach that appears improbable and counter-intuitive, especially given that the last nine-and-a-half years have seen the NHS through no fault of its own: plunge billions of pounds into the red; experience an escalating staffing crisis; stop meeting key waiting-time targets for A&amp;E care, cancer treatment and planned operations; and fail to deliver the \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between mental health care and physical health services that was first promised in 2014.</p> <p>Public concern that runs across party lines about the privatisation of NHS services, claims that Hancock can be economical with the truth, and Johnson\u2019s own <a href=\"http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/23rd-september-1995/6/politics\">previous support </a>for charging patients to use NHS services may all prove pitfalls for the PM in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s bold gamble leaves the two main parties locked in a bidding war over who will do most to improve a service that many of its own personnel view as being in a precarious state after nine years of austerity funding.</p> <p>No wonder, with the stakes so high, that the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represent\u2019s the UK\u2019s 220,000 doctors, has warned that the parties\u2019 promises on the NHS can be little more than \u201cguaranteed vote bait\u201d and even involve the telling of \u201coutright lies\u201d, fears echoed by NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England.</p> <p>The NHS\u2019s unique role in national life, its place in the British mindset plus, especially, the public\u2019s increasing <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/public-satisfaction-nhs\">dissatisfaction</a> with their own experience of care \u2013 long waits for a test, GP appointments, ambulance, mental health bed or cataract removal \u2013 mean the election war over the health service is only just beginning, and will get much louder soon.</p>",

But less than a week after the 12 December poll was announced, it is the state of the NHS that has so far dominated media coverage of the nascent campaign. Back in September, Boris Johnson got an early taste of the risks that await any prime minister using a hospital visit to burnish their credentials as a staunch supporter of the NHS. During a tour of Whipps Cross hospital in east London, and with TV cameras rolling, Johnson was confronted by the father of a week-old baby girl who angrily challenged him over the hospital\u2019s lack of staff. The parent, Omar Salem \u2013 who is also a Labour activist \u2013 said: \u201cThe NHS has been destroyed \u2026 and now you come here for a press opportunity.\u201d While staff at the many hospitals Johnson goes to see are often happy to meet him, his visit to Addenbrooke\u2019s in Cambridge last Thursday led to extensive media coverage of him being booed by medical student Julia Simons along with her claim that his presence was \u201ca PR stunt\u201d. However, the NHS issue that threatens to do Johnson the greatest damage is the suggestion that the health service could see its annual bill for drugs soar in future as the result of a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal. A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation last Monday into that subject initially received scant media attention despite it quoting an estimate of the bill for the NHS ballooning from \u00a318bn to \u00a345bn if the US government and drug firms got their way in trade negotiations. But the programme did lead to Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, becoming visibly awkward when challenged about it subsequently at prime minister\u2019s questions and in media interviews respectively. Hancock has stated categorically that the price the NHS pays for medicines will not go up. But Donald Trump has made it clear that in effect any country seeking a trade deal with the US will have to pay higher prices for American-made drugs. Johnson may continue to have trouble rebutting the charge, which Labour are making regularly, that he is prepared to leave the health service at the mercy of rapacious US pharma companies. However, the debate in the campaign so far about the NHS has not followed its usual pattern of Labour accusing the Conservatives of running the nation\u2019s most loved institution into the ground, and the Tories being stuck on the backfoot trying to convince voters that they are its resolute, generous and trustworthy protectors. Instead, unusually, the Tories see the NHS \u2013 one of Johnson\u2019s three key \u201cpeople\u2019s priorities\u201d \u2013 as a strong card. They are trumpeting record levels of funding, plans for 40 new hospitals in England and a further cash bonanza to buy new scanners and other vital equipment. Recent opinion polls have shown that the PM is trusted by more voters than Jeremy Corbyn on the NHS, which could be taken as evidence that this unlikely approach is paying off. The Tory attempt to get on the front foot over the health service is a surprising, and potentially reckless, strategy for them, given its safe stewardship is usually perceived as a surefire vote-winner for Labour. It is an approach that appears improbable and counter-intuitive, especially given that the last nine-and-a-half years have seen the NHS through no fault of its own: plunge billions of pounds into the red; experience an escalating staffing crisis; stop meeting key waiting-time targets for A&amp;E care, cancer treatment and planned operations; and fail to deliver the \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between mental health care and physical health services that was first promised in 2014. Public concern that runs across party lines about the privatisation of NHS services, claims that Hancock can be economical with the truth, and Johnson\u2019s own previous support for charging patients to use NHS services may all prove pitfalls for the PM in the weeks ahead. Johnson\u2019s bold gamble leaves the two main parties locked in a bidding war over who will do most to improve a service that many of its own personnel view as being in a precarious state after nine years of austerity funding. No wonder, with the stakes so high, that the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represent\u2019s the UK\u2019s 220,000 doctors, has warned that the parties\u2019 promises on the NHS can be little more than \u201cguaranteed vote bait\u201d and even involve the telling of \u201coutright lies\u201d, fears echoed by NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England. The NHS\u2019s unique role in national life, its place in the British mindset plus, especially, the public\u2019s increasing dissatisfaction with their own experience of care \u2013 long waits for a test, GP appointments, ambulance, mental health bed or cataract removal \u2013 mean the election war over the health service is only just beginning, and will get much louder soon.",

Yet the existence of billionaires is irreconcilable with this emancipatory project.</p> <p>The market fundamentalist ideology that dominates much of the west has attempted to indoctrinate us with a simple myth: that we all rise or fall according to our individual efforts alone; that billionaires amass vast amounts of wealth because they are entrepreneurial, plucky, go-getting geniuses. While in the first decades after the second world war, poverty, insecurity and unemployment had been understood as problems with the way society was organised, Thatcherism and Reaganism recast them as personal defects: laziness, lack of effort and plain stupidity. \u201cThere really is no primary poverty left in this country,\u201d argued Margaret Thatcher in 1978, saying that if some were poor it was down to a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/103793\" title=\"\">really hard fundamental character-personality defect</a>\u201d. It is this mentality that led a Welsh Tory candidate to suggest that people on Benefits Street \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/tory-candidate-francesca-obrien-wrote-people-benefits-street-should-be-put-down\" title=\"\">need putting down</a>\u201d. Here was a convenient means of justifying exploding inequality: those at the top deserved to be there, and so did those at the bottom.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Philanthropists spend their money based on their own personal whims, rather than what is best for the social good</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/9/20681088/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-dan-riffle-billionaire-policy-failure\" title=\"\">Dan Riffle</a>, senior adviser to Ocasio-Cortez, says every billionaire is a policy failure. He\u2019s right. A billionaire is someone who has concentrated wealth that is collectively created by the hard work and graft of others. A significant portion have inherited their wealth. But even the majority who haven\u2019t are not \u201cself-made\u201d by any accurate use of that term.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an example. When I defended Russell-Moyle\u2019s argument, the former Ukip MP Douglas Carswell believed he had the perfect comeback: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DouglasCarswell/status/1190026126720225281\" title=\"\">What about the billionaire who created the smartphone Owen is tweeting with?</a>\u201d, he said on Twitter. But this was one of the worst examples he could have used. First there is the matter of iPhones being made by underpaid, exploited workers: no such company can make profit without relying on the deliberately undervalued efforts of their labour force. But it goes far beyond that. As the economist Professor Mariana Mazzucato notes, rather than being the ingenious personal creation of Steve Jobs, the iPhone brings together technologies created by the state at vast public expense. You name it: touchscreen technology, GPS, Siri, liquid crystal display, the microprocessor, the micro hard drive, signal compression, the internet itself \u2013 all were created by publicly funded research and development. Their workforces were educated by the state; their property is protected by a vast state system of justice. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/18/ruins-notre-dame-billionaires-french-philanthropy\">The lesson from the ruins of Notre Dame: don\u2019t rely on billionaires | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what of the great billionaire philanthropists, generously showering their wealth on worthy causes? It\u2019s not just the fact that the philanthropy of many tycoons does not compensate for their use of loopholes to avoid paying tax. Philanthropists decide how to spend their money based on their own personal whims, rather than what is best for the social good. In the US, for example, just 12% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/sep/02/philanthropists-revolution-libraries-grassroots\" title=\"\">philanthropic money</a> went to human services in 2015 \u2013 it was much more likely to be splashed on arts and higher education. Governments are at least democratically accountable for their spending decisions, and are under far more pressure to meet the needs of their population rather than simply indulge private hobby horses.</p> <p>The existence of billionaires should sound an alarm: they are the most extreme manifestation of wealth generated by the efforts of millions of people being funnelled into the pockets of a tiny few. That wealth should be invested in improving the living standards of the majority, not locked away in the bank accounts of the world\u2019s most exclusive club.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Britain is late to this party: across the Atlantic, US leftwing superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says: \u201cA system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people get ringworm because they don\u2019t have access to public health is wrong.\u201d Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, promoted his new wealth tax policy with four words: \u201cBillionaires should not exist.\u201d They were met with vitriol from the US right. Predictably, we are invited to believe that seeking to shut down Britain\u2019s billionaire club \u2013 all 151 members \u2013 is an attack on getting ahead. That isn\u2019t to say the left should be blind to aspiration, of course: as Polish-born US socialist Rose Schneiderman put it in 1912: \u201cThe worker must have bread, but she must have roses.\u201d The left\u2019s mission isn\u2019t simply to grant every citizen the basic means of survival, but comfort and prosperity, too, through collective means. Yet the existence of billionaires is irreconcilable with this emancipatory project. The market fundamentalist ideology that dominates much of the west has attempted to indoctrinate us with a simple myth: that we all rise or fall according to our individual efforts alone; that billionaires amass vast amounts of wealth because they are entrepreneurial, plucky, go-getting geniuses. While in the first decades after the second world war, poverty, insecurity and unemployment had been understood as problems with the way society was organised, Thatcherism and Reaganism recast them as personal defects: laziness, lack of effort and plain stupidity. \u201cThere really is no primary poverty left in this country,\u201d argued Margaret Thatcher in 1978, saying that if some were poor it was down to a \u201creally hard fundamental character-personality defect\u201d. It is this mentality that led a Welsh Tory candidate to suggest that people on Benefits Street \u201cneed putting down\u201d. Here was a convenient means of justifying exploding inequality: those at the top deserved to be there, and so did those at the bottom. Dan Riffle, senior adviser to Ocasio-Cortez, says every billionaire is a policy failure. He\u2019s right. A billionaire is someone who has concentrated wealth that is collectively created by the hard work and graft of others. A significant portion have inherited their wealth. But even the majority who haven\u2019t are not \u201cself-made\u201d by any accurate use of that term. Here\u2019s an example. When I defended Russell-Moyle\u2019s argument, the former Ukip MP Douglas Carswell believed he had the perfect comeback: \u201cWhat about the billionaire who created the smartphone Owen is tweeting with?\u201d, he said on Twitter. But this was one of the worst examples he could have used. First there is the matter of iPhones being made by underpaid, exploited workers: no such company can make profit without relying on the deliberately undervalued efforts of their labour force. But it goes far beyond that. As the economist Professor Mariana Mazzucato notes, rather than being the ingenious personal creation of Steve Jobs, the iPhone brings together technologies created by the state at vast public expense. You name it: touchscreen technology, GPS, Siri, liquid crystal display, the microprocessor, the micro hard drive, signal compression, the internet itself \u2013 all were created by publicly funded research and development. Their workforces were educated by the state; their property is protected by a vast state system of justice. But what of the great billionaire philanthropists, generously showering their wealth on worthy causes? It\u2019s not just the fact that the philanthropy of many tycoons does not compensate for their use of loopholes to avoid paying tax. Philanthropists decide how to spend their money based on their own personal whims, rather than what is best for the social good. In the US, for example, just 12% of philanthropic money went to human services in 2015 \u2013 it was much more likely to be splashed on arts and higher education. Governments are at least democratically accountable for their spending decisions, and are under far more pressure to meet the needs of their population rather than simply indulge private hobby horses. The existence of billionaires should sound an alarm: they are the most extreme manifestation of wealth generated by the efforts of millions of people being funnelled into the pockets of a tiny few. That wealth should be invested in improving the living standards of the majority, not locked away in the bank accounts of the world\u2019s most exclusive club. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

In the days before White\u2019s death on 27 May, Stasiuk allegedly messaged friends saying: \u201cTomorrow I go to war\u201d, and even referenced using a chainsaw. Southampton crown court heard on Monday that at around 4.30pm at Lake Community Gardens in the village of Lake on the Isle of Wight the pair had a confrontation. After allegedly attacking White with the chainsaw, which is understood to have come from the garden\u2019s clubhouse, Stasiuk strangled and smothered him, screaming: \u201cDie bastard, die\u201d, the jury heard. Minutes later he allegedly confessed to murdering White to a 999 operator, the court was told. Stasiuk, who worked for White\u2019s pubs, helped look after the 16-acre \u201cwellness\u201d garden. Matthew Jewell QC, prosecuting, said Stasiuk had a list of complaints against White. \u201cStasiuk harboured a growing sense of grievance and formed a strong belief in his position,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir relationship began to go sour for a number of reasons. \u201cThere was an accusation made against Stasiuk\u2019s partner about \u00a325 transport costs owed to her.

      "body": "<p>Britain has long had a global reputation for bad teeth, and scientists now say we may have the worst in the nation\u2019s history. After examining the teeth of 17th-century skulls, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7644553/British-teeth-worst-TIME-says-scientists.html\" title=\"\">researchers from Queen Mary University of London found</a> fewer missing teeth and less decay than today, blaming widespread sugar consumption and lack of basic hygiene for the sorry state of our teeth. Here, then, is an ultimate guide to optimum dental care.</p> <h2><strong>How should you clean your teeth?</strong></h2> <p>The steadfast rule of brushing is to stick to the two-minute rule using a good fluoride toothpaste. \u201cThe optimum level of fluoride for anyone aged three and over is between 1,350ppm and 1,500ppm, so it doesn\u2019t matter too much which brand you\u2019re using as long as it has that level of fluoride,\u201d says Karen Coates, a dental adviser at the Oral Health Foundation. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to wet the brush. With a pea-sized amount of toothpaste \u2013 you don\u2019t have to fill the whole brush \u2013 use small, circular movements concentrating on every area of the teeth.\u201d</p> <p>Coates adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between brushing effectively and overbrushing. There is evidence that electric brushes give a better clean than a manual, and also have the benefit of a timer (so you\u2019re more likely to brush for two minutes) and a pressure sensor (so you can\u2019t press too hard). Overbrushing can damage the teeth and gums, and can cause recession.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Spit or rinse?</strong></h2> <p>The consensus is: spit, don\u2019t rinse. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve brushed your teeth, just spit out the excess, but don\u2019t rinse your mouth, as you\u2019d just be rinsing out all that fluoride you\u2019ve just put on,\u201d says Coates. \u201cThe residual bits of fluoride will stay on the teeth for about 30 minutes after brushing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What should you use?</strong><br></h2> <p>Damien Walmsley, a scientific adviser for the British Dental Association, recommends using a medium-sized toothbrush that can get to hard-to-reach places at the back of the mouth. Coates adds that brushing can clean the sides, the inside and the biting surface, but a toothbrush alone will not clean all the surfaces of the teeth, so it\u2019s best to use interdental brushes or floss to clean in between your teeth once a day.</p> <h2><strong>What about mouthwash?</strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cMouthwash is not a substitute for brushing your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste,\u201d says Walmsley. \u201cIt only has a small effect in terms of freshening your breath and having a nice taste.\u201d Coates adds that rinsing with mouthwash straight after brushing the teeth is counterproductive as it removes the fluoride. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to use mouthwash, do this at a different time to brushing your teeth because one will counteract the other,\u201d she says. \u201cRinse after lunch, maybe, as that will neutralise the acid produced when you eat or drink anything. Mouthwash isn\u2019t necessary unless it\u2019s been prescribed by your dentist, but most people use it for cosmetic reasons.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>When should you clean your teeth?</strong></h2> <p>Teeth are most vulnerable straight after food or drink. \u201cWhen we eat or drink, any sugars lower the pH level in the mouth, making it acidic. This is what causes dental decay,\u201d says Coates. \u201cIf you brush your teeth too soon [after eating], you could loosen microscopic amounts of loosened enamel from the acid attack. It takes about an hour for that to neutralise.\u201d So, you shouldn\u2019t brush your teeth for at least an hour after eating or drinking anything. \u201cIt\u2019s recommended to brush your teeth last thing at night and at least one other time during the day,\u201d says Coates. \u201cMost people will do this in the morning, although this should be at least 30 minutes before having food or drink or about an hour after.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Should you get braces?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThe NHS criteria for orthodontics is tight so only the worst cases tend to be corrected \u2013 it comes down to function rather than appearance,\u201d says Coates. \u201cThis means you may reach adulthood and become unhappy with the position of the teeth. The option then is to go private, if you can afford it. You can also go private to get braces for your child if they don\u2019t meet the criteria.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How do you counter staining?</strong></h2> <p>Highly coloured food that contains tannins such as tea, coffee, red wine, and some curries (not to mention smoking) can stain the teeth. \u201cIf you are going to have something sugary or acidic, it\u2019s better to have it as part of mealtime, as it\u2019s not the amount you have; it\u2019s the frequency,\u201d says Coates. \u201cIf you\u2019re snacking or sipping something sugary, for example, throughout the day, your teeth will potentially be under an acid attack all day. So if you do need to eat or drink between meals, you\u2019re better off drinking water or milk and snacking on nuts, seeds, rice cakes, breadsticks, cheese, vegetables, etc, which are a much safer pH for the teeth.\u201d As well as regular visits to the dentist, a whitening toothpaste can help to keep the staining down.</p> <h2><strong>Should you whiten your teeth?</strong></h2> <p>Coates explains that at home, you are not going to be able to do much other than removing staining by using a whitening toothpaste, for instance. \u201cThe legal limit for hydrogen peroxide in a product is 0.1%, which isn\u2019t high enough to make a difference to the shade of your teeth. Professional treatment with a dentist is the only legal and reliable route to safe, lasting teeth whitening.\u201d Walmsley also warns that \u201cfad\u201d whitening treatments can sometimes be abrasive and actually damage the teeth.</p> <h2><strong>How often should you see your dentist?</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019re often told to go to the dentist twice a year, but is this really necessary for everyone? \u201cIt\u2019s only by going to see your dentist that you can determine how often you need to see them,\u201d says Walmsley. \u201cDepending on the state of your teeth, they will decide if you need to see them on a regular basis or have a more personalised plan.\u201d</p>",

The report revealed officers unlawfully obtained warrants to search the homes of Proctor and other falsely accused men.</p> <p>The ex-politician has submitted a criminal complaint about five officers involved in the inquiry into the claims of Carl Beech \u2013 known as \u201cNick\u201d when he first came forward in 2014 \u2013 who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/26/carl-beech-vip-paedophile-ring-accuser-jailed-for-18-years\">jailed for 18 years in July</a> over the false allegations.</p> <p>Proctor wants the officers to be investigated and interviewed under caution.

      "bodyText": "The former Tory MP Harvey Proctor who was falsely accused of being part of a VIP paedophile ring in Westminster is calling for five police officers who worked on Scotland Yard\u2019s inquiry to face a criminal investigation. Proctor spoke out after a damning report last month laid bare a series of failings in the \u00a32.5m Metropolitan police investigation into the allegations. The report revealed officers unlawfully obtained warrants to search the homes of Proctor and other falsely accused men. The ex-politician has submitted a criminal complaint about five officers involved in the inquiry into the claims of Carl Beech \u2013 known as \u201cNick\u201d when he first came forward in 2014 \u2013 who was jailed for 18 years in July over the false allegations. Proctor wants the officers to be investigated and interviewed under caution. They include Steve Rodhouse, who was a deputy assistant commissioner and the gold commander of the investigation and is now the deputy director general of the National Crime Agency, Britain\u2019s version of the FBI. The other four, who have all retired from the Met, are Kenny McDonald, Eric Sword, Alison Hepworth and Diane Tudway. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog earlier cleared officers involved in Operation Midland of wrongdoing, but Proctor is accusing the five of perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office. The 72-year-old told a press conference in Westminster that he had made a formal complaint about the five officers. \u201cIt is unprecedented that two senior and respected judges should publicly allege criminality in the conduct of a police investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cI waited for the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] and the IOPC to take the necessary action to trigger a full police investigation into this alleged criminality. In the absence of such action and investigation, after the fullest and most careful consideration, having taken legal advice, and with the deepest regret, I am compelled, in the interest of justice, to report these matters as crimes to Northumbria police.\u201d The force, he said, should not limit its investigation to the five officers and should \u201cgo where the evidence takes them\u201d. Sir Richard Henriques, the retired high court judge who carried out a review of Operation Midland, last month called for a criminal investigation, saying: \u201cThe course of justice was perverted with shocking consequences.\u201d His report revealed that warrants to search the homes of wrongly accused suspects were obtained \u201cunlawfully\u201d and \u201cshould not have taken place\u201d. It said police \u201cmisled\u201d the district judge who authorised the search by describing Beech\u2019s allegations as \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d. The district judge Howard Riddle, who granted the search warrants, agreed with Henriques\u2019s finding. \u201cThe conclusion is that the search warrants were obtained unlawfully,\u201d Riddle said last month. Northumbria police confirmed they had received Proctor\u2019s complaint, which he delivered in person last month, and had referred it to the Metropolitan police. Scotland Yard said it was assessing the complaint, adding: \u201cWe can confirm that the MPS received a referral from Northumbria police on Thursday 31 October 2019 following a complaint comprising criminal allegations in relation to five former MPS officers involved in Operation Midland.\u201d Last month, the Met published an unredacted version of Henriques\u2019s scathing review of Operation Midland which listed a series of police failings and prompted calls for the commissioner, Cressida Dick, to consider her position. Henriques revealed that senior officers agreed to publicly say they believed Beech, leading a detective to infamously declare that his claims were \u201ccredible and true\u201d. The premeditated decision by officers to publicly say they believed Beech was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d, Henriques said. The unredacted report also shed light on the role of Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who, according to Henriques, pressurised investigating officers. Reviewing how to engage with the politician was listed among \u201cinvestigative priorities\u201d by a senior officer. Beech, a former nurse, alleged he was among the victims of an \u201cestablishment group\u201d \u2013 including politicians and military figures \u2013 who kidnapped, raped and murdered boys in the 1970s and 1980s.

Nevertheless, I have checked the list and disagree with most of it. For instance \u2026 </p> <p>The founder of the Polpo restaurants hates the question: \u201cDo you have a reservation?\u201d (It\u2019s actually OK, if you still run a booking system, to ask people if they have booked); the \u201cconcept\u201d (fair enough, but we are all humans just trying to plant a flag on the shifting soil); \u201cartisanal\u201d, \u201chand-cut\u201d, square plates, novelty crockery (OK, granted); sommeliers sniffing corks (there is a theatrical framework to all human activity \u2013 what Lakoff would call Metaphors We Live By; sniffing stuff is merely part of that frame); waiters who go: \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019ll remember everything\u201d (but what if they can?): also, ones who say \u201cEnjoy\u201d (castigating expressions of goodwill is very 1980s).</p> <p>There are, however, plenty of things to legitimately hate about restaurants, of which these are merely the tip of the iceberg:</p> <h2><strong>Parsimonious time slots</strong></h2> <p>If you want people in and out, invent Leon. If you want to create a Faine Daining experience, put up with the fact that people will linger. This hit its apex when Brasserie Z\u00e9del started offering tables in slots of a single hour (relatedly: mad rushing from one course to the next; offering lunch and dinner reservations at times when no one has ever eaten lunch or dinner).</p> <h2><strong>No way of booking</strong></h2> <p>Even while I understand the last decade\u2019s move towards not booking but simply turning up, let\u2019s be frank that it favours the restaurant not the punter; they overcome the curse of the no-show, we get to spend half an hour in a queue. So when they overlay a bunch of other stipulations \u2013 your entire party has to be present before you can join the list, you have to wait on the street, not in the pub, etc \u2013 they\u2019re having a laugh.</p> <h2><strong>Menu patter</strong></h2> <p>In menu rubric, nothing is more annoying that spelling out the price in words when perfectly good numbers exist (\u201cscotch egg; five pounds\u201d); except, possibly, chatting on the menu (\u201cwe love this little farm, and they produce the best damn offal within 50 miles\u201d etc). Oh, wait: proselytising ethical statements that make no sense are bad, too: when the Duck and Waffle opened on Bishopsgate, in London, the menu honestly stated: \u201cAll our ingredients are seasonally sourced from all over the world\u201d, entirely meaningless given that everything\u2019s in season somewhere.</p> <h2><strong>Up-selling</strong></h2> <p>Sommeliers who hover over you, trying to make you feel bad about keeping to the top third of the list; anyone warning you that you will still be hungry if you don\u2019t order a starter; anyone giving you the fish-eye when you don\u2019t want pudding. First rule for everyone involved in the emotional co-production that is public eating: stay classy.</p>",

This hit its apex when Brasserie Z\u00e9del started offering tables in slots of a single hour (relatedly: mad rushing from one course to the next; offering lunch and dinner reservations at times when no one has ever eaten lunch or dinner). No way of booking Even while I understand the last decade\u2019s move towards not booking but simply turning up, let\u2019s be frank that it favours the restaurant not the punter; they overcome the curse of the no-show, we get to spend half an hour in a queue. So when they overlay a bunch of other stipulations \u2013 your entire party has to be present before you can join the list, you have to wait on the street, not in the pub, etc \u2013 they\u2019re having a laugh. Menu patter In menu rubric, nothing is more annoying that spelling out the price in words when perfectly good numbers exist (\u201cscotch egg; five pounds\u201d); except, possibly, chatting on the menu (\u201cwe love this little farm, and they produce the best damn offal within 50 miles\u201d etc). Oh, wait: proselytising ethical statements that make no sense are bad, too: when the Duck and Waffle opened on Bishopsgate, in London, the menu honestly stated: \u201cAll our ingredients are seasonally sourced from all over the world\u201d, entirely meaningless given that everything\u2019s in season somewhere. Up-selling Sommeliers who hover over you, trying to make you feel bad about keeping to the top third of the list; anyone warning you that you will still be hungry if you don\u2019t order a starter; anyone giving you the fish-eye when you don\u2019t want pudding. First rule for everyone involved in the emotional co-production that is public eating: stay classy.",

Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran\u2019s atomic energy organisation, said enriched uranium production was now at 5kg per day, up from 450g two months ago. The announcement coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Iranian takeover of the US embassy. The nuclear deal has been unravelling since May 2018 when Donald Trump withdrew the US and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Tehran said earlier this year it would gradually shed its commitments under the deal and is due to announce its next step within days unless the US lifts economic sanctions. The production increases were made possible by the introduction of two new advanced centrifuges, one of which is undergoing testing. Salehi said Iran was now operating 60 IR-6 advanced centrifuges, a violation of the deal. Salehi added that Iranian engineers were also working on a prototype called IR-9 and said that this would be 50 times faster than the first-generation IR-1s allowed under the accord. Iran said it had now removed all its IR-1 centrifuges and is only using advanced models, leading to the sharp increase in production. It has been calculated that the new centrifuges mean it would take Iran a year to develop a nuclear bomb, something it insists it has no intention of doing. The deal was brokered in 2015 and included Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, in particular on oil exports. It is not clear how the European Union will react to the latest step, but so far the EU has not put the whole nuclear agreement into review, which would be the first move towards its suspension and possible collapse. Sanam Vakil, a Chatham House senior research fellow, warned: \u201cThere is now a serious risk of a dangerous miscalculation with dangerous consequences if Iran\u2019s [latest] step goes too far.\u201d The EU sent an early warning shot on Monday, saying its support for the nuclear deal depended on Tehran fulfilling its commitments. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said the announcement was unacceptable and was putting the whole nuclear deal at risk. Tehran says it is no longer prepared to wait for Europe to fulfil its commitment to boost trade with Iran, made at the time of the deal in 2015. Europe has made promises to find ways to circumvent the US sanctions, but little that is substantial or legally watertight has emerged from extensive talks between Tehran and the three main European powers, Britain, France and Germany. Senior Iranians have blamed a general European strategic weakness in part caused by the distraction of Brexit.

      "body": "<p>Frank Giles, who has died aged 100, enjoyed a lengthy and distinguished journalistic career that culminated in the editorship of the Sunday Times. But his short tenure in the chair was dogged by disputes with his proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, and then destroyed by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/apr/24/25yearsagotodaythesunday\" title=\"\">Hitler diaries</a> fiasco.</p> <p>Giles was only partially to blame for the paper\u2019s publication, in April 1983, of the forged diaries. He would later claim he had been steamrollered by Murdoch. His decision had rested on authentication by an academic regarded as the foremost authority on Nazi Germany, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/27/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a> (Lord Dacre of Glanton). When Trevor-Roper changed his mind on the diaries\u2019 legitimacy, he chose to tell the editor of the Times, Charles Douglas-Home, who did not pass the message on to Giles.</p> <p>It was not until the presses were rolling with the first extract that Giles learned of Trevor-Roper\u2019s revised opinion. The drama, as recounted years later by Giles\u2019s deputy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/15/brian-macarthur-obituary\" title=\"\">Brian MacArthur</a>, was witnessed by Sunday Times executives who overheard Giles speaking to Trevor-Roper on the phone and noted the marked change in his tone of voice.</p> <p>\u201cThe office fell silent. \u2018Well, naturally, Hugh, one has doubts \u2026 but I take it that these doubts aren\u2019t strong enough to make you do a complete 180-degree turn on that? Oh. Oh. I see. You are doing a 180-degree turn.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Two weeks later, the diaries were officially denounced by the German authorities as forgeries. The Sunday Times apologised to its readers. Trevor-Roper apologised to Giles. Murdoch, however, made no apology for removing Giles from the editor\u2019s chair, giving him a two-year non-job as \u201ceditor emeritus\u201d.</p> <p>Murdoch had been unhappy with Giles ever since appointing him in 1981 in succession to Harold Evans, whom he switched to the editorship of the Times. The two men could not have been more different. Giles was, according to a Sunday Times colleague, Magnus Linklater, \u201curbane, cultivated and unflappable \u2026 a somewhat Wodehousian character\u201d. Murdoch viewed such laid-back qualities as examples of British upper-class weakness.</p> <p>It soon became clear that they had distinctly opposing opinions on the roles of owner and editor. Giles believed in editorial independence; Murdoch believed in proprietorial rights. While Giles did manage to resist Murdoch\u2019s attempts to interfere in editorial content, he was forced to accede to his demands over executive appointments, reluctantly agreeing to fire the magazine editor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/02/ron-hall\" title=\"\">Ron Hall</a>, and replace him with Murdoch\u2019s choice, Peter Jackson.</p> <p>In what became something of a guerrilla war, Murdoch took to belittling Giles. He was in the habit of telling guests: \u201cThere goes Frank Giles, ruining a great newspaper.\u201d</p> <p>It was an ignominious concluding chapter to Giles\u2019s professional life. He was born in London, the son of a colonel in the Royal Engineers. His father, also Frank, died when he was 10, leaving the family in straitened circumstances and forcing his mother, Elgiva (nee Ackland-Allen), to take in lodgers. Even so, enough money was found to send Giles to Wellington college, Berkshire.</p> <p>Given that he suffered from poor health as a child, a bout of rheumatic fever having left him with a heart murmur, it was a surprising choice. Wellington was famous for its sporting prowess, which carried no interest for the aesthetic, academic Giles. He was lucky enough to be favoured by a teacher who helped him win a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, to study history.</p> <p>His studies were cut short by the outbreak of the second world war. Unfit for military service, he was appointed as aide-de-camp to Major General Sir Denis Bernard when he became governor of Bermuda in 1939. Among their early visitors were the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Giles recalled Bernard\u2019s outrage when the Duke remarked: \u201cIf I\u2019d been king there would have been no war.\u201d</p> <p>Among other visiting dignitaries were Clement Attlee, Joseph Kennedy, who believed Britain would lose the war, and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/keith-murdoch-a-new-book-examines-rupert-murdochs-father-gallipoli-and-the-birth-of-the-media-a6701756.html\" title=\"\">Sir Keith Murdoch</a>, father of Rupert.</p> <p>On his return to Britain in 1942, Giles worked in the directorate of military operations at the war office, staying until demobilisation. He transferred to the foreign office, where, after the 1945 general election, he was one of the private secretaries to the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin.</p> <p>He dined out on Bevin anecdotes, relishing his coarse jokes. On one occasion, while standing side by side with his boss at the urinal, Bevin said: \u201cThis is it, Giles, the socialist dream \u2013 the means of production in the hands of the people.\u201d</p> <p>Giles\u2019s diplomatic career ended when he failed the permanent foreign office examination. In 1946, he joined the Times as a subeditor. He was soon writing leader columns and a year later was appointed as assistant correspondent in Paris. A two-year stint in Rome followed before he returned in 1953 to Paris as the paper\u2019s main correspondent.</p> <p>He witnessed the collapse, in 1958, of France\u2019s fourth republic, the subject of one of his later books, and the return to power of Charles de Gaulle. His reporting was regarded as sober, balanced and well-sourced. In 1960, he was encouraged by Ian Fleming, the James Bond author who was working part-time as a consultant at the Sunday Times, to try for the post of foreign editor.</p> <p>Giles took up the post in 1961 \u2013 and was delighted by the change of atmosphere he found at the paper. The Sunday Times had become less formal and more populist in tone.</p> <p>He did not remain tied to his desk, winning plaudits for his coverage of the 1967 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/jun/04/internationalnews.israel\" title=\"\">six-day war in Israel</a>. In the same year, he held hopes of becoming editor. Instead, Evans got the job \u2013 and Giles accepted the deputy editorship.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s accounting firm must hand over eight years of his tax returns to New York prosecutors, a US appeals court ruled on Monday in the latest setback for Trump in his attempts to keep his finances secret. The ruling by the New York-based second US circuit court of appeals backed the ability of prosecutors to enforce a subpoena for the returns against accounting firm Mazars. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, said in a statement: \u201cWe will be taking this case to the supreme court.\u201d That will preclude the immediate release of the information. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R Vance Jr sought the records in an investigation that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women, adult film actor and director Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who claim they had affairs with the president before the 2016 election. Trump has denied them. Vance has agreed not to enforce the subpoena while Trump petitions the supreme court. Under the agreement, Trump now has 10 business days to file that petition. The highest court has a 5-4 conservative majority including two justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who were appointed by Trump. Last month, a lower-court judge ruled that the president\u2019s claim to immunity while in office was \u201crepugnant\u201d. US district judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan described the immunity argument as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201can overreach of executive power [that was] repugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values\u201d. He added: \u201cThe court cannot square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the president above the law.\u201d On Monday, Sekulow added: \u201cThe issue raised in this case goes to the heart of our Republic. The constitutional issues are significant.\u201d In the written appeals court decision, the judges said they only decided whether a state prosecutor can demand the president\u2019s personal financial records while he is in office. The court did not consider whether the president is immune from indictment and prosecution while in office or whether the president may be ordered to produce documents in a state criminal proceeding. \u201cWe hold that any presidential immunity from state criminal process does not bar the enforcement of such a subpoena,\u201d wrote chief judge Robert A Katzmann. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said the investigation by Vance, a Democrat, is politically motivated. A spokesman for Vance declined to comment. Since Richard Nixon, presidential candidates have released their tax records by precedent rather than legal compulsion. Since announcing his run for the White House in 2015, Trump has often said he will release his information after the completion of an audit. An audit does not preclude the release of such information. As well as attempts to obtain financial information, Trump faces an impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-led House, over his attempts to get Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate his political rivals.",

Only a single fruit is allowed to grow on each vine, concentrating nutrients. They\u2019re rubbed with gloved hands to stimulate even growth and sweetness. On sunny days they\u2019re fitted with caps to prevent sunburn, and when harvested they\u2019re graded on shape and skin quality as one might for pearls.

In the western world, the perceived value of produce has been shaped by the British agricultural revolution of the 17th to 19th centuries, and the green revolution of the 1950s. These two periods saw dramatic increases in crop yields, leading to much lower prices.</p> <p>Most importantly, the effects of the green revolution shifted a larger share of the agricultural production for western nations to the developing world. Subsistence farming gave way to offshore commercial monocultures for processing and export.</p> <p>Food production that was once a part of daily life became hidden behind a corporate veil.

      "bodyText": "In the basement food halls of Japan\u2019s ritzy department stores you\u2019ll find some of the world\u2019s most expensive fruit. High-end specimens produced for the domestic gift market that can fetch eye-watering prices. A single melon can sell for upwards of 15,000 yen (around A$200), a bunch of 15 or so grapes for 8,000 yen (around A$105), and premium white strawberries for 3,000 yen (A$40) each. Earlier this year, two Yubari King melons from Sapporo sold at auction for 5 million yen \u2013 nearly A$70,000. (You can\u2019t read too much into that price, however. Just like the record-breaking tuna auctions in Tokyo, hugely inflated first-of-season auction prices are usually about rival food corporations bidding to trump competitors for the resulting free media coverage.) Explanations for the high prices of premium Japanese fruit usually focus on the labour that goes into its production. Shizuoka\u2019s famed Crown muskmelons are tended by hand for 100 days. Only a single fruit is allowed to grow on each vine, concentrating nutrients. They\u2019re rubbed with gloved hands to stimulate even growth and sweetness. On sunny days they\u2019re fitted with caps to prevent sunburn, and when harvested they\u2019re graded on shape and skin quality as one might for pearls. Perfectly round melons free from blemishes fetch the highest prices. Production costs aside, the important question is perhaps not why these fruits are so expensive, but why we find the prices so surprising? Some of us will pay hundreds of dollars for a meal that has been tricked up by a chef for a few hours, but baulk at the same money for fruit that has been tended by a farmer for months. These views have history. In the western world, the perceived value of produce has been shaped by the British agricultural revolution of the 17th to 19th centuries, and the green revolution of the 1950s. These two periods saw dramatic increases in crop yields, leading to much lower prices. Most importantly, the effects of the green revolution shifted a larger share of the agricultural production for western nations to the developing world. Subsistence farming gave way to offshore commercial monocultures for processing and export. Food production that was once a part of daily life became hidden behind a corporate veil. The value of our food became linked not with its place in our culture, but with its supermarket price tag. In cultures where cuisine developed together with agriculture before intensive farming, ingredients hold a higher status. In the Asian household I grew up in, we were told to finish our food not because children in Africa were starving, but because idiomatically every grain of rice represented a bead of sweat on a farmer\u2019s brow. Separating our culture and cuisine from agriculture has consequences beyond surprise at the cost of a melon. What we choose to eat and the value we ascribe to it is a question now more frequently answered by commerce than by nature. Proponents of more sustainable alternatives to industrial farming often suggest that the price of food (particularly meat, but also fruits and vegetables) should be higher to account for the economic externalities of that system such as health and environmental costs. That such an approach could increasingly move natural foods out of the financial reach of lower-income households shows there are no easy solutions. One of the key drivers of the British agricultural revolution was discovering that growing turnips and clover could replenish soils better than allowing fields to lie fallow over winter. Animals could be fed on both, so production increased. It led to a boom in turnip recipes in Britain and celebrated products such as spring lamb from ewes well-fed over winter. These days our tastemakers are more likely to be chefs and Instagrammers than farmers. What we choose to eat is driven by ideas that are no longer rooted in the ground. If we all want to eat quinoa we can\u2019t grow and avocados we can\u2019t store there are environmental and social consequences that follow. In Britain, spring lamb is no longer a product of 18th century field rotations. To meet demand, Australian and New Zealand hogget is shipped from the other side of the world to be served on-brand rather than in-season.

      "bodyText": "The latest retail trade figures show that despite protestations from the government that the fundamentals of the economy are strong, the economy is in a deep funk and the tax cuts so far have yet to spur any household spending at all. One of the problems for governments when it comes to the economy is that while you might be able to spin a line that gets a good soundbite on the 6pm news, you can\u2019t actually fool households. Households know how much money they have to spend. All the spin in the world doesn\u2019t put more money in people\u2019s bank accounts. Spin doesn\u2019t raise wages. When the June GDP figures came out the treasurer was at pains to let journalists know that we shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions because those figures did not \u201chave the benefits of the tax cuts or the full flow through from the interest rate cuts\u201d. We now have three months of retail trade figures that do include those factors, and the news is grim. In September, retail trade grew by just 0.2% in both trend and seasonally adjusted terms, and the annual growth of 2.4% in trend terms was the worst since December 2017: The annual growth of retail trade has now fallen for 12 consecutive months \u2013 the worst run since the global financial crisis. But while these figures are bad, where the truly awful news comes through is in the quarterly volume figures. In the September quarter the volume of retail trade fell, and it marked the worst first nine months of a year since 2008. So far this year, households have not increased their volume of retail purchases at all. Since September last year, the volume of retail sales has actually fallen in both trend and seasonally adjusted terms: While the seasonally adjusted measures is a bit more erratic, it is worth noting that according to this measure the past 12 months has been the worst in Australian retail since the 1990 recession: Good luck spinning that. The pathetic growth in the volume of retail trade is important because it gives us a solid insight into what is likely to occur in the September GDP figures. Household consumption, which makes up over half of total GDP, includes more than retail spending (such as housing, health and insurance bills) but the two are closely associated: In July, Josh Frydenberg suggested of household consumption that \u201cyes, it\u2019s a bit weaker than we would like but it is starting, it is still growing at 0.4 and we\u2019ve yet to see the flow through from the tax cuts\u201d. But in the June quarter, retail trade grew by 0.06%; whereas in this quarter it fell by 0.07%. So if household consumption is going to improve in the September quarter, it is mostly going to come off the back of households paying bills. It is now beyond clear that the economy is utterly stagnant. This was clear in the latest inflation figures, and has been supported by these retail trade figures as well as other data out in the past week. While there was some improvement in building approvals in August, it was only evident in the very erratic seasonally adjusted measure, and came via big jumps in approvals for apartment buildings in Brisbane and Adelaide. The trend measure saw yet another fall: And the number of private sector building approvals remains well below what it was a year ago: This is not a shock given the latest RBA figures for credit growth show the worst annual growth of housing credit ever recorded, with the annual growth of investor housing credit falling for the first time ever: And the latest producer price index figures released last Friday show the growth of demand in the economy also fell in the September quarter \u2013 down to 1.5% from 1.7% \u2013 the worst result for nearly three years: It is clear the tax cuts and interest rate cuts alone are not enough. There is little sense that the RBA will cut rates again today but neither is there any sense that the two recent cuts have been enough to do anything other than stem the bleeding. These latest retail figures are yet more evidence that if the Morrison government wants to have any economic credibility, the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook to be released next month must contain some fiscal stimulus measures. And really given the state of the economy, the government shouldn\u2019t even wait that long. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

Garner has already admitted to burning her earlier diaries \u2013 the mortification of re-reading them was too much to bear \u2013 and 1978 finds her able to hear her own unvarnished voice without wincing.</p> <p>Her first novel, the famously autobiographical Monkey Grip, has just been published and has started winning awards when we slip into Garner\u2019s river of consciousness.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019d be a good idea to start another diary, just to cream it off. I bought this yellow book today.\u201d</p> <p>We don\u2019t know what it is she wants to cream off, or even what it means, but this first nonsensical moment won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s a writer\u2019s journal, after all, not moulded into a cohesive or cogent narrative with a beginning, a middle and an end. There is the first page, and the last, and a thousand thoughts, observations, laughs, writerly quotes and much wailing and gnashing of teeth in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3f3973803be8ce1d00f22826306a73dab9b19a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3f3973803be8ce1d00f22826306a73dab9b19a6/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian author Helen Garner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018At first, being inside Helen Garner\u2019s head is discombobulating.\u2019<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren James</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first, being inside Helen Garner\u2019s head is discombobulating.

It can be hard, initially, to keep track of who\u2019s who. There are friends, B, Y and T; there is K and there is L, who may or may not be lovers, we can\u2019t be 100% sure. M is her daughter, the focus of Garner\u2019s savage maternal love, her wonder, her playful affection.

It doesn\u2019t matter. Important elements remain. This raises the question for journal-keepers: of what should we make detailed note?</p> <p>While Garner\u2019s major dramas remain slightly out of focus, little images are sharp and wonderful \u2013 the smell of the rain in the middle of the night, the praying mantis in the twig of bottlebrush with three flowers on it, the morning sun carefully warming her back through the cyclone wire fence.

This is the place where the secret self goes, unwatched, into a locked and private vault. Getting in can be an evil joy. Marry this with the well-known predilections of a writer like Helen Garner, whose reputation for unflinching self-interrogation precedes her, and the anticipation is almost too much. Is it safe to go in? Do you really want to see the things you will find here? Anyone familiar with Garner\u2019s body of work \u2013 the way the writer threads her own vulnerability into her narrative strands \u2013 will understand the trepidation. Once, when the literary journalist Susan Wyndham profiled her, she perfectly described the feeling of reading her, the way she dives into a story, heart thumping on her sleeve: \u201cOh Helen, you want to say, be careful!\u201d And so the reader tiptoes carefully into Helen Garner\u2019s published diaries.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s embrace of a cashless society has seen coin production at the Royal Australian Mint plummet, with revenues from coin sales down more than 30% compared with last year. While the mint had budgeted for circulating coin revenue of $85m in 2018-19, the mint achieved a result of just $58m, selling 111m coins to the banks, 106m of which were for circulation. This was a 9% drop compared with last year; a decade ago the mint produced almost 300m coins. As a result of the lower than expected production, the mint has halved the amount it provides to government coffers through seigniorage, which is the difference between the face value of a coin sold to the banks and its cost of production. Financial statements show that the mint paid the commonwealth\u2019s official public account $24.1m in seigniorage in 2019, compared with $49.2m in 2018. A decade ago, the payment was worth $114m. According to the mint\u2019s annual report, the agency\u2019s off-target estimate of coin demand was based on the findings of research conducted by Colmar Brunton in July 2018. \u201cThe Mint had an expectation that the demand for circulating coin would continue to decline but at a slower pace, as segments of the population resisted the change to a cashless society,\u201d said the mint\u2019s chief executive, Ross MacDiarmid. \u201cThis was in fact not the case. \u201cUpdated research conducted in 2019 and indications of forward orders from the banks, suggests that the plateauing effect expected in the prior 12 months may instead occur in the 2019\u201320 financial year.\u201d While the mint was still able to record a $11.9m profit, its commercial business revenue fell by 21% compared with the prior year and was below budget by 12%. The mint also reports that expenses did not drop in proportion to the drop of sales because there was a strong demand for the low denomination such as five cents, which now has a metal cost equal to face value. At the same time, there was a low demand for the $2 coin which has relatively low expenses compared with face value. The mint sold 37,200 five-cent coins to \u201cexternal parties\u201d in 2018-19, compared with just 1,560 the year before. For the banks, the mint produced about 38m standard five-cent coins, and 8.5m standard $2 coins. The mint argued in 2011 that the five-cent coin should be scrapped, saying it was too expensive to make and was becoming redundant. To try to meet the challenge of a shift away from cash, the mint has been ramping up its other commercial activities, including collectible coin ranges. It also manufactures coins for other countries in the Pacific. Demand for collector coin products grew to a total of $29.96m, an increase of 9.52% on the previous year, with the mint pointing to the success of its special edition AC/DC coins and the Ford and Holden Motorsport Collections. The mint produced more than 25m circulating coins for Pacific countries in 2018\u201319, an 8% decrease on the same period for 2017\u201318. While acknowledging that there is likely to be \u201ca further erosion of the use of currency\u201d the mint says it expects demand for circulating coins to remain at the same level as in 2018\u201319 next year. \u201cWith intensifying global economic uncertainty, the demand for physical assets such as gold and to a lesser extent silver as a hedge against uncertainty, has increased,\u201d the mint says. \u201cThis together with some major events and significant anniversaries has created the environment for the mint to potentially break commercial/numismatic revenue records.\u201d The mint has budgeted for circulating coin revenue of $58m with seigniorage at $33m next year, and commercial revenue of $90m.

The decision to award them, he said, was \u201cextraordinary and absurd\u201d because while the actor had \u201cdelivered his lines\u201d over three days in the witness box, he had never told the court he had not received offers to work. \u201cHere\u2019s one thing he didn\u2019t say, that is, \u2018I am unable to work because of these articles.\u2019 He just didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cNeither did he say I have received no or fewer offers because of these articles. His American agent, Fred Specktor, did not say he has received no or fewer offers because of these articles, his Australian agent wasn\u2019t called, no one gave that evidence.\u201d Blackburn said the \u201cfailure\u201d to ask Rush that question was \u201cnot explicable on any other conceivable basis other than that it was a deliberate decision\u201d. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t clearly come out and say \u2018I have received no offers of work\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe say it is very strange for the court to be having to draw inferences about his state of mind.\u201d The trial continues on Tuesday.",

A packing order is safe if no item in the bag is squashed, that is, if, for each item, that item\u2019s strength is at least the combined weight of what\u2019s placed above that item.

Swapping the apples and the bread, however, gives a safe packing. (i) Which of the other four orderings of apples, bread and carrots are safe or unsafe? Solution: All other orderings are unsafe. (ii) Consider packing items in weight order, with the heaviest at the bottom. Show by giving an example \u2013 that is, invent some items and give them weights and strengths of your choosing \u2013 that this strategy might not produce a safe packing order, even if one exists.

Show by giving an example \u2013 that is, invent some items and give them weights and strengths of your choosing \u2013 that this strategy might not produce a safe packing order, even if one exists. Solution: Here\u2019s an example: (iv) Consider we have a safe packing order in our bag. Assume that item j sits directly on item i. Suppose also that: (weight of j) \u2013 (strength of i) \u2265 (weight of i) \u2013 (strength of j) Show that if we swap items i and j we still have a safe packing order. Solution. First we need to write out what the question states in mathematical language. If the packing is safe, then we know that the following two inequalities hold. (Let the weight above j be W.) W \u2264 (strength of j) (weight above i) \u2264 (strength of i) which is the same as W + (weight of j) \u2264 (strength of i) If we swap items, i is now above j.

We do this by using the inequality immediately above together with the inequality stated in the question, which rearranges as: (weight of i) \u2264 (weight of j) \u2013 (strength of i) + (strength of j) Thus W + (weight of i) \u2264 W + (weight of j) \u2013 (strength of i) + (strength of j) \u2264 (strength of i) \u2013 (strength of i) + (strength of j) = (strength of j) And we are done. (v) Hence suggest a practical method of producing a safe packing order if one exists. Explain why. (Listing all possible orderings is not possible.)

He did not so much interview as allow his guests to almost interview themselves while he listened carefully interjecting only to push them on key points.\u201d Miche\u00e1l Martin, the leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, said Byrne had left an indelible mark on Irish society. \u201cHis intellect and emotional intelligence was unparalleled and his ability to sensitively approach delicate and sometimes controversial issues set him apart from other presenters.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>BAY WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY</h2> \n<p>The Fiver\u2019s German cousin, Vorsprung durch Tin und Lederhosen F\u00fcnfer, was on the blower this weekend, reader, and what a giddy mood he was in! At first, we assumed he\u2019d been on the WeissTin again, because he was just making noises, but then he stopped speaking German and explained that Bayern Munich had given their manager Niko Kovac a kick up die hintern and marched him out of the door marked Do One. And according to F\u00fcnfer, all this means that for the first time in yonks the Bundesliga title race may resemble something more than a season-long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/lewis-hamilton-sixth-f1-world-title-us-grand-prix-bottas\">Lewis Hamilton victory lap</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/03/bayern-munich-niko-kovac\">Bayern\u2019s 5-1 shellacking at Eintracht Frankfurt</a> on Saturday left last season\u2019s double winners languishing \u2026 um \u2026 four points off the top with a dire record of \u2026 um \u2026 10 wins, three draws, and three losses in all competitions. To add to their shame, they are <em>only</em> five points clear at the top of their Big Cup group, too! Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid all have similar records this season but none of them have hoofed their managers yet, have they?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/rangnick-wenger-allegri-ten-hag-bayern-new-coach-kovac\">Ralf Rangnick and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger on Bayern shortlist to replace Niko Kovac</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe performances of our team in recent weeks and the results have shown us that there was a need for action,\u201d blabbed chief suit Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, while triple-bolting the Allianz Arena exit door behind him. Kovac must have been fuming. \u201cI think this is the right decision for the club at this point in time.\u201d Ah. Perhaps not. Which makes The Fiver believe that not only do we know nothing about human feelings but we also know nothing about just how intensely the humourless Bavarians hate their team being laughed at. It\u2019s hypocritical really, considering they have made ridiculing their players an annual tradition by dressing them like garden gnomes, giving them oversized tankards of Tin and making them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/07/bayern-munich-go-from-silky-smooth-to-ragged-in-four-short-days-bundesliga-hoffenheim\">pose for Oktoberfest photographs</a>.</p> \n<p>The Fiver can\u2019t help but think that the timing of the decision may have had as much to do with the club\u2019s super chief suit Uli Hoeness\u2019s upcoming departure on 15 November as it does with the quality of Bayern\u2019s football.

      "bodyText": "BAY WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY The Fiver\u2019s German cousin, Vorsprung durch Tin und Lederhosen F\u00fcnfer, was on the blower this weekend, reader, and what a giddy mood he was in! At first, we assumed he\u2019d been on the WeissTin again, because he was just making noises, but then he stopped speaking German and explained that Bayern Munich had given their manager Niko Kovac a kick up die hintern and marched him out of the door marked Do One. And according to F\u00fcnfer, all this means that for the first time in yonks the Bundesliga title race may resemble something more than a season-long Lewis Hamilton victory lap. Bayern\u2019s 5-1 shellacking at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday left last season\u2019s double winners languishing \u2026 um \u2026 four points off the top with a dire record of \u2026 um \u2026 10 wins, three draws, and three losses in all competitions. To add to their shame, they are only five points clear at the top of their Big Cup group, too! Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid all have similar records this season but none of them have hoofed their managers yet, have they? \u201cThe performances of our team in recent weeks and the results have shown us that there was a need for action,\u201d blabbed chief suit Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, while triple-bolting the Allianz Arena exit door behind him. Kovac must have been fuming. \u201cI think this is the right decision for the club at this point in time.\u201d Ah. Perhaps not. Which makes The Fiver believe that not only do we know nothing about human feelings but we also know nothing about just how intensely the humourless Bavarians hate their team being laughed at. It\u2019s hypocritical really, considering they have made ridiculing their players an annual tradition by dressing them like garden gnomes, giving them oversized tankards of Tin and making them pose for Oktoberfest photographs. The Fiver can\u2019t help but think that the timing of the decision may have had as much to do with the club\u2019s super chief suit Uli Hoeness\u2019s upcoming departure on 15 November as it does with the quality of Bayern\u2019s football. Hoeness, who has never been one to keep his trap shut when headlines can be made, said only two days ago that decisions taken at the club were \u201calways about FC Bayern and not individuals\u201d. Unless that individual is him, which may explain why he tapped into his inner Jack Nicholson, grabbed his axe, and decided to go out swinging. Hoeness now has just enough time to have a say in who replaces Kovac and the chatter on Monday was that there are four leading names: Max Allegri, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and, wait for it, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger! Yes, sorry Jos\u00e9, Wenger\u2019s ability to speak German has made him a very real contender for the Bundesliga\u2019s biggest job. In 2017, Wenger\u2019s Arsenal were on the end of two 5-1 thrashings by Bayern Munich in the space of a fortnight. He knows all about turning an ailing mega-club around after being humbled by such a scoreline doesn\u2019t he? Oh.

Hamilton talked about the need to enjoy the moment but he also said that \u201cfrom the outside things always look great but it\u2019s not always the case. And I am also struggling with lots of different things and battling certain demons.\u201d He was reluctant to elaborate other than to say that everyone has to wrestle with personal challenges in everyday life; negative thoughts and events that demand a positive outlook in response if they are to be overcome. Certainly the death of the Mercedes adviser and mentor Niki Lauda in May cast a shadow over the season. Hamilton also referenced the death of Anthoine Hubert, the 22-year-old Formula Two driver killed in a crash at Spa-Francorchamps in August. \u201cI saw it on the TV, I saw it happen,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThat again, when something like that happens, it can put lots of doubts in your mind and batting that off and thinking \u2018OK, jeez, is it time to stop or shall I keep going because there\u2019s lots of life afterwards?\u2019 I still want to spend time with my family, I still want to have a family one day, all these different things, but I\u2019m so charged to do and I love doing what I do so much that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot that can particularly stop me in that sense.\u201d Bottas\u2019s impressive drive from pole to win his fourth race of the year \u2013 the best season\u2019s haul of his seven-year F1 career \u2013 suggests that, if the 30-year-old Finn continues to improve, he may push Hamilton closer next season (Bottas is second in the standings, 67 points adrift of Hamilton). Ferrari may have something to say about that, provided they can conquer reliability problems and cut out the errors that have pockmarked their campaign. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the quickest package for a long time but we were able to make the least mistakes on Sunday and that was probably the biggest key of making us win the championship,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cThere is a reason why the Schumacher record stands, because it\u2019s just very difficult.\u201d Still, it would be no surprise if Hamilton made it four in a row in 2020 and Wolff added: \u201cIf we are able to provide our drivers with a good car next year that is competitive, we continue to work on the gaps we still have, try to minimise mistakes, and Lewis has a good season, I think there is no reason why he couldn\u2019t go for a seventh title.\u201d Before that 2019 concludes with races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. \u201cUsually the reflection comes at the end of the year, when work finishes and you can just take a load off and just sit back and have a beer,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI will be with my dogs, with my feet up and just only then can you have a moment to grasp how great a year it has been. \u201cIn my mind I\u2019m just too competitive, so I\u2019m thinking: \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got two more races to go. How am I going to do a better job?\u2019\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Twelve billion miles from Earth, there is an elusive boundary that marks the edge of the sun\u2019s realm and the start of interstellar space. When Voyager 2, the longest-running space mission, crossed that frontier more than 40 years after its launch it sent a faint signal from the other side that scientists have now decoded. The Nasa craft is the second ever to travel beyond the heliosphere, the bubble of supersonic charged particles streaming outwards from the sun. Despite setting off a month ahead of its twin, Voyager 1, it crossed the threshold into interstellar space more than six years behind, after taking the scenic route across the solar system and providing what remain the only close-up images of Uranus and Neptune. Now Voyager 2 has sent back the most detailed look yet at the edge of our solar system \u2013 despite Nasa scientists having no idea at the outset that it would survive to see this landmark. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how large the bubble was and we certainly didn\u2019t know that the spacecraft could live long enough to reach the edge of the bubble and enter interstellar space,\u201d said Prof Ed Stone, of the California Institute of Technology, who has been working on the mission since before its launch in 1977. The heliosphere can be thought of as a cosmic weather front: a distinct boundary where charged particles rushing outwards from the sun at supersonic speed meet a cooler, interstellar wind blowing in from supernovae that exploded millions of years ago. It was once thought that the solar wind faded away gradually with distance, but Voyager 1 confirmed there was a boundary, defined by a sudden drop in temperature and an increase in the density of charged particles, known as plasma. The second set of measurements, by Voyager 2, give new insights into the nature of the heliosphere\u2019s limits because on Voyager 1 a crucial instrument designed to directly measure the properties of plasma had broken in 1980. Measurements published in five separate papers in Nature Astronomy reveal that Voyager 2 encountered a much sharper, thinner heliosphere boundary than Voyager 1. This could be due to Voyager 1 crossing during a solar maximum (activity is currently at a low) or the craft itself might have crossed through on a less perpendicular trajectory that meant it ended up spending longer at the edge. The second data point also gives some insight into the shape of the heliosphere, tracing out a leading edge something like a blunt bullet. \u201cIt implies that the heliosphere is symmetric, at least at the two points where the Voyager spacecraft crossed,\u201d said Bill Kurth, a University of Iowa research scientist and a co-author on one of the studies. \u201cThat says that these two points on the surface are almost at the same distance.\u201d Voyager 2 also gives additional clues to the thickness of the heliosheath, the outer region of the heliosphere and the point where the solar wind piles up against the approaching wind in interstellar space, like the bow wave sent out ahead of a ship in the ocean. The data also feeds into a debate about the overall shape of the heliosphere, which some models predict ought to be spherical and others more like a wind sock, with a long tail floating out behind as the solar system moves through the galaxy at high speed. The shape depends, in a complex way, on the relative strengths of the magnetic fields inside and outside of the heliosphere, and the latest measurements are suggestive of a more spherical form. There are limits to how much can be gleaned from two data points, however. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like looking at an elephant with a microscope,\u201d Kurth said. \u201cTwo people go up to an elephant with a microscope, and they come up with two different measurements. You have no idea what\u2019s going on in between.\u201d From beyond the heliosphere, the signal from Voyager 2 is still beaming back, taking more than 16 hours to reach Earth.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of primary school-aged children are being needlessly criminalised because of the \u201cridiculously young\u201d age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales, according to experts who are calling for it to be increased. Representatives from youth services, the justice system and politicians are urging the government to raise the minimum age a child can be convicted of a crime by at least two years from 10 to 12, in response to the Guardian\u2019s investigation into youth courts. Currently, a child aged 10 can be convicted of a crime and subjected to a police investigation, potentially resulting in them having a criminal record for life. Despite repeated criticism and pressure from the UN and other groups to raise the age to at least 12, the internationally recognised minimum, the UK government has so far resisted. No other country in the EU criminalises such young children, with the age of criminal responsibility set at 14 in Germany, 15 in Sweden, 16 in Portugal and 18 in Luxembourg. Charlie Taylor, the head of the Youth Justice Board, said England and Wales was \u201cstarting to look like an anomaly\u201d. \u201cWe need to look at it again,\u201d he said, indicating he would support an increase, along with the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services, one of the most senior police officers in the country, the Association of Youth Offending Team Managers, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, and the leading children\u2019s legal charity, Just for Kids Law. Taylor, a former headteacher, began to question the age of criminal responsibility when a 10-year-old he knew was made to stand trial for rape at the Old Bailey. \u201cIt was a really difficult and complicated case but I had the sense throughout that of: \u2018Really? Is this really the right place to be?\u2019 He wasn\u2019t remanded or anything and he didn\u2019t receive a custodial sentence but it was an eye-opener,\u201d said Taylor. Olivia Pinkney, the national policing lead for children and young people, said 10 years old was a \u201cremarkably low\u201d age of criminal responsibility. She added that from her experience as chief constable of Hampshire constabulary, it was very difficult for such young children to understand \u201cwhat is happening to them if they\u2019re going through the full consequences of the law\u201d. \u201cThere are other ways now of protecting the public\u201d than there were when the age of criminal responsibility was decided, she said. Longfield described the youth courts as \u201cchaotic and dysfunctional\u201d, calling for a complete review and revealing plans for a project looking into the youth criminal justice system next year. \u201cIt is an area we have not yet shone a light on and we wanted to get firsthand experience of what was going on. It is not a child-friendly environment where you could really help a young person and is not meeting standards that we had hoped,\u201d she said. Longfield is calling for the age to be raised to 12 as a first step before being raised again to 14. Last month, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the former lord chief justice of England and Wales, called for the age of criminal responsibility to be raised from 10 to at least 12 in a strongly worded report on the justice system in Wales. The report said: \u201cThere are better ways to deal with children and young people than criminalising them \u2026 The current age of criminal responsibility at 10 is too young. It does not comply with United Nations convention on the rights of the child \u2026 We consider it should be raised to at least 12.\u201d John Bache, the chair of the Magistrates\u2019 Association, who has been a youth magistrate for 27 years, said that although cases concerning children younger than 13 were much rarer than they used to be, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of sense in making it either 13 or 14 \u2013 as it is in an awful lot of European countries\u201d. This autumn, Scotland will stop prosecuting anyone under the age of 12 after its parliament voted unanimously to raise the age of criminal responsibility from eight. The Scottish law also provides certain safeguards to ensure that harmful behaviour by children under 12 can be responded to in an \u201cappropriate and meaningful way\u201d, which will not criminalise children. In England and Wales, a private member\u2019s bill to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12 had been awaiting its second reading in the Commons before parliament was suspended in the runup to the Queen\u2019s speech. The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Navnit Dholakia, who brought forward the proposed new law, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that today\u2019s 10- and 11-year-olds were being criminalised by a law made in 1963, when the age of criminalisation was raised from eight to 10. \u201cIt\u2019s about time we look at this particular issue and say: \u2018Do young people at the age of 10 have the capacity to understand the seriousness of what they have done?\u2019\u201d he said. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has urged reform across the UK after the UN\u2019s committee on the rights of the child (UNCRC) decided the global minimum age at which a child can be prosecuted should be 14. Andy Peaden, the head of Leeds youth justice service who represents all heads of youth offending teams in England and Wales, said 10 was \u201cridiculously young\u201d to be prosecuting children and the age should be raised. \u201cWhen you work with young people on a regular basis it\u2019s absolutely apparent that 10-year-olds are not able to be wholly held to account for the stuff they do,\u201d he said. Aika Stephenson, the legal director at Just for Kids Law, said the low age was \u201cabsolutely crazy\u201d. Describing the difficulty in representing 11-year-olds and trying to explain the meaning of a police caution, she said: \u201cWhat we are expecting of children at that age is quite ridiculous.\u201d David Lammy, the Labour MP who undertook a review for the government in 2017 on the overrepresentation of people from BAME backgrounds in the criminal justice system, would support increasing the age of majority \u2013 the age when someone is deemed an adult \u2013 which currently stands at 18. He pointed to Germany, which treats young people under 21 as juveniles if they show a lack of maturity. \u201cOur system has no such flexibility,\u201d he said. Stuart Gallimore, from the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services, responsible for children\u2019s services at every council in England, said it too would support an increase in the age of criminal responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think the general public need fear that all of a sudden there would be this huge group of people who are now not going to face justice, particularly if we find other ways of dealing with their behaviours. Often it\u2019s just the stupidity of age,\u201d he said. But, Taylor believes, the case of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, who killed the two-year-old James Bulger in 1993, has prevented successive governments from changing the age of criminal responsibility. Recalling the CCTV images of the boys leading James away from Bootle shopping centre, he said: \u201cI think those images of those children holding hands has been such a powerful image so it does loom large.\u201d No 10- or 11-year-olds have been sentenced to custody since 2011, when two brothers from Edlington in South Yorkshire admitted beating and torturing another pair of boys. The government said it had no plans to raise the age of criminal responsibility. A spokesman said: \u201cSetting the age of criminal responsibility at 10 provides flexibility in addressing offending behaviour by children and allows for early intervention to help prevent further offending.\u201d",

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally. In the UK, women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for cervical screening every three years. While cervical screening can save lives, many women find having a clinician take a swab of their cervix unpleasant, embarrassing or are worried it will hurt, with recent figures from Public Health England (PHE) revealing a quarter of women do not attend their appointment. At present, swabs are carried out by medical professionals to see if there are any abnormal cells in the cervix, which would mean a referral for further investigation.

Catt and Bartlett were hooked on the One Coin swindle, with its twists and turns and tales of ordinary people who lost it all. The first such person they meet, Jen McAdam, not only invested her own money but convinced her family to invest theirs too, to the tune of \u00a3220,000.<strong> </strong>But more than that, they were intrigued by its founder, Bulgarian-born Dr Ruja Ignatova, who went to ground in 2017, just as law enforcement were starting get wind of the company. Ignatova was due to attend an event in Lisbon, but boarded a plane to Athens and disappeared. Her brother Konstantin has since been detained by the FBI.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7204c427939ccf1e53bbc60a4de2ffc48cc0a11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7204c427939ccf1e53bbc60a4de2ffc48cc0a11/67_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Missing Cryptoqueen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huge hit ... The Missing Cryptoqueen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The podcast skilfully weaves the thrilling story of Ignatova \u2013 a glamorous, Oxford-educated entrepreneur who attracted vast audiences to her One Coin lectures \u2013 with that of her company, as Catt and Bartlett piece together what became of her. Their search has taken them to places as diverse as a beauty pageant in Romania run by One Coin and a town in southern Germany where Ignatova\u2019s family once owned a metallurgic factory. Week by week, the story has veered off on strange tangents.</p> <p>Its blend of on-trend true crime and cautionary tech tale also means that the story has continued to unfold during production. Last week\u2019s penultimate episode was delayed by five days, when they decided to go abroad to follow a potential lead to Ignatova. Besides, says Bartlett, delving into something that is still very much live (One Coin continues to operate, despite evidence of nefarious activity) is unnerving. \u201cIt can be a bit scary,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you go online there are all these rumours circulating. We don\u2019t go into it too much, partly for legal reasons, but the rumours are about who is really involved, the shadowy people behind it, which criminal groups are involved \u2013 we\u2019ve had that all in the background.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, they have continued to dig into Ignatova\u2019s background, keen to find out what made someone turn her talents to such an iniquitous scheme. \u201cShe is an unbelievably fascinating person,\u201d says Bartlett. \u201cShe is incredibly brave in a strange sort of way, and a weird figure of obsession to the people that follow her. Our view of her went from \u2018paper thin front person\u2019 to \u2018incredibly intelligent and highly skilled\u2019 to where I am now, which is \u2013 as Ruja says herself in one of the FBI documents \u2013 \u2018an expert in dealing in the grey area of life\u2019, and finding gaps in rules and laws.\u201d The podcasters wonder if the Cryptoqueen might be out there somewhere, listening to their podcast. \u201cI reckon she is,\u201d says Catt. </p> <p>As they release the final episode \u2013 an \u201ceven more devastating\u201d chapter of the One Coin scam in Uganda, says Catt \u2013 they hope to tie everything together. \u201cWe thought it was important to end with people really feeling the real human cost of something like this,\u201d says Bartlett, adding that they owe a debt to the victims of the scam. \u201cHowever nerveracking it has been for us, it\u2019s been much scarier for them.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Missing Cryptoqueen is available on BBC Sounds</p>",

The first such person they meet, Jen McAdam, not only invested her own money but convinced her family to invest theirs too, to the tune of \u00a3220,000. But more than that, they were intrigued by its founder, Bulgarian-born Dr Ruja Ignatova, who went to ground in 2017, just as law enforcement were starting get wind of the company. Ignatova was due to attend an event in Lisbon, but boarded a plane to Athens and disappeared. Her brother Konstantin has since been detained by the FBI. The podcast skilfully weaves the thrilling story of Ignatova \u2013 a glamorous, Oxford-educated entrepreneur who attracted vast audiences to her One Coin lectures \u2013 with that of her company, as Catt and Bartlett piece together what became of her. Their search has taken them to places as diverse as a beauty pageant in Romania run by One Coin and a town in southern Germany where Ignatova\u2019s family once owned a metallurgic factory. Week by week, the story has veered off on strange tangents. Its blend of on-trend true crime and cautionary tech tale also means that the story has continued to unfold during production. Last week\u2019s penultimate episode was delayed by five days, when they decided to go abroad to follow a potential lead to Ignatova. Besides, says Bartlett, delving into something that is still very much live (One Coin continues to operate, despite evidence of nefarious activity) is unnerving. \u201cIt can be a bit scary,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you go online there are all these rumours circulating. We don\u2019t go into it too much, partly for legal reasons, but the rumours are about who is really involved, the shadowy people behind it, which criminal groups are involved \u2013 we\u2019ve had that all in the background.\u201d Nevertheless, they have continued to dig into Ignatova\u2019s background, keen to find out what made someone turn her talents to such an iniquitous scheme. \u201cShe is an unbelievably fascinating person,\u201d says Bartlett. \u201cShe is incredibly brave in a strange sort of way, and a weird figure of obsession to the people that follow her. Our view of her went from \u2018paper thin front person\u2019 to \u2018incredibly intelligent and highly skilled\u2019 to where I am now, which is \u2013 as Ruja says herself in one of the FBI documents \u2013 \u2018an expert in dealing in the grey area of life\u2019, and finding gaps in rules and laws.\u201d The podcasters wonder if the Cryptoqueen might be out there somewhere, listening to their podcast. \u201cI reckon she is,\u201d says Catt. As they release the final episode \u2013 an \u201ceven more devastating\u201d chapter of the One Coin scam in Uganda, says Catt \u2013 they hope to tie everything together. \u201cWe thought it was important to end with people really feeling the real human cost of something like this,\u201d says Bartlett, adding that they owe a debt to the victims of the scam. \u201cHowever nerveracking it has been for us, it\u2019s been much scarier for them.\u201d \u2022 The Missing Cryptoqueen is available on BBC Sounds",

They said measures that could have achieved these aims had been suggested in the wake of other high-profile collapses such as that of outsourcing firm Carillion, but that the government had failed to take them forward. Business minister Andrea Leadsom also came in for criticism for her \u201clack of interest\u201d in the weeks leading up to Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, after the Guardian revealed she did not meet executives from the company as it teetered on the brink. Rachel Reeves, the committee chair, said: \u201cThe piling up of debt, confused business plans, lack of challenge in the boardroom and by auditors, and aggressive accounting practices all contributed to the failure of the business. \u201cThe failure at Thomas Cook has also been notable for the extraordinary lack of interest shown by the business department and its secretary of state in the days and weeks leading up to the collapse. \u201cIt is also a matter of fact that many of the necessary measures on audit, on executive pay, and on corporate governance have been sitting in the government\u2019s in-tray for months.\u201d In a letter to Leadsom, the committee made a series of recommendations to toughen up corporate governance, including stronger provisions to claw back bonuses from directors when companies fail.

      "body": "<p>Back in the summer, when the recently promoted Osasuna were building a squad for their return to La Liga, they sent videos to the players they were trying to persuade to join them. They did not have much money \u2013 only three teams have a smaller budget \u2013 and they did not have success to sell, either: the second division title is the only thing they have won and they had just done that for the first time in 58 years. But they could offer something different.</p> <p>When the tapes went out, sales pitches carefully edited in-house, they were not filled with 101 great goals, superb saves or glorious games. Instead they were packed with people. The footage was not of footballers; it was of fans. It was who they are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/european-roundup-barcelona-levante-bayern-frankfurt-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a\">European roundup: Bar\u00e7a lose at Levante as Frankfurt thrash Bayern</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Osasuna sold El Sadar \u2013 the place that can feel like the one, last old ground left even though, opened in 1967, it is not <em>that</em> old. It is a ground where the main stand is so steep, so tight that you feel as if you will tumble on to the pitch below. Punk is played at half-time and fans reach out and touch you, legs dangling over the barriers, banging the drum, flags waving, noise never letting up, team never letting up either. </p> <p>It is the kind of place you would want to play \u2013 if, that is, you are the kind of player they would want playing for them. And Ezequiel \u201cChimy\u201d \u00c1vila was exactly the kind of player they wanted playing for them: the striker with big thighs and an even bigger heart whom the sporting director, Braulio V\u00e1zquez, introduced as \u201cborn to play for Osasuna\u201d. First, though, he had to convince Chimy of that.</p> <p>Chimy was not the only footballer sent footage \u2013 Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n and Facundo Roncaglia were also among the seven players signed \u2013 but he is the new signing who best represents Osasuna\u2019s plans, the identity they were celebrating and reinforcing.</p> <p>\u201cOur fans are our greatest asset. We don\u2019t have much money or the talent other teams have but we have them. You have to make players see it\u2019s a special place,\u201d Braulio says. \u201cWe wanted them to know where they were coming. Here in Pamplona players are God. We sent videos of the fans, how they\u2019re on top of everyone, how they react, how they celebrate. And they really liked them.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to conquer his heart; there\u2019s an emotional element to it. I said to Chimy: \u2018Imagine the whole of El Sadar chanting: Chimy! Chimy!\u2019 He laughed at that: \u2018I can see it already!\u2019 He had other offers but this was the place for him. I told him maybe at Betis, say, the fans like a nutmeg more but here, if you sprint back 50 metres, kill yourself to defend, you\u2019re an idol. At some clubs you might get whistled but, when he missed a sitter against Villarreal, they were all: \u2018Chimy! Chimy!\u2019 And then he scores a brilliant goal.\u201d</p> <p>By then Chimy knew. At his presentation he already knew. The tapes did the trick. \u201cThis is a club where I feel people will love me,\u201d he said back then and he was right.</p> <p>Now an idol in the city and in a team that have played even better than anyone imagined, he says: \u201cWhen Braulio sent me the video of them celebrating promotion, it was emotional seeing the fans. That really got me. And being able to experience it for myself is lovely. That\u2019s why I took the decision to come and I\u2019m happy I did.\u201d At his presentation Chimy promised: \u201cTheir style\u2019s mine: run, crash into people, never give up,\u201d and that starts in the stands.</p> <p>There is a reason that Osasuna won 17 home games in a row on their way to the second division title last year and did not lose at El Sadar all season. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say there were eight games we won because of the fans,\u201d says the striker Brandon Thomas. \u201cThat\u2019s what this club is.\u201d</p> <p>As the captain, Roberto Torres, told El Pa\u00eds: \u201cIn that sense I think Osasuna genuinely is a bit different. Here, unlike other places, fans support Osasuna, not Madrid or Barcelona. Tradition has been lost a bit, the essence of football. Few care about the fans, when they are what really matters. El Sadar\u2019s always been a slightly more \u2018English\u2019 ground. They used to say big teams feared coming.\u201d</p> <p>Now they do again. Barcelona drew 2-2 there and Valencia were hammered 3- 1, but this is more than just a couple of games and more than fans making a lot of noise or a team being good at home. It is that \u2013 as the manager, Jagoba Arrasate, put it on Sunday night after their 4-2 victory against Alav\u00e9s \u2013 they are \u201cbinomial\u201d. Fans and footballers go \u201chand in hand\u201d. Game and ground are inseparable. This team belong in this place; it is this place. Arrasate understands that best. The idea was there but he is the one who fully re\u2011established that relationship when he took over before last season . . . play constructed around the people, their personality.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the start he wanted to recover that traditional identity, to go for it,\u201d says the winger Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00cca, superb last season and this campaign. \u201cHe told everyone there has to be a communion. With every run, every tackle, the fans lift you; they are the adrenaline you need.\u201d</p> <p>Osasuna play as if someone has cut their brake cables and it is much better that way. At home, at least, they go, go, go and then, when they have their breath back or even if they have not, they go again. They isolate opponents and chase them down, terrified. When they get the ball, it is much the same. It is relentless; every pass played with intent, going for the throat, every move played as if it was the last, time running out. </p> <p>On Sunday night a wild game finished 4-2 and the fact there were three penalties and endless stoppages for VAR \u2013 El Sadar is one of the few places to make them fun, drum rolls building to the decision \u2013 took nothing from a match one paper called \u201cblessed madness\u201d.</p> <p>Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00eda scored the first, Chimy swept in an exceptional second, first time on the bounce, and V\u00edctor Laguardia got one back for Alav\u00e9s a minute later with a finish almost as good: another half-volley, hit superbly. Torres made it 3-1 six minutes into additional time at the end of the first half and Lucas P\u00e9rez brought it back to 3-2 with another penalty, before a third from Juan Villar made it 4-2. They had been playing 55 minutes and there had been six goals but, though there were no more, it was not over. In fact, it was getting better.</p> <p>The afternoon had started with Garc\u00eda forcing a save from Fernando Pacheco after 20 seconds and ended with Inigo P\u00e9rez smashing off the post in added time, just as Nacho Vidal had hammered off the bar.

The run goes back 582 days, to April 2018, and it brought Osasuna up, put them three points off a Champions League place and secured 18 primera points, almost halfway to survival already: 31 is a record, beating the previous best set 61 years ago.</p> <p>The following morning at Tajonar, the club\u2019s training ground, a man set off rockets. \u201cHistoric,\u201d cheered the cover of El Diario de Navarra. \u201cO\u00e9 o\u00e9 o\u00e9 o\u00e9 o\u00e9 o\u00e9,\u201d ran the headline inside.

      "bodyText": "Back in the summer, when the recently promoted Osasuna were building a squad for their return to La Liga, they sent videos to the players they were trying to persuade to join them. They did not have much money \u2013 only three teams have a smaller budget \u2013 and they did not have success to sell, either: the second division title is the only thing they have won and they had just done that for the first time in 58 years. But they could offer something different. When the tapes went out, sales pitches carefully edited in-house, they were not filled with 101 great goals, superb saves or glorious games. Instead they were packed with people. The footage was not of footballers; it was of fans. It was who they are. Osasuna sold El Sadar \u2013 the place that can feel like the one, last old ground left even though, opened in 1967, it is not that old. It is a ground where the main stand is so steep, so tight that you feel as if you will tumble on to the pitch below. Punk is played at half-time and fans reach out and touch you, legs dangling over the barriers, banging the drum, flags waving, noise never letting up, team never letting up either. It is the kind of place you would want to play \u2013 if, that is, you are the kind of player they would want playing for them. And Ezequiel \u201cChimy\u201d \u00c1vila was exactly the kind of player they wanted playing for them: the striker with big thighs and an even bigger heart whom the sporting director, Braulio V\u00e1zquez, introduced as \u201cborn to play for Osasuna\u201d. First, though, he had to convince Chimy of that. Chimy was not the only footballer sent footage \u2013 Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n and Facundo Roncaglia were also among the seven players signed \u2013 but he is the new signing who best represents Osasuna\u2019s plans, the identity they were celebrating and reinforcing. \u201cOur fans are our greatest asset. We don\u2019t have much money or the talent other teams have but we have them. You have to make players see it\u2019s a special place,\u201d Braulio says. \u201cWe wanted them to know where they were coming. Here in Pamplona players are God. We sent videos of the fans, how they\u2019re on top of everyone, how they react, how they celebrate. And they really liked them. \u201cWe had to conquer his heart; there\u2019s an emotional element to it. I said to Chimy: \u2018Imagine the whole of El Sadar chanting: Chimy! Chimy!\u2019 He laughed at that: \u2018I can see it already!\u2019 He had other offers but this was the place for him. I told him maybe at Betis, say, the fans like a nutmeg more but here, if you sprint back 50 metres, kill yourself to defend, you\u2019re an idol. At some clubs you might get whistled but, when he missed a sitter against Villarreal, they were all: \u2018Chimy! Chimy!\u2019 And then he scores a brilliant goal.\u201d By then Chimy knew. At his presentation he already knew. The tapes did the trick. \u201cThis is a club where I feel people will love me,\u201d he said back then and he was right. Now an idol in the city and in a team that have played even better than anyone imagined, he says: \u201cWhen Braulio sent me the video of them celebrating promotion, it was emotional seeing the fans. That really got me. And being able to experience it for myself is lovely. That\u2019s why I took the decision to come and I\u2019m happy I did.\u201d At his presentation Chimy promised: \u201cTheir style\u2019s mine: run, crash into people, never give up,\u201d and that starts in the stands. There is a reason that Osasuna won 17 home games in a row on their way to the second division title last year and did not lose at El Sadar all season. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say there were eight games we won because of the fans,\u201d says the striker Brandon Thomas. \u201cThat\u2019s what this club is.\u201d As the captain, Roberto Torres, told El Pa\u00eds: \u201cIn that sense I think Osasuna genuinely is a bit different. Here, unlike other places, fans support Osasuna, not Madrid or Barcelona. Tradition has been lost a bit, the essence of football. Few care about the fans, when they are what really matters. El Sadar\u2019s always been a slightly more \u2018English\u2019 ground. They used to say big teams feared coming.\u201d Now they do again. Barcelona drew 2-2 there and Valencia were hammered 3- 1, but this is more than just a couple of games and more than fans making a lot of noise or a team being good at home. It is that \u2013 as the manager, Jagoba Arrasate, put it on Sunday night after their 4-2 victory against Alav\u00e9s \u2013 they are \u201cbinomial\u201d. Fans and footballers go \u201chand in hand\u201d. Game and ground are inseparable. This team belong in this place; it is this place. Arrasate understands that best. The idea was there but he is the one who fully re\u2011established that relationship when he took over before last season . . . play constructed around the people, their personality. \u201cFrom the start he wanted to recover that traditional identity, to go for it,\u201d says the winger Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00cca, superb last season and this campaign. \u201cHe told everyone there has to be a communion. With every run, every tackle, the fans lift you; they are the adrenaline you need.\u201d Osasuna play as if someone has cut their brake cables and it is much better that way. At home, at least, they go, go, go and then, when they have their breath back or even if they have not, they go again. They isolate opponents and chase them down, terrified. When they get the ball, it is much the same. It is relentless; every pass played with intent, going for the throat, every move played as if it was the last, time running out. On Sunday night a wild game finished 4-2 and the fact there were three penalties and endless stoppages for VAR \u2013 El Sadar is one of the few places to make them fun, drum rolls building to the decision \u2013 took nothing from a match one paper called \u201cblessed madness\u201d. Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00eda scored the first, Chimy swept in an exceptional second, first time on the bounce, and V\u00edctor Laguardia got one back for Alav\u00e9s a minute later with a finish almost as good: another half-volley, hit superbly. Torres made it 3-1 six minutes into additional time at the end of the first half and Lucas P\u00e9rez brought it back to 3-2 with another penalty, before a third from Juan Villar made it 4-2. They had been playing 55 minutes and there had been six goals but, though there were no more, it was not over. In fact, it was getting better.

In the meantime Alav\u00e9s had 12 shots and Osasuna racked up 19 to go with the 30 against Valencia. \u201cOur games are anything but dull,\u201d Braulio says. \u201cYou\u2019re winning 4-2 but at the end, you\u2019ve got one full-back crossing for the other.\u201d Osasuna are, he says, like Liverpool; Arrasate is the Spanish J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference, eh,\u201d he adds swiftly, laughing, but there is something in it. \u201cPeople have fun watching us. It\u2019s the rhythm, the speed, the intensity. We\u2019re very vertical. It\u2019s all very back and forth. But it\u2019s not just that we run and put a foot in. We play, too.

      "body": "<p>On Saturday night, Donald Trump made another rare public foray, attending a UFC match in New York City. He was roundly booed, though not as aggressively or creatively as he was at a World Series game in Washington last month. Pundits have already speculated about what it all meant \u2013 an affluent DC crowd raging against Trump, versus a slightly friendlier New York crowd where everyone had gathered to watch a physical fight \u2013 though it\u2019s all but useless divining any serious implications about 2020.</p> <p>Trump, unlike every other president in modern times, has <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203207/trump-job-approval-weekly.aspx\">never held a positive approval rating</a> in a Gallup poll. This alone will make winning a second term inordinately difficult, though not impossible.

      "bodyText": "On Saturday night, Donald Trump made another rare public foray, attending a UFC match in New York City. He was roundly booed, though not as aggressively or creatively as he was at a World Series game in Washington last month. Pundits have already speculated about what it all meant \u2013 an affluent DC crowd raging against Trump, versus a slightly friendlier New York crowd where everyone had gathered to watch a physical fight \u2013 though it\u2019s all but useless divining any serious implications about 2020. Trump, unlike every other president in modern times, has never held a positive approval rating in a Gallup poll. This alone will make winning a second term inordinately difficult, though not impossible. The black swan victory of 2016 could always repeat itself, in newer and stranger ways.

Goodwill is an accounting concept that refers to the intangible asset of an acquired company which measures things like reputation, customer base and brand value.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are therefore very disappointed to find yet another corporate collapse in which goodwill has played a major part. <br></p> <p>Both PwC and EY told us that they asked the right questions and challenged Thomas Cook\u2019s management.

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets are rallying to record highs, on hopes that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping may sign a provisional trade deal later this month. Britain\u2019s construction sector has suffered another contraction, as Brexit uncertainty hits builders. Eurozone factories were also in decline last month, led by the manufacturing recession in Germany, the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy. Italy and Spain struggled, but French industry posted some growth. The UK arm of Mothercare is to go into administration, after bosses gave up hope of returning it to profitability and failed to find a buyer for the business. The move puts 2,500 jobs at risk. Goodbye, and thank you for all your comments \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. JJ US stock markets have retreated slightly from previous highs after the factory data. Investors face a tricky balancing act, with a darkening economic picture on the one hand and an unpredictable political environment on the other. On the other side of the coin, data just in on US factories makes for less optimistic reading. US factory orders fell by 0.6% in September, according to the US Census Bureau. That was worse than the 0.1% fall in August, and also lower than the 0.5% decline expected by economists. Non-defence aircraft were the second-biggest fallers, although the shadow cast by Boeing\u2019s 737 Max crisis is likely an important factor. A fun graph: the Dow Jones industrial average from its inception to its latest record high. Be slightly wary though: the nature of the index means that the Great Depression (around the 1929 mark) registers as barely a blip on this scale \u2013 when in fact it was a traumatic period for the world. US President Donald Trump has (perhaps predictably) welcomed the record highs on stock markets. Perhaps slightly more surprisingly, he tweeted it before markets opened \u2013 presumably gambling that futures markets were accurate. The opening bell in New York has delivered some noteworthy new records. The S&amp;P 500 rose above 3,066.95 points, a new record high. The Nasdaq opened at a new record, to 8,444.99 points. Dow Jones industrial average up 0.46%. European shares continue to push higher, notching up increases of more than 1%. The FTSE 100 index in London is up 1.2%. Wall Street is expected to open at record highs in just a few minutes, as optimism about the likelihood of a US-China trade deal spreads. Stock futures are pointing to a rise of 178 points on the Dax, up 0.65%, while the S&amp;P 500 is expected to open 19 points higher, or 0.63%, and the Nasdaq is seen rising 65 points, or 0.8%. MPs reiterated their concerns over potential conflicts of interest at the accounting firms, and called for a clear separation between the audit and non-audit parts of thier businesses. PwC earned \u00a34m from providing \u201crecruitment and remuneration\u201d advice to Thomas Cook while also auditing its accounts. Turning to the audit of Thomas Cook\u2019s accounts, which was initially carried out by PwC and later EY, MPs said they had found a large amount of goodwill that was not written down until this year \u2013 similar to the collapsed construction contractor Carillion. Goodwill is an accounting concept that refers to the intangible asset of an acquired company which measures things like reputation, customer base and brand value. We are therefore very disappointed to find yet another corporate collapse in which goodwill has played a major part. Both PwC and EY told us that they asked the right questions and challenged Thomas Cook\u2019s management. EY said that they had followed accountancy standards and procedures in this respect. If the latter is true, and goodwill is being treated in this way across the FTSE 350, it should be cause for grave concern. This would mean that more Carillion and Thomas Cook collapses are potentially already locked into the system. It also presents a picture of audit automatons that are incapable of drawing the most basic of conclusions from a balance sheet, questioning what they add to the corporate reporting process. Reeves and the rest of the committee recently quizzed bosses from PwC and EY, and accused them of being complicit in the failure of Thomas Cook, Carillion and other firms. MPs said they were \u201cshocked to learn\u201d that Fankhauser, who ran Thomas Cook from 2014 until his collapse, received an annual cash allowance worth 30% of his base salary for his pension contribution. The committee\u2019s recommendation is: As with executive pay, changes to executive pension contributions are needed in order to create a fairer system. We expect the FRC\u2019s replacement to have a role here, alongside pressure from investors, stakeholders and remuneration committees. The committee also called for stronger legal provisions on clawback of bonuses. And here are the BEIS committee\u2019s recommendations to the government, to prevent another massive corporate failure like Thomas Cook. MPs have recommended that executive bonus schemes set by companies\u2019 remuneration committees are \u201cnot only robust, but the measured data on which they are based is too\u201d. They flagged up that the performance measures at Thomas Cook in 2018 did not directly address high levels of debt \u2013 highlighted by the former CEO Peter Fankhauser himself as a key cause of the group\u2019s ultimate demise. You can read the full letter from Reeves to Leadsom here. My colleague Rob Davies reported at the time that the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, did not speak to Thomas Cook executives during increasingly frantic talks between the company and the government leading up to its collapse. He wrote: Records of telephone calls and meetings, seen by the Guardian, indicate government ministers were aware the 178-year-old tour operator\u2019s finances had been deteriorating for months. But the documents show Leadsom and ministers and officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had little to no discussion with the company about its ailing balance sheet until after it had entered liquidation. The business, energy and industrial strategy committee has called on the UK government to push ahead with measures to help avoid the next corporate business failure, following the collapse of Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest travel company, in September. It has written to business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, to express disappointment that the government did not press ahed with audit reforms and and bring forward legislation to replace the Financial Reporting Council with a more effective body, the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority. The committee recommended a new government push by including the legislation in the first Queen\u2019s Speech of the new Parliament. Rachel Reeves, chair of the BEIS committee, said: Our inquiry has been cut short by the election but it\u2019s clear that a series of misjudgements at Thomas Cook led to its collapse. The piling up of debt, confused business plans, lack of challenge in the board room and by auditors, and aggressive accounting practices all contributed to the failure of the business. During our inquiry, we\u2019ve witnessed buck-passing and blame-shifting but precious little humility or reflection from those at the top of the business. Directors and senior management pocketed hefty sums in annual salaries and bonuses that Thomas Cook staff will only have dreamed of earning throughout their entire careers. Mr Fankhauser [the former CEO] told us he would reflect on the huge salaries he has earned. Given the riches which Thomas Cook poured into his pockets I hope that Mr Fankhauser will realise that now is the time to put right the wrong he has done. She also criticised the business department and business secretary for their role in the debacle: The failure at Thomas Cook has been also been notable for the extraordinary lack of interest shown by the Business Department and its Secretary of State in the days and weeks leading up to the collapse. Time for a recap: Britain\u2019s construction sector has suffered another contraction, as Brexit uncertainty hits builders. Civil engineering activity fell at the fastest pace in a decade in October, with large projects on hold. Eurozone factories also contracted last month, led by the ongoing manufacturing recession in Germany. Italy and Spain also struggled, but French industry posted some growth. Global stock markets are rallying, on hopes that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could sign a provisional trade deal this month. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained more than 1%, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 index is at a 21-month high. Shares in gambling firms have fallen sharply, as MPs plan new curbs on online betting. The UK arm of Mothercare is going into administration, after bosses gave up hope of returning it to profitability. The move puts 2,500 jobs at risk. The oil price is also rising today, on hopes that a US-China trade deal would boost growth - and demand for energy. Brent crude has gained 1.5% to $62.58 per barrel. Rupert Thompson, Head of Research at Kingswood, says investors are hopeful that the global economy is picking up, after some weak months: Following a couple of failed attempts in July and September, global equities finally last week broke clear of their January 2018 high. Importantly however, at least for UK investors, the break higher is only in local currency terms. The recent bounce in the pound means global equities, in sterling terms, are still languishing some 4% below their July high. The break higher has been fuelled by increased hopes that global growth is bottoming out. Growth was higher than expected in both the US and Europe in the third quarter and little changed from the previous quarter. US employment gains also beat expectations. They are an important source of support for consumer spending which remains robust and is compensating for falls in business investment. Even so, signs of an actual pick up in global growth are still very tentative. Manufacturing will lead any recovery, just as it has led the slowdown, and the latest numbers are painting a mixed picture both in the US and China. Conflicting signals, however, are to be expected at this stage. Turning points are almost always never clear cut - except with hindsight. Here\u2019s our news story on the UK construction sector\u2019s malaise: The Boeing 737 Max crisis continue to loom over the airline industry. Ryanair has warned today there is \u201ca real risk\u201d it will have no Boeing 737 Max planes flying next summer, if the grounded aircraft doesn\u2019t return to service soon. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Europe\u2019s biggest carrier is sticking to its plans to cut bases and pilot and cabin crew jobs and said it expected to receive its first 737 Max planes in March or April 2020, two months later than expected. The 737 Max remains grounded worldwide after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said: \u201cWe have now reduced our expectation of 30 Max aircraft being delivered to us in advance of peak summer 2020 down to 20 aircraft and there is a real risk of none.\u201d European stock markets are pushing higher, despite the weak eurozone factory data and ongoing slump in UK construction. Investors are clinging onto hopes of a breakthrough in the US-China trade talks, following hints that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could sign a \u2018Phase One\u2019 deal this month. In London, the FTSE 100 index has now gained 83 points, or 1.1%, to 7386 - a one-month high. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index is now 1% higher, at a new 21-month high. President Trump would obviously like a trade war \u2018win\u2019, even though a comprehensive deal seems to be some distance away. Any breakthrough could encourage Trump to drop, or postpone, planned tariffs hikes on Chinese-made technology goods due to kick in next month. Pierre Veyrett, technical analyst at ActivTrades, says the US-China trade talks are the main factor driving the markets. Investors welcomed the significant recent progress on intellectual property theft issues, even though this topic hasn\u2019t been entirely solved yet (some issues may slip to the phase 2 of the deal). A new venue is still to be agreed for a November US-China meeting with President Trump wanting the interim deal to be signed somewhere on US territory..... We believe optimism surrounding the trade dispute is likely to keep on supporting stock prices around the globe this week, especially if US and Chinese data is in line with or continues to beat expectations like last week\u2019s solid non-farm payroll reports. India\u2019s stock market has also got the message, closing at a new record high: Shares in Britain\u2019s gambling companies have also fallen heavily this morning, as parliament pushes for a radical overhaul of the online betting industry. My colleague Rob Davies broke the news overnight. MPs are demanding a \u201croot and branch\u201d overhaul of gambling law, that would mirror a recent clampdown on high street bookmakers. A new report from the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) makes several key recommendations that would protect vulnerable gamblers, including: A \u00a32 stake limit on online slot machines. An end to betting by credit card. Restrictions on \u201cVIP\u201d accounts that can allow people to run up huge debts An investigation into non-disclosure agreements between bookmakers and customers APPG hopes the report will influence government policy, regardless of who wins next month\u2019s election. GVC Holdings, which owns Ladbrokes and Corel, has tumbled by 10% this morning, followed by William Hill (-7%), 888 (-4.7%) and Flutter (formerly Paddy Power) (-2.1%). Here\u2019s Rob\u2019s story: Back in the City, shares in Mothercare have now sunk 30% to a new alltime low after it decided to put its UK operations into administration: Andy Brian, partner and retail expert at law firm Gordons, says supermarket chains helped to destroy its business model. \u201cThe reality is that Mothercare operates in an increasingly competitive sector in the UK, where price-driven customers can easily compare the price of big ticket items online and buy smaller items such as children\u2019s clothing in their local supermarket. It tried, and failed, to make its stores more appealing to young mums in particular, and is yet another stark example of a retail brand to which many feel a nostalgic affinity without actually feeling the need to regularly shop there. Julian Pallett, Head of restructuring and corporate recovery at law firm Gowling WLG, says the high street needs more help: Mothercare is the latest in a long line of businesses struggling to adjust to the rapidly changing retail landscape. The insolvency regime in the UK provides a robust and flexible framework, through CVAs and other procedures, to enable businesses like Mothercare to reshape their liabilities and retail footprint, but often this isn\u2019t enough. Reducing the rent roll and business rates can help a lot, and may also help landlords avoid having empty properties in key locations. In order to survive however, retail businesses may need to go further and look for a radical re-positioning of their business structures and offerings, if they are to survive in the longer term in the face of structural shifts in buying habits and competitor offerings. It\u2019s in the interest of all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, landlords and customers that such efforts are successful. The high street needs all the help it can get. The UK construction PMI report is online here. Jan Crosby, UK head of infrastructure, building and construction at KPMG, warns that confidence across Britain\u2019s building industry is weak. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s weak construction PMI report. \u201cThere had been pockets of optimism in the run up to October 31, largely because people were looking forward to some form of clarity around the future of the sector, but Brexit uncertainty has returned once more, coupled with a general election to boot. \u201cThere is widespread evidence of a sluggish housing market, which is likely causing some housebuilders to slow build rates on sites - particularly those not benefiting from Help to Buy. Meanwhile, the commercial sector also appears to be struggling, with investment in the likes of grade-A office space drying up amid the uncertainty. Many clients are likely to hold off until next year before committing to any large-scale projects in the hope they can make more informed decisions. For now, it\u2019s a case of sitting tight.\u201d Gareth Belsham, director of property consultancy and surveyors Naismiths, says builders are suffering from a drop in new business: Investor appetite remains deeply fragile and many contractors are being pummelled on three fronts. Just as their order books get thinner and erode their confidence, they are being forced to bid low for the shallow pool of new work available \u2013 while at the same time input costs go up and slice into their margins. \u201cNo wonder many construction firms are trying to cut costs where they can, and staffing levels have fallen every month since April. \u201cNevertheless there are some glimmers of hope. While Britain\u2019s Brexit agony has been put on pause by what promises to be an equally divisive election hiatus, the chances of a chaotic \u2018no-deal\u2019 exit have at least diminished. Mark Robinson, chief executive of procurement specialists Scape Group, blames Brexit deadlock: \u201cToday\u2019s data paints an even gloomier picture for construction bosses after an already difficult year. Construction firms are continuing to be knocked from both sides as new work continues to decrease and prices soften. SMEs in particular will be feeling the squeeze, as staffing levels drop and companies race to the bottom to secure the limited amount of contracts that are being pushed forward. \u201cBritish building has largely been put on hold while government gets its ducks in a row, but as our EU exit date continues to be pushed back we cannot continue to stand by and watch the industry shrink The construction industry is always vulnerable to political and economic uncertainty, as today\u2019s PMI report proves. When growth is weakening, it\u2019s hard to persuade clients to invest in major projects - such as a new house or office block. If politicians are caught up in one crisis, they can\u2019t focus on other priorities such as transport infrastructure. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says Britain\u2019s politicians have hurt the building sector: \u201cThe construction sector\u2019s distressing decline continued in October in spite of a small improvement in the headline index as a resolution to the political impasse seemed close. However with a fall in civil engineering not seen for a decade and the biggest drop in housebuilding since 2016, it appears that strength in the sector is seeping away. \u201cJobs hiring suffered as businesses unsure of the Government\u2019s next steps held back on their development plans, which were weakened further by stronger competition for fewer opportunities. Future optimism remained at 2012 levels as the deep-seated Brexit gloom dampened down expectations. \u201cTo say these figures are disappointing is a big understatement. Given that the next political hurdle is December\u2019s General Election, all eyes will be on the new administration and clear direction, because at the moment there is little insight into what could possibly pull the sector out of its ditch.\u201d Some instant reaction to the latest slide in UK construction: Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, says UK construction is enduring its worst slump in several years. He blames the political uncertainty, and growing doubts over some major construction projects (perhaps the HS2 railway scheme which is now being reviewed?) Moore says: \u201cUK construction companies experienced a downturn in business performance during October as political uncertainty and subdued economic conditions again combined to hold back sales. New orders have fallen in each month since April, which is the most prolonged period of decline recorded for more than six years. \u201cCivil engineering was the worst-performing area of activity in October, with business activity dropping at the fastest pace in ten years. Construction companies also voiced concerns about the uncertain outlook for large-scale infrastructure projects upon which growth is expected to rest in the coming years. \u201cHouse building has also lost momentum this autumn amid a broader slowdown in market conditions, with the latest survey data signalling the sharpest drop in residential work since June 2016. Worryingly, business optimism among construction firms is languishing at its lowest levels since 2012. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s construction sector has suffered another sharp drop in activity last month, as Brexit uncertainty hits the building industry. Firms have reported they suffered another drop in work, for the sixth month in a row. New orders fell too, forcing construction firms to cut jobs. Civil engineering shrank at its fastest pace since October 2009, while housebuilding also contracted more rapidly. This pulled the Construction PMI index down to 44.2, below the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction (but up from September\u2019s 43.3). As you can see, the sector has been shrinking since early this year: Data firm Markit blames political uncertainty -- ie Brexit -- which is deterring potential clients from committing to new projects. New orders dropped for the seventh month in a row during October, but the rate of decline was the least marked since July. Construction companies noted that clients continued to defer decision-making on new projects in response to political uncertainty and concerns about the economic outlook. Survey respondents also suggested that intense competition for new work had resulted in more widespread price discounting to secure contract awards. Germany\u2019s slump has helped to drag the wider eurozone factory sector down again. The Eurozone Manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity across the euro area, has come in at 45.9 in October. That shows another sharp fall in activity and output, although slightly better than the seven-year low of 45.7 recorded last month. Data firm Markit says there is a \u201csustained weakness in output, new orders and purchases across eurozone factories. Faced with this slump, bosses are cutting jobs at the fastest rate since 2013. Encouragingly, there is solid growth in Greece, and more modest growth in France, Ireland and the Netherlands. Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, says Germany\u2019s factory sector is enduring its worst slump since the financial crisis: \u201cThe German manufacturing sector remains in recession and continues to pose a threat to the domestic economy through a rising number of factory job losses. Employment across the goods-producing sector is now falling at the fastest rate for the best part of ten years, though it should be said that the decline is nothing like that seen during the depths of the global financial crisis, and is so far mainly restricted to contractors. But there may be hope ahead: \u201cThe survey\u2019s more forward-looking indicators offer some glimmers of hope. Latest data for new orders and output expectations were still very weak in October, but nevertheless the best seen in four months. It remains to be seen if the downturn in the German manufacturing has finally reached a nadir \u2013 much of course depends on developments in global trade, with the US set to decide next week whether to impose new tariffs on automotive imports from the EU.\u201d Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector has endured another torrid month, raising concerns that the country is in recession. New orders at German factories fell for the 13th month running in October, while employment levels fell at the fastest rate since January 2010. Manufacturers are running down their inventories at a rapid rate, rather than invest in new stock. Firms were also forced to slash prices to generate business - average prices at the factory gate fell at the fastest rate in almost a decade. This dragged the German manufacturing PMI down to 42.1 in October. That\u2019s up from 41.7 in September (a 10-year low). Such a low figures suggests a sharp fall in activity (any reading over 50 shows growth). Data firm Markit, which produces the report, says Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector remained firmly in contraction. Surveyed businesses reported a backdrop of uncertainty weighing on investment and leading to a general reluctance among clients. New orders fell markedly and for the thirteenth month in a row in October. More to follow.... France\u2019s factory sector shrugged off the wider malaise, by posting modest growth last month. The French manufacturing PMI has risen to 50.7, from 50.5 in September. Companies took on more staff to handle an increase in production, data firm Markit reports. Italy\u2019s factory sector also had a bad October, shrinking for the 13th month running: Oh dear. Spain\u2019s factory sector contracted at a faster rate last month. The Spanish manufacturing PMI has dropped to 46.8, down from 47.7 in September, showing another drop in activity. It\u2019s the fifth monthly fall in a row, as the political deadlock in Spain hurts the economy. Markit, which produces the PMI report, says: The deterioration in the PMI was led in the main by a sharp and accelerated drop in new orders. Against a backdrop of elevated economic and political uncertainty, both at home and abroad, there were widespread reports of underwhelming market demand and clients adopting a cautious approach to their buying and investment activities. Last April\u2019s general election delivered a hung parliament, so Spain is returning to the ballot box later this month. Back in the markets, stocks are rising across Europe in early trading. Investors are taking their cue from Asia, and the optimism over US-China trade talks. France\u2019s CAC index is leading the charge; up 0.6%, to its highest level since 2007. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 0.7% to its highest level sine June 2018. This has driven the Stoxx 600 index, which includes Europe\u2019s largest 600 listed companies, over 400 points for the first time since January 2018. Here\u2019s our news story on Mothercare UK\u2019s administration: Shares in Mothercare have fallen 15%, to a record low of 9p. That values the company at just \u00a333m. Investors have been almost wiped out over the last decade -- the shares were trading at 450p in January 2010. Mothercare UK\u2019s slide into administration is a sad moment, and a real blow to its staff. But it\u2019s not a shock. The high street chain has been struggling for years, facing rising competition from online rivals. The days when expectant parents would pop into their local Mothercare en masse, and leave carrying an expensive pram, cot, and armfuls of toys and bibs are over. Richard Lim, CEO at Retail Economics, says this is \u201cone of the most highly anticipated collapses\u201d in recent years. \u201cYears of underinvestment in the online business and its inability to differentiate itself as a specialist for young families and expectant parents as been the root of its seemingly inevitable downfall. As competition has become fiercer they have been beaten on price, convenience and the overall customer experience. \u201cPut simply, they have been left behind in today\u2019s rapidly evolving market and the board has been unable to restructure the business fast enough to cope with a new retail paradigm that has emerged.\u201d Newsflash: The UK arm of maternity and baby retailer Mothercare is to be put into administration. The move puts thousands of jobs on the UK high street at risk. In a statement to the City, Mothercare says that it will appoint administrators, having concluded that it cannot bring its 79 stores back to \u2018sustained profitability\u2019. The move will not affect the rest of Mothercare, which also operates a profitable franchise business overseas. The company says: Since May 2018, we have undertaken a root and branch review of the Group and Mothercare UK within it, including a number of discussions over the summer with potential partners regarding our UK Retail business. Through this process, it has become clear that the UK Retail operations of the Group, which today includes 79 stores, are not capable of returning to a level of structural profitability and returns that are sustainable for the Group as it currently stands and/or attractive enough for a third party partner to operate on an arm\u2019s length basis. Furthermore, the Company is unable to continue to satisfy the ongoing cash needs of Mothercare UK. The main Asian stock markets are all comfortably higher today (except Japan, which is closed for a holiday). The Hong Kong and South Korea indices have both jumped almost 1.5% today, while China gained 0.7% and Australia is up 0.3%. The AFP newswire credits trade war optimism, saying: The upbeat mood was enhanced by comments from Chinese Vice Premier Liu He that indicated trade talks with Washington were on track. Liu said he had spoken on Friday to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, with both sides saying the talks were \u201cconstructive\u201d. \u201cEveryone is kind of upbeat around the prospect of at least a partial China-US trade deal,\u201d Peter Dragicevich, a strategist at Suncorp Corporate Services, told Bloomberg TV. \u201cIt\u2019s going to keep equities pretty supported.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are buoyant this morning, lifted by hopes of a US-China trade deal and growing optimism about the global economy. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, has become the latest US official to raise hopes of a breakthrough in the trade war with Beijing this month. He\u2019s told the Financial Times that he\u2019s \u201cquite optimistic\u201d that remaining sticking points for a \u2018Phase One\u2019 trade deal can be resolved soon, adding: \u201cYou won\u2019t have a deal on anything until you have a deal on everything....But we are quite optimistic that the remaining issues for the phase one can be closed out.\u201d Ross also suggested that licenses allowing U.S. companies to sell to Huawei \u201cwill be forthcoming very shortly.\u201d That could help pave the way to a trade war breakthrough. Investors are also heartened by Friday\u2019s US employment report, which showed that 128,000 new jobs were created in October - more than expected. Last Wednesday\u2019s cut to US interest rates has also given markets a lift. Stocks have risen in Asia already today, with China\u2019s CSI300 index gaining 0.6%. That means it\u2019s gained a blistering 32% since the start of 2019! The pan-European Stoxx 600 is on track to hit its highest level since January 2018. This follows a decent performance last week, which saw Wall Street hit a new all-time high. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explains: It was another positive week for equities with data on balance more positive, trade talks seemingly going in the right direction, a U.K. election finally called and a Fed rate cut. The S&amp;P 500 advanced +1.5% (+0.97% Friday and a new record high) with semiconductors leading gains, up +2.5% on the week. But is Europe\u2019s economy turning a corner? The latest survey of Eurozone factories, due this morning, is likely to show that activity remains subdued. October\u2019s eurozone manufacturing PMI is expected to remain at just 45.7, matching September\u2019s reading, signalling another contraction. At a country level, only France is tipped to rise over the 50-point mark showing growth, while Germany probably had another dire month. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: The Spanish, Italian, French, and German manufacturing reports will be posted, and economists are expecting 47.5, 47.5, 50.5, and 41.9 respectively. The UK factory data, released on Friday, was better than expected (49.6), so we could get a pleasant surprise today. The UK\u2019s construction PMI survey is due this morning, and expected to show another contraction as Brexit uncertainty lingers. The agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI report for October - expected to remain at 45.7 9.30am GMT: Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence - expected to rise to -13.8, from -16.8 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI report for October - expected to rise to 44.1, from 43.3 3pm GMT: US factory orders for September - expected to fall by 0.5%",

      "bodyText": "The Cleveland Browns have released safety Jermaine Whitehead after he directed a threatening, expletive-laced post at an analyst on the team\u2019s radio network. Dustin Fox, a former NFL player who now works for Browns radio, called Whitehead\u2019s tackling during the team\u2019s loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday a \u201cjoke\u201d. Whitehead was also the subject of criticism from fans on Twitter. Whitehead used a racial slur in response to Fox\u2019s comments on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m out there with a broke hand.. don\u2019t get smoked fuck ass cracker,\u201d he wrote. He also threatened another user on Twitter, writing: \u201cImma kill you bitch\u201d. Whitehead\u2019s account was suspended shortly afterwards but he continued to vent his anger on Instagram, threatening another user. On Sunday night, a Browns spokesperson told ESPN that Whitehead\u2019s comments were \u201ctotally unacceptable and highly inappropriate\u201d. On Monday morning they waived him. The 26-year-old was in his second season with the Browns. He previously played for the Green Bay Packers, who released him after he was ejected for slapping an opponent.

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/oct/28/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/oct/21/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a>from last week.</p> <p>Halloween has been and gone, but I think we can squeeze in one more spooky recommendation. Especially when it\u2019s as good this one from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a> on the subject of The Vampyre by John William Polidori:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Published in 1819, it was the first English vampire story ever written, and influenced much that came after it, notably Bram Stoker. I\u2019ve been keen to read it for a while, expecting it to have dated, but interested in its own origins, and exactly what Polidori had to say.</p> <p>It\u2019s a gothic tale that concerns a veteran wealthy and orphaned young man, Aubrey, who arrives in London and meets the mysterious Lord Ruthven. The two men become friends, and upon discovering that Lord Ruthven is planning a trip to Europe decides to take his grand tour at the same time and travel with him. Slowly, he realises Ruthven\u2019s true character.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4049805\">LarryJayCee </a>has just read Madeline Miller\u2019s Circe:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It certainly deserves all the positive reviews it has received; the only comment I can add is that she does for this character from Greek mythology, what Robert Graves did for the Roman emperor Claudius: to take an almost blank canvas and to create an entirely believable person knitted so well into existing mythology that it made one wonder how Homer could have missed the obvious connections that linked the Golden Fleece, Scylla and the Minotaur.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15798790\">Veufveuve </a>has been reading Natalie Zemon Davis\u2019 Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-Century Lives:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It tells the stories of Glikl, a Jewish woman living in Germany; Marie, an Ursuline sister living in Qu\u00e9bec; and Maria, a Dutch emigrant to South America. What binds them is that each woman left a remarkable account of their life. I\u2019ve just finished Glikl\u2019s story. What comes through most strongly is a reminder of history\u2019s disconcerting ability to be both intensely familiar, and deeply strange and alien. History at its best has a great power to make us ask questions of our own lives as we reflect on the lives of others. I\u2019m looking forward to the rest very much.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lonesome Dove, a Pulitzer prize-winning Western novel by Larry McMurtry, has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18275605\">Maz789</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I love a long read and it is 945 pages. The book doesn\u2019t glorify cowboy/ranger stoicism; rather, it illustrates the financial and emotional poverty from whence it came. And there are lots of exciting blood-curdling scenes, death by many snakes and a grizzly bear versus bull fight, for instance. It doesn\u2019t shy from unpleasant realistic detail and the descriptions of the landscape take you straight there.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Jules Verne is a splendid imaginative work,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13472965\">SydneyH</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Professor Lidenbrock, a geologist in Hamburg, discovers a hidden document from a long dead alchemist, detailing the path to the globe\u2019s inner core. The impulsive academic and his nephew set off immediately to Iceland to the extinct volcano specified by their predecessor.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Halloween has been and gone, but I think we can squeeze in one more spooky recommendation. Especially when it\u2019s as good this one from safereturndoubtful on the subject of The Vampyre by John William Polidori: Published in 1819, it was the first English vampire story ever written, and influenced much that came after it, notably Bram Stoker. I\u2019ve been keen to read it for a while, expecting it to have dated, but interested in its own origins, and exactly what Polidori had to say. It\u2019s a gothic tale that concerns a veteran wealthy and orphaned young man, Aubrey, who arrives in London and meets the mysterious Lord Ruthven. The two men become friends, and upon discovering that Lord Ruthven is planning a trip to Europe decides to take his grand tour at the same time and travel with him. Slowly, he realises Ruthven\u2019s true character. LarryJayCee has just read Madeline Miller\u2019s Circe: It certainly deserves all the positive reviews it has received; the only comment I can add is that she does for this character from Greek mythology, what Robert Graves did for the Roman emperor Claudius: to take an almost blank canvas and to create an entirely believable person knitted so well into existing mythology that it made one wonder how Homer could have missed the obvious connections that linked the Golden Fleece, Scylla and the Minotaur. Veufveuve has been reading Natalie Zemon Davis\u2019 Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-Century Lives: It tells the stories of Glikl, a Jewish woman living in Germany; Marie, an Ursuline sister living in Qu\u00e9bec; and Maria, a Dutch emigrant to South America. What binds them is that each woman left a remarkable account of their life. I\u2019ve just finished Glikl\u2019s story. What comes through most strongly is a reminder of history\u2019s disconcerting ability to be both intensely familiar, and deeply strange and alien. History at its best has a great power to make us ask questions of our own lives as we reflect on the lives of others. I\u2019m looking forward to the rest very much. Lonesome Dove, a Pulitzer prize-winning Western novel by Larry McMurtry, has impressed Maz789: I love a long read and it is 945 pages. The book doesn\u2019t glorify cowboy/ranger stoicism; rather, it illustrates the financial and emotional poverty from whence it came. And there are lots of exciting blood-curdling scenes, death by many snakes and a grizzly bear versus bull fight, for instance. It doesn\u2019t shy from unpleasant realistic detail and the descriptions of the landscape take you straight there. \u201cJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Jules Verne is a splendid imaginative work,\u201d says SydneyH: Professor Lidenbrock, a geologist in Hamburg, discovers a hidden document from a long dead alchemist, detailing the path to the globe\u2019s inner core. The impulsive academic and his nephew set off immediately to Iceland to the extinct volcano specified by their predecessor. My edition is one of the excellent translations by William Butcher for Oxford University Press, doing justice to the claim that Verne\u2019s works in their original French are of a much higher quality than they are represented in the English-speaking world. Lidenbrock himself is a lovely creation, his impatient character summed up by the anecdote that he tugs his plants to try and make them grow faster. Finally, Magrat123 recommends The Caravaners by Elizabeth von Arnim: Published in 1909, it is the funniest book I have read this year, indeed probably one of the funniest books I have ever read. The narrator is Baron Otto von Ottringel, a Prussian nobleman and army officer, and a most extraordinary character he is; conceited, parsimonious, lazy, greedy, misogynistic, snobbish and, worst of all, completely without insight into his effect on other people who he unhesitatingly blames for anything that goes wrong. The Baron has been inveigled into joining in a group caravanning holiday in England (picturesque Kent and Sussex to be precise), so much cheaper than going to Italy or Switzerland \u2026 Needless to say he can\u2019t adjust to English attitudes and behaviour at all, stumbling from one hilarious misunderstanding to another. That sounds wonderful. Interesting links about books and reading \u201cLike it or not, we\u2019re all post-structuralists now living in a Derridean nightmare.\u201d Ron Charles on the Ukraine call transcript. \u201cWhat is Hitler doing in this book?\u201d Christopher Clark on Knausgaard and the enduring stench of the Nazi leader. Apparently, Herman Melville used to enjoy bowling. \u201cWe have reached peak witch\u201d \u2013 or so says The New York Times. \u201cThe story of Atlantis is not without its mythic elements\u201d: Jason Horowitz on Santorini\u2019s famous bookstore.

My legs were itching after a while and I had to go home and take a bath.\u201d</p> \n<p>Living in the world\u2019s most polluted city has taken a toll on almost every one of its 20 million citizens, especially since the Hindu festival of Diwali, which prompted a severe deterioration in air quality. As the air pollution levels reached catastrophic levels \u2013 almost 10 times above the healthy limit on the weekend \u2013 a public health emergency was declared and has remained in place for the past five days. The streets have emptied, schools remained closed and many did not go into work on Monday morning as the air quality index remained stubbornly in the category of \u201csevere\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/delhi-restricts-cars-in-attempt-to-lessen-pollution\">Delhi restricts cars in attempt to lessen pollution</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Monday also saw the temporary introduction of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/delhi-restricts-cars-in-attempt-to-lessen-pollution\">scheme</a>, which ran previously in 2016, where cars with odd and even number plates can only drive on alternate days, which authorities say will take 1.2m cars off Delhi\u2019s roads each day. However, most in the city were highly sceptical about the plan, which will only be in place for two weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey did this scheme twice before and it is pointless,\u201d said Amit, a driver. \u201cI am not supposed to be taking my car out today but I am just taking the back roads and short cuts to avoid the traffic officers. All the other drivers I know are doing the same. Yes pollution is a terrible problem, I have had an awful chest infection for the past two days because of it, but this temporary scheme is not going to change anything. We need real action from the government.\u201d</p> \n<p>The sentiment was exemplified by politician Vijay Goel, senior leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who chose to defy the rules and took his car with an odd number plate out for a drive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6a65cf4-9dfc-4f34-975d-abb26a0b6bb0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zbtltttuUQg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a city such as Delhi, where poverty and homelessness is rife and millions make their living on the sides of the roads, not all had the option of taking shelter in homes or driving cars equipped with air purifiers.</p> \n<p>At his stall selling chickpeas on the roadside of Kamla Nagar, north Delhi, Dinesh Raj said both his health and his business was suffering. \u201cI generally earn around 400 to 500 rupees per day but after the bad pollution I have only sold three plates and it\u2019s already lunchtime,\u201d Raj said, rubbing his eyes which he complained were burning.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are not coming out of their houses anymore, only those like me who cannot afford to stay indoors are here. And even though I cover it up, people are afraid to eat my food because they think the bad air is affecting it. If the government doesn\u2019t do something to clean up the air, I am going to have to go back to my village in Bihar.\u201d</p> \n<p>The lacklustre and uncoordinated response to the crisis from both the federal government and state governments of Delhi, and neighbouring Punjab and Haryana where the burning of the crop stubble has been a key contributor to Delhi\u2019s thick toxic smog, has been a source of infuriation and anger for the city\u2019s residents.</p> \n<p>Navdha Malhotra, campaigns director for Purpose, a social impact agency who run a mobilisation campaign called <a href=\"https://helpdelhibreathe.in/\">Help Delhi Breathe</a>, spoke of her anger that the state governments were \u201call passing the buck and blaming each other while we have to live in this disgusting layer of smog.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a citizen of Delhi who has lived here all my life, this is absolutely disgraceful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Delhi government is very progressive in terms of policies on paper but there is zero implementation and no political will on this issue. People are angry and mobilising, particularly parents who now feel like they can\u2019t let their children go outside, but overall civic action here is also pretty disgraceful. I have seen citizens in Delhi bursting firecrackers while wearing masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Delhi residents woke on the weekend to smog so brown and thick that it was impossible to see more than a few feet ahead, India\u2019s health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted that a good solution to offsetting its harmful impact was to eat carrots. Sunil<strong> </strong>Bharala, minister for the state of Utter Pradesh, meanwhile, defended the practice of crop burning by farmers, declaring it a \u201cnatural system\u201d.</p> \n<p>While Delhi\u2019s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been publicly candid about the problem, calling the current pollution crisis unbearable, he has also been criticised for passing the blame for the problem on to adjacent states.</p> \n<p>While firecrackers were banned and construction has been halted in Delhi since the state of emergency was declared on Friday, in reality these rules have barely been enforced. On Monday, the supreme court judges slammed all responsible authorities for failing to tackle pollution in the capital, saying that people had been \u201cleft to die\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one is safe even inside homes. It is atrocious,\u201d the judges added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6a65cf4-9dfc-4f34-975d-abb26a0b6bb0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zbtltttuUQg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Malhotra condemned the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) for allowing a match against Bangladesh to go ahead in Delhi when the pollution levels were off the charts. \u201cWe should not be normalising these conditions by doing things like hosting a cricket match,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is deathly, and when pollution gets that bad, the whole city should be shutting down. Only then will politicians take this seriously.\u201d</p> \n<p>An indication of both the increasing obvious severity of the pollution, but also increased public awareness about its harmful impact on health, has been masks, which are now visible on the faces of people all over the streets of Delhi. In a mark of the growing public anger in some quarters, a citizens protest is also planned at Indian Gate on Tuesday evening to decry the lack of action by authorities.</p> \n<p>But for many there has been no hiding from the thick poisonous smog. Kushal Malik, a Delhi traffic police officer, had spent the past 12 hours on duty on one of city\u2019s busiest and most polluted roads, with no choice but to inhale the fumes. \u201cI have constant throat irritation, headache and a burning sensation in my eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has provided us with masks but they are not effective for pollution levels this bad. It is not good enough.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Kakoli Bhattacharya</em></p>",

However, most in the city were highly sceptical about the plan, which will only be in place for two weeks. \u201cThey did this scheme twice before and it is pointless,\u201d said Amit, a driver. \u201cI am not supposed to be taking my car out today but I am just taking the back roads and short cuts to avoid the traffic officers. All the other drivers I know are doing the same. Yes pollution is a terrible problem, I have had an awful chest infection for the past two days because of it, but this temporary scheme is not going to change anything. We need real action from the government.\u201d The sentiment was exemplified by politician Vijay Goel, senior leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who chose to defy the rules and took his car with an odd number plate out for a drive. In a city such as Delhi, where poverty and homelessness is rife and millions make their living on the sides of the roads, not all had the option of taking shelter in homes or driving cars equipped with air purifiers. At his stall selling chickpeas on the roadside of Kamla Nagar, north Delhi, Dinesh Raj said both his health and his business was suffering. \u201cI generally earn around 400 to 500 rupees per day but after the bad pollution I have only sold three plates and it\u2019s already lunchtime,\u201d Raj said, rubbing his eyes which he complained were burning. \u201cPeople are not coming out of their houses anymore, only those like me who cannot afford to stay indoors are here. And even though I cover it up, people are afraid to eat my food because they think the bad air is affecting it. If the government doesn\u2019t do something to clean up the air, I am going to have to go back to my village in Bihar.\u201d The lacklustre and uncoordinated response to the crisis from both the federal government and state governments of Delhi, and neighbouring Punjab and Haryana where the burning of the crop stubble has been a key contributor to Delhi\u2019s thick toxic smog, has been a source of infuriation and anger for the city\u2019s residents. Navdha Malhotra, campaigns director for Purpose, a social impact agency who run a mobilisation campaign called Help Delhi Breathe, spoke of her anger that the state governments were \u201call passing the buck and blaming each other while we have to live in this disgusting layer of smog.\u201d \u201cAs a citizen of Delhi who has lived here all my life, this is absolutely disgraceful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Delhi government is very progressive in terms of policies on paper but there is zero implementation and no political will on this issue. People are angry and mobilising, particularly parents who now feel like they can\u2019t let their children go outside, but overall civic action here is also pretty disgraceful. I have seen citizens in Delhi bursting firecrackers while wearing masks.\u201d As Delhi residents woke on the weekend to smog so brown and thick that it was impossible to see more than a few feet ahead, India\u2019s health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted that a good solution to offsetting its harmful impact was to eat carrots. Sunil Bharala, minister for the state of Utter Pradesh, meanwhile, defended the practice of crop burning by farmers, declaring it a \u201cnatural system\u201d. While Delhi\u2019s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been publicly candid about the problem, calling the current pollution crisis unbearable, he has also been criticised for passing the blame for the problem on to adjacent states. While firecrackers were banned and construction has been halted in Delhi since the state of emergency was declared on Friday, in reality these rules have barely been enforced. On Monday, the supreme court judges slammed all responsible authorities for failing to tackle pollution in the capital, saying that people had been \u201cleft to die\u201d. \u201cNo one is safe even inside homes. It is atrocious,\u201d the judges added. Malhotra condemned the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) for allowing a match against Bangladesh to go ahead in Delhi when the pollution levels were off the charts. \u201cWe should not be normalising these conditions by doing things like hosting a cricket match,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is deathly, and when pollution gets that bad, the whole city should be shutting down. Only then will politicians take this seriously.\u201d An indication of both the increasing obvious severity of the pollution, but also increased public awareness about its harmful impact on health, has been masks, which are now visible on the faces of people all over the streets of Delhi. In a mark of the growing public anger in some quarters, a citizens protest is also planned at Indian Gate on Tuesday evening to decry the lack of action by authorities. But for many there has been no hiding from the thick poisonous smog. Kushal Malik, a Delhi traffic police officer, had spent the past 12 hours on duty on one of city\u2019s busiest and most polluted roads, with no choice but to inhale the fumes. \u201cI have constant throat irritation, headache and a burning sensation in my eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has provided us with masks but they are not effective for pollution levels this bad. It is not good enough.\u201d Additional reporting by Kakoli Bhattacharya",

The downsides outweigh the benefits, but we need to be aware of them too.\u201d Irish Doctors for the Environment, an advocacy group, wrote to Varadkar on Monday saying the climate crisis had an \u201coverwhelmingly negative effect on human health\u201d. It asked him to retract and \u201caddress the errors\u201d in his speech. Other environmental campaigners expressed anger and disbelief. \u201cThat the taoiseach would make these comments while delivering a progress report on his government\u2019s climate action plan exposes the extent to which that plan is a surface level response to a multi-faceted crisis, the scale of which they fail to comprehend,\u201d said the Green party. \u201cMillions are dying or being displaced right now. That will rise to hundreds of millions if the complacency of governments around the world continues. Our milder winters are punctuated by cold snaps that threaten our most vulnerable, including the thousands of people now homeless.\u201d Ois\u00edn Coghlan, the director of Friends of the Earth Ireland, acknowledged Ireland could benefit in a narrow way but said the climate emergency\u2019s wider impacts on the country and the rest of the world were overwhelmingly negative. Cara Augustenborg, an environmental scientist at University College Dublin, echoed that view, saying the few lives that might be spared from winter-related deaths paled in comparison to wider suffering. Extinction Rebellion Ireland called the comments shocking. \u201cIt\u2019s time for civil disobedience,\u201d the group said. The spat came as climate experts warned that a catastrophic storm during high tide will flood thousands of homes, businesses and landmark buildings in Dublin in the coming decades. Peter Thorne, a lead author on the fifth assessment report of the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change, said Ireland had so far been able to \u201cdodge a bullet\u201d because storms have struck during low tides. Ireland is one of the EU\u2019s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than \u20ac250m (\u00a3216m) for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting renewable energy. The government unveiled an ambitious plan in June that outlined measures to curb emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In recent days the singer Cher and the actor Mark Ruffalo have added their voices to a campaign to stop Ireland becoming an entry point for fracked US gas.",

      "body": "<p>The Italian government could be forced to change its plans for a tax on plastic packaging after coming under pressure from producers.</p> <p>The measure, which is intended to combat plastic pollution while raising more than \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m) in revenues, has divided the fragile coalition between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Democratic party (PD).</p> <p>The tax, included in the draft budget for 2020, would require companies to pay a \u20ac1 levy on each kilogram of plastic produced, including bottles, polyethylene bags and trays, detergent containers, bubble wrap, packaging for household appliances and product labels. The measure would also provide incentives to firms that produce biodegradable materials.</p> <p>As the budget begins its passage through parliament, however, the proposal has irked one of Italy\u2019s most dynamic industries. It also faces opposition from Italia Viva, the centrist party recently established by the former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who described the tax as \u201ca blow to the middle-class\u201d. Renzi left the PD to form Italia Viva, but the party is still part of the ruling coalition.</p> <p>Confindustria, the confederation of Italian industry, argues that the levy risks harming a sector that brings in a turnover of around \u20ac40bn a year and employs 150,000 people.</p> <p>\u201cThe measure penalises products, not behaviour, and only represents a way to recover resources, while placing huge costs on consumers, workers and businesses,\u201d Confindustria said in a statement, adding that companies already contributed \u20ac450m a year toward the collection and recycling of plastic packaging.</p> <p>Paolo Lamberti, the president of Federchimica, the association that represents the chemicals industry, said the tax did not consider \u201cthe disastrous impact on all firms\u201d while several consumer organisations argue it would add about 10% to product prices.</p> <p>Roberto Gualtieri, the finance minister, moved to appease the critics on Sunday, saying the measure could be modified to reduce the impact on the plastics industry.</p> <p>\u201cBut we must reduce the use of single-use plastic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t applaud the children who campaign for a better environment and then not take action. A measure against single-use plastic is correct and must be reshaped well.\u201d</p> <p>Luigi Di Maio, whose M5S party has long prioritised the environment in its campaigning, said the debate over the tax was \u201csurreal\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/04/better-latte-than-never-compostable-coffee-pods-go-on-sale\">Better latte than never \u2026 compostable coffee pods go on sale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAfter so many years of talking about the impact that plastic has on our seas, Italy has decided to move quickly toward changing its production system,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today the debate is about whether to begin doing that, or not to lose votes. I say that politicians look towards the next elections while statesmen look towards the next generation.\u201d</p> <p>A report published in October by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (Ispra) revealed that more than 500,000 tonnes of plastic waste end up in the Mediterranean each year.</p> <p>The next electoral challenge, especially for the Democratic party, comes in January in Emilia-Romagna, a leftwing stronghold that hosts the biggest concentration of plastics manufacturers. The party\u2019s leader, Nicola Zingaretti, has not commented on the issue but Stefano Bonaccini, the PD\u2019s regional president who will compete for a second mandate against an increasingly popular centre-right coalition, said: \u201cAn ecological turnaround is absolutely necessary, but it must not affect businesses and work.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Italian government could be forced to change its plans for a tax on plastic packaging after coming under pressure from producers. The measure, which is intended to combat plastic pollution while raising more than \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m) in revenues, has divided the fragile coalition between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Democratic party (PD). The tax, included in the draft budget for 2020, would require companies to pay a \u20ac1 levy on each kilogram of plastic produced, including bottles, polyethylene bags and trays, detergent containers, bubble wrap, packaging for household appliances and product labels. The measure would also provide incentives to firms that produce biodegradable materials. As the budget begins its passage through parliament, however, the proposal has irked one of Italy\u2019s most dynamic industries. It also faces opposition from Italia Viva, the centrist party recently established by the former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who described the tax as \u201ca blow to the middle-class\u201d. Renzi left the PD to form Italia Viva, but the party is still part of the ruling coalition. Confindustria, the confederation of Italian industry, argues that the levy risks harming a sector that brings in a turnover of around \u20ac40bn a year and employs 150,000 people. \u201cThe measure penalises products, not behaviour, and only represents a way to recover resources, while placing huge costs on consumers, workers and businesses,\u201d Confindustria said in a statement, adding that companies already contributed \u20ac450m a year toward the collection and recycling of plastic packaging. Paolo Lamberti, the president of Federchimica, the association that represents the chemicals industry, said the tax did not consider \u201cthe disastrous impact on all firms\u201d while several consumer organisations argue it would add about 10% to product prices. Roberto Gualtieri, the finance minister, moved to appease the critics on Sunday, saying the measure could be modified to reduce the impact on the plastics industry. \u201cBut we must reduce the use of single-use plastic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t applaud the children who campaign for a better environment and then not take action. A measure against single-use plastic is correct and must be reshaped well.\u201d Luigi Di Maio, whose M5S party has long prioritised the environment in its campaigning, said the debate over the tax was \u201csurreal\u201d. \u201cAfter so many years of talking about the impact that plastic has on our seas, Italy has decided to move quickly toward changing its production system,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today the debate is about whether to begin doing that, or not to lose votes. I say that politicians look towards the next elections while statesmen look towards the next generation.\u201d A report published in October by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (Ispra) revealed that more than 500,000 tonnes of plastic waste end up in the Mediterranean each year. The next electoral challenge, especially for the Democratic party, comes in January in Emilia-Romagna, a leftwing stronghold that hosts the biggest concentration of plastics manufacturers. The party\u2019s leader, Nicola Zingaretti, has not commented on the issue but Stefano Bonaccini, the PD\u2019s regional president who will compete for a second mandate against an increasingly popular centre-right coalition, said: \u201cAn ecological turnaround is absolutely necessary, but it must not affect businesses and work.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> is exploring plans to ban private jets from UK airports from as early as 2025 should it win the election, in the party\u2019s latest broadside against the super-rich.</p> <p>After a report revealed carbon emissions from the sector equivalent to 450,000 cars each year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andy-mcdonald\">Andy McDonald</a>, the shadow transport secretary, said that billionaire users of private fossil fuel aircraft were damaging the climate and the party would consider a ban.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyMcDonaldMP/status/1191301694052880385\">tweeted</a> on Monday: \u201cThe multi-millionaires &amp; billionaires who travel by private jet are doing profound damage to the climate, and it\u2019s the rest of us who\u2019ll suffer the consequences. A phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets is a sensible proposal.\u201d</p> <p>The warning shot came in response to a <a href=\"https://common-wealth.co.uk/jet-set-go.html\">report</a> from Common Wealth, a thinktank with close links to Jeremy Corbyn, and A Free Ride, a campaign group that called for a ban in Britain from 2025 to encourage the development of electric aircraft.</p> <p>McDonald said he would \u201cexamine these proposals closely and consult with industry on the introduction of a phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets\u201d.</p> <p>The Common Wealth report found that 128,000 flights between UK and EU airports were made using private jets in 2018, representing 6% of all UK air traffic.

      "bodyText": "Labour is exploring plans to ban private jets from UK airports from as early as 2025 should it win the election, in the party\u2019s latest broadside against the super-rich. After a report revealed carbon emissions from the sector equivalent to 450,000 cars each year, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said that billionaire users of private fossil fuel aircraft were damaging the climate and the party would consider a ban. He tweeted on Monday: \u201cThe multi-millionaires &amp; billionaires who travel by private jet are doing profound damage to the climate, and it\u2019s the rest of us who\u2019ll suffer the consequences. A phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets is a sensible proposal.\u201d The warning shot came in response to a report from Common Wealth, a thinktank with close links to Jeremy Corbyn, and A Free Ride, a campaign group that called for a ban in Britain from 2025 to encourage the development of electric aircraft. McDonald said he would \u201cexamine these proposals closely and consult with industry on the introduction of a phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets\u201d. The Common Wealth report found that 128,000 flights between UK and EU airports were made using private jets in 2018, representing 6% of all UK air traffic. A further 14,000 trips were made to destinations outside Europe. It said the global heating impact of the flights was roughly 1m tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year, the same as the annual emissions of about 450,000 typical cars on Britain\u2019s roads. A private flight from London to New York was equivalent to driving a typical UK car non-stop for four and a half years, it said. According to the assessment, a typical private jet passenger journey within Europe emits seven times as much greenhouse gas as a flight in business class on a typical airliner, 10 times as much as flying economy class and about 150 times as much as an equivalent journey using high-speed rail. Industry estimates also suggest that about 40% of private jet movements are empty-leg journeys, in which aircraft are repositioned for the convenience of the super-rich and corporate customers who use them. Even when full, private jets on average will carry as few as five passengers. Almost half of all private jet traffic in Britain passes through five airports around London, given its status as the home to the most billionaires in Europe and one of the world\u2019s biggest financial centres. Luton airport, roughly an hour north of the capital is the busiest, with almost 15,000 private aircraft departures in 2017, followed by Farnborough, Biggin Hill, Stansted and Northolt. Some of Britain\u2019s richest people use private jets. Prince Harry has faced criticism for doing so for short-hop breaks while campaigning against global heating. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the chief executive of the petrochemicals company Ineos, who is Britain\u2019s third richest man with an \u00a318bn fortune, has four private jets and a helicopter. Sir James Dyson, the electrical products entrepreneur and fifth richest man in Britain, owns a \u00a355m private jet. The Common Wealth report, compiled by Leo Murray of Free Ride and Jamie Beevor of Green Gumption, an environmental consultancy, suggested most carbon-emitting private flights to and from UK airports could be handled by new electric aircraft in future. Growing numbers of aircraft manufacturers are investing in the development of electric alternatives to fossil fuel jets. Progress, however, has been slow. The report suggests that only 15% of total UK aviation emissions are set to be replaced by 2050 on the current trajectory. The study found that as many as four out of five private jet journeys within Europe today cover distances that could be completed by small electric aircraft currently in commercial development that would enter the market in the mid 2020s. The European Business Aviation Association, the main body representing the private jet sector, said a ban would do little to curb global heating and that a unilateral ban in Britain made little sense in an international market. A spokesperson said the industry was making progress and had a goal of reducing emissions by 50% relative to 2005 levels. \u201cThe European business aviation sector is keen to be part of a sensible solution that balances the demand for travel, regional cohesion and economic growth with environmental and social responsibility,\u201d they said.",

Two years ago, the then leader, Leanne Wood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/25/plaid-cymru-leader-leanne-wood-defends-decision-not-to-stand-in-election\">focused on</a> the idea of defending Wales from the Tories in London and the Labour-led government in Cardiff, with independence sidelined.</p> <p>Price took swipes at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, complaining Wales was suffering economically and socially because of decisions made in Westminster and Cardiff.</p> <p>\u201cIn calling the third election in just four years, the Westminster parties certainly have given the people the worst Christmas present ever,\u201d he said,</p> <p>\u201cA political culture that is more toxic than at any time in our history, a poisoned chalice of a choice between two divided parties led by one leader who is resolutely dishonest on Brexit and another who is sadly proven, honestly, clueless. And both of them, as we\u2019ve seen in recent days, advised by public schoolboys who seem to see politics as some kind of pathological game.\u201d</p> <p>But he emphasised the election should be not about \u201cthem\u201d but was instead about \u201cus\u201d. Price argued \u201calmighty lessons\u201d could be learned from the Scottish National party, which had the attention and respect it deserved because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/labour-wiped-out-in-scotland-amid-snp-surge\">electoral successes</a>.</p> <p>Price said his party\u2019s priorities included a green jobs revolution, a new approach to care, lifting children out of poverty with universal free childcare and a new \u00a335-a-week payment for every child in low-income families, investing in affordable homes, and tackling crime by creating a Welsh justice system, devolving policing and recruiting 1,600 police officers.</p> <p>He did not discuss pacts with other pro-remain parties during his speech, but in interviews given beforehand, Price said such agreements were the way to go. He insisted Plaid was the leading remain party in Wales, seeking to stop Brexit through a \u201cfinal say\u201d referendum, and wanting Wales to become an independent state in the EU.</p> <p>Introducing Price, the party\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said the times were \u201cdangerous, confused and volatile\u201d but also full of potential. She said the party would look to create harmony with the nearest capital \u2013 Dublin \u2013 and also with London.</p> <p>Saville Roberts also attempted to reach out to voters who may not be traditional Plaid supporters. \u201cWe are the party for Wales and everyone who lives there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Wales is in your heart, we are the party for you.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking after the speech, Price said the party was having \u201cpositive discussions\u201d about taking part in alliances with the pro-remain parties and hope to make an announcement soon.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had extensive discussions, very positive discussions, over many, many weeks and months. In principle, we\u2019re very much supportive of the idea of trying to maximise the number of MPs from pro-Remain parties that are elected from Wales and indeed, of course, there are similar discussions between the Greens and the Liberal Democrats in England.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The leader of Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, has said the general election could signal the start of a movement towards \u201ca new Welsh spirit of independence and optimism\u201d. Speaking at the nationalist party\u2019s campaign launch, Price put the idea of Wales breaking away from the UK and remaining in the EU as an independent country front and centre of the Plaid campaign. \u201cThat pencil we will all hold in a few weeks could be the start not only of a new politics but a new Wales, a new hope for all of us,\u201d he said. Plaid\u2019s campaign slogan is \u201cWales, it\u2019s us\u201d. Price said: \u201cIt\u2019s us, the people of Wales, that hold the key to the nation\u2019s future \u2026 an independent Wales. \u201cNow is the time to focus on the future, not the past. I believe like never before the best days for Wales are ahead of us, and 12 December [election day] can be a day on which we declare a new Welsh spirit of independence and optimism and hope by refusing to put our faith in the Westminster parties and instead voting for a future that we ourselves will shape. \u201cThis is the election in which Wales will begin to find its voice as a nation. It will start as a whisper, a still, small voice in the darkness, but it will end with a chorus. Speaking with one voice \u2026 Now is our time.\u201d Plaid\u2019s launch took place, as it did in 2017, in a hotel close to the Menai strait in north Wales. Two years ago, the then leader, Leanne Wood, focused on the idea of defending Wales from the Tories in London and the Labour-led government in Cardiff, with independence sidelined. Price took swipes at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, complaining Wales was suffering economically and socially because of decisions made in Westminster and Cardiff. \u201cIn calling the third election in just four years, the Westminster parties certainly have given the people the worst Christmas present ever,\u201d he said, \u201cA political culture that is more toxic than at any time in our history, a poisoned chalice of a choice between two divided parties led by one leader who is resolutely dishonest on Brexit and another who is sadly proven, honestly, clueless. And both of them, as we\u2019ve seen in recent days, advised by public schoolboys who seem to see politics as some kind of pathological game.\u201d But he emphasised the election should be not about \u201cthem\u201d but was instead about \u201cus\u201d. Price argued \u201calmighty lessons\u201d could be learned from the Scottish National party, which had the attention and respect it deserved because of electoral successes. Price said his party\u2019s priorities included a green jobs revolution, a new approach to care, lifting children out of poverty with universal free childcare and a new \u00a335-a-week payment for every child in low-income families, investing in affordable homes, and tackling crime by creating a Welsh justice system, devolving policing and recruiting 1,600 police officers. He did not discuss pacts with other pro-remain parties during his speech, but in interviews given beforehand, Price said such agreements were the way to go. He insisted Plaid was the leading remain party in Wales, seeking to stop Brexit through a \u201cfinal say\u201d referendum, and wanting Wales to become an independent state in the EU. Introducing Price, the party\u2019s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said the times were \u201cdangerous, confused and volatile\u201d but also full of potential. She said the party would look to create harmony with the nearest capital \u2013 Dublin \u2013 and also with London. Saville Roberts also attempted to reach out to voters who may not be traditional Plaid supporters. \u201cWe are the party for Wales and everyone who lives there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Wales is in your heart, we are the party for you.\u201d Speaking after the speech, Price said the party was having \u201cpositive discussions\u201d about taking part in alliances with the pro-remain parties and hope to make an announcement soon. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had extensive discussions, very positive discussions, over many, many weeks and months. In principle, we\u2019re very much supportive of the idea of trying to maximise the number of MPs from pro-Remain parties that are elected from Wales and indeed, of course, there are similar discussions between the Greens and the Liberal Democrats in England.\u201d",

But within that frame, Delaney keeps finding funnier settings for the Count\u2019s bewilderment and curmudgeonliness. He performs a one-act play for schoolchildren about Renaissance astronomer Gary Barlow, who invented the telescope, \u201cas well as painting the cistern in the chapel\u201d. Verily, Barry Garlic is \u201cthe Stephen Hawkwind of whichever century it is that I\u2019m in\u201d, blithers the Count, before educating the kids about the planets in our solar system with a clothes rail and eight balloons. His trouble with the phrase \u201cjust a couple of puffs\u201d brings proceedings to a near halt; his accidental ingestion of helium forces an emergency interval. Throughout all this nonsense, the real, gruesomely compelling joke is on the Count\u2019s state of mind, and his mortal combat with the Queen\u2019s English. Even with constant stoking, his train of thought derails repeatedly and ends the show a wreck. How did I get here? his eyes scream at us. Where did I start? How did his lecture on Newtonian physics lead to a role-play about a pineapple falling on a bat? However did a list of space-related chocolate bars end up featuring Ursula Andress, the Four Tops and the films of \u201cDustbin Hoffman\u201d? It would be tragic, if the Count weren\u2019t so cantankerous (blaming everyone but himself for his confusion) and, finally, so indomitable. Yes, the eyes flash with terror, but soon he\u2019s off on another tangent, explaining \u201cthe Big Bump\u201d, imagining Lulu\u2019s guest slot on his TV astronomy vehicle, or reminiscing about the forgotten music-hall icon Lenny Long-Arms. At every turn, Delaney\u2019s performance gives us something to marvel at, whether it\u2019s the Count\u2019s clenched physicality, would-be cut-glass vowels or the fierce concentration he brings (you can almost hear the synapses cranking into position) as he fathoms where Ed Sheeran stops and Alan Shearer begins. There are still moments of claustrophobia; it\u2019s part of the Count Arthur experience to feel trapped with him in ever-decreasing circles. But Delaney pays for your discomfort with great wads of laughter, as the Count\u2019s lecture on cosmology falls to Earth with a very big bump of its own. \u2022 Touring until 8 March.",

      "body": "<p>After Thirtysomething and before This Is Us, Brothers and Sisters was the emotionally manipulative ensemble drama of choice. In 2006, this glass of white whine introduced us to the Walker clan, helmed by seemingly perfect couple Nora (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sally-field\">Sally Field</a>) and William (Tom Skerritt). After he suffered a fatal heart attack at their sprawling California mansion, however, it emerged that William was a serial cheater who had plundered the pension fund of Ojai Foods, the family company. Reeling from these revelations, Nora and her five adult children helped each other survive his death and its aftershocks.</p> <p>The show tended towards schmaltz, with most interpersonal conflicts resolved by the time the credits rolled. It also indulged in soapy tropes, including the discovery of William\u2019s secret love child Rebecca, played by Emily VanCamp, later followed by the revelation that she didn\u2019t share Walker DNA after all, and so was free to marry Nora\u2019s son Justin (Dave Annable).</p> <p>But although it stretched credulity, Brothers and Sisters was grounded by strong acting and heartfelt moments, including Nora and her eldest daughter, rightwing pundit Kitty (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/oct/30/features11.g2\">Calista Flockhart</a>), struggling to reconcile their political differences, and PTSD-affected soldier Justin agonising over his return to Afghanistan. Field rightly won an Emmy for her role; Rachel Griffiths and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/06/matthew-rhys-welsh-bafta-cardiff-born-and-bred\">Matthew Rhys</a> showed off their charm and comic timing as working mum Sarah and lawyer Kevin respectively; and Balthazar Getty played oldest son and charisma vacuum Tommy with as much verve as the part demanded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16ec7383f4e2a292f6ae258454b802f39f8659b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16ec7383f4e2a292f6ae258454b802f39f8659b0/178_125_2731_1639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Field, Calista Flockhart and Rob Lowe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dynasty warriors... Sally Field, Calista Flockhart and Rob Lowe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Taylor/Disney/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the end of season four, the family had a lot to deal with: Kitty was coping with the after-effects of cancer treatment, Ojai Foods had finally failed, and Nora\u2019s brother Saul (Ron Rifkin) was diagnosed with HIV. The last thing they needed was another tragedy, but that\u2019s what they got. As Kitty\u2019s husband, Senator Robert McCallister, Rob Lowe was a supporting player, but an essential one \u2013 a rock for Kitty through her grief and illness. But he told producers he felt \u201cunderutilised\u201d and so Robert\u2019s car soon ploughed into an overturned lorry. Things only got cheerier from there.</p> <p>Season five saw Kitty switch off her husband\u2019s life support. Nora and Saul\u2019s mum died, Justin and Rebecca got divorced, and Kevin\u2019s husband cheated on him. Rebecca\u2019s mother Holly (Patricia Wettig) developed amnesia, and you wondered whether the writers did too, as the one good thing that happened at the end of season four \u2013 the discovery of a lucrative water source on Walker land \u2013 seemed to have been forgotten, with Nora taking a job at her local florist to make ends meet.</p> <p>In a desperate attempt to return to form, the show went back to its uncertain paternity roots, as a horrified Sarah found out that Nora\u2019s first love was her biological dad. Her wedding in the final episode provided the setting for a father-daughter reconciliation and family reunion, but the group bump and grind that resulted was eyeball-searingly embarrassing. Still, it proved that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2018/nov/08/how-rob-lowe-brought-a-tray-of-sausages-to-save-brexit-britain\">Rob Lowe</a> knew when to quit.

      "bodyText": "After Thirtysomething and before This Is Us, Brothers and Sisters was the emotionally manipulative ensemble drama of choice. In 2006, this glass of white whine introduced us to the Walker clan, helmed by seemingly perfect couple Nora (Sally Field) and William (Tom Skerritt). After he suffered a fatal heart attack at their sprawling California mansion, however, it emerged that William was a serial cheater who had plundered the pension fund of Ojai Foods, the family company. Reeling from these revelations, Nora and her five adult children helped each other survive his death and its aftershocks. The show tended towards schmaltz, with most interpersonal conflicts resolved by the time the credits rolled. It also indulged in soapy tropes, including the discovery of William\u2019s secret love child Rebecca, played by Emily VanCamp, later followed by the revelation that she didn\u2019t share Walker DNA after all, and so was free to marry Nora\u2019s son Justin (Dave Annable). But although it stretched credulity, Brothers and Sisters was grounded by strong acting and heartfelt moments, including Nora and her eldest daughter, rightwing pundit Kitty (Calista Flockhart), struggling to reconcile their political differences, and PTSD-affected soldier Justin agonising over his return to Afghanistan. Field rightly won an Emmy for her role; Rachel Griffiths and Matthew Rhys showed off their charm and comic timing as working mum Sarah and lawyer Kevin respectively; and Balthazar Getty played oldest son and charisma vacuum Tommy with as much verve as the part demanded. By the end of season four, the family had a lot to deal with: Kitty was coping with the after-effects of cancer treatment, Ojai Foods had finally failed, and Nora\u2019s brother Saul (Ron Rifkin) was diagnosed with HIV. The last thing they needed was another tragedy, but that\u2019s what they got. As Kitty\u2019s husband, Senator Robert McCallister, Rob Lowe was a supporting player, but an essential one \u2013 a rock for Kitty through her grief and illness. But he told producers he felt \u201cunderutilised\u201d and so Robert\u2019s car soon ploughed into an overturned lorry. Things only got cheerier from there. Season five saw Kitty switch off her husband\u2019s life support. Nora and Saul\u2019s mum died, Justin and Rebecca got divorced, and Kevin\u2019s husband cheated on him. Rebecca\u2019s mother Holly (Patricia Wettig) developed amnesia, and you wondered whether the writers did too, as the one good thing that happened at the end of season four \u2013 the discovery of a lucrative water source on Walker land \u2013 seemed to have been forgotten, with Nora taking a job at her local florist to make ends meet. In a desperate attempt to return to form, the show went back to its uncertain paternity roots, as a horrified Sarah found out that Nora\u2019s first love was her biological dad. Her wedding in the final episode provided the setting for a father-daughter reconciliation and family reunion, but the group bump and grind that resulted was eyeball-searingly embarrassing. Still, it proved that Rob Lowe knew when to quit. If only everyone else had.",

Pete Buttigieg says the race for the Democratic presidential nomination will come down to him and Elizabeth Warren, despite a new Washington Post-ABC poll that puts him in fourth place, with Joe Biden leading and Bernie Sanders in third. The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend has at least seen off the other buzzy young outsider in the race. But with some establishment types fearing the primary has shifted too far left, speculation is rife that none other than Hillary Clinton could launch a last-minute campaign. Iowa issues.

The US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, has criticised China\u2019s militarisation of the South China Sea at the Asean-US summit in Bangkok, condemning Beijing\u2019s \u201cintimidation\u201d of smaller nations in the strategically crucial maritime region. Delhi has introduced new rules whereby private vehicles with odd or even license plate numbers will be banned from the roads on alternate days, in a bid to reduce air pollution in the smog-afflicted Indian capital.

The Massachusetts senator is not just among the three most popular candidates, she is also the (clear) top second choice candidate among the supporters of both Biden and Sanders. Sport Lewis Hamilton came second at Sunday\u2019s US Grand Prix, but that was enough to give the British driver his sixth Formula One world championship \u2013 and to put the 34-year-old behind only Michael Schumacher as the most successful driver in the sport\u2019s history. The San Francisco 49ers are now the only undefeated team in the NFL, after the Baltimore Ravens inflicted New England\u2019s first defeat of the season, beating the Patriots 37-20 at the M&amp;T Bank Stadium on Sunday.

According to the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) and the data provider IHS Markit, civil engineering activity dropped last month at the fastest rate since October 2009, as ministers held back from making decisions on landmark road and rail schemes.

      "body": "<p>It was going to take something to be heard through the cacophony, to guide the way through the fog that sporadically impaired vision of proceedings, and to cut a tension that was quite unusual in the context of Berlin\u2019s football. In a global city where football doesn\u2019t often take centre stage, it needed something or someone to seize the moment. Sebastian Polter was ready.</p> \n<p>In this first top-flight meeting between Berlin\u2019s two most prominent clubs, Union and Hertha, where nerves crackled and fireworks fizzed, the football had been fractious in the Bundesliga new boys\u2019 atmospheric, old-school home, rebuilt by the club\u2019s supporters and still harbouring a manual scoreboard in a corner.</p> \n<p>From the moment the 28-year-old Polter came on to replace Sebastian Andersson for the last 15 minutes, he was determined to make this his moment. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of anything,\u201d Union\u2019s chief spokesman, Christian Arbeit, told the Guardian after the game, smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of guy that wants to carry the world on his shoulders.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2019/oct/30/10-most-prolific-strikers-europe-season\">Ten of the most prolific strikers in Europe this season</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It must have felt like he was doing just that after the referee Denis Aytekin awarded Union an 87th-minute penalty for Dedryck Boyata\u2019s challenge on Christian Gentner. Aytekin went over to check the video monitor, and all through the delay Polter remained on the spot, cradling the ball, alone with his thoughts. When Aytekin did give the go-ahead, he put the ball down and nervelessly smashed the winner into the top corner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"352275f8c62e75c03e6f856c35c0cd3fe615e3fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/352275f8c62e75c03e6f856c35c0cd3fe615e3fd/0_25_4049_2430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There was a fiery atmosphere inside the ground.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There was a fiery atmosphere inside the ground.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixathlon/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is the current apex of a nascent season which has astonished at every turn. Even if Union\u2019s plans continue to be undeniably ambitious, with developing their facilities and their academy in the works, dreaming of these moments and living them are two different states entirely. Their first season in the elite has been a long string of pinch-yourself pinnacles, one after the other \u2013 the overwhelming emotion of the opening-day meeting with Leipzig, with fans bringing and brandishing images of late relatives who supported the club, the improbable first win against Dortmund, and making life tough for Bayern in Munich the previous week. And now this.</p> \n<p>Arbeit had talked in the days before the game about his pride in the derby being chosen as the weekend\u2019s Top-Spiel, occupying the 6.30pm local time slot. It was always for the occasion, not the craft of the football, and what unfolded conformed exactly to type. Union hit the goal frame in the first three minutes, when Christopher Lenz headed Andersson\u2019s right-wing cross against a post, but it was the exception rather than the rule, and the best chance for either side before Polter got his opportunity late on. That he took it was Union\u2019s reward for showing the desire to chase the win rather than just observe the occasion. Hertha, their legs heavy from 120 minutes of Pokal football in front of a full house against Dynamo Dresden in the week, seemed to have little left to give, despite their superior pedigree, though Boyata insisted afterwards that it was \u201cno excuse\u201d for the performance. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t play well,\u201d the defender admitted.</p> \n<p>It had been tempting to wonder how Union would deal with the occasion of a top-level, equal-status meeting with a club that, until reunification in 1990, had played in a different national league to them. The opening day had been hard to handle. \u201cI guess that for the players on the pitch, it was all too much,\u201d Arbeit said of their 4-0 defeat by an admittedly excellent Leipzig.</p> \n<p>This time they were ready, despite the frequency of the flares and rockets, despite the two stoppages at the beginning of the second half, delaying the game by six minutes as the pyro escalated and the smoke snaked over the pitch, obscuring the players in a wispy fog.</p> \n<p>At the end, some fans in the away section fired lit rockets at Union\u2019s celebrating players, and into home sections of the stadium. Polter later discovered that his watching girlfriend and two children, sat in the main stand, were narrowly missed by one of those rockets. \u201cI think pyro has its place in a city derby,\u201d he said afterwards, \u201cbut it has to be ensured that nobody is injured.\u201d</p> \n<p>Anger rose and a handful of masked, black-clad ultras scaled the home fences and on to the pitch, to be turned back by their own players, led by their firm-minded goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz. Nothing was going to spoil this historic day for Union, but they aren\u2019t just in the Bundesliga to enjoy the scenery.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e81c001adb56cf86d4e4ec967dd2e0dee304d225\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e81c001adb56cf86d4e4ec967dd2e0dee304d225/0_0_2660_2372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer looks dejected as Eintracht go 5-1 up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"892\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer looks dejected as Eintracht go 5-1 up.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixathlon/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 A very bad Saturday for Bayern had, by Sunday evening, turned into a new start. At 5.21pm on the Saturday the final whistle blew at Eintracht Frankfurt, with the champions on the wrong end of an unprecedented 5-1 hammering, and at 8.56pm the following evening the club confirmed the departure of the coach Niko Kovac.</p> \n<p>It could be argued that the referee Marcus Schmidt had got the ball rolling at 3.39pm in Frankfurt, correctly commuting his decision to award a penalty to Eintracht and to book J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng to a free-kick and a red card for the defender for his foul on Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia after reviewing and discovering the foul was outside the box.</p> \n<p>The feeling on Sunday morning had been that the powers that be would accord Kovac a temporary reprieve until the international break. It seems, though, that Kovac had also decided enough was enough, in an environment where any authority with which he began had long been chipped away. By the end in Frankfurt it was Manuel Neuer speaking as the leader. \u201cIt was not a huge surprise for me,\u201d he said of the defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s not working. Things definitely have to change.\u201d And they have.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Profiting in the short-term are Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, extending their lead at the summit to three points after a satisfying \u2013 and slightly easier than it looked \u2013 2-1 win at a disjointed Bayer Leverkusen. Marcus Thuram was again outstanding, creating Oscar Wendt\u2019s opener and walking in the winner in the absences of Alessane Pl\u00e9a and Breel Embolo.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Leipzig made it 14 goals in four days \u2013 having trounced Wolfsburg in the DfB Pokal in the week they hammered Mainz 8-0. Timo Werner scored a hat-trick and registered a hat-trick of assists. The last player to manage that was Claudio Pizarro, for Bayern in their 9-2 hammering of Hamburg in March 2013. Werner\u2019s personal haul over the week\u2019s two games is five goals and five assists.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Oliver Glasner\u2019s Wolfsburg, meanwhile, finished off their rotten week by losing the sole remaining unbeaten Bundesliga record at Dortmund. <em>Die W\u00f6lfe</em> were in it in the first half but comprehensively outplayed and downed by three unanswered BVB goals after the break, despite the home side losing Marco Reus to injury in the first half and resting Jadon Sancho. After their Pokal victory against Gladbach it has been a good few days for Dortmund, with Lucien Favre\u2019s position strengthened by his players\u2019 second-half efforts in both games.</p>

      "bodyText": "It was going to take something to be heard through the cacophony, to guide the way through the fog that sporadically impaired vision of proceedings, and to cut a tension that was quite unusual in the context of Berlin\u2019s football. In a global city where football doesn\u2019t often take centre stage, it needed something or someone to seize the moment. Sebastian Polter was ready. In this first top-flight meeting between Berlin\u2019s two most prominent clubs, Union and Hertha, where nerves crackled and fireworks fizzed, the football had been fractious in the Bundesliga new boys\u2019 atmospheric, old-school home, rebuilt by the club\u2019s supporters and still harbouring a manual scoreboard in a corner. From the moment the 28-year-old Polter came on to replace Sebastian Andersson for the last 15 minutes, he was determined to make this his moment. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of anything,\u201d Union\u2019s chief spokesman, Christian Arbeit, told the Guardian after the game, smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of guy that wants to carry the world on his shoulders.\u201d It must have felt like he was doing just that after the referee Denis Aytekin awarded Union an 87th-minute penalty for Dedryck Boyata\u2019s challenge on Christian Gentner. Aytekin went over to check the video monitor, and all through the delay Polter remained on the spot, cradling the ball, alone with his thoughts. When Aytekin did give the go-ahead, he put the ball down and nervelessly smashed the winner into the top corner. It is the current apex of a nascent season which has astonished at every turn. Even if Union\u2019s plans continue to be undeniably ambitious, with developing their facilities and their academy in the works, dreaming of these moments and living them are two different states entirely. Their first season in the elite has been a long string of pinch-yourself pinnacles, one after the other \u2013 the overwhelming emotion of the opening-day meeting with Leipzig, with fans bringing and brandishing images of late relatives who supported the club, the improbable first win against Dortmund, and making life tough for Bayern in Munich the previous week. And now this. Arbeit had talked in the days before the game about his pride in the derby being chosen as the weekend\u2019s Top-Spiel, occupying the 6.30pm local time slot. It was always for the occasion, not the craft of the football, and what unfolded conformed exactly to type. Union hit the goal frame in the first three minutes, when Christopher Lenz headed Andersson\u2019s right-wing cross against a post, but it was the exception rather than the rule, and the best chance for either side before Polter got his opportunity late on. That he took it was Union\u2019s reward for showing the desire to chase the win rather than just observe the occasion. Hertha, their legs heavy from 120 minutes of Pokal football in front of a full house against Dynamo Dresden in the week, seemed to have little left to give, despite their superior pedigree, though Boyata insisted afterwards that it was \u201cno excuse\u201d for the performance. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t play well,\u201d the defender admitted. It had been tempting to wonder how Union would deal with the occasion of a top-level, equal-status meeting with a club that, until reunification in 1990, had played in a different national league to them. The opening day had been hard to handle. \u201cI guess that for the players on the pitch, it was all too much,\u201d Arbeit said of their 4-0 defeat by an admittedly excellent Leipzig. This time they were ready, despite the frequency of the flares and rockets, despite the two stoppages at the beginning of the second half, delaying the game by six minutes as the pyro escalated and the smoke snaked over the pitch, obscuring the players in a wispy fog. At the end, some fans in the away section fired lit rockets at Union\u2019s celebrating players, and into home sections of the stadium. Polter later discovered that his watching girlfriend and two children, sat in the main stand, were narrowly missed by one of those rockets. \u201cI think pyro has its place in a city derby,\u201d he said afterwards, \u201cbut it has to be ensured that nobody is injured.\u201d Anger rose and a handful of masked, black-clad ultras scaled the home fences and on to the pitch, to be turned back by their own players, led by their firm-minded goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz. Nothing was going to spoil this historic day for Union, but they aren\u2019t just in the Bundesliga to enjoy the scenery. Talking points \u2022 A very bad Saturday for Bayern had, by Sunday evening, turned into a new start. At 5.21pm on the Saturday the final whistle blew at Eintracht Frankfurt, with the champions on the wrong end of an unprecedented 5-1 hammering, and at 8.56pm the following evening the club confirmed the departure of the coach Niko Kovac. It could be argued that the referee Marcus Schmidt had got the ball rolling at 3.39pm in Frankfurt, correctly commuting his decision to award a penalty to Eintracht and to book J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng to a free-kick and a red card for the defender for his foul on Gon\u00e7alo Paci\u00eancia after reviewing and discovering the foul was outside the box. The feeling on Sunday morning had been that the powers that be would accord Kovac a temporary reprieve until the international break. It seems, though, that Kovac had also decided enough was enough, in an environment where any authority with which he began had long been chipped away. By the end in Frankfurt it was Manuel Neuer speaking as the leader. \u201cIt was not a huge surprise for me,\u201d he said of the defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s not working. Things definitely have to change.\u201d And they have. \u2022 Profiting in the short-term are Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, extending their lead at the summit to three points after a satisfying \u2013 and slightly easier than it looked \u2013 2-1 win at a disjointed Bayer Leverkusen. Marcus Thuram was again outstanding, creating Oscar Wendt\u2019s opener and walking in the winner in the absences of Alessane Pl\u00e9a and Breel Embolo. \u2022 Leipzig made it 14 goals in four days \u2013 having trounced Wolfsburg in the DfB Pokal in the week they hammered Mainz 8-0. Timo Werner scored a hat-trick and registered a hat-trick of assists. The last player to manage that was Claudio Pizarro, for Bayern in their 9-2 hammering of Hamburg in March 2013. Werner\u2019s personal haul over the week\u2019s two games is five goals and five assists. \u2022 Oliver Glasner\u2019s Wolfsburg, meanwhile, finished off their rotten week by losing the sole remaining unbeaten Bundesliga record at Dortmund. Die W\u00f6lfe were in it in the first half but comprehensively outplayed and downed by three unanswered BVB goals after the break, despite the home side losing Marco Reus to injury in the first half and resting Jadon Sancho. After their Pokal victory against Gladbach it has been a good few days for Dortmund, with Lucien Favre\u2019s position strengthened by his players\u2019 second-half efforts in both games.",

      "bodyText": "Player of the tournament Robert Kitson Michael Leitch. Japan\u2019s all-court rugby was among the tournament\u2019s high spots and their captain was never far from the action. Semi Radradra might have pipped him had Fiji made the last eight. Andy Bull Siya Kolisi. Wasn\u2019t the best player in the tournament, isn\u2019t even the best player in his team but what he achieved, as a captain, and a man, is bigger than that. Gerard Meagher Semi Radradra. He would walk into any side at the tournament and it baffles me that the Fiji wing was not shortlisted for the world player of the year award. His effort against Wales goes down as one of the finest individual performances in recent memory. Paul Rees Siya Kolisi. Perhaps not the outstanding player but the embodiment of a tournament played in a country where self is consumed into the whole. Claire Tolley Alun Wyn Jones, Wales. Totemic, every time he took to the pitch. Breakthrough player RK Tom Curry. Hard to believe he is only 21. On this evidence he will be part of England\u2019s back row for years. AB Tom Curry. Yes, we already knew about him because of the way he\u2019s played in the past 12 months but over the course of the World Cup he stepped up several levels again. GM Sam Underhill. A force of nature and only 23. Made the world take notice with his remarkable tackling. Always engaging off the field, too. There are a few contenders but he is captain material. PR Jordan Petaia. A shaft of light piercing Australia\u2019s gloom. CT Tagir Gadzhiev. Lived up to the nickname given him by coach Lyn Jones \u2013 Tagir the Tiger. Think what the Russia flanker could do fully professional at a big European club. Best match RK England\u2019s performance against New Zealand eclipsed all else but Japan v Scotland was the game of the tournament. With everything at stake, Japan\u2019s first-half display was a joy. AB Japan v Scotland, the day after Typhoon Hagibis blew through. Both teams were playing for a place in the knockout rounds but Japan for something much more precious and inspiring. GM England\u2019s victory over New Zealand was the best performance but it has to be Japan v Scotland. Japan were playing rugby from another planet for half an hour, then Scotland turned up and almost reeled them in. After all that had gone before, it was all the more remarkable. PR Japan v Ireland. The tournament\u2019s liftoff moment. CT Japan v Scotland \u2013 not just the result but the 20 minutes or so when Japan were unplayable. Inspirational. Best try RK Plenty to choose from but South Africa\u2019s two tries in the final will stick in the memory. The unselfish interplay between Makazole Mapimpi and Lukhanyo Am followed by Cheslin Kolbe\u2019s glorious footwork showed the Springboks were not entirely one dimensional. AB Keita Inagaki v Scotland. There were more spectacular solo scores but this was an irresistible team effort by Japan. Four players, three offloads, seven beaten tacklers, finished off by a prop. GM TJ Perenara v Namibia. A mind-boggling finish after a delightful buildup. It was the kind of try that explains why New Zealand are so often lauded for doing things other teams cannot. Australia\u2019s Marika Koroibete scored a couple of gems, too. PR TJ Perenara v Namibia. Two words: Wow and how? CT TJ Perenara v Namibia. Two decent attempted tackles, his entire body out of play in the air, except the arm to put it down \u2026 and that was just the finish. Best moment RK Japan beating Ireland lit up the tournament. The hosts were wonderful on and off the field. AB The crowd of a thousand school children in the little town of Kamaishi merrily belting out the anthems of Fiji and Uruguay before the one and only game played in the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium. GM Siya Kolisi lifting the cup. Such a powerful image that will give hope to millions. Kolisi\u2019s story has been well-documented but that doesn\u2019t make it any less inspiring. PR Canada and Namibia players mucking in to help residents clear up in Kamaishi after Typhoon Hagibis forced the postponement of their crunch match. CT Uruguay\u2019s captain Juan Manuel Gaminara\u2019s TV interview after their narrow victory over Fiji. Biggest disappointment RK Ireland. This should have been the year they finally shone at a World Cup. For whatever reason it never happened. AB The embarrassing carry-on between the unions on the weekend of the typhoon when they were all squabbling about boardroom politics while Japan was dealing with a disaster that killed 80 people. GM Hard to look past England\u2019s performance in the final. Ireland were uninspiring throughout and the furore surrounding high tackles and how referees were policing them early in the tournament was sadly inevitable. PR Three cancellations and the Scottish union making its petulance public. CT The fact the understandable cancellation of Italy v New Zealand meant one of the greatest players in history, Sergio Parisse, did not get to say goodbye to the Italy jersey Funniest moment RK The wonderful world of Japanese restaurant menus. I never knew uterus, intestine and rectum were so, er, big in Japan. My colleague accidentally ordering a bright green cappuccino was another highlight. AB A chance encounter with the local rugby team in Kamaishi. We couldn\u2019t speak each other\u2019s language but they made it very clear no one was leaving the bar until the batteries had gone on the karaoke machine. GM Watching Japan beat Ireland in a tiny bar in Kobe where the staff were bonkers and the locals were utterly bemused by what was taking place. You had to be there ... PR Rassie Erasmus\u2019s incredulous look when asked if he was a bluffer having revealed South Africa\u2019s team and tactics for the final two days early. CT South Africa\u2019s insta-perfect post-final photoshoot. Incidentally, Faf de Klerk wasn\u2019t the only one wearing national flag \u201cspeedos\u2019 \u2013 several seemed to be sporting \u201clucky pants\u201d. One thing I would change for 2023 RK Either a reserve day or an alternative stadium in the event of pool games being postponed. Had the Japan v Scotland decider been scrapped it would have been a travesty. AB For all World Rugby\u2019s talk about how they were caught short by an unseasonal typhoon, they never mentioned the underlying cause of the freakish weather. Just like the rest of us, the game needs to address the climate crisis. GM Get rid of the third-place play-off. PR In an era of extreme climate instances, a gap between the end of the pool stage and the knockout rounds to cater for postponements. CT No big rule interpretation revisions a few months before the tournament, it hits the smaller nations harder.",

The proposed new skills- and salary-assessed system will mean those in jobs the government categorises as low-skilled \u2013 including many frequently found in tourism \u2013 would be unlikely to qualify for a visa.</p> <p>Speaking at a European tourism association (ETOA) event, Louisa Cole of K&amp;L Gates, who advises on UK immigration law, said the tourism industry may struggle to recruit enough staff post-Brexit. Currently, the low-skilled category includes travel agents, tour guides, bus conductors, holiday reps and reservations staff.</p> <p>Set to come into force in 2021, the proposed immigration plans feature a minimum-salary requirement of \u00a330,000 a year. At present, the average salary of tourism workers is estimated at \u00a317,000. A large number of UK tourism businesses, <a href=\"https://www.ukinbound.org/resources/a-perfect-storm-how-ending-free-movement-will-impact-uk-tourism-executive-summary/\">surveyed by UKinbound</a>, believe they will be unable to operate should the cap come into play \u2013 this amounts to 65% of businesses nationally, , rising to 73% in London and 88% in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics estimates that of the 3.3 million workers in the UK tourism industry, overseas workers account for around 16%. However, this figure masks the reality of regional and sub-sector proportions. For example, nearly half the tourism businesses in London rely on EU nationals for more than half of their workforce according to the <a href=\"https://www.ukinbound.org/resources/a-perfect-storm-how-ending-free-movement-will-impact-uk-tourism-executive-summary/\">recent report</a> from UKinbound and Canterbury Christchurch University.</p> <p>The report estimates that the tourism industry contributed \u00a3145.9bn to the UK economy in 2018 (7.2% of UK GDP). This makes it \u201cone of the UK\u2019s most successful industries\u201d according to UKinbound CEO Joss Croft, who also spoke at the ETOA event. Croft suggested that \u201csudden restrictions could destabilise and imperil the industry\u201d and subsequently the UK economy.</p> <p>\u201cTourism is one of the UK\u2019s major success stories, growing employment across the whole of the country, demonstrating the UK\u2019s soft power, supporting education, investment and trade and showing the UK as open, tolerant and welcoming. It cannot and must not be taken for granted,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Current immigration regulations, across all industries, allow highly skilled workers to be recruited from outside the EU, and workers of all skill levels from within the EU. The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/766465/The-UKs-future-skills-based-immigration-system-print-ready.pdf\">proposed changes</a> will replace this with a skills-based threshold for all non-UK workers, who would all also require an employer to sponsor them. There will be transitional measures to allow temporary low-skilled workers on 12-month visas but that would not allow them to reapply for another 12 months (to prevent permanent UK employment). EU nationals currently residing in the UK will have to apply for a status via the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/09/two-million-eu-citizens-apply-to-remain-in-britain-brexit\">EU Settlement Scheme</a> in order to continue working in the UK (pre-settled or settled status, depending on how long they have lived in the UK). Anyone who has not applied by 2021 would be subject to the proposed new skills- and salary-assessed system.</p> <p>Although salary and skills would be prioritised, the new plan would lower the overall skills threshold from level six (degree) to level three (A-level) for visas, meaning roles such as hotel managers would be eligible for a visa. Critics of the plan in the audience at the ETOA event suggested that foreign language skills should also be part of the criteria, a need more likely met by many EU workers. This, along with flexibility on salary according to region, are said to be under consideration by the non-governmental advisory body the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/migration-advisory-committee\">Migration Advisory Committee</a>.</p> <p>Shortages in hard-to-fill roles are not a new challenge for the UK tourism industry, but according to the UKInbound report, 77% of tourism businesses have found recruitment more difficult since the EU referendum. As EU workers return home, business are trying and failing to recruit UK workers, who are less likely to apply for minimum-wage roles and may perceive the sector as an unskilled industry.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2019. EU nationals residing in the UK will not have to \u201capply for a visa, and also meet the requirements of the new EU Settlement Scheme\u201d in order to continue working in the UK, as an earlier version said. They will have to apply for status via the EU Settlement Scheme; anyone who has not applied by 2021 would be subject to the proposed new skills- and salary-assessed system.<br></p>",

Croft suggested that \u201csudden restrictions could destabilise and imperil the industry\u201d and subsequently the UK economy. \u201cTourism is one of the UK\u2019s major success stories, growing employment across the whole of the country, demonstrating the UK\u2019s soft power, supporting education, investment and trade and showing the UK as open, tolerant and welcoming. It cannot and must not be taken for granted,\u201d he said. Current immigration regulations, across all industries, allow highly skilled workers to be recruited from outside the EU, and workers of all skill levels from within the EU. The proposed changes will replace this with a skills-based threshold for all non-UK workers, who would all also require an employer to sponsor them. There will be transitional measures to allow temporary low-skilled workers on 12-month visas but that would not allow them to reapply for another 12 months (to prevent permanent UK employment). EU nationals currently residing in the UK will have to apply for a status via the EU Settlement Scheme in order to continue working in the UK (pre-settled or settled status, depending on how long they have lived in the UK). Anyone who has not applied by 2021 would be subject to the proposed new skills- and salary-assessed system. Although salary and skills would be prioritised, the new plan would lower the overall skills threshold from level six (degree) to level three (A-level) for visas, meaning roles such as hotel managers would be eligible for a visa. Critics of the plan in the audience at the ETOA event suggested that foreign language skills should also be part of the criteria, a need more likely met by many EU workers. This, along with flexibility on salary according to region, are said to be under consideration by the non-governmental advisory body the Migration Advisory Committee. Shortages in hard-to-fill roles are not a new challenge for the UK tourism industry, but according to the UKInbound report, 77% of tourism businesses have found recruitment more difficult since the EU referendum. As EU workers return home, business are trying and failing to recruit UK workers, who are less likely to apply for minimum-wage roles and may perceive the sector as an unskilled industry. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2019. EU nationals residing in the UK will not have to \u201capply for a visa, and also meet the requirements of the new EU Settlement Scheme\u201d in order to continue working in the UK, as an earlier version said. They will have to apply for status via the EU Settlement Scheme; anyone who has not applied by 2021 would be subject to the proposed new skills- and salary-assessed system.",

      "bodyText": "Activists, clerics and other perceived critics of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, continue to be arbitrarily detained more than a year after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a report has said. Bin Salman has overseen the relaxing of a number of the kingdom\u2019s restrictive social laws since assuming a leadership position in the Saudi government four years ago, most recently allowing women over 21 to obtain passports and travel abroad without the permission of a male guardian. But these reforms have belied a \u201cdarker reality\u201d, according to a report released on Monday by Human Rights Watch, including the mass arrests of women\u2019s rights activists, a number of whom have allegedly been sexually assaulted and suffered torture including whipping and electric shocks. Saudi government agencies have denied mistreatment of female activists. About 20 people have been arbitrarily detained this year and there have been 30 detentions since the murder in October last year of Khashoggi, a journalist, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, HRW said. Khashoggi\u2019s murder attracted a wave of scrutiny of the crown prince\u2019s efforts to transform the kingdom and make it less reliant on oil revenues. A UN report released in June said there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d Bin Salman and other senior Saudi officials were liable for Khashoggi\u2019s killing, which the kingdom has characterised as a rogue operation by its agents. But the international criticism has failed to halt a campaign against perceived dissidents inside the kingdom, according to the HRW report, with waves of arrests carried out against women\u2019s rights activists and their allies this year, including the writer Khadijah al-Harbi, who was pregnant at the time of her detention. Anas al-Mazrou, a lecturer at King Saud University, was arrested in March after raising the issue of the detained women\u2019s rights activists during a panel discussion at Riyadh book fair. Michael Page, a deputy Middle East division director at HRW, said: \u201cMohammed bin Salman has created an entertainment sector and allowed women to travel and drive, but Saudi authorities have also locked away many of the country\u2019s leading reformist thinkers and activists on his watch, some of whom called for these very changes. \u201cIt\u2019s not real reform in Saudi Arabia if it takes place in a dystopia where rights activists are imprisoned and freedom of expression exists just for those who malign the dissidents.\u201d The crackdown under Bin Salman began in September 2017 with the arrests of dozens of critics, including intellectuals and influential clerics, in what was widely interpreted as an attempt to crush dissent. The report noted the arrest of human rights activists and dissidents was not a new phenomenon, but the wave of repression since late 2017 had been distinguished by \u201cthe sheer number and range of individuals targeted over a short period of time, as well as the introduction of new repressive practices not seen under previous Saudi leadership\u201d. These practices included extorting financial assets in exchange for a detainee\u2019s freedom, a tool used against dozens of businesspeople and royal family members arbitrarily held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh in November 2017. The kingdom has also allegedly scaled up its use of commercially available surveillance technologies to penetrate the online accounts of critics and dissidents. Guardian journalists are among those to be warned they have been targeted by a hacking unit inside the Saudi government. On Sunday, the engine of Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy, the state-owned energy company Aramco, announced plans to list on the domestic stock exchange. The sale of shares in the world\u2019s most profitable company, including eventually on a foreign stock exchange, would raise at least hundreds of millions of dollars the Saudi government hopes to use to fund the country\u2019s transformation and ensure its long-term future in a world where fossil fuel use is projected to dwindle. The social reforms shepherded through by Bin Salman, often against significant opposition from conservative elements, are part of this wider economic transformation, but Saudis have complained the new \u201cred lines\u201d are difficult to discern and inconsistently enforced.",

Yet even when so much seemed possible for the striker whose goals had obliterated Germany at Euro 2012, Balotelli acknowledged his powerlessness to stop football fans in his home country from abusing him for the colour of his skin.</p> \n<p>Returning to Italy this summer, after stints away at Liverpool, Nice and Marseille, he wondered if things had changed. \u201cI hope with all my heart there won\u2019t be any repeat of the things that happened when I was last here,\u201d he said after signing for Brescia. \u201cI hope Italy has taken some steps forward.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was destined to be disappointed. The Serie A season has witnessed several instances of players being racially abused, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/08/internazionale-romelu-lukaku-latest-victim-ultras-racism\" title=\"\">Romelu Lukaku at Cagliari</a> to Dalbert at Atalanta and Ronaldo Vieira <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/20/serie-a-roundup-ronaldo-vieira-racially-abused-by-roma-fans\" title=\"\">during a home game for Sampdoria</a> against Roma.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/03/mario-balotelli-threatens-to-walk-off-over-racist-abuse-at-verona-brescia\" title=\"\">Balotelli was the target for monkey chants</a> during Brescia\u2019s game at Verona. In the 55th minute, he responded. Fighting to keep the ball in play down by the corner flag, Balotelli turned suddenly and lashed it up towards supporters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/03/mario-balotelli-threatens-to-walk-off-over-racist-abuse-at-verona-brescia\">Mario Balotelli hits out at Verona fans after suffering racist abuse</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Chaos ensued. The referee, Maurizio Mariani, booked Balotelli for unsportsmanlike behaviour. Balotelli threatened to walk off. Players from both teams intervened, talking Balotelli down while also informing officials of the abuse he had received. Mariani waved off the yellow card and suspended the game, instructing the stadium announcer to warn fans it would be abandoned if the chants continued.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd9e92cc8297718c07c4eac100992fc61b752f1c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd9e92cc8297718c07c4eac100992fc61b752f1c/0_52_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Balotelli scored a fabulous late for for Brescia in a 2-1 defeat at Verona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Balotelli scored a fabulous late for for Brescia in a 2-1 defeat at Verona.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filippo Venezia/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After a delay of almost five minutes, play resumed. Verona, already leading through a goal from Eddie Salcedo, extended their advantage through Matteo Pessina. Balotelli responded with a spectacular strike from the edge of the D, struck first time off his right instep into the top corner. It was not enough to rescue Brescia from a 2-1 defeat.</p> \n<p>The situation only got worse after the final whistle, when the Verona manager, Ivan Juric, flatly denied any racist abuse had taken place. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say that nothing happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was loud whistling and mockery but no racist chant. There was nothing. I am a Croatian and I hear \u2018Gypsy piece of shit\u2019 sometimes because unfortunately that is the tendency in Italy but today there was nothing.\u201d</p> \n<p>What possessed him to take such a hard line only he can know. In any case, he was wrong. Juric might not have heard the monkey chants but several of his players did and they were plainly audible on a fan-shot video that circulated on Sunday evening.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/03/bayern-munich-niko-kovac\">Niko Kovac leaves Bayern Munich after Eintracht Frankfurt thrashing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This has too often been the default mode for clubs whose fans stand accused of racist chanting: to mount an aggressive defence first \u2013 often calling into question the integrity of the victim \u2013 and ascertain the facts of what happened later. The Verona president, Maurizio Setti, supported his manager\u2019s line, claiming his team\u2019s supporters were simply \u201csarcastic, not racist\u201d.</p> \n<p>Verona will likely be punished. The independent observer sent to monitor this game heard the racist chants and included them in the official report \u2013 something that did not happen when Lukaku and Dalbert were verbally abused and which should allow the sporting justice greater scope for punishment.</p> \n<p>Still, there are ambiguities that make the verdict hard to predict. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the observer only ascribed the monkey chants to a group of about 15 fans. Balotelli was booed and whistled by many more but we are into murky territory. What constitutes racist abuse rather than jeering of an opponent?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Regardless of the outcome, the discouraging thought is that once again nothing will change. This was a weekend when Roma\u2019s game against Napoli was also suspended in response to territorial discrimination from Roma\u2019s ultras. The initial warning from the stadium announcer was roundly ignored. Only the intervention of Edin Dzeko, encouraging fans to drown out the chants with cheers, seemed to get things back on track.</p> \n<p>Balotelli\u2019s assessment that you cannot force people not to be racist rings as true as ever. On the other hand, Italian football cannot absolve itself of responsibility. Clubs in other countries do a far more effective job of identifying individuals who engage in racist chanting and keeping them out of the stands.</p> \n<p>This is a slow process and even with maximum commitment could not be achieved overnight. It is hard to see how it will ever happen at clubs whose first instinct is to accuse a victim of making it up.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Defeat for Brescia meant the sack for Eugenio Corini \u2013 the manager who steered them to promotion. His team have taken one point from their past six games, but to me this still felt premature. This has been a gruelling run, including games against Juventus, Inter, Napoli and Fiorentina \u2013 none of whom beat them by more than a single goal.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Roma leapt up to third by beating Napoli in a hugely entertaining game, and Paulo Fonseca really does seem to have his team moving on a positive trajectory despite a long injury list. Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo opened the scoring with a wonderful left-foot finish \u2013 marking his fourth straight game with a goal \u2013 and even Javier Pastore is playing well now that he\u2019s back in his preferred home at No 10. Chris Smalling once again played his part, too, with an acrobatic clearance off the line.</p> \n<p>\u2022 When is a handball not a handball? Don\u2019t ask Matthijs De Ligt, who was not punished in the Turin derby when the ball struck his arm in almost identical pose to that in which it had done so when he gave away a penalty against Lecce. This time: no spot-kick \u2013 a contrast that only looked sharper after Juventus edged to a 1-0 victory over their city rivals, courtesy of a volley from the defender himself.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Is it time to start viewing Cagliari as serious contenders for the Champions League? They won 2-0 away to Atalanta, drawing level on points with the Bergamo club and Lazio in fourth place. The Sardinians were aided by a first-half red card to Josip Ilicic but the 23-year-old Uruguayan Christian Oliva was magnificent in midfield. His only previous start came away to Napoli, where Cagliari also won, 1-0.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Two more goals for Romelu Lukaku, who rescued Inter after they fell behind at Bologna. He has nine in Serie A already, placing him second only to Ciro Immobile \u2013 who is already on 13 for Lazio.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "\u2018You can\u2019t delete racism. It\u2019s like a cigarette. You can\u2019t stop smoking if you don\u2019t want to, and you can\u2019t stop racism if people don\u2019t want to.\u201d Six years have passed since Mario Balotelli spoke those words in an interview with Sports Illustrated. He was on top of the world, Italy\u2019s No 9 and fresh from a triumphant half-season at Milan. Signed from Manchester City during the January transfer window, he had scored 12 times in 13 games, carrying Milan to third place. The magazine\u2019s front cover depicted him walking on water. Yet even when so much seemed possible for the striker whose goals had obliterated Germany at Euro 2012, Balotelli acknowledged his powerlessness to stop football fans in his home country from abusing him for the colour of his skin. Returning to Italy this summer, after stints away at Liverpool, Nice and Marseille, he wondered if things had changed. \u201cI hope with all my heart there won\u2019t be any repeat of the things that happened when I was last here,\u201d he said after signing for Brescia. \u201cI hope Italy has taken some steps forward.\u201d He was destined to be disappointed. The Serie A season has witnessed several instances of players being racially abused, from Romelu Lukaku at Cagliari to Dalbert at Atalanta and Ronaldo Vieira during a home game for Sampdoria against Roma. On Sunday, Balotelli was the target for monkey chants during Brescia\u2019s game at Verona. In the 55th minute, he responded. Fighting to keep the ball in play down by the corner flag, Balotelli turned suddenly and lashed it up towards supporters. Chaos ensued. The referee, Maurizio Mariani, booked Balotelli for unsportsmanlike behaviour. Balotelli threatened to walk off. Players from both teams intervened, talking Balotelli down while also informing officials of the abuse he had received. Mariani waved off the yellow card and suspended the game, instructing the stadium announcer to warn fans it would be abandoned if the chants continued. After a delay of almost five minutes, play resumed. Verona, already leading through a goal from Eddie Salcedo, extended their advantage through Matteo Pessina. Balotelli responded with a spectacular strike from the edge of the D, struck first time off his right instep into the top corner. It was not enough to rescue Brescia from a 2-1 defeat. The situation only got worse after the final whistle, when the Verona manager, Ivan Juric, flatly denied any racist abuse had taken place. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say that nothing happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was loud whistling and mockery but no racist chant. There was nothing. I am a Croatian and I hear \u2018Gypsy piece of shit\u2019 sometimes because unfortunately that is the tendency in Italy but today there was nothing.\u201d What possessed him to take such a hard line only he can know. In any case, he was wrong. Juric might not have heard the monkey chants but several of his players did and they were plainly audible on a fan-shot video that circulated on Sunday evening. This has too often been the default mode for clubs whose fans stand accused of racist chanting: to mount an aggressive defence first \u2013 often calling into question the integrity of the victim \u2013 and ascertain the facts of what happened later. The Verona president, Maurizio Setti, supported his manager\u2019s line, claiming his team\u2019s supporters were simply \u201csarcastic, not racist\u201d. Verona will likely be punished. The independent observer sent to monitor this game heard the racist chants and included them in the official report \u2013 something that did not happen when Lukaku and Dalbert were verbally abused and which should allow the sporting justice greater scope for punishment. Still, there are ambiguities that make the verdict hard to predict. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the observer only ascribed the monkey chants to a group of about 15 fans. Balotelli was booed and whistled by many more but we are into murky territory. What constitutes racist abuse rather than jeering of an opponent? Regardless of the outcome, the discouraging thought is that once again nothing will change. This was a weekend when Roma\u2019s game against Napoli was also suspended in response to territorial discrimination from Roma\u2019s ultras. The initial warning from the stadium announcer was roundly ignored. Only the intervention of Edin Dzeko, encouraging fans to drown out the chants with cheers, seemed to get things back on track. Balotelli\u2019s assessment that you cannot force people not to be racist rings as true as ever. On the other hand, Italian football cannot absolve itself of responsibility. Clubs in other countries do a far more effective job of identifying individuals who engage in racist chanting and keeping them out of the stands. This is a slow process and even with maximum commitment could not be achieved overnight. It is hard to see how it will ever happen at clubs whose first instinct is to accuse a victim of making it up. Talking points \u2022 Defeat for Brescia meant the sack for Eugenio Corini \u2013 the manager who steered them to promotion. His team have taken one point from their past six games, but to me this still felt premature. This has been a gruelling run, including games against Juventus, Inter, Napoli and Fiorentina \u2013 none of whom beat them by more than a single goal. \u2022 Roma leapt up to third by beating Napoli in a hugely entertaining game, and Paulo Fonseca really does seem to have his team moving on a positive trajectory despite a long injury list. Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo opened the scoring with a wonderful left-foot finish \u2013 marking his fourth straight game with a goal \u2013 and even Javier Pastore is playing well now that he\u2019s back in his preferred home at No 10. Chris Smalling once again played his part, too, with an acrobatic clearance off the line. \u2022 When is a handball not a handball? Don\u2019t ask Matthijs De Ligt, who was not punished in the Turin derby when the ball struck his arm in almost identical pose to that in which it had done so when he gave away a penalty against Lecce. This time: no spot-kick \u2013 a contrast that only looked sharper after Juventus edged to a 1-0 victory over their city rivals, courtesy of a volley from the defender himself. \u2022 Is it time to start viewing Cagliari as serious contenders for the Champions League? They won 2-0 away to Atalanta, drawing level on points with the Bergamo club and Lazio in fourth place. The Sardinians were aided by a first-half red card to Josip Ilicic but the 23-year-old Uruguayan Christian Oliva was magnificent in midfield. His only previous start came away to Napoli, where Cagliari also won, 1-0. \u2022 Two more goals for Romelu Lukaku, who rescued Inter after they fell behind at Bologna. He has nine in Serie A already, placing him second only to Ciro Immobile \u2013 who is already on 13 for Lazio.",

      "body": "<p>The Drive curves quietly through the green of Maresfield Park, past mature trees, grass verges and tall, polite hedges that offer glimmers of the homes beyond: slate roofs, mullion windows, block-paving, gravel.</p> <p>Once part of a local manor house estate, the land here was requisitioned during the first world war and afterwards parcelled up and sold as separate plots. In the decades since, those plots have become architectural playgrounds of a sort, adventures in Georgian, Regency and Tudorbethan styles, updated and remodelled, with conservatories, annexes and bifold doors.</p> <p>It would be easy to miss Bella and Nick Honness Roe\u2019s house. Set back from the road, it is a low-lying brick building with a carport. Built in 1963, it was designed by local architects for a sea captain who retired to this landlocked corner of East Sussex. Save for its gull-wing roof, it has few of the frills of its neighbours.</p> <p>The couple moved here in the autumn of 2015, shortly after the birth of their second child, leaving behind their two-bedroom flat with cantilevered stairs on the Golden Lane estate in London. \u201cIt was tiny,\u201d says Bella. \u201cOur living space was the size of what is now our playroom. And that was fine when we had one child. But then we were hankering after more space, and this place came up \u2026\u201d</p> <p>For Bella, a film academic, and her husband, a marketing specialist, the appeal was not so much the location, near Gatwick airport and the M25, but the excitement of the house itself. She walks me through the building, from the kitchen along the light-filled corridor that leads to the bedrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s all the original stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cThe design of that period was very liveable \u2013 built-in furniture and wood-panelling, built-in Formica.\u201d </p> <p>They found the property via the Modern House, an estate agency that launched in 2005 and swiftly acquired a cult online following through its website, mailing list and, later, Instagram. It specialises in design-led, architecturally intriguing properties from former factories to art deco gems, modernist estates, urban spaces, loft conversions, new-builds and even partnerships with Turner prize-winning architects Assemble.</p> <p>The peculiar thing about the Modern House is that it has become such a colossal hit with those who could never hope to afford even the cheapest of its listings. For many, it serves not so much as an estate agency but as something we can pleasurably gawp at, in much the same way as Holly Golightly in the film Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, penniless but dreaming, was wont to stare at the window displays of the luxury jewellery store and feel that \u201cnothing very bad could happen\u201d there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a6528f12e9425171e54422d934e11b1b1797376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a6528f12e9425171e54422d934e11b1b1797376/0_0_4644_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bella and Nick Honness Roe\u2019s house in East Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bella and Nick Honness Roe\u2019s house in East Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: French + Tye/The Modern House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI derive a lot of pleasure from looking at beautifully curated spaces,\u201d says a fan of the website, Wilhemina Madeley, 30. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t own a house myself and that continues to be a distant dream (especially in London), I often feel inspired by how spaces are transformed through colour, art and carefully selected items of furniture. More often than not, I look at the properties between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3500,000 because I like to see what I could potentially afford in the future and how people have transformed small and challenging spaces.\u201d</p> <p>The Modern House, with its homes\u2019 ordered beauty and outlandish prices, serves as a form of escapism. How sweet life would be, we think to ourselves, if we could spend our days in such open-plan, light-filled harmony.</p> <p>Bella had long been on the Modern House mailing list. \u201cI\u2019ve always been slightly obsessed with modernist architecture,\u201d she explains. When she first spotted the listing, it was at an emotionally charged time \u2013 shortly after the death of her mother, when Bella was four months pregnant.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t even seriously looking, and I just said: \u2018Let\u2019s just go look at this house this weekend.\u2019 It was the sort of house I\u2019d always loved; it was geographically just about doable; it was just about workable for work; it wasn\u2019t too far from London; it was near a town that looked nice \u2026\u201d That was in April. In July, they put in an offer. \u201cIt took us a really long time to get over taking that leap,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd in the end we just realised we would never know if it was right for us unless we just did it.\u201d</p> <p>There are other property sites with devoted followings \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/CHEAPOLDHOUSES/\" title=\"\">Cheap Old Houses</a>, for instance, the Instagram celebration of largely US doer-uppers; sites dedicated to French chateaus and Tuscan farmhouses, all of which offer a diversion from the drudgery of our daily existence. But what marks out the Modern House is the enduring appeal of its aesthetic and the remarkable affection in which it is held. While other estate agents are often regarded with suspicion, the Modern House is thought of by some of its fans as a friend.</p> <p>The Modern House London offices occupy the ground floor of St Alphege hall, a 1930s church hall in Borough, south London. Here, Matt Gibberd and his business partner, Albert Hill, employ 25 office-based staff; they have more across the country. Both 41, they met at school in Dorset, where Gibberd recalls that Hill \u201cwas very much always an entrepreneurial spirit. Even in those days he was always up to something. He decided he wanted to collect obscure training shoes, so he would buy these boxfresh Nikes and store them in his cupboard.\u201d Hill would sell the trainers to collectors in Japan. \u201cAnd then his dad had a garage studio where you couldn\u2019t get through the door because it had all of Albert\u2019s Memphis Group furniture in it.\u201d</p> <p>A few years later, when they were both journalists writing about architecture and design, Hill had what he describes as a \u201clightbulb moment\u201d \u2013 realising he could apply the same approach he had taken to selling collectable trainers and furniture to selling collectable houses. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t need to put them in my dad\u2019s garage.\u201d </p> <p>Hill\u2019s grandfather was an interior designer, and for a time his father worked finding land for a housing association. When he was nine, the family moved somewhat abruptly from south London to Lyme Regis, to an arts and crafts house on the seafront \u2013 his parents having once told its owners to let them know if they ever felt compelled to sell. \u201cThey said that would be the only reason that they would ever leave London,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they got the call one day. So we had to pack up our London home, our London life and all go down to Dorset.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that informed the business \u2013 the idea that, for one house, you would change everything.\u201d</p> <p>Gibberd, whose father and grandfather were both architects, had also inherited the family interest in buildings. \u201cIt sounds a bit pathetic now but aged 13 I would\u2019ve asked my parents for a book on architecture and minimalism for Christmas,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lived in quite a few different places, buying and selling around Islington,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I also learned about the commercial side of housing. Which is a bit of a taboo subject, but is a reality and the reason why we\u2019re able to do what we do. We always say we\u2019re really lucky because we get to indulge in our passion, which is architecture and design, but we\u2019ve also found a way of monetising it.\u201d</p> <p>The first property they marketed was Six Pillars in Dulwich, south London. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/aug/30/weekend7.weekend8\" title=\"\">Which is a Tecton house</a>,\u201d Hill says. \u201cGrade II*.\u201d Although it was already on the market with another agency, Hill and Gibberd called the owner and told him about their fledgling company. \u201cHe said: \u2018Great, let\u2019s do it!\u2019\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cHe said the other agency didn\u2019t understand the house.\u201d</p> <p>The house still took a while to sell, and not just because of the \u00a31.3m price tag. \u201cThe thing about the pure modern movement houses, especially the early ones, is they\u2019re museum pieces,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to take quite an enlightened buyer who\u2019s going to live in it in that slightly reverential way.</p> <p>\u201cBack then, investing all of your life savings in a house that was design-led, that was such an oddity in the market, you had to have pretty strong nerves,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s changed considerably. It\u2019s partly this shift to people being interested in experiences over objects. The space in your home is where you experience most of your life.

      "bodyText": "The Drive curves quietly through the green of Maresfield Park, past mature trees, grass verges and tall, polite hedges that offer glimmers of the homes beyond: slate roofs, mullion windows, block-paving, gravel. Once part of a local manor house estate, the land here was requisitioned during the first world war and afterwards parcelled up and sold as separate plots. In the decades since, those plots have become architectural playgrounds of a sort, adventures in Georgian, Regency and Tudorbethan styles, updated and remodelled, with conservatories, annexes and bifold doors. It would be easy to miss Bella and Nick Honness Roe\u2019s house. Set back from the road, it is a low-lying brick building with a carport. Built in 1963, it was designed by local architects for a sea captain who retired to this landlocked corner of East Sussex. Save for its gull-wing roof, it has few of the frills of its neighbours. The couple moved here in the autumn of 2015, shortly after the birth of their second child, leaving behind their two-bedroom flat with cantilevered stairs on the Golden Lane estate in London. \u201cIt was tiny,\u201d says Bella. \u201cOur living space was the size of what is now our playroom. And that was fine when we had one child. But then we were hankering after more space, and this place came up \u2026\u201d For Bella, a film academic, and her husband, a marketing specialist, the appeal was not so much the location, near Gatwick airport and the M25, but the excitement of the house itself. She walks me through the building, from the kitchen along the light-filled corridor that leads to the bedrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s all the original stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cThe design of that period was very liveable \u2013 built-in furniture and wood-panelling, built-in Formica.\u201d They found the property via the Modern House, an estate agency that launched in 2005 and swiftly acquired a cult online following through its website, mailing list and, later, Instagram. It specialises in design-led, architecturally intriguing properties from former factories to art deco gems, modernist estates, urban spaces, loft conversions, new-builds and even partnerships with Turner prize-winning architects Assemble. The peculiar thing about the Modern House is that it has become such a colossal hit with those who could never hope to afford even the cheapest of its listings. For many, it serves not so much as an estate agency but as something we can pleasurably gawp at, in much the same way as Holly Golightly in the film Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, penniless but dreaming, was wont to stare at the window displays of the luxury jewellery store and feel that \u201cnothing very bad could happen\u201d there. \u201cI derive a lot of pleasure from looking at beautifully curated spaces,\u201d says a fan of the website, Wilhemina Madeley, 30. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t own a house myself and that continues to be a distant dream (especially in London), I often feel inspired by how spaces are transformed through colour, art and carefully selected items of furniture. More often than not, I look at the properties between \u00a3350,000 and \u00a3500,000 because I like to see what I could potentially afford in the future and how people have transformed small and challenging spaces.\u201d The Modern House, with its homes\u2019 ordered beauty and outlandish prices, serves as a form of escapism. How sweet life would be, we think to ourselves, if we could spend our days in such open-plan, light-filled harmony. Bella had long been on the Modern House mailing list. \u201cI\u2019ve always been slightly obsessed with modernist architecture,\u201d she explains. When she first spotted the listing, it was at an emotionally charged time \u2013 shortly after the death of her mother, when Bella was four months pregnant. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even seriously looking, and I just said: \u2018Let\u2019s just go look at this house this weekend.\u2019 It was the sort of house I\u2019d always loved; it was geographically just about doable; it was just about workable for work; it wasn\u2019t too far from London; it was near a town that looked nice \u2026\u201d That was in April. In July, they put in an offer. \u201cIt took us a really long time to get over taking that leap,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd in the end we just realised we would never know if it was right for us unless we just did it.\u201d There are other property sites with devoted followings \u2013 Cheap Old Houses, for instance, the Instagram celebration of largely US doer-uppers; sites dedicated to French chateaus and Tuscan farmhouses, all of which offer a diversion from the drudgery of our daily existence. But what marks out the Modern House is the enduring appeal of its aesthetic and the remarkable affection in which it is held. While other estate agents are often regarded with suspicion, the Modern House is thought of by some of its fans as a friend. The Modern House London offices occupy the ground floor of St Alphege hall, a 1930s church hall in Borough, south London. Here, Matt Gibberd and his business partner, Albert Hill, employ 25 office-based staff; they have more across the country. Both 41, they met at school in Dorset, where Gibberd recalls that Hill \u201cwas very much always an entrepreneurial spirit. Even in those days he was always up to something. He decided he wanted to collect obscure training shoes, so he would buy these boxfresh Nikes and store them in his cupboard.\u201d Hill would sell the trainers to collectors in Japan. \u201cAnd then his dad had a garage studio where you couldn\u2019t get through the door because it had all of Albert\u2019s Memphis Group furniture in it.\u201d A few years later, when they were both journalists writing about architecture and design, Hill had what he describes as a \u201clightbulb moment\u201d \u2013 realising he could apply the same approach he had taken to selling collectable trainers and furniture to selling collectable houses. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t need to put them in my dad\u2019s garage.\u201d Hill\u2019s grandfather was an interior designer, and for a time his father worked finding land for a housing association. When he was nine, the family moved somewhat abruptly from south London to Lyme Regis, to an arts and crafts house on the seafront \u2013 his parents having once told its owners to let them know if they ever felt compelled to sell. \u201cThey said that would be the only reason that they would ever leave London,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they got the call one day. So we had to pack up our London home, our London life and all go down to Dorset.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that informed the business \u2013 the idea that, for one house, you would change everything.\u201d Gibberd, whose father and grandfather were both architects, had also inherited the family interest in buildings. \u201cIt sounds a bit pathetic now but aged 13 I would\u2019ve asked my parents for a book on architecture and minimalism for Christmas,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lived in quite a few different places, buying and selling around Islington,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I also learned about the commercial side of housing. Which is a bit of a taboo subject, but is a reality and the reason why we\u2019re able to do what we do. We always say we\u2019re really lucky because we get to indulge in our passion, which is architecture and design, but we\u2019ve also found a way of monetising it.\u201d The first property they marketed was Six Pillars in Dulwich, south London. \u201cWhich is a Tecton house,\u201d Hill says. \u201cGrade II*.\u201d Although it was already on the market with another agency, Hill and Gibberd called the owner and told him about their fledgling company. \u201cHe said: \u2018Great, let\u2019s do it!\u2019\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cHe said the other agency didn\u2019t understand the house.\u201d The house still took a while to sell, and not just because of the \u00a31.3m price tag. \u201cThe thing about the pure modern movement houses, especially the early ones, is they\u2019re museum pieces,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to take quite an enlightened buyer who\u2019s going to live in it in that slightly reverential way. \u201cBack then, investing all of your life savings in a house that was design-led, that was such an oddity in the market, you had to have pretty strong nerves,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s changed considerably. It\u2019s partly this shift to people being interested in experiences over objects. The space in your home is where you experience most of your life. Back then, a house was more seen as a bank account or just bricks and mortar.\u201d There has also been a shift in our approach to location. When the Modern House launched, it broke with the conventional estate agent model of serving only one geographical area. \u201cInstead, we celebrate the house and try and attract people from beyond that area,\u201d says Gibberd. The bulk of the Modern House\u2019s properties are in southern England, although there is a regional spread. At any one time, its roster might range from a \u00a395,000 chapel in Suffolk to a \u00a310m architect-designed house in Hampstead, north London. \u201cThe lower end of the market always sells so well,\u201d says Hill. \u201cOne of the founding principles was: it\u2019s not about price, it really is about design, and we\u2019ve always tried to keep as broad a price spectrum as we can.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary, the rise of interest in these homes,\u201d says John Grindrod, author of Concretopia: A Journey Around the Rebuilding of Postwar Britain. \u201cI think Grand Designs has had a bit to do with it, and I think it\u2019s partly a reaction against developers\u2019 houses of the 80s and 90s \u2013 heritage design, fake Tudor, with small rooms and small windows.

      "bodyText": "Mothercare\u2019s UK business has become the latest high-profile victim of the high street crisis as the baby and maternity retailer said it was entering administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. The company said it expected its 79-shop UK chain and online business, which lost \u00a336.3m last year, to be wound down by administrators as it had become clear it could not return to profitability. The administration will not include Mothercare\u2019s profitable overseas operations, which have more than 1,000 stores in over 40 countries. The company, which opened its first store in 1961, said the UK administration filing \u2013 which is expected as soon as Tuesday \u2013 was a \u201cnecessary step in the restructuring and refinancing of the group\u201d after failing to find a buyer. Mothercare\u2019s closure is the latest blow to the UK retail industry after a tough two years which has left more than 7,500 additional shops empty. Well-known names including Karen Millen, Bonmarch\u00e9 and Supercuts have all called in administrators in recent months. Others, including Debenhams, Monsoon and Arcadia Group, have used an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to close shops and cut jobs. Mothercare, whose chief executive Mark Newton-Jones left in April last year only to return a month later, has struggled to compete with supermarkets, online retailers and general retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and Boots. Shoppers outside the group\u2019s Wood Green store in north London on Monday said they would be sad to see Mothercare go. But several said it was more expensive and less convenient than buying from supermarkets, Primark or Amazon. \u201cWhen you can get good quality stuff from Asda or Tesco why bother going to Mothercare? It\u2019s the same items and paying \u00a320 [for some babywear] doesn\u2019t make sense when they are only going to wear it for three months,\u201d said one mother of three pushing her pram past the Wood Green store. Victoria Logan, a shopper with a baby in a pram, said: \u201cI was a bit surprised to hear about the administration.

Founded by Selim Zilkha and Sir James Goldsmith, Mothercare has been listed on the London stock exchange since 1972. Ten years later it merged with Habitat and then British Home Stores to form Storehouse, but the group was broken up in 2000 when BHS was sold to Sir Philip Green.

      "body": "<p>Markets are good at finding the value of some things, but not others. Women are one of those \u201cothers\u201d. As Vicky Pryce puts it in her new book, <em>Women </em><em>vs Capitalism</em>, \u201cwomen are a valuable resource, whose true value is not understood or reflected in market prices\u201d. This book shines a much-needed light on discrimination that still holds too many women back \u2013 and what we can do about it.</p> <p>I first met Pryce when she was joint head of the Government Economic Service and I was working for a bank. Although I am a couple of decades behind Pryce in terms of experience, so much of what she says resonates with me. When I started work as an economist at the Bank of England, just six of my graduate intake of 37 were women. Two decades on, the bank has still not had a female governor in its 600-year-plus history, and only one of nine members of the bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is a woman. Things are changing \u2013 the IMF is headed by Kristalina Georgieva, and the US Federal Reserve was led by Janet Yellen under Obama\u2019s presidency. But, as Pryce argues, even that progress is fragile without a pipeline of talent being nurtured.</p> <p>Why don\u2019t women get the top jobs? Pryce, like others, argues that women are penalised for having children but that men never are. Taking time out for maternity leave and working part-time results in women missing out on promotion or the opportunities to work on big projects. Too often, women find that the men in their cohort scoop up the big jobs and they end up working for them. Three in four working mothers report discrimination in the workplace; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/24/maternity-leave-discrimination-54000-women-lose-jobs-each-year-ehrc-report\" title=\"\">54,000 a year</a> lose their jobs as a result of having a baby; and, perhaps more surprisingly, periods spent in part-time work lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/05/mothers-working-part-time-hit-hard-by-gender-pay-gap-study-shows\" title=\"\">nearly no pay progression</a>. The 1970 Equal Pay Act didn\u2019t have any answers to this, although it did a huge amount to stamp out blatant pay discrimination. In 1970, the average male industrial worker earned twice that of a woman. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender-pay-gap\" title=\"\">Gender pay gap reporting</a> is beginning to expose the gender divide in the labour market. But, Pryce argues, until firms have to show how they are going to reduce their pay gaps, it is little more than box-ticking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f336199f391af741bf41de0dde7bf75ec91939b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f336199f391af741bf41de0dde7bf75ec91939b8/0_0_1632_2464/662.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Shines a much-needed light\u2019: former joint head of the Government Economic Service Vicky Pryce\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shines a much-needed light\u2019: former joint head of the Government Economic Service Vicky Pryce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond the motherhood penalty, Pryce picks up other biases. The truth is \u201cpeople tend to like people like themselves\u201d. If the people at the top of an organisation are all men, it\u2019s hardly surprising that they hire and promote more men in their image. In making the argument for quotas for women on boards Pryce points to some depressing and shocking attitudes that still prevail in too many boardrooms: \u201cmost women don\u2019t want the hassle or the pressure of sitting on a board\u201d or \u201call the \u2018good\u2019 women have already been snapped up\u201d. As well as quotas, Pryce\u2019s solutions include better parental leave, access to finance to help female entrepreneurs flourish, pay transparency, and much greater access to flexible working. But the key argument is simple: capitalism won\u2019t fix the problem \u2013 and it\u2019s a market failure that costs us all. The talent of too many women is wasted because they don\u2019t get promoted, or in many cases leave the labour market altogether.</p> <p>What is missing from Pryce\u2019s account is an analysis of the experience of women at the bottom of the labour market: the \u201c61% of low-paid workers [who] are women\u201d. Beyond saying that women often take lower-paid, less senior jobs (especially after a period of maternity leave), there isn\u2019t much analysis of why work traditionally seen as \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d (caring, for example) is valued at such a discount compared with \u201cmen\u2019s work\u201d. Nor is there much analysis of why women seem to \u201cchoose\u201d jobs in the lower-paid parts of the economy in the first place. That is a shame, because it warrants more attention. Pryce\u2019s interviews are illuminating, but they are with women at the top, not the bottom, in their sector. That said, Pryce does make the argument that women\u2019s work in the home is undervalued, and floats the idea of a basic income to reward that work, pointing to recent ONS data that shows that UK women do 60% more unpaid work than men. Women v capitalism is an ever tougher battle if you are a low-paid woman bringing up a family, relying on benefits to top up your earnings.</p> <p>However, for policymakers, directors and women wondering what they can do to fight back, this is a fantastic book. My daughter told me a couple of years ago that when she grows up she wants to be a fairy princess. If that doesn\u2019t work out, then I hope government and business have adopted some more of the policies that Pryce argues for by then. It will help ensure that whatever she wants to do she won\u2019t be held back by the discrimination that Pryce shows is endemic.</p> <p><em>Rachel Reeves is Labour MP for Leeds West </em><em>and </em><em>chair of the </em><em>business, </em><em>energy and </em><em>industrial </em><em>strategy </em><em>select </em><em>committee. </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Women vs Capitalism: Why We Can\u2019t Have It All in a Free Market Economy</em> by Vicky Pryce is published by C Hurst &amp; Co (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>This week, Twitter\u2019s founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1189634360472829952\">announced the company\u2019s plan to ban all political ads</a> on the platform. The ban encompasses paid tweets from candidates as well as \u201cpolitical issues\u201d ads. The announcement received widespread applause, in particular from leading Democratic figures, but far less enthusiasm from those who create, run or research political advertising.</p> <p>Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads is unnecessarily severe and simplistic, disadvantages challengers, and is likely unenforceable \u2013 but it was a great PR move for the company, for now.</p> <p>As others have<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-bans-political-advertising/\"> pointed out</a>, there is lots of room for nuanced digital ad policy between Facebook\u2019s \u201ceverything goes\u201d model and Twitter\u2019s blackout. But Twitter\u2019s new policy is simplistic and likely will have unintended effects.</p> <p>After Dorsey tweeted the new policy, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1189656652250845184\">Trump campaign released a statement</a> decrying the move, pointing to the ban as more \u201cevidence\u201d for supposed anti-conservative bias. But the last person who needs Twitter ads is Trump. My research indicates that upwards of 80% of Trump tweets end up in news stories, earning him massive amounts of media exposure. The move by Twitter all but ensures a repeat of 2016, when Trump\u2019s Twitter tactics helped gain his campaign <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\">an estimated $2bn </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html\">of earned media coverage</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Challenger campaigns use low-cost digital ads to build lists of supporters, solicit donations, and mobilize volunteers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moving beyond Trump and the US presidential election, Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads disadvantages challengers and political newcomers. Digital ads are much cheaper than television ads, <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~gjmartin/papers/Ads_Online_and_Offline_Working.pdf\">drawing in a wider scope of candidates, especially for down-ballot races.</a> Though much of the public debate about digital ads focuses on hyped-up fears of nefarious persuasion, many more digital ads are used as an organizational tool. Challenger campaigns use low-cost digital ads to build lists of supporters, solicit donations and mobilize volunteers. Digital ads also allow political newcomers to introduce themselves \u2013 a tactic that often only breaks through with paid promotion.</p> <p>As a smaller platform, Twitter brings in far less revenue in political ads than, say, Facebook. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nedsegal/status/1189651487065923584\">According to Twitter\u2019s CFO ,Ned Segal</a>, the company brought in less than $3m from political ads during the 2018 US midterms. But Twitter offers political newcomers the ability to communicate to a crucial population: journalists and political elites. From Twitter, <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/journalists-on-twitter-study.php\">journalists infer what is newsworthy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/26/watching-democratic-debates-tonight-with-twitter-little-screen-keep-this-mind/\">tweets that get high engagement on the platform can lead to news coverage</a>. Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads will make it harder for challengers and newcomers to break into the news cycle.</p> <p>A move to ban political ads still puts Twitter in the position of arbitrating political speech, as it must decide what is \u2013 and what is not \u2013 political. Identifying candidate ads is relatively straightforward, but identifying political issue ads is anything but. Though the full policy won\u2019t be public until 15 November, Twitter\u2019s policy and legal lead, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vijaya/status/1189664481263046656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext%252Fhtml%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07%26schema%3Dtwitter%26url%253\">Vijaya Gadde, offered a working definition</a>: \u201cAds that advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance (such as: climate change, healthcare, immigration, national security, taxes).\u201d These broad categories are open to vast interpretive flexibility.

Advocating a certain healthcare policy may be political, but what about advertising locations of healthcare centers? What about women\u2019s healthcare centers? What about women\u2019s healthcare centers like Planned Parenthood? Can they advertise about breast exams? Birth control? Abortions? The broad category of \u201chealthcare\u201d gets fuzzy fast. Of course, defining anything as <em>not </em>political tends to come from a privileged point of view.</p> <p>With the end of political ads, does that mean the end of the <a href=\"https://ads.twitter.com/transparency/i/political_advertisers\">Twitter ad archive</a>? The archive had problems, to be sure, but it did provide a measure of transparency. With a ban policy in place, Twitter should continue to embrace transparency and implement some method for showcasing what ads are rejected for being deemed political. Furthermore, Twitter should establish clear and specified mechanisms to contest these decisions. My <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10584609.2019.1619639?journalCode=upcp20\">research</a>, with <a href=\"https://danielkreiss.com/\">Daniel Kreiss</a>, suggests that tech firms\u2019 vagaries around political ad guidelines, decisions and processes leave political users frustrated and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/01/are-google-facebook-censoring-conservatives-problem-is-more-widespread-than-that/\">leaves tech firms open to charges of conservative bias</a>.</p> <p>From a PR perspective, though, Twitter\u2019s announcement was a slam dunk.

Once, on a shopping trip to Birmingham with school friends, I tried on halter necks, short skirts and flimsy summer dresses in the Topshop changing rooms, just to see how they looked. I remember the wild excitement, gazing at a reflection that didn\u2019t seem like me.

The Chiefs\u2019 gritty 26-23 win over Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings not only improved their record to 6-3, good enough to keep them in first place in the AFC West, it showed that this is a genuine team and not just Patrick Mahomes\u2019s supporting cast.</p> <p>Nobody, other than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealSkipBayless/status/1191101338798583808\">delusional professional contrarian Skip Bayless</a>, would argue that the Chiefs would be better off in the long run with Moore rather than Mahomes. Mahomes is a generational talent, who could potentially be the face of the entire league. The sooner he comes back from his dislocated knee, the better it will be for the team\u2019s chances at winning, both in the short-term and in the long-term.</p> <p>With that obvious caveat, the Chiefs having to come together to win this game without Mahomes could end up paying dividends later in the season. When Mahomes is fully healthy and playing at his best, he is about as close as it comes to football having a cheat code and there can be a temptation to simply run the offense through him and let him rack up ridiculous numbers. In the regular season, in a quarterback-driven league, that\u2019s usually going to result in a win. The postseason, however, can be a different beast, as the Chiefs learned <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001012380/article/chiefs-learn-tough-lesson-in-afc-title-game-defeat-to-patriots\">back in January</a>.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s offensive star was wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who showed why the Chiefs have stuck with him despite the disturbing child abuse allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/19/tyreek-hill-cleared-domestic-violence-case\">leveled against him</a>. Hill picked up 140 receiving yards, averaging 23.3 yards per carry and was the recipient of Moore\u2019s lone touchdown pass. He even managed to steal the spotlight from his own teammate when he caught up to running back Damien Williams during his 91-yard touchdown run. The late game heroics came courtesy of kicker Harrison Butker who hit a 54-yard field goal to tie the game and then won it all on a 44-yarder.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ComplexSports/status/1191086386062884864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tyreek Hill caught up to Damien Williams with ease \ud83d\ude33<br><br> <a href=\"https://t.co/dKkGMtfk9W\">pic.twitter.com/dKkGMtfk9W</a></p>&mdash; Complex Sports (@ComplexSports) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComplexSports/status/1191086386062884864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And then there was Kansas City\u2019s much derided defense.

In no uncertain terms, she delivers. Don\u2019t Start Now is a flex in every sense: Lipa sets herself apart by eschewing the charts\u2019 predominant rap-influenced sound and going classic. It starts with the tightest disco bassline, adding strings and sparkle until the song\u2019s sharp scaffolding builds out to an opulent penthouse, all velvet cushions and mirrored halls. And her voice is the ritziest fixture of all: she swoons witheringly as she reminds a begging ex that he was the one who ditched her \u2013 via <a href=\"https://genius.com/18355086\">a canny I Will Survive reference</a> \u2013 and struts when she says she\u2019s quite all right without him, thanks very much indeed.

Earlier this year the pair duetted on the single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pryRrJvfI\">Monopoly</a>, with palpable chemistry: \u201cI\u2019m so thankful working with my best friend, she the cheat code,\u201d they rap at one another. Fanbase duly widened, Mon\u00e9t is gearing up for a solo project in 2020, and this single is a sensational calling card for it: perhaps the best R&amp;B track of the year. Over gorgeous production flourishes like a bathwater-warm brass section and a distorted guitar solo, she sings a witty, equally warm song admiring her own behind \u2013 one that has men apparently regarding it not so much with lechery as baffled wonderment. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmkjultuaFc\">L\u00e5psley \u2013 My Love Was Like the Rain</a></h2> <p>Before the current crop of super-young, hyper-emotional pop stars \u2013 Billie Eilish, Beabadoobee, Clairo et al \u2013 there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/03/lapsley-i-dont-have-to-say-i-love-the-kind-of-music-i-make\">L\u00e5psley</a>, who released her confident, heartfelt debut aged just 19. Three years on, with millions of streams and the greatest disco song of recent years in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvzJ-3yCto0\">DJ Koze-remixed Operator</a> behind her, she\u2019s returned with this wise, poetic new single. With a smooth, cool electropop backing, she characterises the love she gives as various natural elements \u2013 sky, rain, sea, fire, flowers \u2013 and there is such sureness to her voice as she sings: \u201cSo I embody these elements / I wear them as a fragrance.\u201d It\u2019s the bracing sound of someone who has figured out who they are \u2013 until the next youthful epiphany. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NZvM1918_E\">Harry Styles \u2013 Lights Up</a></h2> <p>Someone else who sounds like they\u2019ve done some growing up and learning is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/harry-styles\">Harry Styles</a>, who has released the best song yet of any of the ex-One Directioners. The lyrics have been read by internet gossips as a defiant announcement of bisexuality, though truth be told they\u2019re so vague (\u201cI could, but wouldn\u2019t stay / Wouldn\u2019t put it like that / What do you mean? / I\u2019m sorry by the way\u201d) that he still sounds buffeted by confusion. There is a stridency, though, to the chorus line: \u201cStep into the light \u2026 I\u2019m not ever going back.\u201d Musically, it doesn\u2019t sound like anything else in the charts \u2013 there\u2019s a touch of the cosmic funk of Tame Impala, but the gospel chorus, supple bassline and Balearic guitars all cohere into something genuinely fresh. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzVyhB_PUmg\">Twin Atlantic \u2013 Novocaine</a></h2> <p>This is rock music at its most compressed and synthetic \u2013 a sound that can be wretchedly empty. But the Scottish band, approaching veteran status with 13 years in the game, have a truly euphoric chorus that befits their recent jump to a major label. The lyrics are all drunken, teary blank poetry \u2013 \u201cIf I\u2019m nothing, you\u2019re it all / My foolish electric heart\u201d \u2013 sung with jolting passion by Sam McTrusty. There are shades of Bloc Party\u2019s Helicopter to the rhythm guitar and relentless pace, and the whole endeavour is suffused with the Big Music of their Celtic forebears: Simple Minds, U2, the Waterboys, the Blue Nile, Big Country et al. <strong>BBT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17d60d24d99bbcac56bcbf189cfb98c58ec56deb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17d60d24d99bbcac56bcbf189cfb98c58ec56deb/0_326_2128_1425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Davido.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davido.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Fieber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9H3iinXZv0\">Davido \u2013 Risky (feat. Popcaan)</a></h2> <p>West Africa meets the Caribbean \u2013 via, for the video, a housing estate in west London \u2013 in this brilliantly written pop-dancehall ballad, with Nigeria\u2019s Davido and Jamaica\u2019s Popcaan stepping and skanking around the beat with nimble vocal melodies. Their earnestness and casual mastery makes the track, but credit also to producer Speroach Beatz, whose love of lithe, ringtone-cutesy melodies has cemented him as one of the prime movers in the Afropop scene. <strong>BBT</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlJDTxahav0\">Selena Gomez \u2013 Lose You to Love Me</a></h2> <p>There\u2019s unavoidable celebrity subtext here: Lose You to Love Me is a towering revenge ballad aimed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/justin-bieber\">Justin Bieber</a>, who reportedly broke up with Selena Gomez in spring 2018, only to be married to model Hailey Baldwin by that September. But Gomez\u2019s comeback (after she took a few years away to recover from lupus and a kidney transplant) stands independently from the gossip as a timeless riposte. The weighty piano is just spare enough to let her words sear (\u201csang off-key in my chorus \u2019cause it wasn\u2019t yours\u201d is a great evocation of someone\u2019s careless egoism), building to a chorus laden with choral backing vocals. The amassed voices offer protection to her fairly devastating conclusion \u2013 one that sets new stakes for the self-love pop song: \u201cI needed to hate you to love me.\u201d There\u2019s an air of an avant-garde Adele to it, and it also marks the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/billie-eilish-the-pop-icon-who-defines-21st-century-teenage-angst\">Billie Eilish</a>\u2019s brother and producer, Finneas, into the big leagues. <strong>LS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b83a484306aaf70ddc13078ab500822f003aa91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b83a484306aaf70ddc13078ab500822f003aa91/0_0_1499_2000/750.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Bejar, aka Destroyer.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Bejar, aka Destroyer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maegan Hill-Carroll</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mFTgJQtCPk\">Destroyer \u2013 Crimson Tide</a></h2> <p>Dan Bejar\u2019s voice has a very specific pleasure: it\u2019s laced with a sneer, and he tends to ease into a song weighed down by a sighing sense of contempt for the world around him. Yet he can\u2019t help himself from leaning in deeper, picking up the pace and stacking his opaque observations until they find a captivating sense of momentum. On Crimson Tide, there are \u201cchicken shit singers paying their dues\u201d, a funeral that \u201cgoes completely insane\u201d, a woman who instructs him to \u201cget into the zone\u201d when \u201cthe zone is brimstone and wire\u201d. His strange yet beguiling images slip down easier thanks to a synth-pop turn that rumbles in on classic Peter Hook bass and snapping drum machines. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StIrPbglNPc\">The Orielles \u2013 Come Down on Jupiter</a></h2> <p>The Halifax band feel like the closest thing we have to a contemporary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/04/stereolab-songbook-tim-gane-laetitia-sadier\">Stereolab</a>: as sharp as they are spacey, at home with psychedelic wooze and seductively chugging guitar pop. The lead single from their forthcoming second album wildly expands the indie ambitions of their debut: it starts out mystic and silvery, the sound of coils lazily unwinding, then snaps into a determined riff that grows ever tighter, like a Chinese finger trap. There\u2019s no telling what dreamy singer Esme Dee Hand-Halford is on about (\u201cthrift shop cowboys\u201d, anyone?), but the four-piece mingle their joyful yips with Clangers-worthy cosmic transmissions, creating a unique, glittering energy. <strong>LS</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGHxth8rcBk\">Lanark Artefax \u2013 Corra Linn</a></h2> <p>It often takes an artist years for their sound to slough off its influences and reach maturity, but Scottish producer Lanark Artefax seemed to arrive fully formed in 2017 with his debut EP. Yes, there were hints of Aphex Twin and Arca, but the way his beatific chords spluttered and spat, like an ersatz gas fire on a flatscreen TV, was all his own. His live show, performed in front of a 2001-style monolith, is excellent, and it was little wonder Bj\u00f6rk came calling: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9TpwojyW5Q\">his take on Arisen My Senses</a> is one of the best ever remixes of her work. There\u2019s often a latent jungle energy to his tracks, which he brought to the fore for 2018\u2019s Styx, and is now combined into this chimeric lead track from an EP of the same name. As well as the breaks \u2013 and the startled vocal whoop that has become his signature \u2013 there are hints of dancehall and trap rhythms, and the tracks squirms around itself, never allowing itself comfort. <strong>BBT</strong></p>",

What happens when we travel across borders? As identities shift, and boundaries are questioned or defended, now is the time to explore migration stories.</p> <p>Inspiration and metaphor spring readily from the contrasts between different worlds.

      "bodyText": "Express your interest in this course What tales emerge when people journey from one place to another, one kind of life to another, one identity to another? What happens when we travel across borders? As identities shift, and boundaries are questioned or defended, now is the time to explore migration stories. Inspiration and metaphor spring readily from the contrasts between different worlds. Transitions generate plot. Perhaps migration - physical, emotional, spiritual, conceptual - is at the heart of all storytelling. Drawing on more than 20 years of writing and teaching, award-winning author Elise Valmorbida leads this practical one-day workshop to explore storytelling (fiction or nonfiction) with particular emphasis on language, memory, character and place. Through discussion, writing exercises and supportive critical feedback, you will learn how to write about migration - your own or others\u2019 - and how to bring ideas to life on the page. You\u2019ll approach creative writing with a fresh sense of confidence and direction.

Greater Manchester police said officers tried to stop the Ford Fusion at 9.25pm on Sunday before it made off and collided with a building in the suburb of Burnage. The two occupants of the car were taken to hospital with injuries described as life-threatening, police said. One of the men, aged in his late teens, died later in hospital and the other remains in a critical condition. The dead teenager was named locally as Deon Simpson according to the Manchester Evening News. Police said the incident had been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which has launched an investigation in the circumstances around the crash, in line with policy around fatal crashes following a police pursuit. Images from the scene appeared to show the vehicle flipped on its side into the end of a row of shops at the busy junction in south Manchester. Greater Manchester fire and rescue service said its officers pulled the two men from the wreckage at the junction of Burnage Lane and Lane End Road. DCS Jon Chadwick, of GMP\u2019s professional standards branch, said: \u201cI would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family of the person who has passed away following the collision in Burnage last night. \u201cThe response to the incident is still ongoing and there are a number of road closures in place in the nearby area, with the scene likely to remain for some time. \u201cIn line with our usual policy with incidents of this nature, we have made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and they have made a decision to launch an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collision.\u201d",

It happens to the few teams that are lucky enough to make it to the top. It\u2019s what makes sports interesting. But the speed at which this team has changed course is stunning, leaving the rest of the NBA with whiplash.</p> <p>Obviously, the Warriors\u2019 title hopes were on shaky ground before Wednesday. They had already lost a lot of their core over the summer: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/kevin-durant-brooklyn-nets-nba-free-agency-kyrie-irving\">Durant left for Brooklyn</a>, Shaun Livingston retired and Andre Iguodala was sent to Memphis. And with Thompson out at least until February while he recovers from a torn achilles tendon, Curry and Draymond Green were going to have to carry a roster with nine players 23 years old or younger.</p> <p>In some ways, this was inevitable: Thompson, Curry and Green have huge amounts of wear-and-tear on their bodies. Over the last five years, the Warriors have played 105 postseason games. Considering a regular season is 82 games, that means they played six seasons of basketball in five years. Warriors\u2019 coach Steve Kerr tried to manage their minutes during the regular season and sit them for minor bumps and bruises. But injuries are bound to happen with that kind of mileage. Nevertheless, these situations leave a long trail littered with what ifs.</p> <p>What if Green hadn\u2019t cursed at Durant and dared him to leave the Warriors during a fight last November, something Durant recently acknowledged played into him choosing Brooklyn during free agency. Or what if the Warriors hadn\u2019t let Durant play in Game 5 of the finals, when he ruptured his achilles tendon in his first game back after missing a month because of a calf strain? In an alternate universe would Durant have been healthy this season and still on the Warriors? But this is what people always do when things go wrong. They question. They wonder. They perseverate.</p> <p>There\u2019s a silver lining to all of this for the Warriors, though. The younger guys will get minutes and experience \u2013 and losing isn\u2019t a bad thing because that\u2019ll increase the team\u2019s chances of getting a better lottery pick. That coupled with the return of Curry and Thompson could propel the Warriors to being a championship-caliber team next season. For now, the pressure is completely off the Warriors. And in many ways that\u2019s liberating.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not excited to have everything completely different,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/sns-tns-bc-bkn-warriors-green-20191102-story.html\">Green told reporters last week</a>. \u201cBut I am excited from the standpoint of it\u2019s a new challenge. It\u2019s a different challenge. And even more importantly, these young guys get an opportunity to really try to make a name for themselves and try to build up on their careers, change their lives, change their family\u2019s lives. To see that, that\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p>And if the Warriors tank \u2013 purposely or not \u2013 who knows what could happen. The San Antonio Spurs tanked in 1997 so they could acquire Tim Duncan with the top pick in the draft the following season. That led to five championships.</p> <p>It\u2019s too early to tell whether this is just a lost season for the Warriors. Or whether this marks something much more significant \u2013 the end of one of the most exciting runs in NBA history. But while people surmise about the Warriors\u2019 future, one thing is certain: Curry does not seem worried. The day after sustaining his injury, Curry posted a photo to his Instagram account in which he was dressed in a Buzz Lightyear costume, smiling ear-to-ear while standing alongside his family on Halloween. He added a video of him sidestepping along the sidewalk, as his wife laughed along.</p> <p>If he\u2019s not stressing, perhaps others shouldn\u2019t either. The Warriors will be back. And let\u2019s not forget that anything can happen to any team, even in as few as six games.</p>",

Nevertheless, these situations leave a long trail littered with what ifs. What if Green hadn\u2019t cursed at Durant and dared him to leave the Warriors during a fight last November, something Durant recently acknowledged played into him choosing Brooklyn during free agency. Or what if the Warriors hadn\u2019t let Durant play in Game 5 of the finals, when he ruptured his achilles tendon in his first game back after missing a month because of a calf strain? In an alternate universe would Durant have been healthy this season and still on the Warriors? But this is what people always do when things go wrong. They question. They wonder. They perseverate. There\u2019s a silver lining to all of this for the Warriors, though. The younger guys will get minutes and experience \u2013 and losing isn\u2019t a bad thing because that\u2019ll increase the team\u2019s chances of getting a better lottery pick. That coupled with the return of Curry and Thompson could propel the Warriors to being a championship-caliber team next season. For now, the pressure is completely off the Warriors. And in many ways that\u2019s liberating. \u201cYou\u2019re not excited to have everything completely different,\u201d Green told reporters last week. \u201cBut I am excited from the standpoint of it\u2019s a new challenge. It\u2019s a different challenge. And even more importantly, these young guys get an opportunity to really try to make a name for themselves and try to build up on their careers, change their lives, change their family\u2019s lives. To see that, that\u2019s exciting.\u201d And if the Warriors tank \u2013 purposely or not \u2013 who knows what could happen. The San Antonio Spurs tanked in 1997 so they could acquire Tim Duncan with the top pick in the draft the following season. That led to five championships. It\u2019s too early to tell whether this is just a lost season for the Warriors. Or whether this marks something much more significant \u2013 the end of one of the most exciting runs in NBA history. But while people surmise about the Warriors\u2019 future, one thing is certain: Curry does not seem worried. The day after sustaining his injury, Curry posted a photo to his Instagram account in which he was dressed in a Buzz Lightyear costume, smiling ear-to-ear while standing alongside his family on Halloween. He added a video of him sidestepping along the sidewalk, as his wife laughed along. If he\u2019s not stressing, perhaps others shouldn\u2019t either. The Warriors will be back. And let\u2019s not forget that anything can happen to any team, even in as few as six games.",

\n<p>But nearly a year later there is scant sign of progress, as the country reels from a series of humiliating high-profile attacks and murder statistics surge to levels not seen even during the darkest days of Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s 2006-2012 \u201cwar on drugs\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eacc6277-77e2-442b-804d-217b8340d53b\"

late 2006 when the president at the time, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, ordered thousands of troops onto the streets in response to an explosion of horrific violence in his native state of Michoac\u00e1n.</p>\n    <p>Calder\u00f3n hoped to smash the drug cartels with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/30/mexico-drug-war-tierra-caliente-calderon\">heavily militarized onslaught </a>but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico\u2019s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Kingpin strategy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Simultaneously Calder\u00f3n also began pursuing the so-called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/mexico-drug-kingpins-behind-bars-violence-corruption-unchecked\">\u201ckingpin strategy\u201d&nbsp;</a>by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders.</p>\n    <p>That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps \u2013 notably Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva who was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/17/arturo-beltran-leyva-drug-cartel\">gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009</a>&nbsp;\u2013 but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie.</p>\n    <p>Under Calder\u00f3n\u2019s successor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the government\u2019s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world\u2019s most murderous mafia groups.</p>\n    <p>But Calder\u00f3n\u2019s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa\u2019s Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.</p>\n    <p>When \u201cEl Chapo\u201d was arrested in early 2016, Mexico\u2019s president bragged: \u201cMission accomplished\u201d. But the violence went on. By the time Pe\u00f1a Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>\"Hugs not bullets\"</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The leftwing populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics.

But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants.</p>\n    <p>Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Last month Mexico\u2019s security chief, Alfonso Durazo, <a href=\"https://www.milenio.com/politica/durazo-presume-inflexion-homicidios-dolosos-baja-percepcion-inseguridad\">claimed</a> the crisis was reaching \u201cinflection point\u201d \u2013 only for his upbeat message to be imploded by a week of mayhem which saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/15/mexico-police-officers-killed-cartel-ambush-michoacan\">cartel gunmen slay 13 police officers</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/el-chapo-son-ovidio-guzman-lopez-release-amlo\">paralyze a major city</a> in order to free the son of Mexico\u2019s most famous drug lord, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.</p> \n<p>In the first nine months of this year, Mexico suffered an average of close to 100 murders a day.</p> \n<p>Tijuana has seen a methamphetamine-fuelled murder epidemic which produced a record 2,518 murders in 2018 and looks set to cause even more this year.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe state has lost control,\u201d said Victor Clark, a security expert and activist based in the city.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d1463b385e27455c89903888cda8f0fed02f31b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d1463b385e27455c89903888cda8f0fed02f31b/0_0_4464_2976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man carrying a Mexican flag walks through downtown Tijuana to celebrate the country\u2019s recent independence day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man carrying a Mexican flag walks through downtown Tijuana to celebrate the country\u2019s recent independence day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilio Espejel/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>\u2018Killings that matter to no one\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>To explore the violence blighting Latin America\u2019s number two economy the Guardian spent seven days reporting from Tijuana \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most deadly cities \u2013 between 4 and 11 October.</p> \n<p>The Guardian\u2019s week had an unusually peacefully start, with not a single murder recorded in the first 24 hours, according to the newly elected mayor, Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez Cruz.</p> \n<p>Gonz\u00e1lez, a L\u00f3pez Obrador ally, claimed that had not happened in several years and voiced frustration the media had ignored the achievement.</p> \n<p>But by day two the slaughter had resumed.

      "bodyText": "Brianna Rojas seemed her usual breezy self as she set off for work. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later!\u201d friends remember the 20-year-old calling out as she headed to her insurance company\u2019s bright yellow offices on Tijuana\u2019s Calle del Carmen. But by lunchtime Rojas was dead \u2013 shot in the head at close range by an unknown assassin whose attack pushed the number of homicides here to almost 1,800 so far this year, and nearly 26,000 nationwide. When first responders arrived they encountered a fearful scene: the victim slumped backwards in a black swivel chair, her arms flopping downwards towards a pool of blood as if she had been caught completely by surprise. \u201cShe was a decent girl, a good-looking girl \u2013 she was always smiling,\u201d said her longtime boyfriend\u2019s father as shellshocked relatives gathered outside and crime scene officers prepared to transport Rojas\u2019s body to the city\u2019s overburdened morgue. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating what is happening here,\u201d said the man, who asked not to be named. \u201cIt is out of control.\u201d Pacifying Mexico When Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador became Mexico\u2019s president last December he vowed to \u201cpacify\u201d one of Latin America\u2019s most violent nations by waging war on the social roots of crime. But nearly a year later there is scant sign of progress, as the country reels from a series of humiliating high-profile attacks and murder statistics surge to levels not seen even during the darkest days of Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s 2006-2012 \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. Last month Mexico\u2019s security chief, Alfonso Durazo, claimed the crisis was reaching \u201cinflection point\u201d \u2013 only for his upbeat message to be imploded by a week of mayhem which saw cartel gunmen slay 13 police officers and then paralyze a major city in order to free the son of Mexico\u2019s most famous drug lord, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. In the first nine months of this year, Mexico suffered an average of close to 100 murders a day. Tijuana has seen a methamphetamine-fuelled murder epidemic which produced a record 2,518 murders in 2018 and looks set to cause even more this year. \u201cThe state has lost control,\u201d said Victor Clark, a security expert and activist based in the city. \u2018Killings that matter to no one\u2019 To explore the violence blighting Latin America\u2019s number two economy the Guardian spent seven days reporting from Tijuana \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most deadly cities \u2013 between 4 and 11 October. The Guardian\u2019s week had an unusually peacefully start, with not a single murder recorded in the first 24 hours, according to the newly elected mayor, Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez Cruz. Gonz\u00e1lez, a L\u00f3pez Obrador ally, claimed that had not happened in several years and voiced frustration the media had ignored the achievement. But by day two the slaughter had resumed. At 6am a man\u2019s body was found dumped in the eastern neighbourhood of Emperadores. At 11.35am a decomposing pair of legs were spotted on wasteland in the city\u2019s south. And at 2.45pm an unidentified killer barged into a home on Calle Tamaulipas, pulled out a gun and brought an unidentified male\u2019s life to an end. \u201cMunicipal police officers mounted an operation to track down the person thought responsible for the attack,\u201d one local tabloid reported \u2013 though in a country where more than 90% of crimes go unpunished there was no indication they had succeeded. Outside Tijuana\u2019s general hospital a bullet-riddled people-carrier bore witness to the latest gunfight. What had happened? \u201cAn accident,\u201d a police investigator snapped, shooing reporters away as forensic science officers marked each of the entry holes with white cards marked A-K. The next evening 30-year-old Jes\u00fas Bernal staggered into an alley off Calle Belice, blood oozing from at least four separate gunshot wounds in his legs and wrists. As ambulance technicians strapped the blood-spattered man to a stretcher with silver duct tape, a police officer claimed he was a convicted burglar probably shot while trying to rob a local home. \u201cIt\u2019s a punishment \u2026 a message,\u201d speculated one of the first responders. But like so much of the bloodletting, the case would go unreported by newspapers, unnoticed by society and unsolved by the police. \u201cThese are killings that matter to no one,\u201d Clark said. \u2018An era of great psychological terror\u2019 It has been just over a decade since a savage turf war for control of drug smuggling routes into the United States made Tijuana one of the most ill-famed cities on Earth. There was an explosion of carnage in 2008 as El Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa cartel tried to muscle in on what had long been the domain of the locally based Tijuana mob. Corpses were hung from bridges and shootouts raged, even in the city\u2019s most glitzy corners. In one of the most disturbing episodes 12 corpses were abandoned with their tongues hacked out and placed nearby in a black plastic bag. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t go out because you were scared of what might happen,\u201d recalled Dora Elena Cort\u00e9s, a local journalist whose Agencia Fronteriza de Noticias chronicled the butchery. \u201cIt was an era of great psychological terror.\u201d Negative headlines sparked government action and by 2012 the number of annual murders had plunged. But Tijuana\u2019s murder rate is now soaring once again with the slaughter so routine that one local newspaper features a muert\u00f3metro (deathometer) to help readers keep track. Authorities and academics blame the new wave of violence on a largely hidden dispute for Tijuana\u2019s drug trade \u2013 particularly that of crystal meth \u2013 although Brianna Rojas\u2019s murder did not seem to fit that mould. \u201cThese deaths aren\u2019t about the fight for control of the routes into the US. They\u2019re fighting over the local market,\u201d said Clark. That appeared to be what was at stake on the night of 8 October when dozens of heavily armed police descended on a petrol station after a drive-by shooting left four men injured, one critically. Illuminated in the the red and blue lights of emergency vehicles, a half-naked man lay in a pool of blood, shot through the thigh and fighting for his life. After a 10-minute race to the hospital, he was carried in past police with white skulls stamped on to their black uniforms and rifles slung from their shoulders. Investigators barked questions at the man\u2019s three accomplices as they lay bleeding in the corridor. Mayor Gonz\u00e1lez admitted it was \u201cunreal\u201d to expect an immediate end to Tijuana\u2019s murder crisis but hoped the body count could be reduced and insisted the city\u2019s \u201ceconomic dynamism\u201d remained unaffected. During an interview at Tijuana\u2019s brutalist city hall he reiterated the president\u2019s doctrine that crime would only be stopped by rehabilitating Tijuana\u2019s \u201csocial fabric\u201d and eradicating corruption. \u201cCorruption is the mother of all evils, because it affects everything,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. Clark, the expert who has spent decades tracking Tijuana\u2019s security situation, was pessimistic such tactics alone would work. \u201cSo far nothing has changed \u2013 absolutely nothing,\u201d he said of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s first year in power. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt he has good intentions. But what they are doing isn\u2019t enough.\u201d For residents of Boulevard Fundadores, where Tijuana\u2019s public mortuary is located, change cannot come fast enough. On the afternoon of 9 October, as Brianna Rojas\u2019s mother came to recover her daughter\u2019s corpse, the cloying stench of decomposing bodies hung in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. Every single day we breathe death,\u201d fumed one local woman who has been campaigning to get the morgue moved. The woman reached for her smartphone to show a series of macabre images depicting conditions inside. One showed perhaps two dozen naked corpses sprawled on the floor, a putrid tangle of bloodied limbs. \u201cAt night it\u2019s like there are 60 dead dogs lying out here,\u201d the woman complained of the reek. \u201cWe can\u2019t open our windows.\u201d Forty-eight hours later \u2013 as the week reached a bloody peak - emergency workers from Mexico\u2019s Red Cross raced westwards to collect their latest cargo from a tumbledown community called Francisco Villa. A man was hauled semi-conscious from a hillside shooting gallery and hoisted into the ambulance, his arms bound with bandages to prevent him lashing out. \u201cHe got shot in the skull,\u201d one of the team said. Would he survive? \u201c50-50,\u201d they replied. Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija",

      "body": "<p>Wandering around a <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/vija-celmins\" title=\"\">Vija Celmins retrospective</a> at the Met Breuer gallery in Manhattan with the poet-turned-novelist Ben Lerner, I sensed that I had walked into a trap. We had met to discuss his new book, <em>The Topeka School</em>, the third and most intricate in his acclaimed trilogy of novels featuring a Lerner-like character named Adam Gordon, and yet it wasn\u2019t easy to tell who was interviewing whom. Lerner turned to fiction only after publishing three volumes of poetry (the second, <em>Angle of Yaw</em>, got him shortlisted for a <a href=\"https://www.nationalbook.org/books/angle-of-yaw/\" title=\"\">National book award</a> in 2006), and his novels share a disarming, conversational tone, a taste for collage, and a playful attitude to the line between life and art \u2013 a line poets have never been called on to respect. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/05/leaving-atocha-station-ben-lerner\" title=\"\">Leaving the Atocha Station</a></em> (2011) features a callow American poet lounging around Madrid on a Fulbright scholarship (as Lerner once did); <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/04/10-04-review-ben-lerner-great-writer\" title=\"\">10:04</a></em> (2014) incorporates some of Lerner\u2019s art criticism and a magazine story he published, and opens with the narrator and his agent celebrating the \u201cstrong six figure\u201d advance he\u2019s received for the novel you\u2019re reading. Neither is autobiographical in any straightforward sense: <em>10:04</em> focuses on a single man\u2019s plan to get a platonic friend pregnant, while the real Lerner had been happily married for years.</p> <p>His creative work now seems pleasantly bifurcated: he still writes poems for experimental collaborations with visual artists and intellectuals, while collecting mainstream accolades as a novelist. He has received a Guggenheim and a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant, and has been named in the New York Times as the most talented writer of his generation. Being with him in the museum, looking at Celmins\u2019s series of mesmeric images, felt eerily like being in a Ben Lerner novel (one work by Celmins that juxtaposes a starry sky with a plummeting warplane even appears in <em>10:04</em>). \u201cThe fact/fiction divide is like a therapeutic frame,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s some creative pretending about your relationships.\u201d And as we made our way through the galleries he brought up disparate things I\u2019d said in order to draw thematic connections between them, as if sketching out the start of an autobiographical novel on my behalf, or serving as a therapist. </p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s unsurprising, since Lerner is the child of therapists, raised in Kansas where both his parents worked at the renowned Menninger Foundation, and where his mother, Harriet Lerner, wrote her bestselling books, beginning with <em>The Dance of Anger</em>. It\u2019s also where the teenage Ben first learned to talk rings around people, becoming a state and national champion in competitive debate and holding his own against the other boys at parties \u2013 where middle-class white kids strove to outdo each other in appropriating some version of rap culture \u2013 with the superior quality of his freestyling. All this is the territory mapped by <em>The Topeka School</em>, a prequel to <em>Leaving the Atocha Station</em> and <em>10:04</em> that completes the story of Adam Gordon\u2019s coming of age by excavating his beginnings, while also offering, as Lerner puts it, \u201ca prehistory of the regression to fascist unreason in the present\u201d. The book is written, he notes, \u201cin a way that basically avoided the representation of a lot of adolescent speech, because I couldn\u2019t really show all the obscenities \u2013 racial, sexual, etc \u2013 that would exist in that environment ... It was interesting to try and write a book about weaponised speech but to have to figure out modes of indirection. In a way, that was good for the book, because it produced some innovation, but it also at certain moments felt like maybe I should have just gone for broke and written this much more disturbing version.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve always been interested in the\u00a090s, before Columbine and the advent of the Clinton dynasty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now 40 and the father of two young girls with his wife Ariana Mangual Figueroa, a professor whose own research focuses on people\u2019s use of language, he says he \u201cknew that if I was going to write something in relation to the other two books that was about the thinking that comes out of being a father \u2013 or the feeling more than the thinking \u2013 that the way to do it would be to write it in Topeka in the 90s. And I\u2019ve always been interested in the 90s, right before Columbine, and the \u2018end of history\u2019 discourse, and the advent of the Clinton dynasty.\u201d</p> <p>Lerner has partly built this novel by reconstructing \u201cContest of Words\u201d, a 2012 magazine essay about his youth in Topeka that set out some intriguing arguments about the deterioration of US political discourse and the roots of a frighteningly empty, unaccountable form of white male rage and violence. Coming out now, under Trump, the book\u2019s examination of these large public questions has inevitably attracted a lot of attention, and yet its treatment of them feels far stranger, more laceratingly personal, than you might expect \u2013 the novel\u2019s heart is a startling, rich experiment in voice, in particular that of Adam\u2019s mother Jane, who is modelled on Harriet Lerner. Jane appears in a first person that seems at times as if it must have been transcribed directly, though Lerner explains that he wrote it by inhabiting her \u2013 as with any character \u2013 except that \u201cI know her voice in a different way. And it sounds more like her.\u201d For Lerner, \u201cthe whole drama of the book is the present-tense Adam remembering his childhood from his parents\u2019 perspective, because he has more access to their voices than he does to the child version of himself.\u201d Jane describes aspects of their family life, the institutional sexism she faced in her career and the misogynist trolling (as a child Adam often picks up the landline phone and encounters men calling to whisper abuse at the famous feminist) and damaged friendships that resulted from her success.</p> <p>But before any of that, Jane begins with an account of the halting process by which she first confronted the memory of being sexually abused in childhood by her father. Lerner describes this section as \u201cthe big psychological gamble\u201d at the core of the book, and it\u2019s also the place where it becomes clearest that Lerner\u2019s interest in language that conceals rather than reveals has never been only intellectual or artistic \u2013 it\u2019s also connected to intergenerational trauma. In a crucial passage, Jane describes the moment when her speech began \u201cfragmenting under the emotional pressure, became a litany of non sequiturs, like how some of the poets you admire sound to me\u201d. (The novel\u2019s title partly plays on the New York School poets Lerner grew up admiring \u2013 John Ashbery gets a cameo here when Adam goes to hear him speak.) The novel is full of these instances where language gets away from the speaker or hearer, or different registers collapse into one another. Jane figures out a way to handle the men who whisper obscenities at her by asking them repeatedly to speak louder, forcing them to inhabit and take responsibility for their own speech (at which point, spooked, they hang up).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/09/10-04-ben-lerner-review-masterclass-in-metafiction\">10:04 by Ben Lerner review \u2013 a masterclass in metafiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This novel is the first time Lerner has explicitly approached the subject of his parents and their enormous influence on him, but throughout the trilogy the impulse towards writing fiction, and ambivalence about that impulse, is tangled up in questions of parentage. One of the funniest recurring episodes in <em>Leaving the Atocha Station</em> is the narrator\u2019s spur-of-the-moment lie (to impress a woman) that his mother is dead. Having first feigned tears, he soon bursts into real ones at the thought that his disloyal words might really kill his mother or that in the future, \u201cwhatever she suffered would be traceable in some important sense to this exact moment when I traded her life for the sympathy of an attractive stranger\u201d. This lie reappears in <em>10:04</em> in an altered, sadder form. The real parents only come into focus in the new book, but Adam\u2019s confusion about the limits and dangers of his own power has been a constant through the trilogy \u2013 and \u201call three books,\u201d Lerner says, \u201care about the risks and possibilities of ventriloquising.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a full psychiatric account,\u201d Lerner says, \u201cfor why, when I started writing fiction, it was suddenly about parents and parental mortality. Some of it is that my parents have been very influential on my thinking about systems and patterns, and that\u2019s how fiction is made, in a different way, for me. And family systems therapy is very novelistic, it\u2019s thinking about the architecture of relationships and the way that political or social circumstances \u2026 get repeated over generations.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses and adds \u201cand then part of it is deeper and more complicated\u201d, an attempt to work through his own childhood as well as the legacy of his grandparents. \u201cI do think I was working my way to writing about having certain kinds of knowledge about my parents that are difficult to have, about sexual abuse, about different kinds of transgression.\u201d The novel is a homage to his mother, yet it involves a \u201cseparation\u201d, because writing in her voice requires not seeing your mother as your mother. It requires seeing her as \u201csomebody else\u2019s child\u201d. And also as a parent who was getting by as best she could, just as Lerner himself is now. The point of autofiction, for Lerner, has never been self-revelation. He has used himself as an instrument for examining other things, while also \u201caggressively disavowing\u201d the Great American Novelist position of white universality, which he considers at best \u201cpompous\u201d and pretentious, at worst a \u201creal political danger\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11a7f950bd2787b360a28a8b022447bd11a44400\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a7f950bd2787b360a28a8b022447bd11a44400/0_0_486_510/476.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Lerner mother Harriet, author of  The Dance of Anger.\" width=\"476\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lerner\u2019s mother Harriet, author of the bestselling book <em>The Dance of Anger.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunflower Publications/Jason Dailey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet exploring some of the more intimate territory in this novel clearly affected him in a new way. He found that \u201cinhabiting [his mother\u2019s] speech also brought me closer \u2026 to the disorganising potential of the event\u201d. \u201cIt became clear to me that if I wanted to write about this pretty constitutive sense of the divide between different regimes of language in which I was raised, and different kinds of men, there was just no writing it that wasn\u2019t going through my grandfather, my mom, the legacy of that stuff \u2013 coming into knowledge of that, thinking about that as a parent. I just couldn\u2019t not write about it if I was going to write the book, but it fucked me up. It made me really crazy, sometimes.\u201d (He jokes that after this \u201cI\u2019m going right into genre fiction. I\u2019m going into a saga about teenage vampires who cover their genitalia in gum,\u201d as seven-year-old Adam does in <em>The Topeka School</em>.) In an especially powerful scene, Adam and his parents listen together to a recording of his grandfather\u2019s voice. At first expressing a kind of inchoate anger toward the grandfather that tends to repeat his domineering brand of masculinity \u2013 he keeps saying \u201cI would have destroyed him\u201d in a debate \u2013 Adam then refers back to a childhood game he had with his mother, in which he misquotes a little rhyme called \u201cThe Purple Cow\u201d and she corrects him. It\u2019s a restorative moment between mother and son. Lerner calls it \u201cthe central loving scene in the book, because it\u2019s about intergenerational transmission \u2013 like I\u2019m passing this thing on \u2013 and then the ritual of misquotation is this way of creating a new tradition that\u2019s about the malleability of what\u2019s inherited from the past.\u201d</p> <p>Pain reverberates through generations, but it\u2019s not fated to recur indefinitely. For Lerner, the Purple Cow game and Adam\u2019s \u201cventriloquising of the mother\u2019s voice are symmetrical in the book\u201d: the blending of their two voices is a version of the blurring of boundaries between parent and child that\u2019s benign. It\u2019s an experiment that establishes the possibility of other patterns of communication,\u201d and that, \u201cby exposing what would otherwise be unspoken and repressed, is a bid for not repeating it\u201d. In a way the trilogy culminates in the understanding that \u201cthere are no grownups\u201d. Adam must come to terms with his own helplessness in a hostile political environment, with not knowing what he\u2019s doing, even as he understands that he\u2019s responsible for himself and his daughters, that there is no higher authority to appeal to \u2013 certainly not the state, and not his mother either. Parts of the book, it seems, were also conceived in that strange, lively, generative place just slightly beyond the author\u2019s own control \u2013 a bold, unusual experiment to undertake at a point in his career when he is getting more attention than ever. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m proud of about this book,\u201d Lerner tells me, \u201cis just that I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, and it was hard and upsetting. That I didn\u2019t write a book where I knew what I was doing.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Topeka School is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).</em></p>",

Lerner turned to fiction only after publishing three volumes of poetry (the second, Angle of Yaw, got him shortlisted for a National book award in 2006), and his novels share a disarming, conversational tone, a taste for collage, and a playful attitude to the line between life and art \u2013 a line poets have never been called on to respect. Leaving the Atocha Station (2011) features a callow American poet lounging around Madrid on a Fulbright scholarship (as Lerner once did); 10:04 (2014) incorporates some of Lerner\u2019s art criticism and a magazine story he published, and opens with the narrator and his agent celebrating the \u201cstrong six figure\u201d advance he\u2019s received for the novel you\u2019re reading. Neither is autobiographical in any straightforward sense: 10:04 focuses on a single man\u2019s plan to get a platonic friend pregnant, while the real Lerner had been happily married for years. His creative work now seems pleasantly bifurcated: he still writes poems for experimental collaborations with visual artists and intellectuals, while collecting mainstream accolades as a novelist. He has received a Guggenheim and a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant, and has been named in the New York Times as the most talented writer of his generation. Being with him in the museum, looking at Celmins\u2019s series of mesmeric images, felt eerily like being in a Ben Lerner novel (one work by Celmins that juxtaposes a starry sky with a plummeting warplane even appears in 10:04). \u201cThe fact/fiction divide is like a therapeutic frame,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s some creative pretending about your relationships.\u201d And as we made our way through the galleries he brought up disparate things I\u2019d said in order to draw thematic connections between them, as if sketching out the start of an autobiographical novel on my behalf, or serving as a therapist. Perhaps that\u2019s unsurprising, since Lerner is the child of therapists, raised in Kansas where both his parents worked at the renowned Menninger Foundation, and where his mother, Harriet Lerner, wrote her bestselling books, beginning with The Dance of Anger. It\u2019s also where the teenage Ben first learned to talk rings around people, becoming a state and national champion in competitive debate and holding his own against the other boys at parties \u2013 where middle-class white kids strove to outdo each other in appropriating some version of rap culture \u2013 with the superior quality of his freestyling. All this is the territory mapped by The Topeka School, a prequel to Leaving the Atocha Station and 10:04 that completes the story of Adam Gordon\u2019s coming of age by excavating his beginnings, while also offering, as Lerner puts it, \u201ca prehistory of the regression to fascist unreason in the present\u201d. The book is written, he notes, \u201cin a way that basically avoided the representation of a lot of adolescent speech, because I couldn\u2019t really show all the obscenities \u2013 racial, sexual, etc \u2013 that would exist in that environment ... It was interesting to try and write a book about weaponised speech but to have to figure out modes of indirection. In a way, that was good for the book, because it produced some innovation, but it also at certain moments felt like maybe I should have just gone for broke and written this much more disturbing version.\u201d Now 40 and the father of two young girls with his wife Ariana Mangual Figueroa, a professor whose own research focuses on people\u2019s use of language, he says he \u201cknew that if I was going to write something in relation to the other two books that was about the thinking that comes out of being a father \u2013 or the feeling more than the thinking \u2013 that the way to do it would be to write it in Topeka in the 90s. And I\u2019ve always been interested in the 90s, right before Columbine, and the \u2018end of history\u2019 discourse, and the advent of the Clinton dynasty.\u201d Lerner has partly built this novel by reconstructing \u201cContest of Words\u201d, a 2012 magazine essay about his youth in Topeka that set out some intriguing arguments about the deterioration of US political discourse and the roots of a frighteningly empty, unaccountable form of white male rage and violence. Coming out now, under Trump, the book\u2019s examination of these large public questions has inevitably attracted a lot of attention, and yet its treatment of them feels far stranger, more laceratingly personal, than you might expect \u2013 the novel\u2019s heart is a startling, rich experiment in voice, in particular that of Adam\u2019s mother Jane, who is modelled on Harriet Lerner. Jane appears in a first person that seems at times as if it must have been transcribed directly, though Lerner explains that he wrote it by inhabiting her \u2013 as with any character \u2013 except that \u201cI know her voice in a different way. And it sounds more like her.\u201d For Lerner, \u201cthe whole drama of the book is the present-tense Adam remembering his childhood from his parents\u2019 perspective, because he has more access to their voices than he does to the child version of himself.\u201d Jane describes aspects of their family life, the institutional sexism she faced in her career and the misogynist trolling (as a child Adam often picks up the landline phone and encounters men calling to whisper abuse at the famous feminist) and damaged friendships that resulted from her success. But before any of that, Jane begins with an account of the halting process by which she first confronted the memory of being sexually abused in childhood by her father. Lerner describes this section as \u201cthe big psychological gamble\u201d at the core of the book, and it\u2019s also the place where it becomes clearest that Lerner\u2019s interest in language that conceals rather than reveals has never been only intellectual or artistic \u2013 it\u2019s also connected to intergenerational trauma. In a crucial passage, Jane describes the moment when her speech began \u201cfragmenting under the emotional pressure, became a litany of non sequiturs, like how some of the poets you admire sound to me\u201d. (The novel\u2019s title partly plays on the New York School poets Lerner grew up admiring \u2013 John Ashbery gets a cameo here when Adam goes to hear him speak.) The novel is full of these instances where language gets away from the speaker or hearer, or different registers collapse into one another. Jane figures out a way to handle the men who whisper obscenities at her by asking them repeatedly to speak louder, forcing them to inhabit and take responsibility for their own speech (at which point, spooked, they hang up). This novel is the first time Lerner has explicitly approached the subject of his parents and their enormous influence on him, but throughout the trilogy the impulse towards writing fiction, and ambivalence about that impulse, is tangled up in questions of parentage. One of the funniest recurring episodes in Leaving the Atocha Station is the narrator\u2019s spur-of-the-moment lie (to impress a woman) that his mother is dead. Having first feigned tears, he soon bursts into real ones at the thought that his disloyal words might really kill his mother or that in the future, \u201cwhatever she suffered would be traceable in some important sense to this exact moment when I traded her life for the sympathy of an attractive stranger\u201d. This lie reappears in 10:04 in an altered, sadder form. The real parents only come into focus in the new book, but Adam\u2019s confusion about the limits and dangers of his own power has been a constant through the trilogy \u2013 and \u201call three books,\u201d Lerner says, \u201care about the risks and possibilities of ventriloquising.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a full psychiatric account,\u201d Lerner says, \u201cfor why, when I started writing fiction, it was suddenly about parents and parental mortality. Some of it is that my parents have been very influential on my thinking about systems and patterns, and that\u2019s how fiction is made, in a different way, for me. And family systems therapy is very novelistic, it\u2019s thinking about the architecture of relationships and the way that political or social circumstances \u2026 get repeated over generations.\u201d He pauses and adds \u201cand then part of it is deeper and more complicated\u201d, an attempt to work through his own childhood as well as the legacy of his grandparents. \u201cI do think I was working my way to writing about having certain kinds of knowledge about my parents that are difficult to have, about sexual abuse, about different kinds of transgression.\u201d The novel is a homage to his mother, yet it involves a \u201cseparation\u201d, because writing in her voice requires not seeing your mother as your mother. It requires seeing her as \u201csomebody else\u2019s child\u201d. And also as a parent who was getting by as best she could, just as Lerner himself is now. The point of autofiction, for Lerner, has never been self-revelation. He has used himself as an instrument for examining other things, while also \u201caggressively disavowing\u201d the Great American Novelist position of white universality, which he considers at best \u201cpompous\u201d and pretentious, at worst a \u201creal political danger\u201d. Yet exploring some of the more intimate territory in this novel clearly affected him in a new way. He found that \u201cinhabiting [his mother\u2019s] speech also brought me closer \u2026 to the disorganising potential of the event\u201d. \u201cIt became clear to me that if I wanted to write about this pretty constitutive sense of the divide between different regimes of language in which I was raised, and different kinds of men, there was just no writing it that wasn\u2019t going through my grandfather, my mom, the legacy of that stuff \u2013 coming into knowledge of that, thinking about that as a parent. I just couldn\u2019t not write about it if I was going to write the book, but it fucked me up. It made me really crazy, sometimes.\u201d (He jokes that after this \u201cI\u2019m going right into genre fiction. I\u2019m going into a saga about teenage vampires who cover their genitalia in gum,\u201d as seven-year-old Adam does in The Topeka School.) In an especially powerful scene, Adam and his parents listen together to a recording of his grandfather\u2019s voice. At first expressing a kind of inchoate anger toward the grandfather that tends to repeat his domineering brand of masculinity \u2013 he keeps saying \u201cI would have destroyed him\u201d in a debate \u2013 Adam then refers back to a childhood game he had with his mother, in which he misquotes a little rhyme called \u201cThe Purple Cow\u201d and she corrects him. It\u2019s a restorative moment between mother and son. Lerner calls it \u201cthe central loving scene in the book, because it\u2019s about intergenerational transmission \u2013 like I\u2019m passing this thing on \u2013 and then the ritual of misquotation is this way of creating a new tradition that\u2019s about the malleability of what\u2019s inherited from the past.\u201d Pain reverberates through generations, but it\u2019s not fated to recur indefinitely. For Lerner, the Purple Cow game and Adam\u2019s \u201cventriloquising of the mother\u2019s voice are symmetrical in the book\u201d: the blending of their two voices is a version of the blurring of boundaries between parent and child that\u2019s benign. It\u2019s an experiment that establishes the possibility of other patterns of communication,\u201d and that, \u201cby exposing what would otherwise be unspoken and repressed, is a bid for not repeating it\u201d. In a way the trilogy culminates in the understanding that \u201cthere are no grownups\u201d. Adam must come to terms with his own helplessness in a hostile political environment, with not knowing what he\u2019s doing, even as he understands that he\u2019s responsible for himself and his daughters, that there is no higher authority to appeal to \u2013 certainly not the state, and not his mother either. Parts of the book, it seems, were also conceived in that strange, lively, generative place just slightly beyond the author\u2019s own control \u2013 a bold, unusual experiment to undertake at a point in his career when he is getting more attention than ever. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m proud of about this book,\u201d Lerner tells me, \u201cis just that I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, and it was hard and upsetting. That I didn\u2019t write a book where I knew what I was doing.\u201d \u2022 The Topeka School is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).",

When asked about the President\u2019s push to build a wall along the southern border of the United States, White <a href=\"https://podbay.fm/podcast/1124228879/e/1474959660\">told UFC Unfiltered</a> that \u201cwhat [Trump is] really saying is all these people coming from different countries need to do it the old school way. You register and you get your paperwork done. He is talking about people that are sneaking into the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>White has also shown support for Trump\u2019s sports-related concerns. Following Trump\u2019s onslaught against former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for his decision to kneel in protest during the national anthem, White told Fox Business that the controversy was a \u201cbig deal\u201d to him and that he believes in \u201cstanding for the national anthem.\u201d</p> \n<p>Though the UFC does not play the national anthem ahead of its events, it has found other ways to use its platform for political purposes. In 2018, White visited the White House with then interim welterweight champion Colby Covington, a fighter who markets himself as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/05/colby-covington-ufc-eric-trump-donald-trump-jr-mma\">conservative mouthpiece</a>, and posed for pictures with the Trump. Later that same year, the UFC released a documentary titled <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiT1rqYw-PeAhWHKnwKHSy1ApIQwqsBMAB6BAgBEAQ&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x78_igEJBkk&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Zcy1oKNBt5AbzLB8Lyc4C\">Combatant in Chief</a> that looked at the promotion\u2019s peculiar relationship with the President. The documentary, which made the dubious claim that Trump played a \u201cpivotal role in legitimizing the UFC,\u201d was a clear example of promotional propaganda and a case study in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/15/sportswashing-europes-biggest-clubs-champions-league-owners-sponsors-uefa\">political sportswashing</a>.</p> \n<p>While many of those in attendance at UFC 244 on Saturday were vocal about their distaste for the President, it does not change the fact that the UFC is an ideal platform for Trump and his political ideology. The UFC has proven its willingness to be used as a tool for the White House\u2019s displays of sports-related soft power. As long as Trump has supporters within the UFC \u2013 a sports organization without a union or association that collectively bargains and represents its athletes \u2013 the President will continue to benefit from his relationship with cagefighting.</p>",

When asked about the President\u2019s push to build a wall along the southern border of the United States, White told UFC Unfiltered that \u201cwhat [Trump is] really saying is all these people coming from different countries need to do it the old school way. You register and you get your paperwork done. He is talking about people that are sneaking into the country.\u201d White has also shown support for Trump\u2019s sports-related concerns. Following Trump\u2019s onslaught against former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for his decision to kneel in protest during the national anthem, White told Fox Business that the controversy was a \u201cbig deal\u201d to him and that he believes in \u201cstanding for the national anthem.\u201d Though the UFC does not play the national anthem ahead of its events, it has found other ways to use its platform for political purposes. In 2018, White visited the White House with then interim welterweight champion Colby Covington, a fighter who markets himself as a conservative mouthpiece, and posed for pictures with the Trump. Later that same year, the UFC released a documentary titled Combatant in Chief that looked at the promotion\u2019s peculiar relationship with the President. The documentary, which made the dubious claim that Trump played a \u201cpivotal role in legitimizing the UFC,\u201d was a clear example of promotional propaganda and a case study in political sportswashing. While many of those in attendance at UFC 244 on Saturday were vocal about their distaste for the President, it does not change the fact that the UFC is an ideal platform for Trump and his political ideology. The UFC has proven its willingness to be used as a tool for the White House\u2019s displays of sports-related soft power. As long as Trump has supporters within the UFC \u2013 a sports organization without a union or association that collectively bargains and represents its athletes \u2013 the President will continue to benefit from his relationship with cagefighting.",

It was a nice line from a manager who tends to prefer that his players\u2019 performances do the talking. While his side were nowhere near flawless on Saturday they were certainly impressive: there is no doubt Wolves are one of the best-coached teams in the Premier League and they look back to their old selves now after an uncertain, Europa League-addled start to the campaign. They have not lost in the top flight since mid-September and a four-point haul from their visits to the Etihad and the Emirates suggests they will lift themselves into contention for this season\u2019s European spots. Wolves do not offer a thrill a minute but few sides have their technical and tactical clarity; they dominated for sizeable periods and, even without the injured defender Willy Boly, are a formidable prospect once again. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal 1-1 Wolves</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/nov/03/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend\u2019s best Premier League photos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) VAR providing more questions than answers</h2> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s win over Aston Villa on Saturday was achieved despite more VAR-related controversy. Afterwards Dean Smith said he was pleased that he and the other 19 Premier League managers will meet authorities this week to discuss changes to VAR. \u201cThey are talking to the right people,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI was at a meeting last Thursday and every manager is going to another meeting this Thursday. Then the CEOs and the Premier League will get together and decide where they\u2019re taking it. You can\u2019t scrap it now, there are 28 countries using it. We all wanted it to find the right decisions but there was always going to be teething problems. We need to find a happy medium. I feel they\u2019re taking a little bit of authority away from the referee.

Could Steve Cook be the 14th? Lewis Dunk, a friend of the 28-year-old\u2019s from his time at Brighton, from whom he signed for \u00a3170,000 seven years ago, and Tyrone Mings, who played second fiddle to Cook at Bournemouth, have both been given chances by Southgate and the form of the Bournemouth captain, who shone on his 150th Premier League appearance on Saturday, is not likely to have gone unnoticed. \u201cGareth leaves no stone unturned, so all he has to do is to continue to perform at his consistent best for us,\u201d said the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe. \u201cDisplays like that [against Manchester United on Saturday], where he was, for me, pretty faultless throughout are certainly going to do his cause no harm.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/bournemouth-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Bournemouth 1-0 Manchester United</a></em></p> \n<h2>4) Brighton head to Old Trafford with nothing to fear</h2> \n<p>Graham Potter\u2019s Brighton moved into the top half of the table with Saturday\u2019s 2-0 victory over Norwich City. Although it might seem natural to think of the 3-0 home win against Tottenham a month ago as a turning point in their season, the feeling among fans is the fortunate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/26/brighton-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-2 victory against Everton</a> last week was more of a watershed moment. Saturday\u2019s Leandro Trossard-inspired victory over Norwich sent Brighton up to eighth, two places above Manchester United, to whom they travel on Sunday. The days when clubs of Brighton\u2019s stature visited Old Trafford aiming merely for damage limitation are long gone. With their summer recruit Trossard fit, Brighton will face Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s misfiring United believing they can register a third straight win in the Premier League. <strong>Luke McLaughlin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/brighton-hove-albion-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Brighton 2-0 Norwich</a></em></p> \n<h2>5) Less is more for deadly Vardy</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Brendan Rodgers has admitted Jamie Vardy\u2019s renaissance at Leicester is down to a \u201cmore synchronised\u201d approach to defending from the front. The former England striker scored his 10th Premier League goal of the season against Crystal Palace on Sunday to move one ahead of Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Tammy Abraham in the race for the Golden Boot, and is scoring at a rate that would see him surpass the 24 he racked up in Leicester\u2019s title-winning season. \u201cHe\u2019s not having to press the whole back four,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cJamie is a guy who would run all day for you, so now he is doing shorter bursts, which he is very good at. He\u2019s also playing more central and staying on the last man because he is such a threat. He is a really top striker for this level and he is really enjoying his football.\u201d Leicester are six points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who they host on Saturday. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/03/crystal-palace-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace 0-2 Leicester</a></em></p> \n<h2>6) A difference of opinion at Stockley Park?</h2> \n<p>It is not exactly an exclusive to report that VAR decisions are taking too long. The 12 minutes of added time that allowed Everton to claim an equaliser were not all down to Andr\u00e9 Gomes\u2019s horrific injury: there was a ridiculous three-minute delay to come to a conclusion about the ball hitting Dele Alli on the arm in the home penalty area. The ball did hit Alli on the arm, the arm was over the player\u2019s head, so why no penalty? Taking three minutes then deciding nothing was amiss strongly suggests the Stockley Park officials had differing opinions. VAR is good at seeing everything but we are still no further down the road to consistency, and three minutes is simply too long for players to stand around scratching their heads, especially if it happens two or three times a game. We keep being told the process will get slicker and speedier. But opinions and arguments, it appears, are not to be rushed. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/03/everton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Everton 1-1 Tottenham</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5817e2b7-1de0-43e7-a671-74ec3e04b90d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dERmND8HIhs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>7) Guardiola plays it cool ahead of Anfield showdown</h2> \n<p>Despite the six-point gap Pep Guardiola is adamant Manchester City do not have to beat Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. \u201cWe are going to try but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said the manager, who joked about their rivals\u2019 formidable home record. \u201cHow many centuries have they not lost at Anfield? We will see. Now we go to Italy [to play Atalanta] and when we come back we go to Anfield. We know what happened on Saturday beyond the result \u2013 they beat Aston Villa in the last minutes \u2013 and there are a lot of games left to play. Many things are going to happen.\u201d Last season\u2019s corresponding fixture was a 0-0 draw, while City\u2019s 2-1 win at the Etihad in January\u2019s reverse match proved vital to the defence of their title. Privately, Guardiola surely knows victory on Sunday, however difficult, could be pivotal in turning the title race back in City\u2019s favour though he may be without David Silva, as he is a doubt owing to a muscular problem. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/manchester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City 2-1 Southampton</a></em></p> \n<h2>8) Egan the unsung hero of Blades backline</h2> \n<p>Sheffield United may have exciting overlapping centre-halves but they also possess the Premier League\u2019s joint-best defence. This was their fifth clean sheet of the season and significant credit must go to John Egan, who once again excelled at the heart of that central trio. Egan was once a promising youngster at Sunderland but an awful leg injury sustained on loan at Bradford required complicated surgery and there were fears his career might be over before it had properly begun. Instead, he battled back at Gillingham and then Brentford before Chris Wilder made him his defensive cornerstone. John Lundstram, Enda Stevens and Lys Mousset rightly commanded headlines as Burnley were shredded but the outstanding Egan was a very big reason why Sean Dyche\u2019s side barely got sight of goal. Small wonder Blades fans fretted when the player who makes United\u2019s unique system work limped off late on. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/sheffield-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sheffield United 3-0 Burnley</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/03/everton-tottenham-var-supply-highlights\">Out-of-form Everton and Tottenham leave it to VAR to supply highlights | Paul Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>9) Lampard\u2019s patience with Pulisic looking a masterstroke</h2> \n<p>Has the real Christian Pulisic arrived? The winger started slowly at Chelsea after his \u00a358m move from Borussia Dortmund but Frank Lampard\u2019s decision to hold him back looks inspired. Pulisic is demonstrating why his fee was so high. Having shielded the 21-year-old when he was out of the side during September, Lampard has unleashed him in recent weeks and has watched him make a stunning impact. Pulisic came on to make important contributions in last month\u2019s wins over Ajax and Newcastle and he looks determined not to lose his place in the starting line-up, following up last week\u2019s hat-trick against Burnley with another excellent display at Vicarage Road. Pulisic scored the decisive goal against Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s side and only inspired goalkeeping from Ben Foster stopped him going home with the match ball again. Now he needs to maintain his form when Ajax visit Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/watford-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Watford 1-2 Chelsea</a></em></p> \n<h2>10) West Ham\u2019s stand-in is falling short</h2> \n<p>\u201cWe need to find a reason why it happened\u201d, said Manuel Pellegrini of West Ham\u2019s defeat by Newcastle. And their losses to Everton, and Crystal Palace, and Oxford United. Pellegrini believes his team\u2019s loss of form can be traced back to their shock Carabao Cup defeat to the League One side but it seems he is no nearer to fixing the problem. There was a general listlessness on Saturday and a naivety in pushing high up against Newcastle\u2019s explosive counterattack. But one other factor Pellegrini might be considering is his goalkeeper. Roberto made his second appearance for the club against Oxford and has been in goal ever since following the long-term injury to Lukasz Fabianksi. The 33-year-old did not inspire confidence against Newcastle; caught in no-man\u2019s land at a set piece for the second goal, he was too soft against Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s free-kick for the third. Fabianski isn\u2019t expected back until the new year now \u2013 he looks a better player with every match he misses. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a

Luke McLaughlin \u2022 Match report: Brighton 2-0 Norwich 5) Less is more for deadly Vardy Brendan Rodgers has admitted Jamie Vardy\u2019s renaissance at Leicester is down to a \u201cmore synchronised\u201d approach to defending from the front. The former England striker scored his 10th Premier League goal of the season against Crystal Palace on Sunday to move one ahead of Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Tammy Abraham in the race for the Golden Boot, and is scoring at a rate that would see him surpass the 24 he racked up in Leicester\u2019s title-winning season. \u201cHe\u2019s not having to press the whole back four,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cJamie is a guy who would run all day for you, so now he is doing shorter bursts, which he is very good at. He\u2019s also playing more central and staying on the last man because he is such a threat. He is a really top striker for this level and he is really enjoying his football.\u201d Leicester are six points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who they host on Saturday. Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 0-2 Leicester 6) A difference of opinion at Stockley Park? It is not exactly an exclusive to report that VAR decisions are taking too long. The 12 minutes of added time that allowed Everton to claim an equaliser were not all down to Andr\u00e9 Gomes\u2019s horrific injury: there was a ridiculous three-minute delay to come to a conclusion about the ball hitting Dele Alli on the arm in the home penalty area. The ball did hit Alli on the arm, the arm was over the player\u2019s head, so why no penalty? Taking three minutes then deciding nothing was amiss strongly suggests the Stockley Park officials had differing opinions. VAR is good at seeing everything but we are still no further down the road to consistency, and three minutes is simply too long for players to stand around scratching their heads, especially if it happens two or three times a game. We keep being told the process will get slicker and speedier. But opinions and arguments, it appears, are not to be rushed. Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Everton 1-1 Tottenham 7) Guardiola plays it cool ahead of Anfield showdown Despite the six-point gap Pep Guardiola is adamant Manchester City do not have to beat Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. \u201cWe are going to try but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said the manager, who joked about their rivals\u2019 formidable home record. \u201cHow many centuries have they not lost at Anfield? We will see. Now we go to Italy [to play Atalanta] and when we come back we go to Anfield. We know what happened on Saturday beyond the result \u2013 they beat Aston Villa in the last minutes \u2013 and there are a lot of games left to play. Many things are going to happen.\u201d Last season\u2019s corresponding fixture was a 0-0 draw, while City\u2019s 2-1 win at the Etihad in January\u2019s reverse match proved vital to the defence of their title. Privately, Guardiola surely knows victory on Sunday, however difficult, could be pivotal in turning the title race back in City\u2019s favour though he may be without David Silva, as he is a doubt owing to a muscular problem. Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 2-1 Southampton 8) Egan the unsung hero of Blades backline Sheffield United may have exciting overlapping centre-halves but they also possess the Premier League\u2019s joint-best defence. This was their fifth clean sheet of the season and significant credit must go to John Egan, who once again excelled at the heart of that central trio. Egan was once a promising youngster at Sunderland but an awful leg injury sustained on loan at Bradford required complicated surgery and there were fears his career might be over before it had properly begun. Instead, he battled back at Gillingham and then Brentford before Chris Wilder made him his defensive cornerstone. John Lundstram, Enda Stevens and Lys Mousset rightly commanded headlines as Burnley were shredded but the outstanding Egan was a very big reason why Sean Dyche\u2019s side barely got sight of goal. Small wonder Blades fans fretted when the player who makes United\u2019s unique system work limped off late on. Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 3-0 Burnley 9) Lampard\u2019s patience with Pulisic looking a masterstroke Has the real Christian Pulisic arrived? The winger started slowly at Chelsea after his \u00a358m move from Borussia Dortmund but Frank Lampard\u2019s decision to hold him back looks inspired. Pulisic is demonstrating why his fee was so high. Having shielded the 21-year-old when he was out of the side during September, Lampard has unleashed him in recent weeks and has watched him make a stunning impact. Pulisic came on to make important contributions in last month\u2019s wins over Ajax and Newcastle and he looks determined not to lose his place in the starting line-up, following up last week\u2019s hat-trick against Burnley with another excellent display at Vicarage Road. Pulisic scored the decisive goal against Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s side and only inspired goalkeeping from Ben Foster stopped him going home with the match ball again. Now he needs to maintain his form when Ajax visit Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Watford 1-2 Chelsea 10) West Ham\u2019s stand-in is falling short \u201cWe need to find a reason why it happened\u201d, said Manuel Pellegrini of West Ham\u2019s defeat by Newcastle. And their losses to Everton, and Crystal Palace, and Oxford United. Pellegrini believes his team\u2019s loss of form can be traced back to their shock Carabao Cup defeat to the League One side but it seems he is no nearer to fixing the problem. There was a general listlessness on Saturday and a naivety in pushing high up against Newcastle\u2019s explosive counterattack. But one other factor Pellegrini might be considering is his goalkeeper. Roberto made his second appearance for the club against Oxford and has been in goal ever since following the long-term injury to Lukasz Fabianksi. The 33-year-old did not inspire confidence against Newcastle; caught in no-man\u2019s land at a set piece for the second goal, he was too soft against Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s free-kick for the third. Fabianski isn\u2019t expected back until the new year now \u2013 he looks a better player with every match he misses. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: West Ham 2-3 Newcastle",

Local authorities have not revealed the identities of those arrested in the central province of Nghe An, but they are suspected of being part of a ring responsible for smuggling Vietnamese people to Britain. The arrests follow the Vietnamese government\u2019s strong condemnation of human trafficking. It described the deaths \u2013 of people now all believed to be Vietnamese \u2013 as a \u201cserious humanitarian tragedy\u201d. \u201cBased on what we learn from the suspects, we will actively launch investigations to fight and eradicate these rings which bring people illegally to Britain,\u201d said Nguyen Huu Cau, the Nghe An province police chief. \u201cThe best thing to do now is to deal with the consequences of the incident and help family members receive the bodies.\u201d He reportedly added that police were treating the case as a smuggling incident, rather than a case of human trafficking. The Vietnamese prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, ordered an investigation into human trafficking on 26 October, and since then local police have arrested a total of 10 suspects believed to be linked to the lorry deaths. Police in the northern province of Ha Tinh launched an investigation after families reported losing contact with relatives who were known to be en route to England, about 6,000 miles away. Authorities are collecting DNA samples from the families to send to the UK for cross-verification. Many of the victims are also thought to be from the neighbouring Nghe An province, where poor employment prospects and environmental concerns are among the issues leading largely young Vietnamese to travel to Europe. The province is one of the poorest in Vietnam and a hotspot for human trafficking, according to the NGO Blue Dragon Children\u2019s Foundation, an organisation that rescues trafficked people from China. Hundreds of Vietnamese people are trafficked to the UK each year according to the UK-based charity Ecpat. Often, they are forced into slavery in nail bars or cannabis farms. A delegation of Vietnamese diplomats and police are expected to meet their British counterparts on Monday, after the country\u2019s ambassador met Essex police last week. Over the weekend, London\u2019s Vietnamese community gathered to honour the unidentified victims. The Rev Simon Nguyen offered prayers for the victims and for their loved ones in Vietnam. \u201cWe show our condolences and sympathies for the people who have lost their lives on the way to seeking freedom, dignity and happiness,\u201d he said, going on to pray for those who had lost their sons and daughters in the tragedy.

      "body": "<p>From the politicians who reluctantly voted for it, to the millions who must now make a choice and cast their vote, everybody surely knows it: this is a very, very weird election. I mean that not just in terms of the borderline absurd timing, nor the sense that it will not resolve the fundamentals of Brexit, but much deeper tensions and contradictions.</p> <p>Large chunks of the public seem weary, and ill-disposed to both main parties; to ask a lot of people who they might vote for is to invite long sighs and eye-rolls, and suggestions that the whole thing is ridiculous. It has always been the case that when politicians, party activists and the media dissolve in excitement and passion, most people tend to keep their distance. But now the gap is so big, and political outcomes seemingly so random, that there is a resulting sense of big events happening almost by accident.</p> <p>The fact that the media carries on with rituals unchanged in 50 years \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7626753/The-10-crunch-battleground-seats-decide-2019-December-general-election.html\" title=\"\">identify the target seats!</a> <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/shelagh-fogarty/professor-john-curtice-makes-surprising-prediction/\" title=\"\">Bring on the psephologists! </a>Do 10-second vox pops! \u2013 only compounds the oddness. The best example of the absurdity of what passes for the national conversation is the attention still paid to opinion polling: on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/general-election-poll-double-trouble-for-boris-johnson-after-bounce-in-corbyn-support-and-remain-electoral-pact-0nbttwvwd\" title=\"\">reports suggested the Tories were variously leading Labour by eight, 16 and 12 percentage points</a>. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage was on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show again. At the same time, the stakes could not be higher: one way or another, it\u2019s clear that this contest will mark a historic tipping point not just for politics, but the future of the country.</p> <p>What is it all actually about? As in 2017, there are at least three elections going on at once: the contest about Brexit \u2013 and the ludicrous idea that we will soon \u201cget it done\u201d \u2013 conceived by the Tories and pounced on by the Liberal Democrats; Labour\u2019s great debate about austerity and inequality \u2013 and the mixture of both, woven through with the question of independence, defining the battle in Scotland, and centred on the Scottish National party.</p> <p>The extent to which the public buys into these narratives is open to question: three years of anticlimactic pantomime over Brexit have only increased people\u2019s distance from politics, and 40-odd years of dealignment and waning loyalties apparently mean that <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nearly-half-of-voters-will-switch-parties-at-next-general-election-rs7ffsf9z\" title=\"\">nearly half of us might switch to a different party from the one we backed in 2017</a>. Thanks to our creaking electoral system, support for the newly energised Lib Dems, the Brexit party and the Greens could have no end of unforeseen consequences, or very few at all. All that is certain is that those staunchly partisan voices that echo around social media are in a small, somewhat freakish minority: far more people are politically on the move, almost constantly.</p> <p>Thanks to the means we now use to communicate, what is going on is probably more complicated still. Thousands \u2013 millions? \u2013 of personalised micro-campaigns are already unfolding on people\u2019s social media feeds, defined by many forces and voices way beyond the party machines and the traditional media, and often beyond anyone\u2019s control.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the digital age, capitalism has constructed ways of blindsiding its opponents and distracting the public at large</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two years ago, a big part of Theresa May\u2019s undoing was the way that an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-48549130\" title=\"\">avalanche of mocking memes</a> quickly rendered her a laughing stock; similar things will happen this time, but it is not yet clear who they will affect, and how. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/31/twitter-use-facebook-scale-against-it-ban-political-advertising\" title=\"\">Twitter may have suddenly banned political advertising</a>, but that probably means there is all the more reason for plenty of actors to use the subterfuge of bots, fake accounts, and all the rest. We know that CTF Partners, the lobbying firm run by Boris Johnson\u2019s confidant Lynton Crosby, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/grassroots-facebook-brexit-ads-secretly-run-by-staff-of-lynton-crosby-firm\" title=\"\">was recently caught overseeing pro-Brexit Facebook ads purporting to be the work of grassroots activists</a>.

It\u2019s clear that the Tories are prepared to use falsehoods in their online campaigning: in September, they put ads on Facebook presenting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/13/tories-misrepresent-critical-bbc-news-article-in-facebook-ad\" title=\"\">BBC report about \u00a314bn of schools funding</a> as if it was a fact, when the report in question actually criticised the figure\u2019s credibility. The fines levied on the official leave campaign for funding breaches related to online activity and sending thousands of people unsolicited text messages shine unflattering light on the presence of many of its former high-ups \u2013 including, obviously, the prime minister \u2013 at the heart of government (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50276673\" title=\"\">we now know that a file relating to the former transgression was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service last month</a>). And before anyone on the left starts feeling too smug, let us at least acknowledge that there are those who make the case for Labour online \u2013 some closely connected to the party machine \u2013 who have a somewhat loose relationship with fact, and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42430083\" title=\"\">tendency to pursue their objectives using nastiness and misinformation</a>.</p> <p>Bluntly put, it is not the 20th century any more, and that is not just about online dirty tricks, but people\u2019s very understanding of what an election means. The occasions when an election could thrash out national differences, decide a victor and then accord them the stability and space to implement their programme belong to another age, along with Thatcher, Churchill, Attlee and the rest. The accelerated, saturated culture we now live in fosters so much irreverence and cynicism that the very idea of people and parties claiming they have all-encompassing solutions to the country\u2019s problems can easily look absurd, something Boris Johnson \u2013 like Donald Trump \u2013 seems to consciously trade on, pushing politics towards the absurd as a matter of conscious strategy.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say that seriously radical intentions such as those of the reinvented Labour party are illegitimate, nor that all kind of unfairnesses and inequalities are in dire need of those kind of answers. But in the digital age, capitalism has constructed ways of blindsiding its opponents and distracting the public at large way beyond the old opiates of the masses, and it is an onerous task to even begin to shift them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/02/general-election-key-contests-changing-tactics-fractured-nation\">Key contests and changing tactics in Britain\u2019s general election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clearly, the internet has political benefits that suit progressive people and parties, from the ease of crowdfunding, through the way that activists can quickly form networks, to information channels that can bypass the orthodox \u2013 and often rightwing \u2013 media. But at the current stage of the online world\u2019s evolution, these things seem to be constantly overshadowed by the way that the cacophony hosted by the big platforms scrambles meanings, promotes the worst kind of discourse, and sows confusion. This is less about messages than the medium: once politics moves online, it tends to operate in a context of disbelief, cynicism and the kind of endless tribal warfare that rarely achieves any resolution. No one really wins.</p> <p>In the 21st century\u2019s political culture, few stories develop any traction, and scandal and lies almost seem to be priced in to people\u2019s expectations. As Trump and Johnson prove, politics may now be more about camp, performance and the imperative to crash around the right online platforms than the idea of actually achieving anything. And nothing is ever concluded. What transpires on Friday 13 December will have a big influence on the future. But the day after, the usual noise and confusion will resume, as our politics continues to evolve in ways we are only just beginning to understand.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "From the politicians who reluctantly voted for it, to the millions who must now make a choice and cast their vote, everybody surely knows it: this is a very, very weird election. I mean that not just in terms of the borderline absurd timing, nor the sense that it will not resolve the fundamentals of Brexit, but much deeper tensions and contradictions. Large chunks of the public seem weary, and ill-disposed to both main parties; to ask a lot of people who they might vote for is to invite long sighs and eye-rolls, and suggestions that the whole thing is ridiculous. It has always been the case that when politicians, party activists and the media dissolve in excitement and passion, most people tend to keep their distance. But now the gap is so big, and political outcomes seemingly so random, that there is a resulting sense of big events happening almost by accident. The fact that the media carries on with rituals unchanged in 50 years \u2013 identify the target seats! Bring on the psephologists! Do 10-second vox pops! \u2013 only compounds the oddness. The best example of the absurdity of what passes for the national conversation is the attention still paid to opinion polling: on Sunday, reports suggested the Tories were variously leading Labour by eight, 16 and 12 percentage points. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage was on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show again. At the same time, the stakes could not be higher: one way or another, it\u2019s clear that this contest will mark a historic tipping point not just for politics, but the future of the country. What is it all actually about? As in 2017, there are at least three elections going on at once: the contest about Brexit \u2013 and the ludicrous idea that we will soon \u201cget it done\u201d \u2013 conceived by the Tories and pounced on by the Liberal Democrats; Labour\u2019s great debate about austerity and inequality \u2013 and the mixture of both, woven through with the question of independence, defining the battle in Scotland, and centred on the Scottish National party. The extent to which the public buys into these narratives is open to question: three years of anticlimactic pantomime over Brexit have only increased people\u2019s distance from politics, and 40-odd years of dealignment and waning loyalties apparently mean that nearly half of us might switch to a different party from the one we backed in 2017. Thanks to our creaking electoral system, support for the newly energised Lib Dems, the Brexit party and the Greens could have no end of unforeseen consequences, or very few at all. All that is certain is that those staunchly partisan voices that echo around social media are in a small, somewhat freakish minority: far more people are politically on the move, almost constantly. Thanks to the means we now use to communicate, what is going on is probably more complicated still. Thousands \u2013 millions? \u2013 of personalised micro-campaigns are already unfolding on people\u2019s social media feeds, defined by many forces and voices way beyond the party machines and the traditional media, and often beyond anyone\u2019s control. Two years ago, a big part of Theresa May\u2019s undoing was the way that an avalanche of mocking memes quickly rendered her a laughing stock; similar things will happen this time, but it is not yet clear who they will affect, and how. Twitter may have suddenly banned political advertising, but that probably means there is all the more reason for plenty of actors to use the subterfuge of bots, fake accounts, and all the rest. We know that CTF Partners, the lobbying firm run by Boris Johnson\u2019s confidant Lynton Crosby, was recently caught overseeing pro-Brexit Facebook ads purporting to be the work of grassroots activists. We know too that the Conservative party has hired people closely connected to CTF, well versed in the most slippery online campaigning techniques. This weekend brought the unsurprising news that Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing lies in political adverts will apply to the UK, which will obviously suit plenty of people just fine. It\u2019s clear that the Tories are prepared to use falsehoods in their online campaigning: in September, they put ads on Facebook presenting a BBC report about \u00a314bn of schools funding as if it was a fact, when the report in question actually criticised the figure\u2019s credibility. The fines levied on the official leave campaign for funding breaches related to online activity and sending thousands of people unsolicited text messages shine unflattering light on the presence of many of its former high-ups \u2013 including, obviously, the prime minister \u2013 at the heart of government (we now know that a file relating to the former transgression was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service last month). And before anyone on the left starts feeling too smug, let us at least acknowledge that there are those who make the case for Labour online \u2013 some closely connected to the party machine \u2013 who have a somewhat loose relationship with fact, and a tendency to pursue their objectives using nastiness and misinformation. Bluntly put, it is not the 20th century any more, and that is not just about online dirty tricks, but people\u2019s very understanding of what an election means. The occasions when an election could thrash out national differences, decide a victor and then accord them the stability and space to implement their programme belong to another age, along with Thatcher, Churchill, Attlee and the rest. The accelerated, saturated culture we now live in fosters so much irreverence and cynicism that the very idea of people and parties claiming they have all-encompassing solutions to the country\u2019s problems can easily look absurd, something Boris Johnson \u2013 like Donald Trump \u2013 seems to consciously trade on, pushing politics towards the absurd as a matter of conscious strategy. This isn\u2019t to say that seriously radical intentions such as those of the reinvented Labour party are illegitimate, nor that all kind of unfairnesses and inequalities are in dire need of those kind of answers. But in the digital age, capitalism has constructed ways of blindsiding its opponents and distracting the public at large way beyond the old opiates of the masses, and it is an onerous task to even begin to shift them. Clearly, the internet has political benefits that suit progressive people and parties, from the ease of crowdfunding, through the way that activists can quickly form networks, to information channels that can bypass the orthodox \u2013 and often rightwing \u2013 media. But at the current stage of the online world\u2019s evolution, these things seem to be constantly overshadowed by the way that the cacophony hosted by the big platforms scrambles meanings, promotes the worst kind of discourse, and sows confusion. This is less about messages than the medium: once politics moves online, it tends to operate in a context of disbelief, cynicism and the kind of endless tribal warfare that rarely achieves any resolution. No one really wins. In the 21st century\u2019s political culture, few stories develop any traction, and scandal and lies almost seem to be priced in to people\u2019s expectations. As Trump and Johnson prove, politics may now be more about camp, performance and the imperative to crash around the right online platforms than the idea of actually achieving anything. And nothing is ever concluded. What transpires on Friday 13 December will have a big influence on the future. But the day after, the usual noise and confusion will resume, as our politics continues to evolve in ways we are only just beginning to understand. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1) New Zealand v South Africa</strong></h2> <p>It looked like advantage to the holders after they effectively decided the pool pecking order on the opening weekend, but it prompted South Africa\u2019s head coach, Rassie Erasmus, to make a significant change. The Springboks conceded only four tries in the tournament, two against the All Blacks. Erasmus used a conventional split of five forwards and three backs on the bench on that evening, but he changed it to six-two for the pool match against Italy and the three knockout games, giving him an alternative tight five to maintain physical power and mental sharpness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/rugby-world-cup-japan-values-south-africa\">World Cup offered timely reminder of rugby\u2019s values, on and off the pitch</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>2) End game</strong></h2> <p>A World Cup normally completes a four-year cycle, but arguably only two of the contenders were at that stage \u2013 Ireland and Wales. The former had lost momentum after beating New Zealand last November and looked stale while Wales were ultimately undone by injuries. England and New Zealand had changed course a year before, South Africa had appointed a new coach at the beginning of 2018 while Australia and France looked all over the place. Japan were settled, but were they considered likely winners? The position of fly-half summed up the state of flux; that South Africa were settled there was a factor in their success.</p> <h2><strong>3) Low high</strong></h2> <p>The organisers said before the start of the tournament that high and dangerous challenges would warrant a red card unless there were mitigating circumstances. But after an opening weekend in which several such tackles went unpunished, officials agreed there had been undue leniency. Tolerance was reduced to near zero and the intended consequence, to force coaches to ensure their players went into tackles lower, was largely met. The only red card in the knockout stage was for an act of crass stupidity by France\u2019s S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina that would have received the same sanction early on. Everybody else went low.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/03/momentum-professional-sport-trick-of-the-mind\">Springboks and Nationals show momentum in sport is overrated</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>4) Japan v Ireland</strong></h2> <p>The Brave Blossoms\u2019 stunning victory over the team that led the world rankings at the start of the tournament captured the attention and imagination of the host nation. Their victory over South Africa in the 2015 World Cup had been more than a water-cooler moment, but it was ultimately a one-off. This was different. The winning try against the Springboks four years ago \u2013 and it was ironic that the country that caused their greatest humiliation on the field should be where they won the trophy for the third time \u2013 came at the end of the match, an act of plunder. Their victory over Ireland in Shizuoka was a tactical triumph built on a much firmer foundation and that resonated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1ea07cee0266305bbde03a15c1d372f888a2065\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1ea07cee0266305bbde03a15c1d372f888a2065/0_495_3506_2104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The South Africa captain, Siya Kolisi, poses with the World Rugby Team of the Year Award in Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The South Africa captain, Siya Kolisi, poses with the World Rugby Team of the Year Award in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Mullan - World Rugby/World Rugby via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5) Siya Kolisi</strong></h2> <p>The captain from humble beginnings maintained his humility at the moment of his greatest triumph. It was notable how relaxed the South Africa coaches and players who performed media duties last week were, but none more so than Kolisi on Friday afternoon. He could have been taking part in an end-of-term sack race, smiling often and leaning back in his chair as he was again asked about his upbringing, what victory would mean for a country in need of a lift and how the Springboks were a squad no longer defined by race or colour but one that celebrated and exploited their different backgrounds. Like his head coach, Erasmus, he was hugely impressive after the final, even minutes after it finished when he had to do a flash interview. Erasmus has made many smart decisions since taking over last year but the best was his first: his choice of captain.</p> <h2><strong>6) Not blown off course</strong></h2> <p>Typhoon Hagibis could have taken an even greater toll on the tournament than the cancellation of three matches. Only one of these, Italy against New Zealand, had any relevance on the quarter-final shake-up and then only mathematically as Italy needed to beat the holders and secure a bonus point. Had the final group match between Japan and Scotland fallen victim to it, the fall-out could have far-reaching after the Scottish Rugby Union made a series of demands and took legal advice. An army of staff and volunteers at the stadium in Yokohama, some of whom had had to evacuate their homes in the worst storm here for 60 years, made sure it went ahead, many working through the night, and this was, by some way, the friendliest of the World Cups.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7951d1d93cb5a6ac6ea0471da2992ee674aaef2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7951d1d93cb5a6ac6ea0471da2992ee674aaef2a/0_96_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rescue workers in Nagano prefecture after Typhoon Hagibis struck Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rescue workers in Nagano prefecture after Typhoon Hagibis struck Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7) Momentum shifts</strong></h2> <p>The theory in tournaments used to be that it was all about momentum: get on a roll and no one can stand in your path. Here, New Zealand trounced Ireland one week and were dismantled by England the next. England, seven days later, were put through the mincer by South Africa. It is not as if New Zealand or England were confronted by the unexpected after their triumphs, although the sustained brilliance of Eddie Jones\u2019s team may have caught out the All Blacks. England knew what was coming their way in the final but did not do enough to build their defences. South Africa played at a consistent level throughout the tournament: they did not hit the highs of New Zealand or England, even Wales maybe, but neither did they go as low. In an era of almost celebrity coaches, have players lost the capacity to think when a plan is not working out?</p> <h2><strong>8) Not to be forgotten</strong></h2> <p>It was a time of farewells. Steve Hansen and Warren Gatland reached the end of their long stints with New Zealand and Wales respectively going for bronze rather than gold, Joe Schmidt was unable to end Ireland\u2019s record of never having made the last four, Jacques Brunel looked to be here in name only, there seemed to be a new name to succeed Italy\u2019s Conor O\u2019Shea every day and Michael Cheika\u2019s five years with Australia came to an acrimonious end after elimination by England. Coaches now tend to be given time and, given intense analysis and the importance of man-management, they have never been more influential. Gatland said after Wales finished fourth that he would be heartbroken if all the gains made during his 12 years were lost and Wales returned to the doldrums.

      "bodyText": "1) New Zealand v South Africa It looked like advantage to the holders after they effectively decided the pool pecking order on the opening weekend, but it prompted South Africa\u2019s head coach, Rassie Erasmus, to make a significant change. The Springboks conceded only four tries in the tournament, two against the All Blacks. Erasmus used a conventional split of five forwards and three backs on the bench on that evening, but he changed it to six-two for the pool match against Italy and the three knockout games, giving him an alternative tight five to maintain physical power and mental sharpness. 2) End game A World Cup normally completes a four-year cycle, but arguably only two of the contenders were at that stage \u2013 Ireland and Wales. The former had lost momentum after beating New Zealand last November and looked stale while Wales were ultimately undone by injuries. England and New Zealand had changed course a year before, South Africa had appointed a new coach at the beginning of 2018 while Australia and France looked all over the place. Japan were settled, but were they considered likely winners? The position of fly-half summed up the state of flux; that South Africa were settled there was a factor in their success. 3) Low high The organisers said before the start of the tournament that high and dangerous challenges would warrant a red card unless there were mitigating circumstances. But after an opening weekend in which several such tackles went unpunished, officials agreed there had been undue leniency. Tolerance was reduced to near zero and the intended consequence, to force coaches to ensure their players went into tackles lower, was largely met. The only red card in the knockout stage was for an act of crass stupidity by France\u2019s S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina that would have received the same sanction early on. Everybody else went low. 4) Japan v Ireland The Brave Blossoms\u2019 stunning victory over the team that led the world rankings at the start of the tournament captured the attention and imagination of the host nation. Their victory over South Africa in the 2015 World Cup had been more than a water-cooler moment, but it was ultimately a one-off. This was different. The winning try against the Springboks four years ago \u2013 and it was ironic that the country that caused their greatest humiliation on the field should be where they won the trophy for the third time \u2013 came at the end of the match, an act of plunder. Their victory over Ireland in Shizuoka was a tactical triumph built on a much firmer foundation and that resonated. 5) Siya Kolisi The captain from humble beginnings maintained his humility at the moment of his greatest triumph. It was notable how relaxed the South Africa coaches and players who performed media duties last week were, but none more so than Kolisi on Friday afternoon. He could have been taking part in an end-of-term sack race, smiling often and leaning back in his chair as he was again asked about his upbringing, what victory would mean for a country in need of a lift and how the Springboks were a squad no longer defined by race or colour but one that celebrated and exploited their different backgrounds. Like his head coach, Erasmus, he was hugely impressive after the final, even minutes after it finished when he had to do a flash interview. Erasmus has made many smart decisions since taking over last year but the best was his first: his choice of captain. 6) Not blown off course Typhoon Hagibis could have taken an even greater toll on the tournament than the cancellation of three matches. Only one of these, Italy against New Zealand, had any relevance on the quarter-final shake-up and then only mathematically as Italy needed to beat the holders and secure a bonus point. Had the final group match between Japan and Scotland fallen victim to it, the fall-out could have far-reaching after the Scottish Rugby Union made a series of demands and took legal advice. An army of staff and volunteers at the stadium in Yokohama, some of whom had had to evacuate their homes in the worst storm here for 60 years, made sure it went ahead, many working through the night, and this was, by some way, the friendliest of the World Cups. 7) Momentum shifts The theory in tournaments used to be that it was all about momentum: get on a roll and no one can stand in your path. Here, New Zealand trounced Ireland one week and were dismantled by England the next. England, seven days later, were put through the mincer by South Africa. It is not as if New Zealand or England were confronted by the unexpected after their triumphs, although the sustained brilliance of Eddie Jones\u2019s team may have caught out the All Blacks. England knew what was coming their way in the final but did not do enough to build their defences. South Africa played at a consistent level throughout the tournament: they did not hit the highs of New Zealand or England, even Wales maybe, but neither did they go as low. In an era of almost celebrity coaches, have players lost the capacity to think when a plan is not working out? 8) Not to be forgotten It was a time of farewells. Steve Hansen and Warren Gatland reached the end of their long stints with New Zealand and Wales respectively going for bronze rather than gold, Joe Schmidt was unable to end Ireland\u2019s record of never having made the last four, Jacques Brunel looked to be here in name only, there seemed to be a new name to succeed Italy\u2019s Conor O\u2019Shea every day and Michael Cheika\u2019s five years with Australia came to an acrimonious end after elimination by England. Coaches now tend to be given time and, given intense analysis and the importance of man-management, they have never been more influential. Gatland said after Wales finished fourth that he would be heartbroken if all the gains made during his 12 years were lost and Wales returned to the doldrums. His successor, Wayne Pivac, will change style while needing to remain on the same course. 9) Tier stained Every World Cup prompts a debate about the access emerging nations (tier two) should have to the countries that play in major championships (tier one), but the tone changed here because Japan made the quarter-finals while Italy, Argentina and Scotland boarded early flights home. Japan\u2019s success ensured the losing margin in matches involving sides from the two groups fell; but even when there were blow-outs, and Namibia and Canada found themselves in the same group as the holders and the eventual winners, the investment in high-performance systems paid off. Some of the tournament\u2019s outstanding players were in tier two sides and if the last six weeks have shown anything it is that the old order should be shaken up. 10) Memories From the moment 15,000 locals who turned up to watch Wales train in Kitakyushu, having learned the Welsh national anthem, it was clear this was going to be a different tournament.

The top of its list then was the Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/el-chapo-sentence-life-prison-mexican-drug-lord-trial\">\u201cEl Chapo\u201d</a>, as he is better known, was arrested three years later, escaped and captured again in 2016.</p> <p>Another since struck off the list is the Irish-American mobster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger.

The bureau claims 93% of those listed are eventually caught. It recently added its oldest suspect, Eugene Palmer, 83, <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/eugene-palmer/@@download.pdf\">accused of killing</a> his daughter-in-law.</p> <p>Osama bin Laden featured on the list until September 2001, when he was shifted to a newly created list of most-wanted terrorists that extends to 28 names and offers lucrative cash rewards.</p> <p>The al-Qaida leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/al-qaida-leader-denounces-islamic-state-liars-in-new-message\">Ayman al-Zawahiri </a>is worth most at $25m.

The 2010 list <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101013225136/https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber\">featured five names</a>, including a man accused of selling illegal satellite TV connections. Now it extends to nearly 70 people, including dozens in Russian and Chinese military uniforms, and <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/russian-interference-in-2016-u-s-elections\">groups with titles</a> such as \u201cRussian Interference in 2016 US Elections\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMost wanted\u201d appears to be mostly a matter of perspective. India\u2019s anti-terrorism agency debuted its version of the list in October last year, with a scale befitting the second most-populated country in the world. No fewer than 258 names were listed, with the highest reward (1.5m rupees, or \u00a316,000) reserved for the Ganapathi, the <em>nom-de-guerre</em> of a former leader of a Maoist insurgency that has raged for more than five decades.</p> <p>China has also taken to publishing its own list of 100 most-wanted fugitives, the vast majority <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/global/2019-01/25/content_37431487.htm\">accused of fraud, theft or bribery</a> as part of a wider anti-corruption crackdown that has become a signature campaign of president Xi Jinping.</p> <p>In 2019, the idea that \u201cmost wanted\u201d should necessarily be followed by \u201cman\u201d has not gone unquestioned. \u201cCrime has no gender,\u201d declared <a href=\"https://eumostwanted.eu/crimehasnogender\">a recent campaign</a> by the European agency for law enforcement cooperation, Europol, to publicise a list of the continent\u2019s most notable female suspects.

No rankings are provided, but the two-person rule is occasionally waived for those being sought with extra urgency.

      "bodyText": "He never touched mobile phones. Had no permanent home. Got his underwear stolen by an informant. And had his final moments narrated by Donald Trump. Such was life for the world\u2019s most wanted man. The title doesn\u2019t exist. But if anyone could have staked the claim it was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State chief who oversaw a UK-sized empire involved in slavery, torture, lurid video-taped executions and terrorist violence in an estimated 40 countries. His death left Isis \u2013 temporarily \u2013 without a leader, and lists of the world\u2019s most-wanted criminals without a compelling number one. There are, regrettably, no shortage of replacements, the challenge being to rank them. Is a Burmese g\u00e9nocidaire worse than a Sri Lankan terrorist? A French gun-runner more heinous than a Chinese don? Forbes used to compile a world reprobate ranking in coordination with law enforcement agencies, but appears to have abandoned the enterprise in 2011. The top of its list then was the Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n. \u201cEl Chapo\u201d, as he is better known, was arrested three years later, escaped and captured again in 2016. Another since struck off the list is the Irish-American mobster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger. He was finally caught in late 2011 after his neighbour recognised him from a most-wanted feature on TV and called the police. She pocketed a US$2m reward. Bulger was beaten to death in prison last year. The rest of the eight-year-old Forbes lineup are otherwise still at large, including the Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, whose militia had been so whittled down by 2017 that authorities simply stopped looking for him. The most famous criminal survey is the FBI\u2019s 10 most-wanted fugitives list, which turned 70 this year. The bureau claims 93% of those listed are eventually caught. It recently added its oldest suspect, Eugene Palmer, 83, accused of killing his daughter-in-law. Osama bin Laden featured on the list until September 2001, when he was shifted to a newly created list of most-wanted terrorists that extends to 28 names and offers lucrative cash rewards. The al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is worth most at $25m. Bin Laden\u2019s purported heir Hamza (\u201clooks just like his father, tall, very handsome\u201d, Trump observed last week) never had the chance to make the list after it was confirmed in September he had died in a US airstrike. The FBI\u2019s list of most-wanted cyber criminals has undergone a transformation. The 2010 list featured five names, including a man accused of selling illegal satellite TV connections. Now it extends to nearly 70 people, including dozens in Russian and Chinese military uniforms, and groups with titles such as \u201cRussian Interference in 2016 US Elections\u201d. \u201cMost wanted\u201d appears to be mostly a matter of perspective. India\u2019s anti-terrorism agency debuted its version of the list in October last year, with a scale befitting the second most-populated country in the world. No fewer than 258 names were listed, with the highest reward (1.5m rupees, or \u00a316,000) reserved for the Ganapathi, the nom-de-guerre of a former leader of a Maoist insurgency that has raged for more than five decades. China has also taken to publishing its own list of 100 most-wanted fugitives, the vast majority accused of fraud, theft or bribery as part of a wider anti-corruption crackdown that has become a signature campaign of president Xi Jinping. In 2019, the idea that \u201cmost wanted\u201d should necessarily be followed by \u201cman\u201d has not gone unquestioned. \u201cCrime has no gender,\u201d declared a recent campaign by the European agency for law enforcement cooperation, Europol, to publicise a list of the continent\u2019s most notable female suspects. They include accused forgers, drug smugglers, human traffickers and murderers \u2013 the same miserable catalogue of offences suspected of the men of Europe\u2019s Most Wanted, a series in publication since 2016. The list is a kind of delinquent Eurovision, with EU countries nominating their two most sought-after suspects for the spotlight. No rankings are provided, but the two-person rule is occasionally waived for those being sought with extra urgency. Suspects in the November 2015 Paris attacks were among those to receive that dishonour. The sole addition is Ridouan Taghi, a Dutch-Moroccan national suspected of murder and drug smuggling, whose name was included last month after a lawyer in proceedings against him was gunned down in Amsterdam. The world\u2019s most wanted fugitives according to the Guardian 1. Abubakar Shekau The Nigerian militant became leader of the Boko Haram group in 2009, overseeing a brutal \u201choly war\u201d waged not just against military or police targets but civilians, including the kidnapping of 276 girls from a secondary school in Chibok, a town in Borno state. 2. Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi Isis\u2019s newly named successor will immediately find a place on the most-wanted lists of governments around the world. 3. Ayman al-Zawahiri Born in 1950 to a well-to-do Egyptian family, Zawahiri initially trained as a surgeon before becoming ensconced in the country\u2019s burgeoning radical Islamist movement. Frequently jailed and tortured, he fled to Pakistan, where he aided the mujahideen fighters to repel Soviet invaders, and met a young Saudi financier by the name of Osama bin Laden. The pair fused their organisations to form al-Qaida, and Zawahiri took the helm after Bin Laden\u2019s 2011 death. 4. Ibrahim Dawood Dawood, 63, built a multimillion-dollar empire through extortion, match fixing and drug smuggling, and was named as mastermind of a series of bombings in Mumbai in 1993 that killed more than 250 people. Being a UN-listed global terrorist has not stopped the Indian gangster from living large: he is alleged to still have interests in property across the UK and reportedly attended his nephew\u2019s 2016 wedding via Skype. 5. Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, known as \u201clittle Chapo\u201d or \u201cChapito\u201d, followed his father Joaqu\u00edn into the family business, becoming one of the most prominent drug traffickers in the Mexican city of Culiac\u00e1n. Dozens of heavily armed Mexican police managed to capture Ovidio a few weeks ago, but found themselves outgunned when the cartel leader\u2019s henchmen fanned into upmarket neighbourhoods in the city, setting fires and blocking roads until authorities agreed to release their boss. Little Chapo is not regarded as the boss of his father\u2019s organisation, but after his recent escape, Mexican authorities will be especially eager to show they can bring him to justice. 6. Tse Chi Lop The Chinese-Canadian national dubbed \u201cthe most-wanted man in Asia\u201d is accused of leading an international drug syndicate born from an alliance of five triad groups. Police allege his syndicate funnels vast amounts of narcotics including heroin and methamphetamine across the region, from Japan to New Zealand. He is said to be protected by a posse of Thai kickboxers, according to Reuters investigation. 7. Vassilis Paleokostas Europe\u2019s most lucrative bounty is reserved for the thief and kidnapper Vassilis Paleokostas. Dubbed \u201cthe uncatchable\u201d, the Greek national fled prison in 2006 aboard a helicopter hijacked by his brother. He was arrested again two years later, but escaped the same prison, once again aboard a helicopter, in February 2009. Greece will pay \u20ac1m to whoever helps bring him back. 8. Matteo Messina Denaro Described as \u201cthe last Mohican of the old mafia\u201d, the Sicilian organised crime figure is one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives, in hiding since 1993. Denaro, 57, infamously claimed: \u201cI filled a cemetery all by myself\u201d, and has apparently kept up his luxurious lifestyle, thanks to his several bankrollers who, according to prosecutors, include politicians and businessmen. 9. Guccifer 2.0 The persona of one or several hackers who claim to be responsible for penetrating the servers of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and then leaking documents and emails they found. The US justice department last year indicted 12 Russian nationals for the hack, all of them members of the GRU, a Russian military intelligence agency. It is extremely unlikely the Kremlin will ever hand any of those indicted over to US law enforcement. 10.F\u00e9licien Kabuga Kabuga is wanted by the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda for his alleged role in facilitating that country\u2019s 1994 genocide in which more than 800,000 men, women and children were massacred.

My plan was to travel by train and cycle at each end.</p> <p>Tickets purchased, I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobynJankel/status/1180459108954230792\">tweeted</a> CrossCountry for a bike reservation, adding that I\u2019m unable to use a vertical hanging hook and asking whether alternative storage would be available. The answer was no. As a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CrossCountryUK/status/1180464542587002881\">follow-up</a> came the unexpectedly hostile: \u201cYou\u2019ll need to find a way of hanging it up yourself, or seek help in doing so. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t come onboard.\u201d</p> <p>In theory, vertical storage allows for two bicycles to be stored upright, tucked into a narrow cupboard, front wheels hung on ceiling hooks. The space is minimal, allowing train operators to claim cycle storage is provided, whilse stretching the technical definition to its absolute limit.</p> <p>The fact so few bicycles are narrow or light enough to fit into this crevice seems of minor concern to the rail companies. That still fewer people are physically capable of wrestling them in appears of even less interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WeAreCyclingUK/status/1179321627118575616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We&#39;re on the way to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CycleontheSenedd?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CycleontheSenedd</a>, going from Reading to Cardiff...and are having &quot;fun&quot; with the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GWR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GWR</a> cycle spaces, as our bike won&#39;t fit their hooks when there are two.

It may not have been a deliberate choice but this, nonetheless, is the end result.</p> <p>Women are on average shorter and have less upper body strength than men: anything requiring a heavy object to be hoisted six foot in the air is intended for use by the average (fit, non-disabled) man, and not the average person. Cycling is my primary mode of transportation, but with weakness in both wrists, I can\u2019t lift my bike without support.</p> <p>As a newly single woman on an independence kick, it was quite an indignity to feel I required male assistance in order to assert said independence.</p> <p>Cue my impotent rage, to which CrossCountry responded that it hears \u201cvery few complaints along these lines\u201d. Which was interesting, because the company and I then received a barrage of tweets from all manner of passengers facing this very issue.</p> <p>CrossCountry is not the only rail company to install this parody of cycle storage. ScotRail, Great Western, Virgin and others have all introduced it and the rest are following suit.</p> <p>Each of LNER\u2019s new, much-touted Azuma trains have four hooks in two cupboards, which the operator <a href=\"https://www.lner.co.uk/faq/azuma/bikes-on-azuma/what-bike-storage-is-there-on-an-azuma-train/\">describes</a> as \u201cplenty of bike storage\u201d. With greater passenger numbers and pressure from above to increase capacity still further, something\u2019s got to give, and that something is adequate, accessible cycle storage.</p> <p>But in order to tackle the climate crisis and encourage sustainable journeys, we need to make the natural combination of rail and cycle an easy, accessible option for everyone who could be cycling, and not simply those who currently do.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s gender split of cyclists is <a href=\"https://www.cyclinguk.org/article/campaigns-guide/women-cycling\">heavily skewed</a> towards men, with our infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/mar/08/how-to-get-more-women-cycling-in-cities\">fundamentally unattractive</a> to women. It\u2019s ironic, given the bicycle was once a historical symbol of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2011/nov/04/bicycle-symbol-womens-emancipation\">female empowerment</a> and independence.</p> <p>Engineers and CEOs don\u2019t actively calculate how best to exclude women, but they don\u2019t work out how to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/23/truth-world-built-for-men-car-crashes\">encourage them</a>. If female cyclists \u2013 particularly those traveling alone \u2013 find it harder to load their bicycles on to trains then many simply won\u2019t bother cycling at all. Some won\u2019t make the journey. Others will drive instead.</p> <p>The same can be said for disabled cyclists.</p> <p>Many disabled and elderly people find it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/02/cambridge-disabled-people-cycling-rolling-walking-stick\">easier</a> to cycle than walk, but provision such as this makes no allowance for handbikes, trikes, recumbents or e-bikes.</p> <p>CrossCountry\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/on-board-with-crosscountry/bikes-and-cyclists\">cycle policy</a> states: \u201cAs space is limited, we are unable to convey tandems, tricycles \u2026 or motorised bikes on any of our trains.\u201d No exceptions are mentioned.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: vertical cycle storage is a disaster for everybody. It carries fewer bikes, allows for limited styles and sizes, is a struggle for even the most capable, stops families travelling together and actively discourages sustainable journeys. Through my involvement with the <a href=\"https://yorkcyclecampaign.bike/\">York Cycle Campaign</a>, I\u2019m aware of how many engineers, cycling bodies, individuals and organisations warned the rail companies against it. Every cyclist I\u2019ve heard from considers it either a hindrance or a flat-out barrier.</p> <p>Nonetheless, as ever, it\u2019s the marginalised groups who suffer the most. My plan is to write to ministers at relevant government departments to see what they have to say.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\">Peter Walker</a> adds:</h2> <p>After seeing Robyn\u2019s tweets, I asked on Twitter about other people\u2019s experiences, and the response was overwhelming. Wherever vertical cycle storage is in place, people said, the cupboards are either far too small for many bikes, difficult for people to hang their bikes in, or full of rubbish, baggage or both.

I particularly sought information on what work they had done to ensure vertical bike storage was accessible.</p> <p>The responses were long, and mixed \u2013 extracts of them are below. But the key seemed to be this: most companies said they receive few complaints. Perhaps UK cyclists are inured to awful treatment on trains? But perhaps that\u2019s the lesson \u2013 don\u2019t just mention it on Twitter, let the rail company know.</p> <p>The main rationale given is quite depressing. Rail services are busy, space is limited, and vertical is the best way to fulfil the contractual obligation to carry some bikes without taking up much room.</p> <p>But here are edited extracts of what they had to say:</p> <h2>CrossCountry</h2> <p>The company says it is \u201cfully compliant with the committed obligations\u201d to carry bikes, and on carrying disabled people. It went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As more and more people choose rail as their preferred mode of transport, managing the finite interior space on trains becomes even more important to support all types of customer. This increase in demand for seats and luggage means vertical bike storage offers the best solution for the limited space we have available. We introduced vertical storage on our trains over 10 years ago and this is now common on Britain\u2019s railways, including on the latest high speed long-distance trains currently being introduced with other train operators.</p> <p>Ensuring our services are inclusive for all our customers, including cyclists, is something we keep under constant review. However, with only 12 months remaining, there is no opportunity to change the design of cycling provision in our current franchise. Although not a huge issue in terms of customer feedback, with only 13 contacts regarding the storage of cycles over the past year, we would be happy to raise this in our ongoing dialogue with the Department for Transport on options for the future of CrossCountry.</p> </blockquote> <h2>GWR</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We recognise that some customers preferred the storage for bikes in the separate guard\u2019s van on our older trains. However, we had to find space for cycles on the train, while improving space for customers and luggage without cycles. The guard\u2019s van was not ideal either \u2013 it meant cyclists had to walk to the very end or very front of the train to store their bikes, go and find their seat and then head all the way back when they wanted to depart.</p> <p>It also meant an added risk of delay as it could be difficult for customers to get to the end of the train within the scheduled times. The guard\u2019s van also took up the space of about 80 standard class seats on every train \u2013 an important consideration given the increasing passenger numbers on the rail network.</p> <p>We are fully supportive of encouraging greener travel \u2013 bikes are welcome on our trains, and of course every additional non-cycling customer we carry is a potential journey not made by road. We are investing in improved cycle parking facilities at various stations across GWR and cycle hire services are available at a number of locations too.</p> <p>The hook system has been designed to Department for Transport standards, thoroughly tested, and other train operators have also been using the same setup for some time.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Listening to customer feedback, at GWR we do however accept that in practice there have been occasions when the dedicated cycle space is used by other customers to store their luggage, and we are working with Hitachi to further improve onboard signage.</p> </blockquote> <h2>LNER</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we introduce new Azuma trains across our network, collecting feedback from our customers is as important as ever. LNER is currently gathering feedback from customers travelling with bikes to help us understand how we can make improvements.

      "bodyText": "Do you ever get the feeling you\u2019re not wanted? I recently took a trip to Sheffield from my home in York. My plan was to travel by train and cycle at each end. Tickets purchased, I tweeted CrossCountry for a bike reservation, adding that I\u2019m unable to use a vertical hanging hook and asking whether alternative storage would be available. The answer was no. As a follow-up came the unexpectedly hostile: \u201cYou\u2019ll need to find a way of hanging it up yourself, or seek help in doing so. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t come onboard.\u201d In theory, vertical storage allows for two bicycles to be stored upright, tucked into a narrow cupboard, front wheels hung on ceiling hooks. The space is minimal, allowing train operators to claim cycle storage is provided, whilse stretching the technical definition to its absolute limit. The fact so few bicycles are narrow or light enough to fit into this crevice seems of minor concern to the rail companies. That still fewer people are physically capable of wrestling them in appears of even less interest. But in choosing to provide vertical storage as the only option, these companies have made a decision that disproportionately puts female cyclists and those with mobility issues at a huge disadvantage. It may not have been a deliberate choice but this, nonetheless, is the end result. Women are on average shorter and have less upper body strength than men: anything requiring a heavy object to be hoisted six foot in the air is intended for use by the average (fit, non-disabled) man, and not the average person. Cycling is my primary mode of transportation, but with weakness in both wrists, I can\u2019t lift my bike without support. As a newly single woman on an independence kick, it was quite an indignity to feel I required male assistance in order to assert said independence. Cue my impotent rage, to which CrossCountry responded that it hears \u201cvery few complaints along these lines\u201d. Which was interesting, because the company and I then received a barrage of tweets from all manner of passengers facing this very issue. CrossCountry is not the only rail company to install this parody of cycle storage. ScotRail, Great Western, Virgin and others have all introduced it and the rest are following suit. Each of LNER\u2019s new, much-touted Azuma trains have four hooks in two cupboards, which the operator describes as \u201cplenty of bike storage\u201d. With greater passenger numbers and pressure from above to increase capacity still further, something\u2019s got to give, and that something is adequate, accessible cycle storage. But in order to tackle the climate crisis and encourage sustainable journeys, we need to make the natural combination of rail and cycle an easy, accessible option for everyone who could be cycling, and not simply those who currently do. The UK\u2019s gender split of cyclists is heavily skewed towards men, with our infrastructure fundamentally unattractive to women. It\u2019s ironic, given the bicycle was once a historical symbol of female empowerment and independence. Engineers and CEOs don\u2019t actively calculate how best to exclude women, but they don\u2019t work out how to encourage them. If female cyclists \u2013 particularly those traveling alone \u2013 find it harder to load their bicycles on to trains then many simply won\u2019t bother cycling at all. Some won\u2019t make the journey. Others will drive instead. The same can be said for disabled cyclists. Many disabled and elderly people find it easier to cycle than walk, but provision such as this makes no allowance for handbikes, trikes, recumbents or e-bikes. CrossCountry\u2019s cycle policy states: \u201cAs space is limited, we are unable to convey tandems, tricycles \u2026 or motorised bikes on any of our trains.\u201d No exceptions are mentioned. Let\u2019s be clear: vertical cycle storage is a disaster for everybody. It carries fewer bikes, allows for limited styles and sizes, is a struggle for even the most capable, stops families travelling together and actively discourages sustainable journeys. Through my involvement with the York Cycle Campaign, I\u2019m aware of how many engineers, cycling bodies, individuals and organisations warned the rail companies against it. Every cyclist I\u2019ve heard from considers it either a hindrance or a flat-out barrier. Nonetheless, as ever, it\u2019s the marginalised groups who suffer the most. My plan is to write to ministers at relevant government departments to see what they have to say. Peter Walker adds: After seeing Robyn\u2019s tweets, I asked on Twitter about other people\u2019s experiences, and the response was overwhelming. Wherever vertical cycle storage is in place, people said, the cupboards are either far too small for many bikes, difficult for people to hang their bikes in, or full of rubbish, baggage or both. Here are a few examples. I also sought responses from the three rail companies that came up most often: CrossCountry, which runs long-distance services around the UK; GWR, which operates to Wales, and the west and south-west of England; and LNER, which operates the main East Coast franchise. I particularly sought information on what work they had done to ensure vertical bike storage was accessible. The responses were long, and mixed \u2013 extracts of them are below. But the key seemed to be this: most companies said they receive few complaints. Perhaps UK cyclists are inured to awful treatment on trains? But perhaps that\u2019s the lesson \u2013 don\u2019t just mention it on Twitter, let the rail company know. The main rationale given is quite depressing. Rail services are busy, space is limited, and vertical is the best way to fulfil the contractual obligation to carry some bikes without taking up much room. But here are edited extracts of what they had to say: CrossCountry The company says it is \u201cfully compliant with the committed obligations\u201d to carry bikes, and on carrying disabled people. It went on: As more and more people choose rail as their preferred mode of transport, managing the finite interior space on trains becomes even more important to support all types of customer. This increase in demand for seats and luggage means vertical bike storage offers the best solution for the limited space we have available. We introduced vertical storage on our trains over 10 years ago and this is now common on Britain\u2019s railways, including on the latest high speed long-distance trains currently being introduced with other train operators. Ensuring our services are inclusive for all our customers, including cyclists, is something we keep under constant review. However, with only 12 months remaining, there is no opportunity to change the design of cycling provision in our current franchise. Although not a huge issue in terms of customer feedback, with only 13 contacts regarding the storage of cycles over the past year, we would be happy to raise this in our ongoing dialogue with the Department for Transport on options for the future of CrossCountry. GWR We recognise that some customers preferred the storage for bikes in the separate guard\u2019s van on our older trains. However, we had to find space for cycles on the train, while improving space for customers and luggage without cycles. The guard\u2019s van was not ideal either \u2013 it meant cyclists had to walk to the very end or very front of the train to store their bikes, go and find their seat and then head all the way back when they wanted to depart. It also meant an added risk of delay as it could be difficult for customers to get to the end of the train within the scheduled times. The guard\u2019s van also took up the space of about 80 standard class seats on every train \u2013 an important consideration given the increasing passenger numbers on the rail network. We are fully supportive of encouraging greener travel \u2013 bikes are welcome on our trains, and of course every additional non-cycling customer we carry is a potential journey not made by road. We are investing in improved cycle parking facilities at various stations across GWR and cycle hire services are available at a number of locations too. The hook system has been designed to Department for Transport standards, thoroughly tested, and other train operators have also been using the same setup for some time. Listening to customer feedback, at GWR we do however accept that in practice there have been occasions when the dedicated cycle space is used by other customers to store their luggage, and we are working with Hitachi to further improve onboard signage. LNER As we introduce new Azuma trains across our network, collecting feedback from our customers is as important as ever. LNER is currently gathering feedback from customers travelling with bikes to help us understand how we can make improvements. We\u2019ll be reviewing this with our engineering team to identify where improvements can be made.

      "bodyText": "Last week about 3,500 of Britain\u2019s most mathematically gifted sixth formers sat Oxford university\u2019s annual Mathematics Admissions Test. The exam is designed to test \u201cmathematical understanding\u2026rather than a breadth of knowledge.\u201d Today\u2019s puzzle is taken from a recent paper. It\u2019s about stacking items in a shopping bag. If you get full marks in parts (i), (ii) and (iii), well done. Most of the applicants who got in to Oxford did too. But on average, successful applicants did not score full marks in either of parts (iv) or (v). Can you do better than them? You need to pack several items into your shopping bag without squashing anything. The items are to be placed one on top of the other. Each item has a weight and a strength, defined as the maximum weight that can be placed above that item without it being squashed. A packing order is safe if no item in the bag is squashed, that is, if, for each item, that item\u2019s strength is at least the combined weight of what\u2019s placed above that item. For example, here are three items and a packing order: This packing is not safe. The bread is squashed because the weight above it, 5, is greater than its strength, 4. Swapping the apples and the bread, however, gives a safe packing. (i) Which of the other four orderings of apples, bread and carrots are safe or unsafe? (ii) Consider packing items in weight order, with the heaviest at the bottom. Show by giving an example \u2013 that is, invent some items and give them weights and strengths of your choosing \u2013 that this strategy might not produce a safe packing order, even if one exists. (iii) Consider packing items in strength order, with the strongest at the bottom. Show by giving an example \u2013 that is, invent some items and give them weights and strengths of your choosing \u2013 that this strategy might not produce a safe packing order, even if one exists. (iv) Consider we have a safe packing order in our bag. Assume that item j sits directly on item i. Suppose also that: (weight of j) \u2013 (strength of i) \u2265 (weight of i) \u2013 (strength of j) Show that if we swap items i and j we still have a safe packing order. (v) Hence suggest a practical method of producing a safe packing order if one exists. Explain why. (Listing all possible orderings is not possible.) I\u2019ll be back with the solutions \u2013 and workings! \u2013 at 5pm UK. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS! UPDATE: To read the solution click here. (The Mathematics Admissions Test is taken by students applying to study maths, computer science and joint honours, at Oxford, Imperial and Warwick universities. This question was for those applying for computer science courses. It has been rephrased slightly to make it more suitable for a newspaper column. Thanks to James Munro at Oxford\u2019s Mathematical Institute. ) I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. If you you enjoy puzzles, you might enjoy my latest book, So You Think You\u2019ve Got Problems?, which is out this week. It contains about 200 problems from many different genres, including logic puzzles, word puzzles, physical puzzles and geometrical puzzles. The book also includes background material about the history of the puzzles and discusses the concepts involved.",

A 2018 National Retail Federation <a href=\"https://appriss.com/retail/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/12/AR3018_2018-Customer-Returns-in-the-Retail-Industry_Digital.pdf\">study</a> pegged the cost of \u201creturn fraud\u201d at a staggering $18.4bn. What <em>is</em> unusual is that this shoplifting suspect, Andrew Francis Lippi III, is rich. A week before his Kmart arrest, he paid $8m for an island in the Florida Keys.</p> <p>Kabinet Bangoura, the Kmart loss prevention manager who scanned hours of surveillance video to build the case, is blunt about Lippi\u2019s motivation: \u201cMillionaires think they\u2019re above the law and can get away with anything.\u201d</p> <p>While it\u2019s impossible to profile shoplifters \u2013 the crime transcends gender, age and all socio-demographic strata, and about one in 11 people commit it \u2013 evidence suggests the rich actually do steal more than the poor. The paper cited most often to support this theory, Prevalence and Correlates of Shoplifting in the United States (American Journal of Psychology,<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4104590/\">2008</a>),<em> </em> states that people with incomes of $70,000 shoplift 30% more than those earning $20,000 a year.</p> <p>A federal lawyer proved that point last year when she was caught swiping $257.99 worth of cosmetics from a military base store in Quantico, Virginia. This unnamed FBI employee later confessed to that theft and several previous shoplifting sprees in the area. More recently, in September, Sgt Eva Pena of the New York police department was suspended from her job after she was allegedly caught stealing clothing valued at $359 from a Macy\u2019s store. This wasn\u2019t a crime of poverty. Pena, whose 2018 salary was $107,809, drove to court in a white Mercedes to enter her not guilty plea.</p> <p>So why do otherwise law-abiding (and well-off) citizens ignore their better angels and go full <a href=\"https://www.ranker.com/list/celebrities-who-have-been-caught-shoplifting/celebrity-lists\">Winona Ryder</a>? The answer depends on which expert you consult. Every psychiatrist, substance abuse counselor and social scientist has a theory to explain this counterintuitive behavior.</p> <p>\u201cStealing is just the first layer of the onion,\u201d explains Terrence Shulman, the founder of the Shulman Center for Compulsive Theft, Spending and Hoarding. \u201cBeneath that are all the unresolved losses, traumas, abuses and repressed memories.\u201d He emphasizes that these psychic scars aren\u2019t always rooted in the past. Tragic events like a recent divorce, a bankruptcy or death in the family could trigger a shoplifting episode. \u201cThese people are self-medicating. Theft becomes their drug of choice,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These people are self-medicating. Theft becomes their drug of choice</p> <footer> <cite>Terrence Shulman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Psychologists have a label for this maladaptive behavior: <em>nonsensical shoplifting</em>, or shoplifting not apparently motivated by need or desire. Depression and trauma, stressors and triggers are often brought up when a celebrity shoplifting bust hits the newsfeeds. Not everyone, however, believes that nonsensical shoplifting is a layer of an onion or a coping mechanism.</p> <p>Psychologist Stanton E Samenow, the author of The Myth of the Out of Character Crime, is convinced wealthy people shoplift because, as he puts it: \u201cWhy buy it if you can steal it?\u201d He disparages all the exculpatory data: \u201cThere\u2019s always an attempt to ascribe criminality to circumstances outside the individual or some psychological disability. It\u2019s the unconscious \u2018cry for help\u2019 or the person is seeking psychological punishment. These theories are old and shopworn.\u201d</p> <p>Samenow recounts a case study, a patient that he treated several years ago: \u201cHe had more than enough money to buy the item. He took it for the thrill of it, to outsmart the establishment. He enjoyed every aspect of shoplifting: scanning the aisles for the objects, looking for the exits, trying to outsmart the surveillance and store personnel, the theft and the getaway. This was all about excitement and building up one\u2019s self-worth.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/20/confessions-of-teenage-shoplifter-241\">Confessions of a teenage shoplifter | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Psychiatrist Jon Grant, a University of Chicago professor, agrees that shoplifting may often elicit a sense of euphoria. But he\u2019s quick to add that once the adrenaline rush subsides, a darker side of this compulsion manifests itself. \u201cI see shoplifting as an addiction,\u201d he says. \u201cThe people I treat really hate the fact that they steal. They enjoy the thrill but then almost instantly beat themselves up for the behavior. They have lots of guilt and frequently think about and attempt suicide because of their behavior.\u201d</p> <p>Social hierarchies is an established field of psychology that focuses on the effects of wealth, power and privilege. The study results in this area are remarkably consistent: the rich tend to be unethical, and are more likely to cheat and steal than the poor are. In one experiment, the drivers of luxury cars were less likely to obey the right-of-way laws at a busy four-way intersection than the drivers of cheaper or older model cars. Then there\u2019s the grim and troubling \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/109/11/4086\">candy experiment</a>\u201d, where researchers observed wealthy people remove twice as much candy from a jar that had been earmarked for children than people of more modest means did. Experiments have also shown that wealthy people are more <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/18683-rich-people-lie-cheat-study.html\">likely to cheat </a>on their taxes and their romantic partners.</p> <p>One theory to explain this contrast in behavior is that low-income people are less likely to cheat and steal because they are more invested in their communities and fear being publicly humiliated. Conversely, the rich harbor feelings of entitlement and self-interest, which destabilizes their moral compass. Here\u2019s another factor that may apply: the poor have a heightened fear of authority figures, and the rich do not. There\u2019s a Kmart security guy in Florida who could have told you that.</p>",

Kabinet Bangoura, the Kmart loss prevention manager who scanned hours of surveillance video to build the case, is blunt about Lippi\u2019s motivation: \u201cMillionaires think they\u2019re above the law and can get away with anything.\u201d While it\u2019s impossible to profile shoplifters \u2013 the crime transcends gender, age and all socio-demographic strata, and about one in 11 people commit it \u2013 evidence suggests the rich actually do steal more than the poor. The paper cited most often to support this theory, Prevalence and Correlates of Shoplifting in the United States (American Journal of Psychology, 2008), states that people with incomes of $70,000 shoplift 30% more than those earning $20,000 a year. A federal lawyer proved that point last year when she was caught swiping $257.99 worth of cosmetics from a military base store in Quantico, Virginia. This unnamed FBI employee later confessed to that theft and several previous shoplifting sprees in the area. More recently, in September, Sgt Eva Pena of the New York police department was suspended from her job after she was allegedly caught stealing clothing valued at $359 from a Macy\u2019s store. This wasn\u2019t a crime of poverty. Pena, whose 2018 salary was $107,809, drove to court in a white Mercedes to enter her not guilty plea. So why do otherwise law-abiding (and well-off) citizens ignore their better angels and go full Winona Ryder? The answer depends on which expert you consult. Every psychiatrist, substance abuse counselor and social scientist has a theory to explain this counterintuitive behavior. \u201cStealing is just the first layer of the onion,\u201d explains Terrence Shulman, the founder of the Shulman Center for Compulsive Theft, Spending and Hoarding. \u201cBeneath that are all the unresolved losses, traumas, abuses and repressed memories.\u201d He emphasizes that these psychic scars aren\u2019t always rooted in the past. Tragic events like a recent divorce, a bankruptcy or death in the family could trigger a shoplifting episode. \u201cThese people are self-medicating. Theft becomes their drug of choice,\u201d he says. Psychologists have a label for this maladaptive behavior: nonsensical shoplifting, or shoplifting not apparently motivated by need or desire. Depression and trauma, stressors and triggers are often brought up when a celebrity shoplifting bust hits the newsfeeds. Not everyone, however, believes that nonsensical shoplifting is a layer of an onion or a coping mechanism. Psychologist Stanton E Samenow, the author of The Myth of the Out of Character Crime, is convinced wealthy people shoplift because, as he puts it: \u201cWhy buy it if you can steal it?\u201d He disparages all the exculpatory data: \u201cThere\u2019s always an attempt to ascribe criminality to circumstances outside the individual or some psychological disability. It\u2019s the unconscious \u2018cry for help\u2019 or the person is seeking psychological punishment. These theories are old and shopworn.\u201d Samenow recounts a case study, a patient that he treated several years ago: \u201cHe had more than enough money to buy the item. He took it for the thrill of it, to outsmart the establishment. He enjoyed every aspect of shoplifting: scanning the aisles for the objects, looking for the exits, trying to outsmart the surveillance and store personnel, the theft and the getaway. This was all about excitement and building up one\u2019s self-worth.\u201d Psychiatrist Jon Grant, a University of Chicago professor, agrees that shoplifting may often elicit a sense of euphoria. But he\u2019s quick to add that once the adrenaline rush subsides, a darker side of this compulsion manifests itself. \u201cI see shoplifting as an addiction,\u201d he says. \u201cThe people I treat really hate the fact that they steal. They enjoy the thrill but then almost instantly beat themselves up for the behavior. They have lots of guilt and frequently think about and attempt suicide because of their behavior.\u201d Social hierarchies is an established field of psychology that focuses on the effects of wealth, power and privilege. The study results in this area are remarkably consistent: the rich tend to be unethical, and are more likely to cheat and steal than the poor are. In one experiment, the drivers of luxury cars were less likely to obey the right-of-way laws at a busy four-way intersection than the drivers of cheaper or older model cars. Then there\u2019s the grim and troubling \u201ccandy experiment\u201d, where researchers observed wealthy people remove twice as much candy from a jar that had been earmarked for children than people of more modest means did. Experiments have also shown that wealthy people are more likely to cheat on their taxes and their romantic partners. One theory to explain this contrast in behavior is that low-income people are less likely to cheat and steal because they are more invested in their communities and fear being publicly humiliated. Conversely, the rich harbor feelings of entitlement and self-interest, which destabilizes their moral compass. Here\u2019s another factor that may apply: the poor have a heightened fear of authority figures, and the rich do not. There\u2019s a Kmart security guy in Florida who could have told you that.",

      "body": "<h2>Why was the Berlin Wall erected?</h2> <p>The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 to stop an exodus from the eastern, communist part of divided Germany to the more prosperous west. Between 1949 and 1961 more than 2.6 million East Germans, out of a total population of 17 million, had escaped. Many were skilled professionals and their loss was increasingly felt in the German Democratic Republic, or GDR, as it was called.</p> <p>With the country on the edge of economic and social collapse, the East German government therefore made the decision to close the entire border, and erected the wall overnight, on 13 August 1961. It was often referred to by eastern authorities as the anti-fascist protection barrier, to protect East Germans from the west.</p> <h2>How was it built?</h2> <p>The concrete barrier, complete with 300 guard towers at regular intervals, was 96 miles in length and 13 feet high, though to start with it comprised temporary barriers of barbed wire coils. The erection date of 13 August 1961 was deliberately chosen because it was a Sunday during the summer holidays. Over days and weeks the barbed wire was replaced with vertical concrete slabs reinforced with iron bars, and hollow blocks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"897b2bd43652229bd6e0292d7edb89367a849a2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/897b2bd43652229bd6e0292d7edb89367a849a2b/0_0_2000_1659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"East German soldiers set up barbed wire barricades in Berlin on 13 August 1961\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">East German soldiers set up barbed wire barricades in Berlin on 13 August 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nothing was allowed to stand in the way of the wall. Houses on streets ,such as Bernauer Strasse, where the pavements were in the west, and the backs of the houses were in the east, became part of the border construction. The authorities simply ordered the bricking up of front entrances and windows. There are documented cases of people jumping from windows to avoid being locked into the east in their own homes.</p> <p>The wall itself was merely the outer boundary. Behind it was the so-called \u201cdeath strip\u201d, containing anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and other defence devices. Wherever the boundary ran through water, similar defence mechanisms were put in place to prevent anyone escaping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"177b50eeb959490e1fab073bb74b0a3fab73977c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/177b50eeb959490e1fab073bb74b0a3fab73977c/0_0_2982_2404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"East German soldier Hans Conrad Schumann leaps over a barbed wire barricade at the Bernauer Street sector into West Berlin in August 1961\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">East German soldier Hans Conrad Schumann leaps over a barbed wire barricade at the Bernauer Street sector into West Berlin in August 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Leibing/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Did anyone manage to escape?</h2> <p>At least 138 people lost their lives trying to escape across the wall, but an estimated 5,000 did manage to flee, although both figures are often disputed. Those who escaped hid in cars, sneaked through border points, crashed tanks through the fortifications, swam across the Teltow canal, paddled on a lilo over the river Spree, or crawled out via tunnels specially constructed by teams of dedicated volunteers including would-be escapers. Among the most spectacular was the circus tightrope walker who walked across a disused power line to the west, breaking both arms in the process.</p> <p>Most of those who tried their luck were males with an average age of 25.</p> <h2>Why was it pulled down?</h2> <p>An autumn of rising political protest in 1989 put pressure on the East German government to relax travel rules. In the early evening of 9 November, a government spokesman told a press conference that East Germans would be free to travel into West Germany. Asked when, he hesitated, and to the shock and amazement of the Germans present, added: \u201cimmediately\u201d.</p> <p>As soon as western media reported \u2013 erroneously \u2013 that the border had opened, people started gathering in large numbers at checkpoints on both sides. Overwhelmed by the numbers, passport checks were dropped by guards at around 11.30pm, by which time people were surging through.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 11 and 12 November that the first pieces of wall were pulled down. A hole was made in the wall segment cutting off the Brandenburg Gate on 10 November, but then sealed off again by the East German authorities and the wall did not come down properly until 22 December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d3f16d59226ae0b88e5277bf14e23ed13d2be6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3f16d59226ae0b88e5277bf14e23ed13d2be6b/0_257_3650_2190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People smash chunks off the Berlin Wall on 12 November 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People smash chunks off the Berlin Wall on 12 November 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool Chute do Mur Berlin/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How was it removed?</h2> <p>East German authorities initially began removing pieces of the wall using angle grinders, construction vehicles and cranes in the days after 9 November, to create more crossing points between east and west; thousands of Mauerspechte or \u201cwall peckers\u201d with hammers and chisels came to take pieces home.</p> <p>Later, people would rent out the hammers for a fee. The thud and chink sound of the hammers on the iron-reinforced concrete was heard for months. Most segments remained in place and it took more than two years to remove the vast majority of it, with an official demolition programme not starting until the summer of 1990.</p> <p>After much debate about the best way to mark the position of the former wall, a double row of cobblestones was discreetly set into public streets and pavements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b3e5702ad3fa73a7b18cc6bf2ead8f90be41ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b3e5702ad3fa73a7b18cc6bf2ead8f90be41ed8/0_0_3500_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists are seen in front of graffiti depicting former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev kissing his East German counterpart Erich Honecker along the East Side Gallery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists are seen in front of graffiti depicting former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev kissing his East German counterpart Erich Honecker along the East Side Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Is any of it still in place in Berlin?</h2> <p>Initially there was little appetite for keeping any of the wall in Berlin.

It is one of the most visited Berlin Wall sites, attracting about 3 million visitors a year. At 1,314 metres in length, it gives an impression of the physically imposing presence of the wall.</p> <p><strong>Mauerpark </strong>Now a popular green space with everyone from families to joggers, hosting a flea market and outdoor karaoke, this was formerly on the border strip, and not accessible by Berliners.</p> <p><strong>Schlesicher Busch watch tower </strong>Again, along the former border strip, the 10 metre high tower and a few metres of wall, is now set among clubs and parks, and a popular floating swimming pool on the River Spree.</p> <p><strong>Potsdamer Platz</strong><strong> </strong>After the last remaining original sections of wall were taken down in 2008, six sections were later re-erected next to the railway station. For some reason tourists have taken to pressing their coloured chewing gum into the wall, often impressing beer bottle tops into the gunge. It is a popular selfie site.</p> <p><strong>St Hedwig Cemetery</strong><strong> </strong>At St Hedwig Cemetery, is a 15 metre section of the last \u201cversion\u201d of the wall to be erected, in 1975 \u2013 known as \u201cBorder Wall 75\u2019. It runs along the Liesenbr\u00fccken, which crossed the border between west and east Berlin.</p> <p><strong>B\u00f6sebr\u00fccke \u2013 Bornholmer Strasse </strong>Immortalised in David Bowie\u2019s 2013 song Where Are We Now?

The open air exhibition here is arguably the most impressive, and a watch tower and a viewing platform help give a sense of the wall\u2019s scale.</p> <p><strong>Topography of Terror </strong>Next to the former SS central command site, <a href=\"http://www.topographie.de/\">now a museum</a>, there is a long stretch of the wall, about 200 metres long. Juxtaposed against the permanent exhibition on the murderous crimes of the SS, it is a particularly chilling reminder of the tumultuous history of the 20th century.</p> <p><strong>Checkpoint Charlie </strong>The most famous border crossing, controlled by US troops, Checkpoint Charlie is now a trashy Disneyfied \u201cmonument\u201d to the wall. But there is a small piece of the \u201chinterland\u201d wall remaining on the corner of Sch\u00fctzenstrasse.</p> <h2>What about the rest of the world?</h2> <p>Hundreds of wall segments have been <a href=\"http://the-wall-net.org/\">shipped to more than 50 countries</a>, mostly as commemoration pieces and acts of solidarity and friendship, but sometimes as auctioned pieces put on display in private estates.</p> <p>Wall pieces can now be found as far afield as the north-south Korean border, a train station in Monaco, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/las-vegas-bathroom-unexpected-places-to-see-berlin-wall-180953226/\">a urinal in Las Vegas</a> and a historic east-west summit venue in Reykjavik.</p> <p>Segments found their way overseas in interesting ways.

      "bodyText": "Why was the Berlin Wall erected? The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 to stop an exodus from the eastern, communist part of divided Germany to the more prosperous west. Between 1949 and 1961 more than 2.6 million East Germans, out of a total population of 17 million, had escaped. Many were skilled professionals and their loss was increasingly felt in the German Democratic Republic, or GDR, as it was called. With the country on the edge of economic and social collapse, the East German government therefore made the decision to close the entire border, and erected the wall overnight, on 13 August 1961. It was often referred to by eastern authorities as the anti-fascist protection barrier, to protect East Germans from the west. How was it built? The concrete barrier, complete with 300 guard towers at regular intervals, was 96 miles in length and 13 feet high, though to start with it comprised temporary barriers of barbed wire coils. The erection date of 13 August 1961 was deliberately chosen because it was a Sunday during the summer holidays. Over days and weeks the barbed wire was replaced with vertical concrete slabs reinforced with iron bars, and hollow blocks. Nothing was allowed to stand in the way of the wall. Houses on streets ,such as Bernauer Strasse, where the pavements were in the west, and the backs of the houses were in the east, became part of the border construction. The authorities simply ordered the bricking up of front entrances and windows. There are documented cases of people jumping from windows to avoid being locked into the east in their own homes. The wall itself was merely the outer boundary. Behind it was the so-called \u201cdeath strip\u201d, containing anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and other defence devices. Wherever the boundary ran through water, similar defence mechanisms were put in place to prevent anyone escaping. Did anyone manage to escape? At least 138 people lost their lives trying to escape across the wall, but an estimated 5,000 did manage to flee, although both figures are often disputed. Those who escaped hid in cars, sneaked through border points, crashed tanks through the fortifications, swam across the Teltow canal, paddled on a lilo over the river Spree, or crawled out via tunnels specially constructed by teams of dedicated volunteers including would-be escapers. Among the most spectacular was the circus tightrope walker who walked across a disused power line to the west, breaking both arms in the process. Most of those who tried their luck were males with an average age of 25. Why was it pulled down? An autumn of rising political protest in 1989 put pressure on the East German government to relax travel rules. In the early evening of 9 November, a government spokesman told a press conference that East Germans would be free to travel into West Germany. Asked when, he hesitated, and to the shock and amazement of the Germans present, added: \u201cimmediately\u201d. As soon as western media reported \u2013 erroneously \u2013 that the border had opened, people started gathering in large numbers at checkpoints on both sides. Overwhelmed by the numbers, passport checks were dropped by guards at around 11.30pm, by which time people were surging through. It wasn\u2019t until 11 and 12 November that the first pieces of wall were pulled down. A hole was made in the wall segment cutting off the Brandenburg Gate on 10 November, but then sealed off again by the East German authorities and the wall did not come down properly until 22 December. How was it removed? East German authorities initially began removing pieces of the wall using angle grinders, construction vehicles and cranes in the days after 9 November, to create more crossing points between east and west; thousands of Mauerspechte or \u201cwall peckers\u201d with hammers and chisels came to take pieces home. Later, people would rent out the hammers for a fee. The thud and chink sound of the hammers on the iron-reinforced concrete was heard for months. Most segments remained in place and it took more than two years to remove the vast majority of it, with an official demolition programme not starting until the summer of 1990. After much debate about the best way to mark the position of the former wall, a double row of cobblestones was discreetly set into public streets and pavements. Is any of it still in place in Berlin? Initially there was little appetite for keeping any of the wall in Berlin. Only years later, did people start to talk about the necessity of building an Erinnerungskultur or culture of memory, including bringing chunks back and setting them in new foundations. Sections still remain but there is said to be more of the wall on display in the US than in Berlin itself. Original segments can be found at: The East Side Gallery Artists from around the world painted this stretch, the largest existing piece of outer wall. It is one of the most visited Berlin Wall sites, attracting about 3 million visitors a year. At 1,314 metres in length, it gives an impression of the physically imposing presence of the wall. Mauerpark Now a popular green space with everyone from families to joggers, hosting a flea market and outdoor karaoke, this was formerly on the border strip, and not accessible by Berliners. Schlesicher Busch watch tower Again, along the former border strip, the 10 metre high tower and a few metres of wall, is now set among clubs and parks, and a popular floating swimming pool on the River Spree. Potsdamer Platz After the last remaining original sections of wall were taken down in 2008, six sections were later re-erected next to the railway station. For some reason tourists have taken to pressing their coloured chewing gum into the wall, often impressing beer bottle tops into the gunge. It is a popular selfie site. St Hedwig Cemetery At St Hedwig Cemetery, is a 15 metre section of the last \u201cversion\u201d of the wall to be erected, in 1975 \u2013 known as \u201cBorder Wall 75\u2019. It runs along the Liesenbr\u00fccken, which crossed the border between west and east Berlin. B\u00f6sebr\u00fccke \u2013 Bornholmer Strasse Immortalised in David Bowie\u2019s 2013 song Where Are We Now? (\u201cTwenty thousand people cross B\u00f6sebr\u00fccke, fingers are crossed, just in case\u201d) was the focus of world attention on the night of 9 November when it became the first crossing to open. Scores of Japanese cherry trees line the so-called Mauerweg or wall path, which contains a stretch of wall. Bernauerstrasse Berlin Wall Memorial This street was split by the wall, which ran down its southern side. The open air exhibition here is arguably the most impressive, and a watch tower and a viewing platform help give a sense of the wall\u2019s scale. Topography of Terror Next to the former SS central command site, now a museum, there is a long stretch of the wall, about 200 metres long. Juxtaposed against the permanent exhibition on the murderous crimes of the SS, it is a particularly chilling reminder of the tumultuous history of the 20th century. Checkpoint Charlie The most famous border crossing, controlled by US troops, Checkpoint Charlie is now a trashy Disneyfied \u201cmonument\u201d to the wall. But there is a small piece of the \u201chinterland\u201d wall remaining on the corner of Sch\u00fctzenstrasse. What about the rest of the world? Hundreds of wall segments have been shipped to more than 50 countries, mostly as commemoration pieces and acts of solidarity and friendship, but sometimes as auctioned pieces put on display in private estates. Wall pieces can now be found as far afield as the north-south Korean border, a train station in Monaco, a urinal in Las Vegas and a historic east-west summit venue in Reykjavik. Segments found their way overseas in interesting ways. One ended up in Kingston, Jamaica, after being gifted to Usain Bolt following his record-breaking 100 metre dash in 2009. Another popped up in Cape Town after being selected by Nelson Mandela. What happened to the rest of it? Large sections of the wall were crushed up and used for the building of motorways. Later, slabs of it were used in the building of homes. Sections still come up for sale at auction houses, with two pieces selling for well above the expected price of \u00a317,000 in Sussex in March. Those in doubt as to whether their chips and chunks are real can send their samples, for a fee, to a government agency \u2013 the Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Materialpr\u00fcfung (the federal office for material control) \u2013 for verification. Many are fake. Over the years pieces of the wall have been turned into everything from earrings to medical cures. There is a homeopathic remedy in which imbibing minuscule amounts is said to help everything from asthma to insomnia. What happened to the strip of land on which it sat? It has variously morphed into a bicycle path, a property boom (see the sea of glassy office blocks on Potsdamer Platz) and a legal row (around Griebnitzsee where villa owners refused public access to the lakeside path). Bernd Ingmar Gutberlet, who is something of a \u201cBerlin Wall archaeologist\u201d, says traces of the old wall are everywhere, if you know where to look. \u201cThey are often just small traces, but I\u2019ve found everything from little markings in the ground and ditches dug to impede escape tunnel builders, iron bars marking the border zone, the lamps which illuminated it, as well as evidence of the plenty of attempts made to disguise the wall so that people would literally forget it was there, and obstacles placed in the ground to stop vehicles from crossing.\u201d Among his finds was a wall segment now incorporated into the garden wall of a kindergarten. The further towards the outskirts of Berlin, he says, the greater the chance of finding evidence. \u201cI want to encourage other people to do the same,\u201d he adds. What commemorations are planned for this year\u2019s 30th anniversary? A week of festivities is planned in Berlin for the anniversary.

Mohammad, a Rohingya farmer who lost his leg fleeing violence in Myanmar, does not understand why. \u201cWe got a lot more before in terms of food and help, but now it feels like we are not getting enough support from the government and NGOs. We are also more restricted in our movement,\u201d he says, sitting on a bench outside his house, surrounded by discarded plastic bottles and rotting food. The Bangladeshi government has launched a crackdown in the camp, shutting shops run by refugees, blocking internet services, confiscating mobile phones, putting up fencing and setting an 8pm curfew, meaning people can\u2019t leave their homes at night. Bangladesh appears to be getting frustrated with its more than 1 million guests. Politics is turning and it has been reported that locals in Cox\u2019s Bazar are running out of patience. The government is finalising plans to move 100,000 refugees to an island in the Bay of Bengal and refugees wonder if it is all connected.

I support impeachment.\u201d</p> <p>On 30 September, Clinton tweeted: \u201cThe president is a corrupt human tornado.\u201d On 3 October, after Trump invited China to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden: \u201cSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Someone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count</p> <footer> <cite>Hillary Clinton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And on 8 October, when Trump suggested Clinton should enter the presidential race, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/1181645880983732224?lang=en\">she retorted:</a> \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.

      "bodyText": "A high-profile book tour. Countless TV interviews. Political combat with a Democratic primary candidate and Donald Trump. A year before the US presidential election, it looks like a campaign and it sounds like a campaign but it isn\u2019t a campaign. At least, not as far anyone knows. Yet a recent surge of activity by Hillary Clinton, combined with reports and columns suggesting the Democrats have not found the right candidate, have made a 2016 rematch a fun, speculative and potentially intriguing topic of Washington conversation. The sense that something strange is going on began a few weeks ago. A book is a traditional vehicle for a candidate. The former secretary of state launched The Book of Gutsy Women, co-written with daughter Chelsea, and embarked on a tour that included events, speeches and late-night TV appearances. Clinton, 72, whose narrow, devastating defeat by Trump was one of the greatest upsets in political history, has also become more prolific and pugnacious on Twitter. On 25 September, after revelations about Trump\u2019s call with the president of Ukraine, she wrote: \u201cThe president of the United States has betrayed our country \u2026 He is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free. I support impeachment.\u201d On 30 September, Clinton tweeted: \u201cThe president is a corrupt human tornado.\u201d On 3 October, after Trump invited China to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden: \u201cSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count.\u201d And on 8 October, when Trump suggested Clinton should enter the presidential race, she retorted: \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d Perhaps most oddly of all, Clinton also appeared to lash out at a fellow Democrat. In a podcast interview, she said Russia had \u201cgot their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate\u201d. It was widely assumed to be a reference to Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who mounted a furious response. This week the comeback tour continued when she appeared with the supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington. As she was introduced with husband Bill, Clinton gained longer and louder applause than the former president, whose affair with a White House intern has received fresh scrutiny in the #MeToo era. Unlike his wife, he has been remarkably silent during the Democratic primary. Candidates show little appetite for his endorsement. Addressing law students, Clinton appeared more humorous and at ease than on the campaign trail. The final question concerned whether the guests were rooting for the Washington Nationals in baseball\u2019s World Series. Bill interjected: \u201cI guess I should go first. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s not running for anything. Ever. She may or may not ever run for anything but I can\u2019t legally run for president again.\u201d The Nationals won the deciding game in Houston and Hillary managed to make a political point: \u201cWorld Series champs should get statehood.\u201d The following night, she even performed in a Halloween sketch for The Daily Show on Comedy Central, revisiting the horror of the electoral college that cost her victory in 2016. \u2018It\u2019s time to move past the Clintons\u2019 All this could be dismissed as no more than a smart way to promote a book, were it not coinciding with mild panic in Democratic ranks. The primary has attracted a record number of candidates and record diversity yet, many argue, failed to produce a John F Kennedy, a Bill Clinton or a Barack Obama, in terms of natural political gifts or charisma. \u201cNone of them are what you would call inspirational,\u201d said John Zogby, a Democratic pollster, noting that few percentage points separate leading contenders Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.

Fox News continues to run polls that include Hillary Clinton. A recent example puts her on 43% and Trump on 41%. Speculation has been fuelled by Biden\u2019s uncertain debate performances, tendency to trip over his own words and vulnerability in fundraising and polls. A New York Times Upshot/Siena College survey in late October found Warren in the lead in Iowa on 22%, followed by Sanders on 19%, Buttigieg on 18% and Biden fourth on 17%.

The group took \u00a3255,000 from 10,000 individual donations and has nearly equalled the \u00a3260,000 it raised across the entire general election period in 2017. The fundraising comes as the group, chaired by Jon Lansman, a socialist member of Labour\u2019s ruling body, launches a campaign strategy on Monday called Labour legends. This encourages people to take a week off work and campaign for the party full time as it gears up for the poll. Labour has already taken \u00a32m in donations in the first two quarters of this year. Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, Laura Parker, said the level of fundraising showed that the \u201csame people-powered movement\u201d from 2017 \u201cis back, bigger and more dedicated than ever\u201d. Staffers of the organisation, which has 40,000 members, took an average \u00a326 per donor in its fundraising drive and hit \u00a3100,000 in the first 12 hours. At some points in the past six days they took \u00a31,000 a minute. They said the money will be spent on their plan to \u201cmobilise thousands of activists\u201d and will pay for more help with training and organising the activists. The Labour Legends campaign will ask activists to get in touch to say how much time they can commit to the election, describe their skills and share their location, and they will then be given one-to-one support from a Momentum organiser. This could involve phone banking, canvassing, volunteering in a party office or even being embedded in a marginal constituency for a longer period. Parker said: \u201cBig business and the bank accounts of billionaires may be backing the Tories but we have something altogether better and stronger.

It\u2019s all delicious and all affordable, with prices starting at \u20ac2.70.

      "bodyText": "Isle of culture It must be hard for today\u2019s visitors to imagine the \u00cele de Nantes, in the middle of the Loire, as the industrial wasteland it became once shipbuilding finished in the 1980s. But from 2007, it has been transformed from virtual no-go area into cultural hub \u2013 giving the island back to the people and attracting tourists. The Machines de l\u2019Ile \u2013 gigantic, surreal steampunk animals and insects lumbering through the old shipyards \u2013 have been a big hit. For summer days, La Cantine du Voyage is a huge open-air cafe on Quai des Antilles, serving healthy meals (from \u20ac11, reopens April 2020). A huge warehouse, Le Hangar \u00e0 Bananes, where bananas were once brought to ripen, is now HAB, a brilliant contemporary art venue, while at night there are bars, concerts and clubbing. The belly of the city The place to meet locals is March\u00e9 de Talensac, the belly of the city, where everyone does their shopping. Inside the 1937 covered hall are specialities such as rum- and lemon-flavoured g\u00e2teau nantais, pungent cur\u00e9 nantais cheese, and fish straight from the trawler. Each weekend, farmers set up stalls outside with a cornucopia of organic vegetables, including a buzzing flea market covering the adjoining Place Viarme on Saturday. The market is ringed by friendly cafes and bars, such as Caf\u00e9 du Coin, or the stallholders\u2019 favourite, Caf\u00e9 du Matin, where you can bring your cheese, charcuterie or oysters and enjoy them with a chilled bottle of muscadet. \u2022 Tues-Sun 8am-1pm The finest art Visitors to France often forget that many of our provincial cities have art galleries with the same class of grand masters as at the Louvre and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, but without the queues or crowds. That is certainly the case in Nantes, where the magnificent Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Arts, established by Napoleon in 1801 and recently reopened after a six-year renovation, showcases a splendid collection, from Tintoretto and Rubens to Monet, Rodin, Kandinsky and Chagall. I oversee a host of ever-changing avant-garde events here under Le Voyage \u00e0 Nantes umbrella, but visitors can appreciate the museum\u2019s 10,000-strong collection all year round. \u2022 museedartsdenantes.nantesmetropole.fr Must-try muscadet Muscadet is the wine of Nantes, sold at every cafe and restaurant. It has been enjoying a revival as the focus has returned to quality over quantity and more organic wines. The vineyards begin just outside town, so either drive or join an organised trip through the countryside between Nantes and Clisson. Stop off at elegant 70-hectare waterside Ch\u00e2teau de Coing, run by mother-and-daughter vigneronnes, or make an appointment for a tasting with Michel Badouet, one of the leading lights in the natural wine movement. Book lunch at romantic La Cascade in Clisson (two-course lunch from \u20ac16.50), then end the afternoon with a couple of hours\u2019 lazy kayaking on the S\u00e8vre and Maine rivers. \u2022 levignobledenantes-tourisme.com Cruise the arty estuary The magnificent Loire estuary is a natural extension to the city that we have been opening up for locals and tourists. Three art biennales have left a heritage of 30 monumental sculptures and installations as the river nears the Atlantic. A cruise (\u20ac25pp) lasts almost three hours, the landscape changing from industrial sites to fishing villages, farms and wetlands filled with wildlife, to shipyards and containers at Saint-Nazaire. The artworks will take your breath away: a half-submerged house, a giant sea snake, wild animals climbing trees, a metal tower with a house on top (that can be rented). And at the end, a \u20ac5 train ride gets you back to Nantes in 30 minutes. Gilded arcade The flamboyant Passage Pommeraye \u2013 a precursor of modern shopping malls, built in 1843 \u2013 may not be as famous as its peers in Paris, Brussels and Milan, but for me Pommeraye is the most beautiful, with its elaborate staircase, statues and ornaments that climb up three floors, leading to a maze of gilded galleries. Shoppers can browse fashion showrooms, cake shops and jewellery or leather workshops. Just down the road from Pommeraye\u2019s ornate entrance, the lustrous belle \u00e9poque showroom of Chocolatier Gautier Debott\u00e9 (9 rue de la Fosse) is a paradise for chocolate lovers, and the talkative owner of Les Rigolettes Nantaises (18 rue de Verdun), St\u00e9phan Le Guiriec, will explain the century-old history of Nantes\u2019s famous fruit bonbons, inspired by Verdi\u2019s opera. \u2022 passagepommeraye.fr \u2018Unique\u2019 cultural centre The striking art nouveau tower of the old LU biscuit factory is a symbol of Nantes, but when production closed in the 1980s, it became a symbol of the city\u2019s decline. The vast building was abandoned until we created Le Lieu Unique in 2000 as an accessible and affordable cultural centre \u2013 a place for everyone in Nantes to have fun, and open daily from 11am to 2am or even 6am. It was a success from day one, offering a cheap and cheerful restaurant and waterside bar, a bookshop, a kindergarten, contemporary art exhibitions and ever-changing theatre, dance and music events, many of them free. There are even Turkish baths in the basement. It was a gamble, as this kind of venue hardly existed then in France. \u2022 Quai Ferdinand-Favre, lelieuunique.com Cr\u00eapes and bistronomie Nantes probably has more cr\u00eaperies than any town in Brittany (historically and culturally the city is Breton though it now belongs to the Pays de la Loire region), and visitors should experience a meal of savoury galettes de bl\u00e9 noir (buckwheat), then sweet wheatflour pancakes accompanied by local cider. Of the cr\u00eaperies, it\u2019s difficult to beat Heb-Ken. The Breton name means \u201ctake it as it is\u201d, so don\u2019t expect anything else apart from cr\u00eapes, all made with local ingredients such as ham, goat\u2019s cheese, strawberry jam, chocolate and the traditional beurre sal\u00e9 \u2013 just don\u2019t count the calories. It\u2019s all delicious and all affordable, with prices starting at \u20ac2.70. Nantes has some inventive new bistros too, run by young talented chefs. Restaurant Ici and Le Petit Boucot are especially good value for a gourmet lunch: both offering two courses for \u20ac18, comprising perhaps mackerel with heritage tomato carpaccio and line-fished hake on a bed of creamy aubergine. Riverside neighbourhood Just north-west of the 19th-century Jardin Botanique is Les Bordes de l\u2019Erdre, a tranquil neighbourhood bordering the river of the same name. The bustling town centre may be only 15 minutes\u2019 walk away, but this laid-back bohemian quartier is perfect for sunset aperitifs on the P\u00e9p\u00e9 Guinguette, a houseboat moored on the quay, or waterside bars such as Le Bateau-lavoir and Caf\u00e9 de l\u2019Ile. Rent an electric boat (\u20ac25 an hour) to explore the Erdre, where a stylised Japanese garden with pagoda is hidden away on the \u00cele de Versailles. For eating out, reserve at Le Broc\u00e9liande, where a \u20ac10 plat du jour could be a bistro classic of juicy lamb cutlets and garlicky potatoes or a vegetarian prune tagine. Perfect bar crawl With a lively student population of about 50,000 (out of a total of 670,000), the town centre is perfect for an evening bar crawl. Choose between specialist wine bars like Le Jeroboam (21 rue L\u00e9on Blum) and La Com\u00e9die des Vins (4 rue Suffren), where 20 to 30 wines are served by the glass, accompanied by plates of cheese and charcuterie, to Le Labo (19 rue L\u00e9on Blum), a rhumerie with dozens of rare aged and infused rums, or artisan ale bars such as Le Sur Mesure Beauregard (no website, 15 rue Beauregard). And now there is a genuine retro cocktail bar, the 19:33 Cocktail Experience (8 rue Voltaire), pretty much the first in Nantes, which serves exquisitely made tipples made by mixologist Martin Gouget, including some highly rated non-alcholic ones in a setting that resembles a carriage of the Orient Express. Where to stay The four-star Oceania H\u00f4tel de France Nantes (doubles from \u20ac110 room-only) is in a recently renovated 18th-century mansion in the historic centre. Its rooms veer between art deco and contemporary styles, some with balconies overlooking Place Graslin. Best time to visit There are cultural festivals all year round (Cinematography of Africa, Asia and Latin America kicks off on 19 November). The city is quite rainy (800mm a year \u2013 more than London) but mild. Getting there Trains from London to Nantes, with a change of station in Paris, take about six hours, from \u00a3110 return when booked in advance.

Via an entire episode dedicated to another character (Naomi Ackie\u2019s blank yet somehow remarkably expressive Bonnie), we are filled in on a whole new strand of relevant backstory and yet, deliciously, hardly any the wiser about where the series might be going. It is a beautifully observed little tale that pulls off the admirable trick of being desperately bleak while remaining very funny indeed. Phil Harrison Dispatches: Puppet Masters \u2013 The Men Who Really Run Britain 8pm, Channel 4 The provocateurs behind the current political chaos get an expos\u00e9.

PH Meet the Bears 9pm, BBC Two Big old grizzlies, furry Paddingtons and icy polars are the big draws in this ursine spectacular.

He told the Guardian he has told his frontbenchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/obey-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-warns-cabinet-dissenters\">to fall into line after divisions over Brexit </a>sparked a furious row over an election. \u201cI just said, \u2018look, this debate is now over. We\u2019ve done it, the party has now made its decision, and that\u2019s it; and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to campaign on\u2019,\u201d he said. Corbyn said he had made a unilateral decision to back Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for the 12 December vote, despite the vocal objections of several colleagues, including Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown. \u201cI put it to them quite clearly: I said, our objections are now gone. We are now supporting a general election \u2013 and everybody gulped. I didn\u2019t alert anybody in advance \u2013 it was my decision. On my own. I made that decision. And they gulped, and said \u2018Yes Jeremy\u2019.\u201d If elected, Labour plans to negotiate a new deal with Brussels \u2013 including a closer trading relationship \u2013 within three months, and put it to the public in a referendum within six.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile the People\u2019s Vote campaign will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/peoples-vote-to-use-1m-war-chest-to-back-pro-eu-candidates\">unleash its \u00a31m election war chest</a> this week despite a continuing internal feud, in part about whether it should back more Labour candidates. Despite half of its staff still being on strike, the campaign says it has received \u00a3200,000 in donations in the past two days.</p> \n<p>Overnight, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/03/trump-johnson-farage-come-together-general-election\">waded in to British politics</a>, saying he hoped Boris Johnson and Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, would come together on a united political platform. But Farage said on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/nigel-farage-says-he-will-not-stand-for-mp-in-general-election-brexit-party\">he would not run</a> for a seat in the general election and the PM has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/01/boris-johnson-dismisses-trump-and-farages-suggestion-of-pact-with-the-brexit-party-video\">rejected the suggestion</a> from both that he should work with the Brexit party.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Grace Millane </strong>\u2013 The man accused of killing the British backpacker in New Zealand nearly a year ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/03/grace-millane-british-backpackers-trial-to-begin-in-auckland\">has re-entered his not-guilty plea</a> at the start of his trial. The name of the 27-year-old New Zealand man has been suppressed by the court. The judge said members of the 12-person jury had a duty to \u201cput feelings of sympathy and prejudice to one side and approach their task coolly and dispassionately\u201d. Millane, 21, disappeared from central Auckland on 1 December and her body was found in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/11/grace-millane-nz-detectives-search-for-shovel-in-investigation\"> </a>bushland in west Auckland a week later.

The company said he had demonstrated poor judgement as managers are forbidden from having romantic relationships with direct or indirect employees.

The research looked at the genetic and gut microbiome data of about 4,000 people and whether there were genetic variants linked to the presence of certain types of bacteria. The results showed those whose genes increased the likelihood of having a type of <em>Bacteroidales</em> bacteria had a 2-15% increased risk of the disease.

Lawyers for Sarah Ward, who lives in Poole, will challenge a public space protection order in the town centre which prohibits obstructing doorways, sitting with a receptacle \u201cfor the purpose of begging\u201d and other behaviour associated with homelessness. People found to have violated the order are liable to a \u00a3100 spot fine, which can rise to \u00a31,000 if left unpaid, and receive a summary conviction. The case, to be heard in 2020, could have implications for a rising number of councils that have obtained the power to issue fines in England and Wales.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Better latte than never </strong>\u2013 The first compostable one-cup coffee pods from a major manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/04/better-latte-than-never-compostable-coffee-pods-go-on-sale\">will go on sale this week</a> in a battle to stop the 20bn pods used every year around the world from ending up in landfill.

News spread across his neighbourhood that there was a mad gunman on the loose. The children scattered to find safety but when Flea, real name Michael Peter Balzary, returned home, he realised the gunman was his stepfather. \u201cHe was the lunatic they were all talking about,\u201d Flea recalled. \u201cIt was terrifying and shameful.\u201d But it reflected a violent and sometimes terrifying childhood of drugs and petty crime, triggered in some part by the separation of his parents and his musician stepfather\u2019s dangerous lifestyle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c2ee4ebd77b02276d396b460de9d8105921c35e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c2ee4ebd77b02276d396b460de9d8105921c35e/0_54_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flea performing in Rio in October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flea performing in Rio in October 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L\u00e9o Corr\u00eaa/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/04/flea-red-hot-chili-peppers-interview-memoir\">Flea\u2019s memoir, Acid for the Children</a>, he tells of smoking joints at 12, roaming the streets with no one watching; feeling abandoned by his father.

However dysfunctional his stepfather\u2019s life, it exposed him to music: \u201cWhen I saw him and his musician buddies set up in the living room to play bebop with such emotion and physicality, it changed my life forever,\u201d he said. Ultimately, Flea said, he found everything about writing the book hard. \u201cI went through so much to get it to be honest about what shaped me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about: a yearning to know who I am.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Sport</h2> \n<p>Lewis Hamilton said 2019 has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/lewis-hamilton-sixth-f1-world-title-us-grand-prix-bottas\">his best and toughest season</a> after he secured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/dominant-lewis-hamilton-laps-of-honour-us-grand-prix\">his sixth world title</a> on Sunday with a second-place finish in the United States Grand Prix.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Labour says campaign must be fought on social justice and climate crisis Good morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke. Jeremy Corbyn has told his fractious shadow cabinet \u201cthe debate is over\u201d on Brexit, as he seeks to stamp his authority on the general election campaign and shift the focus to social justice and the climate emergency. He told the Guardian he has told his frontbenchers to fall into line after divisions over Brexit sparked a furious row over an election. \u201cI just said, \u2018look, this debate is now over. We\u2019ve done it, the party has now made its decision, and that\u2019s it; and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to campaign on\u2019,\u201d he said. Corbyn said he had made a unilateral decision to back Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for the 12 December vote, despite the vocal objections of several colleagues, including Labour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown. \u201cI put it to them quite clearly: I said, our objections are now gone. We are now supporting a general election \u2013 and everybody gulped. I didn\u2019t alert anybody in advance \u2013 it was my decision. On my own. I made that decision. And they gulped, and said \u2018Yes Jeremy\u2019.\u201d If elected, Labour plans to negotiate a new deal with Brussels \u2013 including a closer trading relationship \u2013 within three months, and put it to the public in a referendum within six. Meanwhile the People\u2019s Vote campaign will unleash its \u00a31m election war chest this week despite a continuing internal feud, in part about whether it should back more Labour candidates. Despite half of its staff still being on strike, the campaign says it has received \u00a3200,000 in donations in the past two days. Overnight, President Trump waded in to British politics, saying he hoped Boris Johnson and Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, would come together on a united political platform. But Farage said on Sunday he would not run for a seat in the general election and the PM has rejected the suggestion from both that he should work with the Brexit party. * * * Grace Millane \u2013 The man accused of killing the British backpacker in New Zealand nearly a year ago has re-entered his not-guilty plea at the start of his trial. The name of the 27-year-old New Zealand man has been suppressed by the court. The judge said members of the 12-person jury had a duty to \u201cput feelings of sympathy and prejudice to one side and approach their task coolly and dispassionately\u201d. Millane, 21, disappeared from central Auckland on 1 December and her body was found in bushland in west Auckland a week later. The death shocked New Zealand and prompted an outpouring of public grief. * * * \u2018Time to move on\u2019 \u2013 The British-born CEO of McDonald\u2019s, Steve Easterbrook, has left the company after violating company policy by engaging in a consensual relationship with an employee. The company said he had demonstrated poor judgement as managers are forbidden from having romantic relationships with direct or indirect employees. In an email to staff, Easterbrook acknowledged the relationship and said it was a mistake: \u201cGiven the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.\u201d * * * Bowel cancer \u2013 The presence of certain bacteria may increase risk of the disease, a new study has suggested. The research looked at the genetic and gut microbiome data of about 4,000 people and whether there were genetic variants linked to the presence of certain types of bacteria. The results showed those whose genes increased the likelihood of having a type of Bacteroidales bacteria had a 2-15% increased risk of the disease. The team said the findings backed up previous research suggesting bacteria are more common in those with bowel cancer. * * * \u2018Begging fines\u2019 \u2013 A landmark high court case will consider whether fines for begging, loitering and leaving bedding in doorways unfairly targets homeless people, after the fundraising campaign for legal costs reached its target. Lawyers for Sarah Ward, who lives in Poole, will challenge a public space protection order in the town centre which prohibits obstructing doorways, sitting with a receptacle \u201cfor the purpose of begging\u201d and other behaviour associated with homelessness. People found to have violated the order are liable to a \u00a3100 spot fine, which can rise to \u00a31,000 if left unpaid, and receive a summary conviction. The case, to be heard in 2020, could have implications for a rising number of councils that have obtained the power to issue fines in England and Wales. * * * Better latte than never \u2013 The first compostable one-cup coffee pods from a major manufacturer will go on sale this week in a battle to stop the 20bn pods used every year around the world from ending up in landfill. The Italian espresso giant Lavazza is aiming to replace its entire range of home use capsules with new eco-friendly ones \u2013 at the same retail price \u2013 by the end of the year. It\u2019s thought that 95m cups of coffee are drunk in the UK every day, but the single-serve pods typically end up in landfill where they can take take up to 500 years to break down. Today in Focus podcast \u2013 David Attenborough: the making of a British icon Patrick Barkham joins Anushka Asthana to chart the rise of one of Britain\u2019s best-loved personalities: the natural history broadcaster David Attenborough. Plus: Gaby Hinsliff on women and the myth of \u201clikability\u201d. Lunchtime read \u2013 Drugs, violence, rebellion: Flea\u2019s troubled life before the Chili Peppers At 13, the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist had a terrifying experience at Halloween. News spread across his neighbourhood that there was a mad gunman on the loose. The children scattered to find safety but when Flea, real name Michael Peter Balzary, returned home, he realised the gunman was his stepfather. \u201cHe was the lunatic they were all talking about,\u201d Flea recalled. \u201cIt was terrifying and shameful.\u201d But it reflected a violent and sometimes terrifying childhood of drugs and petty crime, triggered in some part by the separation of his parents and his musician stepfather\u2019s dangerous lifestyle. In Flea\u2019s memoir, Acid for the Children, he tells of smoking joints at 12, roaming the streets with no one watching; feeling abandoned by his father. Flea writes that he had \u201can undying sense that something was wrong with me, that everyone else is clued into a group consciousness from which I am excluded\u201d. However dysfunctional his stepfather\u2019s life, it exposed him to music: \u201cWhen I saw him and his musician buddies set up in the living room to play bebop with such emotion and physicality, it changed my life forever,\u201d he said. Ultimately, Flea said, he found everything about writing the book hard. \u201cI went through so much to get it to be honest about what shaped me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about: a yearning to know who I am.\u201d Sport Lewis Hamilton said 2019 has been his best and toughest season after he secured his sixth world title on Sunday with a second-place finish in the United States Grand Prix. Eddie Jones is planning an England overhaul after their Rugby World Cup final defeat by South Africa, declaring the end of an era for his current team. Francois Pienaar, South Africa\u2019s 1995 World Cup-winning captain, has hailed the Springboks\u2019 latest success as bigger than the one achieved by his team 24 years ago. The England centre Emily Scarratt has been crowned the women\u2019s world player of the year. Cenk Tosun saved a point for Everton with an injury-time header against Tottenham after Andr\u00e9 Gomes was carried off with a serious leg injury. Leicester won 2-0 at Crystal Palace to move into third, thanks to goals from Caglar Soyuncu and Jamie Vardy. World Cup Golden Boot winner Ellen White scored her first goal in a Manchester City shirt, while neighbours United cantered to a 3-0 win at Everton in the Women\u2019s League Cup. Mario Balotelli has expressed his gratitude for the support he received in the wake of racist abuse which saw him set to walk off at Verona. And world No 1 Ashleigh Barty showed emphatically just how far she has come this year by outclassing Elina Svitolina to win the WTA Finals and its $4.42m (\u00a33.42m) cheque, the biggest prize money in tennis history. Business Government spending is on course to return to levels last seen in the 1970s, according to a report that found both Tory and Labour plans will significantly increase the share of GDP taken up by the state over the next parliament. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said spending sprees aimed at ending austerity and increasing public investment were central to the plans of both major parties and would drive spending above the average for the 20 years up to the 2008 financial crash of 37.4% of GDP. The pound is buying \u20ac1.158 and and $1.294.

Lavazza says its new biopolymer-based Eco Caps break down into compost in as little as six months when combined with food waste for council collection. Provided local authority rules allow it, used capsules could be thrown in the food waste bin. However, where this is unavailable, Lavazza has teamed up with waste collection service TerraCycle to establish a network of public access drop-off points for consumers to dispose of capsules which need to be industrially composted. David Rogers, managing director of Lavazza UK, said: \u201cThis major investment confirms our commitment to excellence and sustainable development.\u201d Its new research, also published on Monday, shows that more than a third of people in the UK admit to throwing their used coffee capsules into the bin because they don\u2019t know how to properly dispose of them. Consumers also feel generally confused about what can and cannot be recycled, with 72% admitting to feeling overwhelmed when trying to understand the various recycling symbols. The coffee company Nespresso \u2013 part of the Swiss multinational Nestl\u00e9 \u2013 encourages consumers to send back their used aluminium capsules in the UK in special bags while it has also trialled council collection schemes. Most compostable or biodegradable pods on the market have been launched by small, niche brands. A separate range of 100% compostable pods made from sugar cane and paper pulp, made by online retailer Halo, can be put into home compost or food bins. Halo co-founder Richard Hardwick said: \u201cThe coffee revolution has happened and one of the key challenges the industry now faces is the millions of tonnes of waste created as a result. \u201cAluminium and plastic coffee capsules are difficult to recycle so most of them end up in the bin, and that\u2019s why up to 75% are currently being sent to landfill every minute. Most people don\u2019t understand the irreversible damage these coffee capsules are inflicting on the planet.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In his new memoir, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea recalls a Halloween night of genuine horror. At 13, he was trick-or-treating with friends when word spread through his neighborhood that a madman was firing a gun randomly in the street. The terrified kids scattered to find safety in their homes, but when Flea approached his parents\u2019 house he noticed that all the front windows had been blown out and debris strewn all over the lawn. Once inside, he found his step-father, Walter, with blood smeared over his face and torso, a smoking pistol dangling by his side. \u201cHe was the lunatic they were all talking about,\u201d Flea recalled. \u201cIt was terrifying and shameful.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/31/rain-phoenix-on-her-new-album-river-phoenix-guiding-light\">Rain Phoenix on her new album River: 'My brother has been my guiding light'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And it wasn\u2019t the first time something like that happened. \u201cWalter would get drunk and something would trigger him and he would freak out and smash everything in the house,\u201d Flea said. \u201cAt times, a gun would come out.\u201d</p> <p>After the Halloween incident, the cops came and arrested Walter. After he went through the system and returned home, he apologized to Flea and his mom profusely. \u201cAnd then,\u201d said Flea, \u201cthe pattern would repeat.\u201d</p> <p>Making sense of events like this wound up driving nearly the entire narrative of Flea\u2019s harrowing \u2013 but, at times also, hilarious \u2013 memoir, titled Acid for the Children. It\u2019s overwhelmingly focused on his formative years, broken by short fast-forwards to his time with the Chili Peppers. Some of the Peppers\u2019 vignettes deal with the band\u2019s own traumas, including Flea\u2019s guilt over the heroin-related death of the band\u2019s early guitarist Hillel Slovak at just 26. But the main part of the book ends with their very first live show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90f0491f51b204a7beac05797fdb48e5f46207a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90f0491f51b204a7beac05797fdb48e5f46207a6/0_0_2066_2978/694.jpg\" alt=\"Flea in his younger years\" width=\"694\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flea in his younger years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the author</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that this was Flea\u2019s original game plan. \u201cI thought I would just write about the band because who would be arrogant enough to think anyone would care about my childhood?\u201d he said.</p> <p>But, given the amount of violence, drug use and sometimes useful adventure in his past, this clearly wasn\u2019t just any childhood. \u201cEventually, I became entranced with the idea of getting under the narrative, to find out the \u2018why\u2019 of my early life,\u201d he said.</p> <p>To capture the fractured nature of it, Flea divided his book into brief, blunt chapters, in the process creating a rhythm for his prose as curt and distinct as his bass playing. The first part of the story centers on impressionistic perceptions from his first four years of life in Melbourne, Australia, where he was born Michael Peter Balzary. When he was five, his father\u2019s work necessitated the family move to Rye, a northern suburb of New York City. By the time he was seven, Flea\u2019s parents divorced and his father moved back to Australia, causing the boy to feel abandoned and unmoored. Things became even more unstable when his mother remarried to a troubled jazz musician, Walter Urban Jr (now deceased). Immediately, Walter moved the family (including Flea\u2019s older sister, Karyn) to his parents\u2019 house where they lived together in the basement. Though Flea paints his stepfather as an unkempt, odd and violent man, he believes his mother was drawn to his bohemian sensibility. \u201cShe had grown up in this really straight Australia, where things went by the rules of the 1950s,\u201d he said. By contrast, \u201cWalter did drugs and played jazz and had all kinds of ethnicities hanging out. It was a chance for her to go into New York City and liberate herself.\u201d</p> <p>After a few wild years on the east coast, the family relocated to the gnarlier parts of Hollywood and, by 11, a barely supervised Flea began to smoke pot every day. The cover of the book boasts a picture of him at 12 smoking a joint. By that time, Flea had acquired his nickname, based on his fidgety nature and diminutive stature. The latter contributed to an already serious inferiority complex. From early childhood, Flea writes that he had \u201can undying sense that something was wrong with me, that everyone else is clued into a group consciousness from which I am excluded\u201d.</p> <p>This belief, along with his unstructured home life, led him to yearn for a brotherhood of friends to serve as a surrogate family. Most of the kids he found were fellow scamps who enabled his knack for getting into scrapes, which ranged from petty theft to crashing cars. Drugs became another bond. Flea began shooting speed regularly, which didn\u2019t help his attention deficit disorder tendencies or his emotional advancement.

      "bodyText": "In his new memoir, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea recalls a Halloween night of genuine horror. At 13, he was trick-or-treating with friends when word spread through his neighborhood that a madman was firing a gun randomly in the street. The terrified kids scattered to find safety in their homes, but when Flea approached his parents\u2019 house he noticed that all the front windows had been blown out and debris strewn all over the lawn. Once inside, he found his step-father, Walter, with blood smeared over his face and torso, a smoking pistol dangling by his side. \u201cHe was the lunatic they were all talking about,\u201d Flea recalled. \u201cIt was terrifying and shameful.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t the first time something like that happened. \u201cWalter would get drunk and something would trigger him and he would freak out and smash everything in the house,\u201d Flea said. \u201cAt times, a gun would come out.\u201d After the Halloween incident, the cops came and arrested Walter. After he went through the system and returned home, he apologized to Flea and his mom profusely. \u201cAnd then,\u201d said Flea, \u201cthe pattern would repeat.\u201d Making sense of events like this wound up driving nearly the entire narrative of Flea\u2019s harrowing \u2013 but, at times also, hilarious \u2013 memoir, titled Acid for the Children. It\u2019s overwhelmingly focused on his formative years, broken by short fast-forwards to his time with the Chili Peppers. Some of the Peppers\u2019 vignettes deal with the band\u2019s own traumas, including Flea\u2019s guilt over the heroin-related death of the band\u2019s early guitarist Hillel Slovak at just 26. But the main part of the book ends with their very first live show. Not that this was Flea\u2019s original game plan. \u201cI thought I would just write about the band because who would be arrogant enough to think anyone would care about my childhood?\u201d he said. But, given the amount of violence, drug use and sometimes useful adventure in his past, this clearly wasn\u2019t just any childhood. \u201cEventually, I became entranced with the idea of getting under the narrative, to find out the \u2018why\u2019 of my early life,\u201d he said. To capture the fractured nature of it, Flea divided his book into brief, blunt chapters, in the process creating a rhythm for his prose as curt and distinct as his bass playing. The first part of the story centers on impressionistic perceptions from his first four years of life in Melbourne, Australia, where he was born Michael Peter Balzary. When he was five, his father\u2019s work necessitated the family move to Rye, a northern suburb of New York City. By the time he was seven, Flea\u2019s parents divorced and his father moved back to Australia, causing the boy to feel abandoned and unmoored. Things became even more unstable when his mother remarried to a troubled jazz musician, Walter Urban Jr (now deceased). Immediately, Walter moved the family (including Flea\u2019s older sister, Karyn) to his parents\u2019 house where they lived together in the basement. Though Flea paints his stepfather as an unkempt, odd and violent man, he believes his mother was drawn to his bohemian sensibility. \u201cShe had grown up in this really straight Australia, where things went by the rules of the 1950s,\u201d he said. By contrast, \u201cWalter did drugs and played jazz and had all kinds of ethnicities hanging out. It was a chance for her to go into New York City and liberate herself.\u201d After a few wild years on the east coast, the family relocated to the gnarlier parts of Hollywood and, by 11, a barely supervised Flea began to smoke pot every day. The cover of the book boasts a picture of him at 12 smoking a joint. By that time, Flea had acquired his nickname, based on his fidgety nature and diminutive stature. The latter contributed to an already serious inferiority complex. From early childhood, Flea writes that he had \u201can undying sense that something was wrong with me, that everyone else is clued into a group consciousness from which I am excluded\u201d. This belief, along with his unstructured home life, led him to yearn for a brotherhood of friends to serve as a surrogate family. Most of the kids he found were fellow scamps who enabled his knack for getting into scrapes, which ranged from petty theft to crashing cars. Drugs became another bond. Flea began shooting speed regularly, which didn\u2019t help his attention deficit disorder tendencies or his emotional advancement. On the other hand, he believes he got a lot out of his experiments with hallucinogens. One chapter begins with the line \u201cLSD was good to me\u201d. \u201cFor someone like me, who was running crazy in the street, the drug got me to access my subconscious, to develop introspection,\u201d he said. Flea admits he overperformed on that front, a tendency exacerbated by his desire to escape the violence at home. At the same time, his stepfather\u2019s role as a serious musician and artist had a positive effect on him, providing a living example of the power and beauty of music. \u201cWhen I saw him and his musician buddies set up in the living room to play bebop with such emotion and physicality, it changed my life forever,\u201d he said. The combination of the muscularity of music and Flea\u2019s wild character contributed to his later emphasis on nudity and primitivism in the Chili Peppers\u2019 presentation. \u201cI grew up running around naked,\u201d said Flea. \u201cThere\u2019s a freedom inherent in it, a rebelliousness, that I find beautiful.\u201d The band\u2019s eager display of their bodies gave them a homoerotic frisson from the start. But for Flea there was a serious message behind it, rooted in his past. In a chapter of the book titled Men Don\u2019t Kiss Men he recalls how hurt he felt at the age of six when his birth father admonished him for wanting a kiss. It seeded a will in him to rebel against the restrictive nature of male identity. Early in their career, the Chili Peppers did so in a daring way by posing for the Los Angeles-based gay porn magazine In Touch. \u201cI felt honored that they wanted us in the magazine,\u201d Flea said. \u201cThe gay community in Los Angeles were the first ones to really embrace the Chili Peppers.\u201d In conversation, Flea revealed that he had gay experiences of his own growing up, episodes he wrote about at length in an early version of the book. But, he wound up taking all that out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be sensationalized,\u201d he explained. \u201cTo me, it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I was experimenting and it turns out, \u2018hey, I\u2019m not gay\u2019. So, it\u2019s not really my story.\u201d More central to Flea\u2019s story is his deep, and complicated, relationship with the Chili Peppers\u2019 singer, Anthony Kiedis. In the book, he calls Anthony \u201cthe missing link I never considered\u201d. \u201cHe was unlike anyone I had ever met,\u201d Flea said. \u201cAmong my friends, I was the guy who was always trying to do something that would freak people out.

      "body": "<p>Earlier this year, the actor John Cleese, now 80, repeated his claim: \u201cLondon is no longer an English city.\u201d In 2011, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-hit-back-as-cleese-says-city-is-no-longer-english-6439482.html\" title=\"\">he had told an Australian audience</a>: \u201cI love having different cultures around, but when the parent culture kind of dissipates you\u2019re left thinking: \u2018Well, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d He had <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/john-cleese-englishness-white-london-immigration-empire\" title=\"\">previously declared</a>: \u201cI love being down in Bath because it feels like the England that I grew up in.\u201d</p> <p>In May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/may/29/john-cleese-criticised-for-saying-london-is-no-longer-an-english-city\" title=\"\">he doubled down</a>, insisting his foreign friends felt the same way, \u201cso there must be some truth in it\u201d, and describing London (wrongly) as \u201cthe UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU\u201d.</p> <p>We will leave aside the fact that Cleese lives in the Caribbean. His meaning was clear: in a familiar, wilful and tiresome confusion of race and place, he was disoriented by the multiracial and multicultural nature of Britain\u2019s capital.</p> <p>For his own peace of mind and ossified sense of nostalgia, Cleese should steer clear of Tate Britain for a while. Because next week, the artist and film-maker Steve McQueen\u2019s Year 3 will open there \u2013 a display of school photographs from almost two-thirds of London\u2019s primaries. There they stand: more than 3,000 photographs, showing about 76,000 children. The project\u2019s photographers have captured the full range of the capital\u2019s seven- and eight-year-old citizenry: from state, private, religious and special education schools, uniformed, non-uniformed, daffy grins, big ears, long braids, scuffed shoes, ironed headscarves and wild afros.</p> <p>There is a transfixing power to these pictures when laid out together. You are struck by the sheer size of the capital, its diversity in every manner \u2013 the full force of its vast and vital nature. It is hard to see how one could look at these kids, standing in rows, wide-eyed and wide-smiled, and come away with a sense of moral panic. But you know it is out there in this moment of parochial anxiety, dislocation and division. In a city with virtually the same number of non-white people as white British people (according to the last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/11/2011-census-data-key-points\" title=\"\">census, in 2011</a>, London was home to 45% who described themselves as \u201cwhite British\u201d, as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/regional-ethnic-diversity/latest\" title=\"\">40% who did not describe themselves as white</a> at all), it provides a snapshot not just of the present, but of a future that would leave the likes of Cleese thinking: \u201cWell, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c3413254c78ba1669920ac08d8f68fcfebfa667\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c3413254c78ba1669920ac08d8f68fcfebfa667/0_224_3484_2090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Year 3 at a state primary in east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Year 3 at a state primary in east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9Steve McQueen &amp; Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a sense, that is precisely the effect McQueen, 50, wants the exhibition to have, even if he takes visitors on a different journey from Cleese\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a telescope and microscope situation,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re looking through a telescope and seeing all these people, but it\u2019s also reflecting back on you, making you think: \u2018Who am I in all of this?\u2019 It\u2019s exciting and dynamic. I hope the people and the powers that be are aware of that potential and reap from it. I find it very inspiring. The future is in those pictures. There\u2019s going to be the criminal, the banker and the person who may not make it to 21. They are all there.\u201d</p> <p>Getting them there was no small feat. \u201cWe spent a year and a half trying to work out how to do it,\u201d says Clarrie Wallis, the exhibition\u2019s curator. \u201cVery early on it became clear that you couldn\u2019t just do a callout to all the schools in London. There were issues like safeguarding that came into play. We had to make sure we had in place something that was robust and appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>They needed the consent of every child\u2019s parent or guardian. Some schools had the will but not the wherewithal. As fantastic an opportunity as it was, this was one more demand on a system that was understaffed and overstretched. \u201cSome schools felt they didn\u2019t have the time or the capacity,\u201d says Wallis. \u201cA lot of them are under-resourced anyway and the arts programmes get squeezed.\u201d</p> <p>So the Tate had to work out an \u201coffer\u201d, providing arts-based workshops with the help of A New Direction, an organisation that specialises in creative work within schools. Facilitators and photographers went into schools to do various exercises with children that related to the broader project.</p> <p>Every year 3 class that took part has been invited to come and see its photograph in the exhibition. Again, this is no small undertaking, involving everything from employing greeters to usher the children around, including a small tour of the Tate, to portable buildings in the car park where they can eat their lunch. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to champion why creativity matters,\u201d says Wallis. \u201cThe hope is that they come, they\u2019ll fall in love with us and want to come back again.\u201d When the exhibition is over the schools will be given the framed photographs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0d8e9dc974d9bb40b613c80d272ac12919016e03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d8e9dc974d9bb40b613c80d272ac12919016e03/0_0_5448_3644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alpha preparatory independent school in Harrow, north-west London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alpha preparatory independent school in Harrow, north-west London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9Steve McQueen &amp; Tate</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is something about the simplicity of the concept that makes the exhibition mesmerising. Row upon row of classic school photographs, all taken with the same format. The teacher in the centre, set back slightly into the class \u2013 embedded into their brood \u2013 with the teaching assistants towards the back and to the side. Where the class is larger, the front row sits on the floor cross-legged, the second row is on chairs and all the rest are standing up. \u201cWe had the photographers all stand a certain distance away, to allow for the variation in the size of classes,\u201d explains Wallis, pointing out that while some classes could go up to 34 children, others, particularly in schools for children with special educational needs, might number eight or nine. However big or small the class, all the children are shown at roughly the same size. All were shot with natural light.</p> <p>The effect of this rigorous consistency in form is to draw out the difference in content. The pictures were taken wherever the school chose to accommodate them \u2013 in gyms and classrooms, under basketball nets, with backdrops of climbing bars, the Virgin Mary, blackboards and artwork.

There\u2019s conformity. But there\u2019s individualism, too. Each one is an individual. They\u2019re trying to make you conform. But, at the same time, there\u2019s still that spark there, that individuality, that questioning.\u201d</p> <p>This tension, between the energy of the child at this stage of their development and the demands of the system, at this point in the process, McQueen finds particularly intriguing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this moment, when things have almost become regimented, just before they have to conform. It\u2019s not that you lose them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a whirlwind and they have to stand up in it. And the ones that can\u2019t stand up often get chopped down and disregarded. And at the same time those that can also try to sustain a bit of themselves within that system. So you see the potential and possibility in these kids\u2019 lives.\u201d</p> <p>The initial idea, he says, came from his own experience of primary school, which he remembers as a time of wonder, boundless energy and fearless freedom. \u201cIt was incredible. The friends I had, and the potential, the possibilities. Playing, drawing, the kinship of friends, experimenting, getting wet in the rain. I had the chance to daydream.

You scan that class, then another, then another, thinking of how unlike your own school they are, or how similar, and before long you are reaching back to yourself at that age. To how big things were and how small your world was. Trying to remember who your teacher was, or your best friend, or your arch-enemy.

She would hit the roof, pointing out how my dishevelment shamed her, sigh, and then say, \u201cI like this one\u201d and remark on my dimples or say I had my father\u2019s smile.

He has spent much of the last two decades in Amsterdam, but loves London. \u201cI need this city because it\u2019s given me so much,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s given me my belief system. It\u2019s given me my viewpoint on life.\u201d</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t always loved him back. As McQueen progressed through the secondary system during the early 80s, he felt the walls closing, seeking to bury that sense of possibility under the dead weight of institutional racism. Simultaneously laughing and shaking his head, he mentions Tam Joseph\u2019s painting UK School Report, which consists of three portraits side by side. The first, of a black youth in school blazer and tie, with a neat afro, is captioned: \u201cGood at Sports\u201d; the second youth is funkier, slightly older with twists and an earring, and reads: \u201cLikes music.\u201d The last has long locks and an open shirt above the words: \u201cNeeds surveillance.\u201d \u201cBy the time I got into high school things had definitely changed,\u201d says McQueen.</p> <p>This is partly why he chose year 3.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this year, the actor John Cleese, now 80, repeated his claim: \u201cLondon is no longer an English city.\u201d In 2011, he had told an Australian audience: \u201cI love having different cultures around, but when the parent culture kind of dissipates you\u2019re left thinking: \u2018Well, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d He had previously declared: \u201cI love being down in Bath because it feels like the England that I grew up in.\u201d In May, he doubled down, insisting his foreign friends felt the same way, \u201cso there must be some truth in it\u201d, and describing London (wrongly) as \u201cthe UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU\u201d. We will leave aside the fact that Cleese lives in the Caribbean. His meaning was clear: in a familiar, wilful and tiresome confusion of race and place, he was disoriented by the multiracial and multicultural nature of Britain\u2019s capital. For his own peace of mind and ossified sense of nostalgia, Cleese should steer clear of Tate Britain for a while. Because next week, the artist and film-maker Steve McQueen\u2019s Year 3 will open there \u2013 a display of school photographs from almost two-thirds of London\u2019s primaries. There they stand: more than 3,000 photographs, showing about 76,000 children. The project\u2019s photographers have captured the full range of the capital\u2019s seven- and eight-year-old citizenry: from state, private, religious and special education schools, uniformed, non-uniformed, daffy grins, big ears, long braids, scuffed shoes, ironed headscarves and wild afros. There is a transfixing power to these pictures when laid out together. You are struck by the sheer size of the capital, its diversity in every manner \u2013 the full force of its vast and vital nature. It is hard to see how one could look at these kids, standing in rows, wide-eyed and wide-smiled, and come away with a sense of moral panic. But you know it is out there in this moment of parochial anxiety, dislocation and division. In a city with virtually the same number of non-white people as white British people (according to the last census, in 2011, London was home to 45% who described themselves as \u201cwhite British\u201d, as opposed to 40% who did not describe themselves as white at all), it provides a snapshot not just of the present, but of a future that would leave the likes of Cleese thinking: \u201cWell, what\u2019s going on?\u201d In a sense, that is precisely the effect McQueen, 50, wants the exhibition to have, even if he takes visitors on a different journey from Cleese\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a telescope and microscope situation,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re looking through a telescope and seeing all these people, but it\u2019s also reflecting back on you, making you think: \u2018Who am I in all of this?\u2019 It\u2019s exciting and dynamic. I hope the people and the powers that be are aware of that potential and reap from it. I find it very inspiring. The future is in those pictures. There\u2019s going to be the criminal, the banker and the person who may not make it to 21. They are all there.\u201d Getting them there was no small feat. \u201cWe spent a year and a half trying to work out how to do it,\u201d says Clarrie Wallis, the exhibition\u2019s curator. \u201cVery early on it became clear that you couldn\u2019t just do a callout to all the schools in London. There were issues like safeguarding that came into play. We had to make sure we had in place something that was robust and appropriate.\u201d They needed the consent of every child\u2019s parent or guardian. Some schools had the will but not the wherewithal. As fantastic an opportunity as it was, this was one more demand on a system that was understaffed and overstretched. \u201cSome schools felt they didn\u2019t have the time or the capacity,\u201d says Wallis. \u201cA lot of them are under-resourced anyway and the arts programmes get squeezed.\u201d So the Tate had to work out an \u201coffer\u201d, providing arts-based workshops with the help of A New Direction, an organisation that specialises in creative work within schools. Facilitators and photographers went into schools to do various exercises with children that related to the broader project. Every year 3 class that took part has been invited to come and see its photograph in the exhibition. Again, this is no small undertaking, involving everything from employing greeters to usher the children around, including a small tour of the Tate, to portable buildings in the car park where they can eat their lunch. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to champion why creativity matters,\u201d says Wallis. \u201cThe hope is that they come, they\u2019ll fall in love with us and want to come back again.\u201d When the exhibition is over the schools will be given the framed photographs. There is something about the simplicity of the concept that makes the exhibition mesmerising. Row upon row of classic school photographs, all taken with the same format. The teacher in the centre, set back slightly into the class \u2013 embedded into their brood \u2013 with the teaching assistants towards the back and to the side. Where the class is larger, the front row sits on the floor cross-legged, the second row is on chairs and all the rest are standing up. \u201cWe had the photographers all stand a certain distance away, to allow for the variation in the size of classes,\u201d explains Wallis, pointing out that while some classes could go up to 34 children, others, particularly in schools for children with special educational needs, might number eight or nine. However big or small the class, all the children are shown at roughly the same size. All were shot with natural light. The effect of this rigorous consistency in form is to draw out the difference in content. The pictures were taken wherever the school chose to accommodate them \u2013 in gyms and classrooms, under basketball nets, with backdrops of climbing bars, the Virgin Mary, blackboards and artwork. There was little retouching \u2013 chipped walls remained chipped. \u201cI love that fact that there\u2019s a similarity,\u201d says McQueen. \u201cEveryone is regimented in the same way. There\u2019s conformity. But there\u2019s individualism, too. Each one is an individual. They\u2019re trying to make you conform. But, at the same time, there\u2019s still that spark there, that individuality, that questioning.\u201d This tension, between the energy of the child at this stage of their development and the demands of the system, at this point in the process, McQueen finds particularly intriguing. \u201cIt\u2019s this moment, when things have almost become regimented, just before they have to conform.

Last year, youth cases took an average of 142 days from offence to completion, compared with 101 in 2011. In the slowest region, Sussex Central, the average time was 491 days last year.</p> \n<p>The delays go against the guidelines for youth cases, which say children should be dealt with as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p>In Manchester youth court, trials for children are being booked well into 2020 after five out of the nine magistrates courts in the Greater Manchester region closed since 2011.

Most other nations do not use an adversarial system which can see children separated from their parents and lawyers via bulletproof glass in what is essentially an adult courtroom with a different sign on the door.</p>\n    <p>Officially, the focus in youth courts is on rehabilitation, tackling the underlying causes of youth offending. But although there has been an 88% drop in the number of children cautioned or convicted since 2007, reoffending rates have increased. Just over 40% of children who go to court reoffend within a year; for those sent to youth custody, that figure rises to 71.6%.</p>\n    <p>Children who end up in trouble now are disproportionately likely to be of black, Asian or minority ethnicity. They are vastly more likely to be in care and they are extremely likely to have ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and communication difficulties.

      "bodyText": "Children as young as 10 are sometimes waiting more than a year for their youth court cases to be heard after cost-cutting measures resulted in half of all magistrates courts closing between 2010 and 2018. The impact of the closures is that youth courts in England and Wales, which are housed in magistrates courts, are facing increased workloads as cases are moved to the remaining open courts. Criminal cases involving children are taking almost 40% longer than they used to, partly because of the problem in getting a court date. Last year, youth cases took an average of 142 days from offence to completion, compared with 101 in 2011. In the slowest region, Sussex Central, the average time was 491 days last year. The delays go against the guidelines for youth cases, which say children should be dealt with as quickly as possible. In Manchester youth court, trials for children are being booked well into 2020 after five out of the nine magistrates courts in the Greater Manchester region closed since 2011. Children from Bury and Rochdale, which no longer have their own court, waited 324 days on average last year. But getting a national picture on what has happened to youth courts during nine years of austerity is difficult, with even the government admitting it does not know how many remain. In response to a Guardian freedom of information request on how many youth courts closed between 2010 and 2018, the Ministry of Justice said it did not hold the information because there was \u201cno legal or business requirement\u201d for it to do so. \u201cYouth courts take place in magistrates court and are not a separate category of court building. Some magistrates courts hear youth work while others do not. A youth court can sit in any suitable HMCTS [Her Majesty\u2019s Courts and Tribunals Service] building where necessary, but only approved magistrates can hear youth court work. Whether a court is or is not hearing youth work is something that can change over time as it is not routinely identified in the name of the site,\u201d said the MoJ response, which came from the HMTCS property directorate. The Youth Justice Board, a non-departmental public body responsible for overseeing the youth justice system in England and Wales, said it also did not know how many youth courts remained open. The MoJ had to make cuts of 25% in the four years to 2014-15 as part of the 2010 spending review under the coalition government. The department was also under pressure to make money. The courts sold between 2010 and February 2018 raised \u00a3224m for the public purse. Since 2010 there has been a 75% drop in children going through the criminal justice system: 26,881 children aged 10-17 received a caution or sentence in England and Wales in 2018, compared with 106,969 in 2010. The government continues to look to savings in the court system and earlier this year said it was acceptable for users to have to travel two hours for justice: leaving home \u201cno earlier than 7.30am, attend their hearing, and return home by 7.30pm\u201d. But youth justice practitioners warn that if journey times were to increase then those attending court would experience greater stress and anxiety \u2013 particularly children, who may not have the means to pay for a longer journey. Many youth lawyers complain that their clients now have to travel too far for their hearings and cannot afford the bus or train fare.

He said the reason for that was \u201cabsolutely obvious, because every magistrate believes that they are acting with scrupulous fairness \u2026 so to be given a report that suggests that that might not be the case is first of all surprising, but also very upsetting because none of us want to be unfair to anybody who appears in front of us.\u201d Unconscious bias training for all magistrates and legal advisers launched in June this year.</p> \n<p>The Magistrates Association, which represents the 15,000 justices of the peace in England and Wales, has <a href=\"https://www.magistrates-association.org.uk/News/ma-report-on-disproportionality-in-the-youth-justice-system\">recently convened a group</a> to address disproportionality, including representatives from the Ministry of Justice, the CPS, the Youth Justice Board and charities. The group agreed it was an \u201curgent problem, especially in relation to the alarming disproportionality illustrated by the proportion of BAME children and young people in custody\u201d. It proposed recruiting more diverse magistrates and promoting awareness among magistrates of the different factors that BAME individuals face.</p> \n<p>The Ministry of Justice said: \u201cThe issues that lead to black, Asian and ethnic minority children being overrepresented in youth custody begin before they enter the criminal justice system, which is why work is under way across the system to change race disparity.\u201d</p>",

In 2018, 27% of the 10 to 18-year-olds who received a youth caution or sentence were from a minority ethnic background, compared with 14% in 2010, according to official figures from the Ministry of Justice released earlier this year.

She said the increase in levels of disproportionality was a direct consequence of BAME children being dealt \u201cdifferent treatment by practitioners across the criminal justice system\u201d, and called for wholesale changes to policing, transparency in the charging and prosecution of cases, and an end to the unequal application of laws such as joint enterprise. Clarke welcomed the overall reduction in criminalisation of children but said negative racial profiling meant it \u201chadn\u2019t benefited all groups equally, meaning BAME children cannot be diverted out of the system in the same ways as their white counterparts\u201d. She put this down to \u201cperceptions of risk and criminality\u201d in the police, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), courts and youth justice service. The Guardian spoke to senior representatives of all four groups and few could point to positive changes in outcomes since the Lammy review, which cited youth justice as the \u201cbiggest concern\u201d. Olivia Pinkney, the chief constable for Hampshire and national policing lead for children and young people, conceded there was still \u201cso much more to be done\u201d and \u201cnone of us should rest and be comfortable\u201d with the rise in the proportion of young BAME people criminalised. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something that will be unwitting, but we need to understand why.\u201d She said the police were taking steps to tackle the problem, pointing to the increased focus on the use of stop and search and mandatory equality and inclusion training. Gerry Wareham, a senior prosecutor and CPS lead for young people, said the CPS could only choose to prosecute from the cases that the police brought to it. \u201cWe\u2019re in a demand-led position. We get what the police bring to us,\u201d he said. Lammy said his review not only showed the disproportionate criminalisation of black youth, but also similar trends for young Muslims and a \u201chistoric problem\u201d of overrepresentation of young people from Gypsy and Traveller backgrounds. The youth justice system is in need of further reform, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real need to get a grip on how we\u2019re supporting families, how we\u2019re supporting young people, what second chances they are getting. \u201cThose are big questions that obviously affect all young people who fall into the criminal justice system, but they are generally young people from working-class and poor socio-economic backgrounds and most definitely young people from ethnic He said the government had accepted the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of his recommendations, but had chosen not to impose targets for improving diversity in the judiciary, where he believed there were \u201cstill real issues\u201d. Only 12% of magistrates and 7% of district judges are from BAME backgrounds, according to figures published in July. Youth cases are either heard by three magistrates or a district judge. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) puts the UK\u2019s minority ethnic population at 13.8%. John Bache, the chair of the Magistrates Association, said some magistrates had found it \u201cvery difficult to accept the results\u201d of the Lammy review. He said the reason for that was \u201cabsolutely obvious, because every magistrate believes that they are acting with scrupulous fairness \u2026 so to be given a report that suggests that that might not be the case is first of all surprising, but also very upsetting because none of us want to be unfair to anybody who appears in front of us.\u201d Unconscious bias training for all magistrates and legal advisers launched in June this year. The Magistrates Association, which represents the 15,000 justices of the peace in England and Wales, has recently convened a group to address disproportionality, including representatives from the Ministry of Justice, the CPS, the Youth Justice Board and charities. The group agreed it was an \u201curgent problem, especially in relation to the alarming disproportionality illustrated by the proportion of BAME children and young people in custody\u201d. It proposed recruiting more diverse magistrates and promoting awareness among magistrates of the different factors that BAME individuals face. The Ministry of Justice said: \u201cThe issues that lead to black, Asian and ethnic minority children being overrepresented in youth custody begin before they enter the criminal justice system, which is why work is under way across the system to change race disparity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Daily Telegraph has dramatically dropped its claim that the judge who awarded Geoffrey Rush $2.9m in damages after a series of defamatory articles about the Oscar-winning actor displayed an attitude of bias during the trial. On Monday the Daily Telegraph through its parent company, Nationwide News, began its appeal against federal court justice Michael Wigney\u2019s ruling that the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper had defamed Rush by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d during a Sydney Theatre Company production of King Lear in 2015. Rush is due to receive $2.9m, including $1.97m in special damages based on past and future lost earnings \u2013 the largest defamation payout to a single person in Australia. The Daily Telegraph is appealing against the decision, and as late as Monday morning had planned to argue that Wigney\u2019s conduct in the case \u201cgave rise to an apprehension of bias\u201d, citing examples of the \u201ctone\u201d used by the judge throughout the trial and his assessment of the credibility of the newspaper\u2019s witnesses. But on Monday afternoon the Daily Telegraph\u2019s barrister, Tom Blackburn SC, told the court the newspaper would no longer press the claim. Blackburn said he saw \u201cno utility in the circumstances\u201d in pressing the apprehended bias claim because the Daily Telegraph was seeking a retrial on other grounds. The Daily Telegraph is also arguing the judge erred both in finding that the Daily Telegraph\u2019s star witness, Eryn Jean Norvill, gave unreliable evidence and in awarding special damages to Rush based on an \u201cinference\u201d the actor would no longer be able to work. It has argued for a retrial if the first challenge is upheld, and Blackburn said if they succeeded \u201cin those circumstances we see no need to press [the apprehended bias] claim\u201d. Rush\u2019s barrister, Bret Walker SC, slammed the sudden change of heart, saying the Daily Telegraph\u2019s \u201cvery grave\u201d allegation of bias had been \u201ca slur both on the trial judge and on the cogency of the vindication our client has enjoyed\u201d. Lawyers for the Daily Telegraph have called the decision to award Geoffrey Rush $2.9m in damages after a series of defamatory articles about the Oscar-winning actor \u201cextraordinary and absurd\u201d, and based on \u201cuncertain inferences from inexact proofs\u201d. At the opening of the two-day appeal before three judges in the federal court in Sydney on Monday, Blackburn argued the court should overturn Wigney\u2019s finding that the newspaper\u2019s key witness, the actor Eryn-Jean Norvill, was \u201cprone to exaggeration and embellishment\u201d. During the trial Norvill, who made the initial complaint about the actor to the STC, told the court that Rush \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s best-known actors \u2013 engaged \u201cdaily\u201d in a pattern of \u201csexual harassment\u201d including \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and groping gestures that made her feel \u201cbelittled\u201d, \u201cfrightened\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Wigney found Norvill\u2019s evidence was \u201cnot only uncorroborated but contradicted\u201d by other witnesses. He said in his judgment he \u201cwas not ultimately persuaded that Ms Norvill was an entirely credible witness\u201d. On Monday, Blackburn argued Wigney\u2019s findings about Norvill were \u201cglaringly improbable\u201d. He raised five examples of Wigney\u2019s judgment about Norvill, including his finding that the actor did not need to make \u201chighly complimentary\u201d comments about Rush during an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald to promote the play in 2015. \u201cThese were press conferences in support of the Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s production of King Lear, this is not mainstream entertainment, this is not a Harry Potter movie,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cIt is, if not niche entertainment, it\u2019s certainly not mainstream entertainment. \u201cWhat is Ms Norvill supposed to do? Is she supposed to be guarded, or heroically pure at a press conference? Mr Rush was obviously, apart from being a distinguished actor, obviously a great drawcard for this production, I mean she had to talk him up.\u201d Blackburn told the court the decision to award special damages in favour of Rush was \u201cextraordinary and absurd\u201d because while the actor had \u201cdelivered his lines\u201d over three days in the witness box, he had never told the court he had not received offers to work. \u201cHere\u2019s one thing he didn\u2019t say, that is, \u2018I am unable to work because of these articles.\u2019 He just didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cNeither did he say I have received no or fewer offers because of these articles. His American agent, Fred Specktor, did not say he has received no or fewer offers because of these articles, his Australian agent wasn\u2019t called, no one gave that evidence.\u201d Blackburn said the \u201cfailure\u201d to ask Rush that question was \u201cnot explicable on any other conceivable basis other than that it was a deliberate decision\u201d. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t clearly come out and say \u2018I have received no offers of work,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe say it is very strange for the court to be having to draw inferences about his state of mind. On ordinary principles the court should have inferred that it wasn\u2019t asked [because] counsel feared to ask it. The fear being the answer might be unfavourable.\u201d",

Surprisingly little, says Spoonley.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been one of the most dramatic demographic transitions that we\u2019ve seen really anywhere and it\u2019s been done without major social conflict. We had a very intense and quite angry debate in the 1970s and 80s about M\u0101ori rights and indigenous rights \u2013 so that possibly was the moment when we engaged in some of the more difficult conversations.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the second thing is that we are an immigrant population, so we don\u2019t have those debates about national identity and threats from people who are culturally and religiously different that you would find in Europe. Some of that\u2019s been dislodged by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\">mosque shootings in Christchurch</a> but that major hostility is not something that\u2019s been part of the New Zealand political and policy debates,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This is not to say racism, discrimination and protectionism do not exist. Asian house buyers have been blamed for the high cost of property in Auckland. In 2018 the Labour-led government passed a law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/15/tenants-on-our-own-land-new-zealand-bans-sale-of-homes-to-foreign-buyers\">banning many non-resident foreigners from buying existing homes</a>. </p> <p>One factor that might be lowering the potential for tensions is that New Zealand has a tradition of immigration and high levels of intermarriage. Dr Xin Chen of the New Zealand Asia Institute at the University of Auckland says it remains to be seen how immigration will complicate society and politics. For instance, about 75% of Chinese New Zealanders vote for the centre-right National party. Most live in cities, she says, which tend to be more liberal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/oct/22/exposings-ones-selfies-aucklanders-answer-call-for-city-snapshots-in-pictures\">Exposing one's selfies: Aucklanders answer call for city snapshots \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Strongly religious immigrants, meanwhile, tend to hold socially conservative views \u2013 in a country where the percentage of nonbelievers has now reached 49%. Winston Peters, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Labour government\u2019s coalition partner, New Zealand First, says his party will campaign for a values test for migrants and refugees at the next election.</p> <p>According to the Ministry of Health, New Zealanders are living longer than ever before, putting more pressure on hospitals and and the dwindling number of working-age residents to fund the state pension and support services.

In the South Island, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/29/tiny-new-zealand-town-with-too-many-jobs-launches-drive-to-recruit-outsiders\">some small towns are crying out for people</a> and offering incentives such as cheap housing and a plethora of jobs. But in the North Island, which hosts both major cities and a more temperate climate, residents complain of congestion, unaffordable housing and a declining quality of life amid growing urbanisation.</p> <p>Although many regions over the next decade will see their populations stagnate or decline, says Spoonley, each one, apart from the west coast of the South Island, gained people in the last census. Some of this is down to immigration, some to baby boomer retirement, and some to people seeking to escape Auckland, says Jackson. Economist Benje Patterson says more than 30,000 Aucklanders left in the four years to 2017, many of them older Europeans.</p> <p>The pressures on Auckland have prompted suggestions that migrants should go to other, more rapidly ageing parts of the country and stay for at least five years on a bonded scheme, says Spoonley. Few serious policy adjustments have been made to make that happen, he says, though Jackson notes changes to the immigration points system mean you would get more if you go to a town outside Auckland. Prospective migrants gain points based on age, skills, education and other factors.</p> <p>When the 5 million mark is reached, however, a few cheers are likely to be heard in the nation\u2019s bars and at barbecues. Some will urge it on upwards. More people, sensibly managed, means greater opportunity, diversity, sustainable growth, staving off the demographic crisis for a little longer. Auckland is confident it can cope. The city has earmarked 15,000 hectares for future urban development and believes it can handle a growing population.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/23/400000-year-job-new-zealand-three-months-holiday\">The $400,000-a-year New Zealand job with three months' holiday that no one wants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ben van Bruggen, a Londoner in charge of Auckland council\u2019s urban design strategy, says the region is the same size as London, which holds more than four times the population. \u201cOn that basis there\u2019s still quite a bit of way to go,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In the capital, Wellington, a 25-year-old M\u0101ori woman, Krystal Clarke, has doubts about New Zealand\u2019s demographic growth.

But how can we be properly hospitable to our immigrant friends if we can\u2019t even look after ourselves properly?\u201d</p> <p>The urban development minister, Phil Twyford, said New Zealand reaching 5 million people was a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d as the country had always based its self-image on being a quiet, underpopulated country at the bottom of the world.</p> <p>The country\u2019s population growth was causing growing pains, however, Twyford said, noting dysfunctional transport systems and unaffordable housing as the country\u2019s major issues in the North Island cities in particular.</p> <p>Rebalancing the population so it was more evenly spread and attracting more migrants to the regions \u2013 \u201cwhich have been neglected for decades\u201d \u2013 would mean New Zealand could support 5 million people, and potentially many more.</p> <p>\u201cThe bigger issue is that we\u2019re facing pretty sustained and rapid population growth and we need to really lift our game in how we manage growth,\u201d Twyford said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never really grasped the nettle around a population policy in New Zealand.

For so long this Pacific island country at the bottom of the world has been defined by its geographical isolation. The appeal of these volcanic rocks has always been their sense of frontier adventure; a sparsely settled nation where only the toughest survive. But since 2012, Aotearoa has had one of the highest net inflows of migrants of any OECD country. The question now is how these rapid changes will reconfigure its society, politics and environment. Approaching a population milestone For most of its nationhood, New Zealand\u2019s population growth was delivered, quite literally, by its mothers. In 1855, New Zealand\u2019s women had an average of at least five babies. The birthrate quickly dipped below three before bobbing up again in the late 1950s as more young immigrants, largely from Britain, began to step off boats.

But growing from 4 million to 5 million will have taken just 14 years, rather than the previous 30 because of a significant rise in immigration, according to Massey University sociologist Prof Paul Spoonley. \u201c[Net inflow of migrants] has been tracking at about the equivalent of 1.5% of the total population,\u201d he said. \u201cMost countries wouldn\u2019t come anywhere near 1%. Between 2013 and 2018 \u2013 the two census points \u2013 the net gain from migration was 270,000 people.\u201d Many of the latest arrivals are from Asia, largely China, India and the Philippines, says Spoonley, and most have settled in Auckland. As a result, the broad \u201cAsian\u201d ethnic group is expected to rise across the country from 540,000 in 2013 to perhaps 1.4 million within the next two decades. The number of people with Pacific heritage nationally is also projected to grow in that time to 650,000 and the M\u0101ori population to more than a million. Now at 1.7 million, Auckland\u2019s population could reach 2.4 million within 30 years. Auckland is regularly ranked as one of the most liveable cities in the world, but it is also one of the most expensive. The average cost of housing is nine times the average household income. And the city is overcrowded, being home to one-third of the country\u2019s entire population. \u201cInfrastructural and service provision simply has not kept up with the rate of population growth,\u201d Spoonley says. The city is \u201cbulging at the seams\u201d. Beautiful views, unswimmable rivers As a result of the rising population, New Zealand\u2019s wilderness is under strain. Desperately needed housing is encroaching on forest and bushland, and hiking trails renowned for their isolation are becoming clogged highways of overworked city workers seeking a digital detox. While New Zealand is famous for its birdlife, dozens of native species are now endangered thanks to introduced predators such as rats and stoats. Intensive farming practices are destroying the once pristine and potable water in rivers and lakes. Fertilisers and animal manure from the country\u2019s 27 million sheep and 10 million cattle are making waterways toxic and unswimmable due to high levels of bacteria such as E coli and frequent algal blooms, among other issues. Dozens of native fish species are also under threat of extinction from nitrogen and phosphorus, but it is not just farming practices that are to blame for the decline of water quality. Increasing rates of urbanisation have put pressure on ageing sewerage systems, and stormwater infrastructure regularly gets overwhelmed, resulting in faecal contamination and regular closures of popular Auckland beaches. The message that New Zealand\u2019s natural environment is being desecrated is yet to be heard by the global tourism market, with visitor numbers expected to top 5 million annually within years. The numbers hiking its Great Walks, such as the Routeburn, Kepler and Milford tracks, have risen more than 30,000 in five years, from 80,000 in 2013 to about 112,000 today. Until last year, before a trial fee was introduced for tourists, foreign visitors regularly outnumbered locals. \u201cIt\u2019s become a highway, a conveyor belt,\u201d a Department of Conservation worker on the Milford track told the Guardian in 2018. \u201cPeople come here looking for meaning, searching for some sort of solace. But the bush doesn\u2019t just give that up. In the huts there\u2019s so much squabbling and showing off.

Winston Peters, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Labour government\u2019s coalition partner, New Zealand First, says his party will campaign for a values test for migrants and refugees at the next election. According to the Ministry of Health, New Zealanders are living longer than ever before, putting more pressure on hospitals and and the dwindling number of working-age residents to fund the state pension and support services. By 2050, up to 27% of New Zealanders are predicted to be over 65, compared with 15% in 2016. Some 83,000 people are over 85; by 2060 that figure is projected to be 383,000.

Few serious policy adjustments have been made to make that happen, he says, though Jackson notes changes to the immigration points system mean you would get more if you go to a town outside Auckland. Prospective migrants gain points based on age, skills, education and other factors. When the 5 million mark is reached, however, a few cheers are likely to be heard in the nation\u2019s bars and at barbecues. Some will urge it on upwards. More people, sensibly managed, means greater opportunity, diversity, sustainable growth, staving off the demographic crisis for a little longer. Auckland is confident it can cope. The city has earmarked 15,000 hectares for future urban development and believes it can handle a growing population. Ben van Bruggen, a Londoner in charge of Auckland council\u2019s urban design strategy, says the region is the same size as London, which holds more than four times the population. \u201cOn that basis there\u2019s still quite a bit of way to go,\u201d he says. In the capital, Wellington, a 25-year-old M\u0101ori woman, Krystal Clarke, has doubts about New Zealand\u2019s demographic growth. Clarke was recently homeless \u2013 sleeping in her car with her partner, despite both being employed \u2013 and she wonders if New Zealand should grow any further if it can\u2019t feed and house the people it has already. \u201cEvery time I come out here for my break, it is M\u0101ori people especially who come up to me \u2013 do you have a dollar, do you have a cigarette? Why are we like this, why do our immigrant friends seem to be OK but we\u2019re not? What\u2019s been put in place for them to succeed that is not in place for our people? \u201cThe M\u0101ori concept of manaakitanga is one of hospitality. But how can we be properly hospitable to our immigrant friends if we can\u2019t even look after ourselves properly?\u201d The urban development minister, Phil Twyford, said New Zealand reaching 5 million people was a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d as the country had always based its self-image on being a quiet, underpopulated country at the bottom of the world. The country\u2019s population growth was causing growing pains, however, Twyford said, noting dysfunctional transport systems and unaffordable housing as the country\u2019s major issues in the North Island cities in particular. Rebalancing the population so it was more evenly spread and attracting more migrants to the regions \u2013 \u201cwhich have been neglected for decades\u201d \u2013 would mean New Zealand could support 5 million people, and potentially many more. \u201cThe bigger issue is that we\u2019re facing pretty sustained and rapid population growth and we need to really lift our game in how we manage growth,\u201d Twyford said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really grasped the nettle around a population policy in New Zealand. We just sort of never quite got to having that debate. My personal view is that if we got our policies right we could easily accommodate a lot more people.\u201d We are expanding our coverage of New Zealand.

All think that extra stimulus will be needed, and all think it\u2019ll have to come from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, as well as the bank. All but two say the treasurer should be prepared to sacrifice his goal of an immediate budget surplus in order to provide it. The 13 are members of the 20-person economic forecasting panel assembled by the Conversation at the start of this year. All but one have been surprised by the extent of the economic slowdown. The 13 represent 10 universities in five states. Among them are macroeconomists; economic modellers; former Treasury, IMF, OECD and Reserve Bank officials; and a former government minister. The central bank needs help At issue is the government\u2019s contention, spelled out by Frydenberg\u2019s Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, in evidence to the Senate last month, that there is usually little role for government spending and tax (\u201cfiscal\u201d) measures in stimulating the economy in the event of a downturn. Absent a crisis, economic weakness was \u201cbest responded to by monetary policy\u201d. Monetary policy \u2013 the adjustment of interest rates by the Reserve Bank \u2013 is nearing the end of its effectiveness in its present form. The bank has already cut its cash rate to close to zero (0.75%) and will consider another cut on Tuesday. It is preparing to consider so-called \u201cunconventional\u201d measures, including buying bonds in order to force longer-term interest rates down towards zero. Governor Lowe has made the case for \u201cfiscal support, including through spending on infrastructure\u201d saying there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve. The 13 economists unanimously back the governor. Seven of the 13 say what is needed most is fiscal stimulus (including extra government spending on infrastructure), three say both fiscal and monetary measures are needed, and three want government \u201cstructural reform\u201d, including measures to help the economy deal with climate change and remove red tape. None say the Reserve Bank should be left to fight the downturn by itself without further help from the government. Mark Crosby, Monash University: \u201cThere is plenty of room for fiscal stimulus, particularly infrastructure spending.\u201d Ross Guest, Griffith University: \u201cI agree with the emerging consensus that monetary policy is no longer effective when interest rates are so low.\u201d Guay Lim, Melbourne Institute: \u201cIt is time for coordinated monetary and fiscal policies to boost domestic demand.\u201d The surplus can wait Eleven of the 13 believe the government should abandon its determination to deliver a budget surplus in 2019-20. The economic modeller Renee Fry-McKibbin says the government should \u201cease its position of a surplus at all costs\u201d. The former Treasury and ANZ economist Warren Hogan says achieving a surplus in the current environment would have \u201czero value\u201d. The former OECD director Adrian Blundell-Wignall says that rather than aiming for an overall budget surplus, the government should aim instead for an \u201cnet operating balance\u201d, a proposal that was put forward by Scott Morrison as treasurer in 2017. The approach would move worthwhile infrastructure spending and borrowing onto a separate balance sheet that would not need to balance. Political debate would focus instead on whether the annual operating budget was balanced or in deficit. The former Treasury and IMF economist Tony Makin is one of only two economists surveyed who back the government\u2019s continued pursuit of a surplus, saying annual interest payments on government debt have reached $14 billion, \u201cfour times the foreign aid budget and almost twice as much as federal spending on higher education\u201d. Further deterioration of the balance via \u201cfacile fiscal stimulus\u201d would risk Australia\u2019s creditworthiness. However, Makin doesn\u2019t think the government should leave everything to the Reserve Bank. He has put forward a program of extra spending on infrastructure projects that meet rigorous criteria, along with company tax cuts or investment allowances paid for by government spending cuts. The former trade minister Craig Emerson also wants an investment allowance, suggesting businesses should be able to immediately deduct 20% of eligible spending. It\u2019s an idea put forward by Labor during the 2019 election campaign. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has indicated something like it is being considered for the 2020 budget. Emerson says it should be possible to deliver both the investment allowance and a budget surplus. Quantitative easing would be a worry Five of the 13 economists are concerned about the Reserve Bank adopting so-called \u201cunconventional\u201d measures such as buying government and private sector bonds in order to push long-term interest rates down towards zero, a practice known as quantitative easing. Jeffrey Sheen and Renee Fry-McKibbin say it should be kept in reserve for emergencies. Adrian Blundell-Wignall and Mark Crosby say it hasn\u2019t worked in the countries that have tried it. Adrian Blundell-Wignall: \u201cA quantitative easing avalanche policy by the European central bank larger than the entire UK economy has left inflation below target and growth fading. Quantitative easing destroys the interbank market, underprices risk, and encourages leverage and asset speculation.\u201d Steve Keen says in both Europe and the United States quantitative easing enriched banks and drove up asset prices but did little to boost consumer spending \u201cbecause the rich don\u2019t consume much of the wealth\u201d. The treasurer should step up Taken together, the responses of the 13 economists suggest it is ultimately the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure the economy doesn\u2019t weaken any further, and that it would be especially unwise to palm it off on to the Reserve Bank at a time when the bank\u2019s cash rate is close to zero and the effectiveness of the unconventional measures it might adopt is in doubt. Measures the government could adopt include increasing the rate of the Newstart unemployment benefit, boosting funding for schools and skills training, borrowing for well-chosen infrastructure projects with a social rate of return greater than the cost of borrowing, further tax cuts that double as tax reform (including further tax breaks for business investment), and spending more on programs aimed at avoiding the worst of climate change and adapting to it. The economists are backing the governor in his plea for help. They think he needs it.

      "bodyText": "Shut up and don\u2019t argue; the Australian raven is the best of all birds, and should be bird of the year. Every year. If you\u2019ve ever seen one, your eyes already know these are magnificent creatures. They\u2019re glossy black \u2013 plumage, beak, mouth and tongue \u2013 with feathers that shine purple, green or blue. The scientific name appended them by European naturalists, Corvus coronoides, translates, stunningly, to \u201ccrow shaped\u201d, noting their resemblance to the carrion crow of Europe and West Asia. Pah! to these paltry crows. Our raven is much bigger than its namesake \u2013 growing up to 53cm in length, its wingspan a metre, it\u2019s almost as large at the northern hemisphere\u2019s common raven. That\u2019s big enough for the omnivorous Australian raven to kill a freakin\u2019 rabbit, even \u2013 though less often \u2013 a lamb. If you\u2019ve ever despaired at the damage wreaked on Australian wildlife by the pestilent, introduced rabbit, build a shrine in your home and offer tribute to our raven; this local hero\u2019s fighting back. You don\u2019t need to watch it kill a galah (it can) or feast on the dead (it does) to know that our raven is a badass. Just glance at its eyes; the irises of our adult bird are bright white. The contrast to its dark feathers and mouth gives its face a startling, fang-of-Dracula, switchblade-from-the-shadows-of-an-alleyway quality, a look that says \u201cI will gut you for five bucks, or for fun\u201d. Your nightmares cast this bird in a horror movie directed by Ingmar Bergman. It transforms you into Edgar Allan Poe, freaking out in his study on a bleak December. From personal experience, I advise not walking through a park full of Australian ravens after a viewing of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds \u2026 unless you want the neighbours to hear you running and screaming. This is a bird of stature. More delicate species tremble at the border of extinction; the population of Corvus coronoides is increasing. The highly intelligent raven is unafraid of the human city. It roosts in its towers, it feasts on its waste. I grew up with this bird in the suburbs of Sydney. The Eora and Darug people of the area call the bird \u201cwugan\u201d. To the Kulin nation of what\u2019s now Victoria, a great raven appears in myths going by the name Waa, sometimes Wahn or Waang, and among English-speakers, sometimes \u201ccrow\u201d substitutes for \u201craven\u201d. Across the continent, Indigenous mythology depicts this raven as a divine trickster. The Kulin nation\u2019s Wurundjeri people describe the raven stealing fire from five sisters who guard it. He lures them into a trap, seizes their firesticks, and in the ensuing chaos his feathers are burnt the colour of charcoal (the sisters are swept up into the sky and become the Pleiades constellation). On the other side of the country, the Noongar of Western Australia revere the raven as Waardar \u201cThe Watcher\u201d, and a psychopomp; the bird accompanies the spirits of the dead across the western sea to the paradise of Kurannup. Does this symbolism sound familiar? The Australian raven reminds us that this island continent is no outpost to the human story; the lore of ravens is shared worldwide. They\u2019re the first bird mentioned in the Hebrew bible, and \u2013 on God\u2019s personal instruction \u2013 they feed the prophet Elijah. In the Qur\u2019an, a raven teaches Cain how to bury his murdered brother. Hindu Shani, god of justice, travels via a giant raven. In China, a three-legged raven lives in the sun. The Greek god Apollo uses ravens as spies, as does the Norse god Odin, whose twin pets Huginn and Muninn (\u201cThought\u201d and \u201cMemory\u201d) oversee human life and death with the same detail the Twa Corbies do in the Scottish ballad. For the Inuit, the raven emerged from darkness and created the world as he flew over it \u2013 diverse cultures of the Pacific north-west believe in the raven as both creator and trickster; their sacred stories are known as Raven Tales. There is a feminist energy to other myths of the bird; King Morvran, the \u201cSea-Raven\u201d, was both the son and mate of Hel, the Norse Queen of the Underworld. The Irish hero C\u00fa Chulainn dies with the spurned raven goddess Morrigan waiting to peck out his eyes. The Valkyries take the form of ravens to drink the blood of slain warriors. If you\u2019ve ever heard the legend that Britain will resist invasion until ravens leave the Tower of London, know that it\u2019s because the Welsh hero Br\u00e2n the Blessed is said to be buried under it; Br\u00e2n means \u201craven\u201d. The strength of their symbolism is why they\u2019re in the Game of Thrones saga, and poems by Ted Hughes. I knew none of this at age 11, when taking a walk with my uncle through a Sydney park I watched an unkindness of ravens (yes) square off against an equal number of cockatoos, and followed bursts of black/white feathers in the light-and-shadow dappled cage of trees as the two halves sparred for territory. The cockatoos were pale and pretty, yet the unique kraa! kraa! of the Australian ravens above rang out the instantly familiar drawl of long, slow, suburban afternoons, rural twilights, beachside sunsets \u2026 and I suddenly knew the sound of ravens for that of Australian stillness. Theirs is the song of our moments when the light dips and crowds thin and parents call their kids in for dinner. My heart allied to the black bird then; I hope yours does now. Warrior, trickster, messenger, god \u2013 Raven is both the bird of the world, and the precise sound of coming home. \u2022 Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist",

On the first Tuesday each November, Australians provide a fervent reminder that they\u2019re the world\u2019s biggest gamblers by splurging on the Melbourne Cup.

We estimate more than three million Australians will bet with TAB on the Melbourne Cup.\u201d </p> <p>For a sport that craves, but seldom receives, mainstream exposure, racing has long subsisted on the truism that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The industry has had its share of scandals over the years, from doping and ring-ins to jockeys betting on other horses and most things in between. But racing is nothing if not resilient. Despite issues of integrity that could and should pose a serious existential threat, racing somehow manages to come out the other side and retain its niche as an accepted, even treasured, part of Australian culture.</p> <p>But times are changing. While some sections of society might be prepared to turn a blind eye to the carry-ons of the sport\u2019s ratbag element, the matter of animal welfare is proving harder to stomach. The spate of equine deaths on Melbourne Cup day in recent years \u2013 since 2013, six horses have perished at Flemington on Australian racing\u2019s biggest day \u2013 has brought the issue into sharp focus, prompting the #NupToTheCup movement and a general increase in awareness of the wellbeing of racehorses.

We estimate the real number to be more than 10,000.\u201d</p> <p>Racing administrators shifted promptly to damage control, promising to weed out the wrongdoers. \u201cThe Commission advocates strongly for the welfare of all racing animals and invites the racing community and the public to report racing animal welfare concerns for investigation,\u201d Queensland Racing Integrity commissioner Ross Barnett said. </p> <p>In New South Wales, it is prohibited for horses to be sent to a knackery if they were \u201cpredominantly domiciled\u201d in that state. \u201cIf it\u2019s happening we will put the full force of the law against them because they\u2019re breaking the rules of racing,\u201d Racing NSW chief executive Peter V\u2019landys said. </p> <p>V\u2019landys, for his part, identified animal welfare as racing\u2019s biggest threat some time ago, introducing the above mentioned rule and devoting a percentage of prize money to equine welfare, among other initiatives. And now Racing Victoria is following suit, last week announcing a $25m program to ensure the welfare of racehorses from the cradle to the grave. A key element of the commitment is to support a national responsible breeding campaign \u201cto reduce the number of thoroughbreds that end up with no options\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/04/five-ways-to-make-horse-racing-more-humane-right-now\">Five ways to make horse racing more humane right now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are steps in the right direction, but more is wanted.

Birdcage regular Megan Gale is this year boycotting the Melbourne Cup, following singer Taylor Swift and actor Lana Condor to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/21/taylor-swift-cancels-melbourne-cup-performance-after-criticism-from-animal-rights-groups\">withdraw from the event</a>. Both Swift and Condor cited scheduling issues, but the social media backlash over their intended appearances at Flemington could not be missed. </p> <p>These are interesting times for horse racing. The exposure it so desires it now has in spades, but not for the reasons it might have had in mind.</p>",

To the converted, racing is the sport of kings, where man and beast unite in a battle that is poetry in motion. To its detractors it\u2019s barely a sport at all, rather a business and not a particularly honourable one at that. On one day of the year, however, identity seems less of a problem. On the first Tuesday each November, Australians provide a fervent reminder that they\u2019re the world\u2019s biggest gamblers by splurging on the Melbourne Cup. In Victoria, everyone gets the day off work. For a horse race. And it\u2019s very big business. In 2018, wagering giant Tabcorp held more than $170m in turnover on the Flemington card \u2013 and $115m on the Cup alone \u2013 across its TAB and UBET brands. This year, it expects turnover across the eight key days of spring racing, which includes the four days of the Melbourne Cup carnival, to reach $1bn. \u201cThe Melbourne Cup is an iconic event and one of the world\u2019s great races,\u201d Nicholas Tzaferis, Tabcorp\u2019s general manager of corporate communications, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe Cup is the largest single betting event for our TAB business. We estimate more than three million Australians will bet with TAB on the Melbourne Cup.\u201d For a sport that craves, but seldom receives, mainstream exposure, racing has long subsisted on the truism that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The industry has had its share of scandals over the years, from doping and ring-ins to jockeys betting on other horses and most things in between. But racing is nothing if not resilient. Despite issues of integrity that could and should pose a serious existential threat, racing somehow manages to come out the other side and retain its niche as an accepted, even treasured, part of Australian culture. But times are changing. While some sections of society might be prepared to turn a blind eye to the carry-ons of the sport\u2019s ratbag element, the matter of animal welfare is proving harder to stomach. The spate of equine deaths on Melbourne Cup day in recent years \u2013 since 2013, six horses have perished at Flemington on Australian racing\u2019s biggest day \u2013 has brought the issue into sharp focus, prompting the #NupToTheCup movement and a general increase in awareness of the wellbeing of racehorses. It\u2019s still the race that stops a nation, but now it divides it. The stakes are even higher following the ABC\u2019s expose on the mistreatment and mass slaughter of retired racers at Australian knackeries. Racing Australia claims around 34 ex-racehorses annually, or less than 1% of the population, end up at an abattoir, but the ABC investigation suggests the figure is some way north of this. \u201cThe racing industry has hidden behind bogus studies they commissioned and data collected from a compulsory retirement form,\u201d said Elio Celotto, of the coalition for the protection of racehorses. \u201cThey have now been proven wrong and must own up to the fact that they have a serious welfare problem. We estimate the real number to be more than 10,000.\u201d Racing administrators shifted promptly to damage control, promising to weed out the wrongdoers. \u201cThe Commission advocates strongly for the welfare of all racing animals and invites the racing community and the public to report racing animal welfare concerns for investigation,\u201d Queensland Racing Integrity commissioner Ross Barnett said. In New South Wales, it is prohibited for horses to be sent to a knackery if they were \u201cpredominantly domiciled\u201d in that state. \u201cIf it\u2019s happening we will put the full force of the law against them because they\u2019re breaking the rules of racing,\u201d Racing NSW chief executive Peter V\u2019landys said. V\u2019landys, for his part, identified animal welfare as racing\u2019s biggest threat some time ago, introducing the above mentioned rule and devoting a percentage of prize money to equine welfare, among other initiatives. And now Racing Victoria is following suit, last week announcing a $25m program to ensure the welfare of racehorses from the cradle to the grave. A key element of the commitment is to support a national responsible breeding campaign \u201cto reduce the number of thoroughbreds that end up with no options\u201d. These are steps in the right direction, but more is wanted. Last week, Fairfax journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised V\u2019landys for saying he was proud of Racing NSW\u2019s animal welfare program, suggesting the administrator should give away his role as ARL commission chairman to focus on racing. \u201cHe will, and should, have his hands completely full sorting out the atrocities of racing.\u201d Channel 7\u2019s Bruce McAvaney also weighed in. \u201cAs a small-time owner it made me feel ashamed. And not to have known is not good enough,\u201d McAvaney said of the ABC report. The effects are being felt elsewhere. Birdcage regular Megan Gale is this year boycotting the Melbourne Cup, following singer Taylor Swift and actor Lana Condor to withdraw from the event. Both Swift and Condor cited scheduling issues, but the social media backlash over their intended appearances at Flemington could not be missed. These are interesting times for horse racing. The exposure it so desires it now has in spades, but not for the reasons it might have had in mind.",

You spend so much energy for a result that you can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Liu Li told local media after the court ruling. \u201cNow, I want to tell even more people about this win. I want to tell them: this is definitely hard, but it is not hopeless.\u201d</p> <p>Liu Li\u2019s former boss, Liu Meng, said in a statement on Wechat in August last year, after Liu Li went public with her allegations, that the information online was \u201cnot true\u201d. Calls to Liu Meng and his organisation were not returned and he did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyer has told Chinese media he plans to appeal and countersue Liu Li for defamation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The victory of Liu Li is definitely a positive influence. It must have been very difficult for her.</p> <footer> <cite>Huahua,</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In China where authorities regard grassroots activism with suspicion, the MeToo movement has frequently been censored. Authorities have shut down feminist social media accounts and banned search phrases related to MeToo while activists have been detained. Today, the movement is often referred to in Chinese as <em>Mi Tu</em>, or \u201crice bunny\u201d, a homonym once used to get around censorship of the term.</p> <p>Still, authorities appear to be paying attention. Harassment and gender discrimination are illegal in China, but in December last year the country\u2019s highest court added sexual harassment to the formal list of grounds for civil litigation, making it easier for such cases to go ahead. The government is also drafting a law on sexual harassment that will further define its meaning and require employers to better protect employees.</p> <p>Advocates say the movement still has a long way to go. Of at least 12 cases reported last year, according to <a href=\"https://ngometoo.github.io\">NGOmetoo</a>, a monitoring group, none have made meaningful progress aside from Liu Li\u2019s.</p> <p>One case is that of Huahua, one of the earliest to go public with allegations against a well-known charity founder and anti-discrimination activist. In July last year, Huahua, who is also using an alias, published a letter online accusing the man of raping her during a fundraiser in Beijing in 2015 when she was a volunteer. The activist apologised and stepped down from his role as head of his charity but later told Chinese media that the sex had been consensual.</p> <p>Facing the prospect of a long legal battle in civil court, Huahua has decided for now not to pursue the case. Still, she has taken inspiration from Liu Li\u2019s case. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big victory. I\u2019m very encouraged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe victory of Liu Li is definitely a positive influence. It must have been very difficult for her,\u201d she said, of Liu Li.</p> <p>In one of the most high-profile cases of last year, a woman known by her nickname Xianzi accused a prominent CCTV host of touching and kissing her in his makeup room when she was an intern. Her case has stalled and the host, who has denied the allegations, has countersued friends who helped publish her account last year.</p> <p>Even Liu Li\u2019s case is only a partial win. She did not win compensation for mental duress, as her complaint alleged \u2013 evidence, critics say, that courts still treat the impacts of sexual assault too lightly.

      "bodyText": "Liu Li has spent the past year fighting what many said would be a losing battle. Inspired by a flood of MeToo accounts that emerged in China, last year she brought a lawsuit against her former boss, a prominent and award-winning social worker, whom she claimed sexually harassed her four years ago. Over the course of proceedings, Liu Li, who uses an alias, saw her life scrutinised inside and outside the court. The defence argued that online posts she made about the play the Vagina Monologues suggested she was \u201copen\u201d to sexual advances. Friends and acquaintances, not realising Liu Li was involved, said they thought the claimant was a fame-hungry liar. But she carried on, helped by women\u2019s advocacy groups and a lawyer. Then, on 11 July, a court in Chengdu ruled in her favour and ordered her former boss to publicly apologise. The win, while modest, is one of the first legal victories for China\u2019s MeToo movement, which emerged last year as a dozen women publicly accused men in media, academia, the non-profit world, the tech sector and elsewhere of sexual assault and harassment. Earlier this month, another man was sentenced to six months in prison for molesting a woman and a minor on a subway in Shanghai, marking the first time someone has been criminally punished for sexual harassment on public transport in the city. \u201cThe movement really needs this right now,\u201d said Lu Pin, a Chinese activist, based in New York. Liu Li\u2019s case especially offers a much-needed injection of hope into a movement that has struggled recently under the weight of censorship, counter lawsuits and the detention of activists. Earlier this month, Chinese journalist and leading MeToo activist Sophia Huang was detained by police after she wrote about taking part in anti-Beijing, pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Several women who have publicly accused former co-workers, employers, or professors are now facing defamation lawsuits, including Liu Li. \u201cWe were feeling our way in the dark, with no light ahead that we could see. You spend so much energy for a result that you can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Liu Li told local media after the court ruling. \u201cNow, I want to tell even more people about this win. I want to tell them: this is definitely hard, but it is not hopeless.\u201d Liu Li\u2019s former boss, Liu Meng, said in a statement on Wechat in August last year, after Liu Li went public with her allegations, that the information online was \u201cnot true\u201d. Calls to Liu Meng and his organisation were not returned and he did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyer has told Chinese media he plans to appeal and countersue Liu Li for defamation. In China where authorities regard grassroots activism with suspicion, the MeToo movement has frequently been censored. Authorities have shut down feminist social media accounts and banned search phrases related to MeToo while activists have been detained. Today, the movement is often referred to in Chinese as Mi Tu, or \u201crice bunny\u201d, a homonym once used to get around censorship of the term. Still, authorities appear to be paying attention. Harassment and gender discrimination are illegal in China, but in December last year the country\u2019s highest court added sexual harassment to the formal list of grounds for civil litigation, making it easier for such cases to go ahead. The government is also drafting a law on sexual harassment that will further define its meaning and require employers to better protect employees. Advocates say the movement still has a long way to go. Of at least 12 cases reported last year, according to NGOmetoo, a monitoring group, none have made meaningful progress aside from Liu Li\u2019s. One case is that of Huahua, one of the earliest to go public with allegations against a well-known charity founder and anti-discrimination activist. In July last year, Huahua, who is also using an alias, published a letter online accusing the man of raping her during a fundraiser in Beijing in 2015 when she was a volunteer. The activist apologised and stepped down from his role as head of his charity but later told Chinese media that the sex had been consensual. Facing the prospect of a long legal battle in civil court, Huahua has decided for now not to pursue the case. Still, she has taken inspiration from Liu Li\u2019s case. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big victory. I\u2019m very encouraged.\u201d \u201cThe victory of Liu Li is definitely a positive influence. It must have been very difficult for her,\u201d she said, of Liu Li. In one of the most high-profile cases of last year, a woman known by her nickname Xianzi accused a prominent CCTV host of touching and kissing her in his makeup room when she was an intern. Her case has stalled and the host, who has denied the allegations, has countersued friends who helped publish her account last year. Even Liu Li\u2019s case is only a partial win. She did not win compensation for mental duress, as her complaint alleged \u2013 evidence, critics say, that courts still treat the impacts of sexual assault too lightly. Her former boss\u2019s only punishment from the court is a public apology. Still, advocates say Liu\u2019s case is one step forward and that they are encouraged by other less tangible improvements. More victims are getting help from others \u2013 forming support groups and seeking legal advice. Another former colleague of Liu Li\u2019s is also pursuing a case against the same manager. \u201cI used to be desperate,\u201d added Xianzi, who said she finds younger women are becoming bolder and less ashamed to talk about cases of assault or harassment than previous generations. \u201cNow I\u2019ve become more optimistic.\u201d Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang contributed additional reporting",

      "bodyText": "Researchers studying fossil records say they have come up with an innovative approach to try to save the mountain pygmy possum, an Australian species under serious threat due to global heating. Scientists from the University of New South Wales have used a new paper to argue for the translocation of the species from its current habitat in the alpine regions of Victoria and New South Wales into lowland rainforests. While lowland rainforest would be a new environment for the current species (Burramys parvus), the researchers say fossil records dating back 25m years show other species in the Burramys lineage always occupied these areas. The paper identifies fossil records found in what is now the Tirari Desert in South Australia, the savannah woodlands of Queensland\u2019s Riversleigh world heritage area, and the savannah grasslands of Hamilton, Victoria. The paper\u2019s lead author, Mike Archer, a palaeontologist and professor of biological, earth and environmental sciences, said these previous populations thrived in these areas at a time when they were lowland rainforest communities. \u201cUntil we started doing our fossil work, most people have had no real idea of the history of this endearing animal,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThe environment it\u2019s surviving in now is going to collapse underneath them and the expectation from scientists has been they\u2019ll go extinct due to climate change. \u201cThe fossil record is saying that a new approach may save these animals.\u201d The mountain pygmy possum is a critically endangered marsupial that hibernates for five to seven months of the year. Just 2,000 of them remain in the wild. Recent crashes in Australia\u2019s bogong moth population, an important food source for the possum, have put pressure on the animal. Last year, scientists monitoring the mountain pygmy possum late in the breeding season in Victoria found that between 50% and 95% of the animals had lost their full litters of young. Analysis found the animals had starved to death without their main food source. In the new paper, the UNSW researchers use the fossil records to suggest the current species may be living at the extreme of its habitat. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning They argue for the establishment of a captive population in lowland rainforest to see if it survives in this environment. \u201cWe also want to use this hypothesis to think about consulting palaeontologists about what they know about animals that today are critically endangered,\u201d Archer said. Archer said the team of scientists had raised $150,000 in start-up funds toward the construction of a breeding facility at Secret Creek Sanctuary in Lithgow. They would require more funding to build the facility, as well as government approvals to establish any kind of captive breeding program. But Hayley Bates, a lecturer in zoology and conservation biology at UNSW and a co-author on the study, said the proposed site had some similarities with the type of environment the researchers were looking for. She said the proposal was to breed possums from the NSW mountain pygmy possum population and, once numbers were high enough, study them under different climatic conditions and strategically release them to see if they survive. \u201cIf that\u2019s successful we would look at potentially translocating them to lower down,\u201d Bates said. She said if it works they could consider whether similar approaches could be applied to other species. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can learn from understanding a species\u2019 evolutionary history that ultimately allows it to survive in its habitat now,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIt also gives us a lot of information about how a species might adapt to changing environments.\u201d",

Policies focused on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes and push them into the hands of smugglers, the foreign affairs select committee says in a new report. The human cost of irregular migration made international partnerships essential, including with the EU, the committee said. The report comes just over a week after 39 people, now understood to be Vietnamese nationals, were found dead in the back of a lorry that had arrived in the UK via the port of Zeebrugge. The driver, Maurice Robinson, has been charged with manslaughter and trafficking offences, and a police investigation into a suspected wider trafficking network continues. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the influential committee, said that until the UK left the EU it should continue to attend EU meetings on migration. \u201cThe case of 39 people found dead in a lorry in Essex shocked us all. The full story won\u2019t be clear for some time but this tragedy is not alone,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, hundreds of families across the world are losing loved ones who felt driven to take the fatal gamble to entrust their lives to smugglers. This case should serve as a wake-up call to the Foreign Office and to government. \u201cThe UK has been relatively isolated from the different migrant crises in recent years, but it\u2019s wrong to assume that we are protected from their impact. The UK has a proud history of helping those fleeing conflict and persecution and cooperating with others to protect human rights. We should lead by example.\u201d The report also raised concern that deals with countries such as Libya, Niger and Sudan to limit migration risked fuelling human rights abuses. It said such deals could be used as leverage by partner governments, as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had done recently when he threatened to \u201creopen the gates\u201d. The committee also said the fact that the Home Office was responsible for the UK\u2019s response to irregular migration could lead to the \u201cerror of focusing on preventing migration to the exclusion of other goals such as preventing conflict and promoting stability and respect for fundamental human rights\u201d. It called for more effort to negotiate future close cooperation on migration policy with the EU and an immediate return of UK officials to EU-level meetings where irregular migration is discussed. Other recommendations included the expansion of legal pathways to apply for asylum outside Europe and robust monitoring and safeguards to ensure UK funding for migration programmes in Libya did not contribute to human rights abuses. Tugendhat said the committee\u2019s inquiry had been cut short by the \u201cuncertain nature of parliamentary business\u201d, but that it hoped to return to the issues in the future. Irregular migration is defined by the International Organization for Migration as the \u201cmovement of persons that takes place outside the laws, regulations, or international agreements governing the entry into or exit from the state of origin, transit or destination\u201d.",
