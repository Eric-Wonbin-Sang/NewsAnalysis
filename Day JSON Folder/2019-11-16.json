Hastie and Liberal senator James Paterson were due to travel to Beijing in December with Labor MP Matt Keogh as part of a study tour. The pair were denied visas after being critical of Beijing, with the Chinese embassy in Canberra calling on the two Liberal MPs to \u201crepent and redress their mistakes\u201d. But Hastie said he has no intention of scaling back his criticism of Chinese attempts to exert influence in Australia and human rights abuses against Uighurs in Xinjiang province. \u201cSenator James Paterson and I will not repent,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me be very clear, we will not repent for standing up for Australian sovereignty, our values, our interests, and for those who can\u2019t speak for themselves.\u201d The West Australian MP admits his chances of visiting China are slim. \u201cI am very much open to a trip in the new year, but I suspect unless I repent I won\u2019t be welcome.

He has also spoken out about Chinese influence in Australia and human rights abuses against the Uighur population in Xinjiang province. Paterson has also been a fierce critic of the Chinese, raising concerns about the risk of Chinese influence at Australian universities and the escalating violence in Hong Kong. Paterson told ABC news on Friday, that he would continue to exercise his freedom of speech. \u201cHong Kong is one of the most amazing places in the world and what is happening there is an absolute tragedy and I believe the Communist Party bears some responsibility for that.\u201d Labor frontbencher Stephen Jones called the decision to block the MPs unfortunate, saying more would be gained by allowing them to get a better understanding of China. \u201cIf the purpose behind this is to try and change their minds or change the things they\u2019re going to say, I rather suspect it\u2019s going to have the opposite impact knowing these two people,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201c[It\u2019s] probably playing into their hands rather than the other way.\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Germany, Croatia and Austria all sealed their places in the Euro 2020 finals with wins on Saturday, while a draw in Northern Ireland also confirmed qualification for the Netherlands. Croatia\u2019s 3-1 win over Slovakia means they top Group E, but the 2018 World Cup finalists got a scare when Robert Bozenik put the visitors ahead after 32 minutes in Rijeka. Two goals in four minutes from Nikola Vlasic and Bruno Petkovic settled the hosts\u2019 nerves near the hour mark, before Ivan Perisic sealed victory with a spectacular finish, volleying into the top corner on the stretch with 15 minutes to play. Things were more straightforward for Germany in M\u00f6nchengladbach, where the hosts beat Belarus 4-0. Matthias Ginter\u2019s backheeled finish from Serge Gnabry\u2019s cross gave Germany a half-time lead, and Leon Goretzka doubled their advantage shortly after the break, rifling a low shot home from a short corner. Midfielder Toni Kroos then stole the show with two fine goals as Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side sealed qualification from Group C. The Real Madrid midfielder sidefooted home clinically from the edge of the area on 55 minutes, and added a second late on after twisting beyond two defenders.

His plan to ferret his way out of the country on a private plane falls through when the cops tap Nadia\u2019s phone and he is finally apprehended at his club.

The definitive break came when Thiem led 3-2, with plenty of help from Zverev as his game collapsed in a flurry of dire errors. Thiem broke with a forehand passing shot and he never looked back. Zverev left the court seething, but before he departed for his six day off-season, he previewed the final with a prediction. \u201cNext year will bring a new grand slam champion,\u201d said Zverev. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who that will be, because I think the young guys are playing incredible tennis.\u201d A defining year for Thiem will have a fitting finish as he chases his sixth title. At the beginning of the season he decided to step away from his long-time coach, Gunter Bresnik, who had directed most of his affairs since he was nine years old. At 26, he has finally learnt to make his own decisions and control his own destiny. He seems to like it. Alongside his new coach, Nicolas Massu, he has complemented his booming strokes with more variety and has ensured this week that he will never be called a clay-court specialist again.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me. Here is Ewan Murray\u2019s report. O\u2019Neill: \u201cThings that we can be pleased about and frustrating things. The penalty was a good chance and we didn\u2019t take it. \u201cIn the second half we couldn\u2019t get to the ball enough. \u201cWe didn\u2019t particularly lose anything, we weren\u2019t under so much pressure. We should have been braver. \u201cSteven\u2019s a fantastic player and he knows himself it\u2019s not the best penalty he\u2019s hit.\u201d Van Dijk: \u201cVery tough. We know that. Everyone knew beforehand, they were waiting for moments to press. The penalty was a decision the referee made and Stevo missed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t let them create too many chances. We\u2019re very happy that we\u2019ve qualified. On missed penalty: \u201cThe pitch doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s a big stage and it can happen to anyone.\u201d Here is a bad penalty ... Have you all gone to watch Prince Andrew\u2019s PR disaster? Cathcart: \u201cA little bit disappointed to come away with the draw. \u201cWe just need to pick ourselves up and move on to the Germany match.\u201d Dallas: \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed we didn\u2019t win the game. We went toe to toe with one of the best in the world.\u201d On missed penalty: \u201cThese things happen in football, it can happen to anyone.\u201d On playing in four positions: \u201cThe manager just tells me what to do and I go an do it.\u201d No shots on target for Northern Ireland. Not a great record, especially as they had a penalty. I think it\u2019s optimistic for the lads in the studio to say they deserved more. Northern Ireland completed 309 passes to the Dutch\u2019s 713. Not very close. Back in the big time! The Dutch are celebrating in front of their fans. They controlled the game for almost the entirety of the match and probably could have upped if required. Netherlands qualify for the Euros with that draw, while Northern Ireland are set for the playoffs. In any other circumstances this would be seen as a good point for the hosts. Davis missed the vital penalty, which is a shame but it was ultimately a battle to hold on as they failed to create anything against a very good Dutch side. 90+2 mins: All a bit scrappy as he head to the full-time whistle. 90 mins: Babel is replaced by Ake has the Dutch accept the draw. Three minutes for Northern Ireland to find a winner. 89 mins: McNair swings in a corner from the right but Babel is the man to head clear. McGinn then dinks it in from the other side but that is also dismissed by the defence. \u201cWe love you Michael, we do\u201d rings round the stadium, which is sweet. Scott says: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he did more than four in a game, but Phillip Cocu often played multiple positions in a game.\u201d 87 mins: Smith gets the ball into the box and chips a cross towards goal but Cillessen comes to claim, probably as he\u2019s just very cold. 85 mins: Dallas goes into the book for pulling someone or other back. He just wants to be part of the action all the time. 83 mins: Can anyone remember someone playing in more than four positions in one night? 81 mins: I think Dallas might have just shot from 80 yards out and it\u2019s gone out for a throw, 20 yards from the Dutch net. Fair play. Instead, Thompson is on for Lewis, resulting in Dallas moving to left-back. His fourth position of the night. I think O\u2019Neill might need to sign him for Stoke. 79 mins: Northern Ireland clear a cross to Frenkie De Jong 25 yards from goal and he can only lift a shot well over the bar. Is it time for Lafferty? It\u2019s the best option, no? 77 mins: McGinn nips in to to knock the ball into the box, he chases it but Veltman gets across him and goes down when touched by the Northern Irishman. 75 mins: The Dutch are having all the ball but are not planning on doing much with it. Northern Ireland need a goal but do not seem to have the energy to get the ball back. 73 mins: The Northern Ireland fans are stilling giving their all. Not to mention, the orange corner of Dutch supporters which has added to the atmosphere. The pace has somewhat gone out of the game, though. 71 mins: McGinn replaces Corry Evans, which can be seen to be an attacking change. Dallas moves into the middle and McGinn will play on the left as O\u2019Neill looks for a win. Dallas onto his third position of the night. 69 mins: Northern Ireland need to bring someone on into the centre of the park to provide some energy as they are rapidly running out of it. 67 mins: Promes whips a cross into the the box and Luuk De Jong goes down under pressure from Smith. The whistle is blown for offside, rather than a penalty and Northern Ireland breathe a sigh of relief. Moments later Blind gets behind Whyte on the left, drills a cross towards Promes but Cathcart intercepts and sends it out for a corner. The Dutch are very much on top here. 65 mins: The Dutch are just keeping possession and almost toying with the hosts. Eventually, Cathcart tries to solve the problem by taking down Babel on the right flank. Luuk De Jong replaces Berghuis. 63 mins: Bloomin\u2019 heck! The Dutch are going to bring on Luuk De Jong, meaning we could have two De Jongs and two Evanses on the pitch, which just makes my job needlessly harder on a Saturday night. 61 mins: Northern Ireland look very tired and are playing extremely deep, forcing O\u2019Neill on the sidelines to keep shouting at his players to push up. This could be a long final half an hour. 59 mins: Smith has gone to right-back and Dallas has moved to left wing. 57 mins: A high ball is lumped into the box by De Jong, Veltman rises highest to knock it back across the area for Babel to attack but his header is well saved by Peacock-Farrell. Saville goes off and Smith comes on. 55 mins: Cathcart slips when looking to send a long ball and subsequently completely miskicks it. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s lost his footing. Maybe he needs some better studs. Netherlands are amusing themselves by knocking the ball around. 53 mins: Davis passes the ball out for a throw-in. Northern Ireland are very much on the back foot here. They need to stem the flow here somehow. 51 mins: Van de Beek gets the wrong side of the defence and sends a low cross into the six-yard box but Jonny Evans is waiting and whacks it clear. 49 mins: Babel breaks through the middles, lays it off to Promes who is dispossessed in the box by Davis who is trying to make up for his earlier missed penalty. 47 mins: Lewis lumps a well-shaped cross into the box from the left, Magennis moves into space but gets under the ball and heads it well over the bar. Here we go again! Additionally, Germany are winning, so it does not really matter what Northern Ireland do here. Hey advertisers, I have already bought my one Christmas present for the year. Please stop showing me your adverts. Also ... my neighbour already has a holly wreath on the door. Surely, that is too early! JR emails in to say: \u201cThat handball call is the type of call Ireland are going to need on Monday if they want any chance of beating Denmark. Any chance we can get this ref (Marciniak) to just drive down to Dublin after this game? It\u2019s so close he\u2019d have plenty of time for a nice stop off at Newgrange tomorrow. It\u2019s right on the way. \u201cOr maybe Ireland will get to take their chances with that fella who did the Scotland game earlier.\u201d Davis must have watched this ... Northern Ireland will be left to rue the penalty miss. It was hilariously bad and I am sure Davis probably broke a light in the stand behind. The Dutch have looked good going forward without testing Peacock-Farrell. 45 mins: A free-kick is lifted into the box, Van Dijk gets beyond the defence and knocks the ball down for an oncoming teammate but no one arrives and the ball ends up behind for a goal kick. One minute added on. 44 mins: Both teams might be happy to get through to half-time here. The game has slowed down after quite an intense opening half in general. 42 mins: Davis slips the ball down the line for Whyte, who plays in a harmless cross, or so it seems, until Propper slips instead of clearing. Sadly, for the hosts, the Dutch recover the ball and remove the danger. 40 mins: Davis\u2019 evening gets worse as he is booked for a challenge on De Jong. The Northern Ireland captain stuck a boot in on the Dutchman when he dribbled past him. Hilariously cynical. 38 mins: Bailey Peacock-Farrell having three surnames forming his name is very confusing. I keep thinking his surname is Bailey-Peacock. He has done a fine job so far, considering he does not get a look in at Burnley. 36 mins: An early sub for the visitors, with Propper set to come for De Roon, who was booked earlier on. Koeman must be worried about what Northern Ireland are offering in the middle of the park. Babel lays the ball off to Blind 20 yards out and the full-back lifts a shot over the bar. 34 mins: Well, that was a truly dreadful penalty. Northern Ireland were lucky to get the penalty in the first place, so maybe justice was done. Davis went with power and found absolutely no accuracy. 32 mins: Cillessen plays mind games by moaning about where the ball is placed on the spot. Davis steps up after quite a delay and whacks it over the bar! A long way over! 30 mins: Northern Ireland have a penalty! Or do they? He\u2019s booked someone and is talking the entire Dutch defence without pointing to the spot. McNair swung in a cross which Saville turns towards goal only to see it hit Veltman\u2019s arm. It\u2019s a harsh one as he was only inches away. 28 mins: McNair tries to get the better of Van Dijk, realises it\u2019s a forlorn hope and turns back, with the ball ending up with his own goalkeeper 20 seconds later. 26 mins: Promes gets the better of Dallas down the wing and lifts in a dangerous cross which goes over the head of a flapping Peacock-Farrell, but also everyone else, and out of the box. 24 mins: Northern Ireland have slowed things down, purely because they could not keep up such a ludicrous pace as they set early doors. Now it is case of managing their energy for the next 65 minutes. 22 mins: Northern Ireland have completed 25 passes to Netherlands\u2019 150. Good luck to the hosts! Van de Beek plays a pass through to Babel to take onwards but the flag goes up as the forward whacks at shot which is palmed behind. It was certainly tight. 2o mins: Part-time full-back Dallas is in for a long night at right-back I feel. He is firstly up against Promes who is looking very dangerous, then Babel is pulling onto him whenver he can and Blind is getting up the left flank at every chance. I will keep count of every time the commentators refer to Daley Blind as Danny Blind. Obviously, I will make the same mistake myself. 18 mins: Veltman chucks himself to the ground after Lewis touches his shoulder. A hilarious overreaction from the Ajax man to win a free-kick. 16 mins: Blind controls a perfect crossfield pass and lays the ball off to Babel who fluffs his lines from the middle of the goal and it goes straight to the goalkeeper\u2019s arms. Promes then whacks a shot from the left-hand side of the area but it goes inches wide. 14 mins: Netherlands are under a little less pressure now when they pass it around the back. Admittedly, it would have been impossible for Northern Ireland to keep up the early tempo. 12 mins: De Roon is booked for tripping McNair, meaning he will miss the next match. The Dutch seem to have settled now, though. 10 mins: Netherlands are trying to get a foot in the game. Promes gets into the box and pulls the ball back but Lewis clears. The winger then gets to the byline seconds late and does the same, Berghuis gets to the ball first but he mishits his shot from five yards and it loops onto the crossbar before an almighty scrap to clear the ball. A let-off for Northern Ireland. 8 mins: Whyte swings in a free-kick from the right which Cillessen comes to punch but only gets it as far as Saville on the edge of the box, he smacks a low drive with the goalkeeper AWOL but the ball hits De Ligt on the ground and is cleared. Northern Ireland are really at it currently. So much energy on the pitch and in the stands. 6 mins: Relentless stuff from Northern Ireland as they put pressure on all over the pitch. McNair swings in a cross from the right, Magennis gets across his marker and flicks a header towards the far post but it flashes just wide. 4 mins: Incredible scenes as Corry Evans chases down a backpass to Cillessen, with the goalkeeper whacking it against the midfielder who blocks it and the ball almost ends up in the back of the net, he then tries to set up Magennis but his pass goes astray. This is an intense start from the hosts. I can confirm it is extremely lively in Windsor Park. The fans are playing their part, that is for sure. 2 mins: Netherlands whack it long for Babel to get things going, which is not what I was expecting. Cillessen hits a woeful clearance that only travels 30 yards to the feet of Whyte, who dribbles down the right flank only to see his cross hit the first man. Peep! Peep! Peep! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! The players are on the pitch and I am reminded that the Dutch kit is one of the best around. Van Dijk and De Ligt is a decent centre-back pairing. Josh Magennis was impressive in the reverse fixture but it will be one of the toughest tests of his career tonight. A good win for Wales today. I would like some of this, please. O\u2019Neill: \u201cWe have to go and try to win the game. We\u2019ve picked a team with that in mind. \u201cI think we\u2019ve put as much pace in the team as we can with Stuart Dallas and Jamal Lewis coming in.\u201d Michael O\u2019Neill will have a new Championship rival after Neil Harris was appointed Cardiff boss today. That\u2019s a relief! Scott Minto is actually in Belfast for the match and David Prutton has been relieved. Just 114 caps. Not bad going. Is David Prutton going to carry on for a third game? I will be worried for him if he does. Two is just about doable but presenting three separate matches in a day is madness. I also did the MBM on this earlier and the referee was farcically bad. I am hoping the one in Belfast is better. No Memphis Depay for Netherlands tonight but we do get Ryan Babel, so I am pretty happy. Depay has been in great nick for Lyon this season, making it a shame that we do not get to see him as he looks to vanquish the reputation built during his time at Old Trafford. Your main man Nick Ames is in Pristina, so has written this: Michael O\u2019Neill is off to Stoke but he is focused on the task in hand with Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland: Peacock-Farrell, J Evans, Cathcart, C Evans, Lewis, Saville, Davis, McNair, Whyte, Magennis, Dallas Netherlands: Cillesen, Veltman, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Blind, De Roon, De Jong, Berghuis, Van de Beek, Babel, Promes Good evening! Northern Ireland\u2019s manager has announced he is off and their qualification hopes hang by a thread, so it\u2019s not a great time for the team. On the upside, Netherlands are in town, meaning we should be in for a bit of entertainment as the Dutch seem to have found their feet again under Ronald Koeman. The visitors need just a point to confirm their place at the Euros and they will be planning to secure it tonight. This is not the end of O\u2019Neill and Northern Ireland as they will go into the playoffs next year and the manager will stay on for those matches while also being in charge at Stoke. Northern Ireland ran Netherlands close last month, leading into the closing stages until the Dutch turned the game around late on with two quick goals. Let\u2019s hope they can make it a cracking game once again! Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT",

In July he was invited to Windsor Castle to your daughter, Princess Beatrice\u2019s 18th birthday, why would you do that? Prince Andrew: Because I was asking Ghislaine [Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s girlfriend and a friend of the prince]. But even so, at the time I don\u2019t think I \u2026 certainly I wasn\u2019t aware when the invitation was issued what was going on in the United States and I wasn\u2019t aware until the media picked up on it because he never said anything about it. [...] Maitlis: He was released in July, within months by December of 2010 you went to stay with him at his New York mansion, why? Why were you staying with a convicted sex offender? Andrew: Right, I have always \u2026 ever since this has happened and since this has become, as it were, public knowledge that I was there, I\u2019ve questioned myself as to why did I go and what was I doing and was it the right thing to do? Now, I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together. I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken\u2019s way of doing it. I had to go and see him and talk to him. [...] Maitlis: That was December of 2010. Andrew: Yep.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe all choose our fight and this is mine,\u201d said the art photographer Nan Goldin on Saturday as she led a protest in the Sackler courtyard entrance of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The action was part of her campaign to stop British and American cultural organisations accepting donations and sponsorship from the family behind the pharmaceutical company that made the addictive opioid painkiller OxyContin. Goldin and her supporters joined the protest, organised by the group Pain, which unfurled banners calling for the museum\u2019s director, the former Labour MP Tristram Hunt, to drop all associations with the Sackler name. Goldin told the Observer that although there may be worse things going on in the richest London borough than at the V&amp;A, it was not a question of \u201cranking evil\u201d. \u201cTristram Hunt needs to be re-educated about the fact this is not history,\u201d she said. \u201cThese deaths are happening now. And when it comes to the money donated, the V&amp;A did not need this fancy, chic courtyard. It should concentrate on the exhibits and art inside the museum and stop this expansion.\u201d About 30 protesters arrived at the recently redesigned \u00a32m entrance in Kensington, London, and placed bottles of pills and \u201cOxy dollar\u201d bills stained red on the handmade porcelain tile flooring. Demonstrators then staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d, lying down for five minutes to represent the 400,000 worldwide deaths they blame on drug dependency, and the five people a day they claim die in this country due to prescription drug addiction.

In 2010, he had been photographed walking with Epstein in New York\u2019s Central Park \u2013 two years after Epstein\u2019s first conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution. Addressing his decision to stay with Epstein following the financier\u2019s conviction in 2008, the prince said: \u201cThat\u2019s the bit that \u2026 as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family, and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\u201d The prince denied his relationship with Epstein had damaged the monarch. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s been damaging to the Queen at all \u2013 it has to me, and it\u2019s been a constant drip, if you see what I mean.\u201d Giuffre\u2019s lawyer, Jack Scarola, told Mail Online the prince should agree to an interview \u201cunder oath\u201d instead of giving statements to the media that carry \u201clittle weight\u201d. He said: \u201cI believe there is an ongoing investigation in New York by the FBI under the supervision of the US Attorney\u2019s office into those involved in facilitating Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s abuse. \u201cI would love to see Prince Andrew submit to an interview under oath with the investigating authorities. Talking to the media doesn\u2019t quite cut it. Statements that are not under oath carry little weight.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 and 22 November 2019: to correct a description of Epstein\u2019s offending; and to remove an implication that the prince went to university \u2013 he went to naval college.",

In the latest Opinium poll for the Observer the Conservatives are up three points compared with a week ago, and now stand on 44%. Labour is down one point on 28%. The Liberal Democrats are also down one point on 14%, their lowest showing since August, while the Brexit Party is unchanged on 6%. Brexit is cited by most voters as the most important issue, with 36% saying they will decide which party to support based on their approaches to leaving the EU. This is followed by health (20%) and the economy (7%).",

      "body": "<p>Advanced plans for another centrist political party to be launched after Brexit were developed by MPs earlier this year, it has emerged.</p> <p>Dozens of figures from inside and outside Westminster were involved in the project, designed to go public once a second Brexit referendum was no longer possible.</p> <p>Nick Boles, the former Conservative minister who quit the party over Brexit in April, said he had been \u201cconstantly\u201d in talks about a possible new party and had at one point been confident it would happen. An earlier failed attempt to launch a new party, Brexit delays and the tantalising prospect of a second referendum had stopped it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost all I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Boles said. \u201cI can\u2019t mention names, but it involved some very seriously good people, both MPs and not MPs, but people of great ability, experience and commitment. We had everything in a sense, except for the final resolve of a sufficient number of the individuals we needed in the Labour party. Without that, we were never going to get anywhere.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me a few months ago, I would\u2019ve been very optimistic that by now, something would\u2019ve been up and running. Probably I deluded myself. Because I had made the break, and because I hadn\u2019t thought about it for a very long time and did it in stages, I somehow assumed that it was easier for others to take the same journey than it is. What I\u2019ve realised is that it\u2019s a very difficult journey.\u201d</p> <p>Boles, who is standing down as an MP at this election, said the project could only have succeeded if Brexit had been secured, allowing those wanting a soft Brexit and those wanting a second referendum to unite.</p> <p>\u201cWe all thought that something new would only work and should only launch after this first phase of Brexit had been resolved,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re out of the EU, then we\u2019re all totally agreed \u2013 which is that we want the closest possible relationship with the EU. But the referendum idea came along and split us in two.\u201d</p> <p>He said the failure of the party of 11 MPs launched in February, initially under the banner of The Independent Group (TIG), damaged public appetite for a new party.

      "bodyText": "Advanced plans for another centrist political party to be launched after Brexit were developed by MPs earlier this year, it has emerged. Dozens of figures from inside and outside Westminster were involved in the project, designed to go public once a second Brexit referendum was no longer possible. Nick Boles, the former Conservative minister who quit the party over Brexit in April, said he had been \u201cconstantly\u201d in talks about a possible new party and had at one point been confident it would happen. An earlier failed attempt to launch a new party, Brexit delays and the tantalising prospect of a second referendum had stopped it. \u201cIt\u2019s almost all I\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Boles said. \u201cI can\u2019t mention names, but it involved some very seriously good people, both MPs and not MPs, but people of great ability, experience and commitment. We had everything in a sense, except for the final resolve of a sufficient number of the individuals we needed in the Labour party. Without that, we were never going to get anywhere. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me a few months ago, I would\u2019ve been very optimistic that by now, something would\u2019ve been up and running. Probably I deluded myself. Because I had made the break, and because I hadn\u2019t thought about it for a very long time and did it in stages, I somehow assumed that it was easier for others to take the same journey than it is. What I\u2019ve realised is that it\u2019s a very difficult journey.\u201d Boles, who is standing down as an MP at this election, said the project could only have succeeded if Brexit had been secured, allowing those wanting a soft Brexit and those wanting a second referendum to unite. \u201cWe all thought that something new would only work and should only launch after this first phase of Brexit had been resolved,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019re out of the EU, then we\u2019re all totally agreed \u2013 which is that we want the closest possible relationship with the EU. But the referendum idea came along and split us in two.\u201d He said the failure of the party of 11 MPs launched in February, initially under the banner of The Independent Group (TIG), damaged public appetite for a new party. Initial success evaporated after the group changed its name and struggled with a lack of organisational strength. \u201cIt was a jumping of the gun on a process that had begun but hadn\u2019t matured,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause TIG happened too soon and screwed it up, that gave those who were more nervous about the idea an excuse not to [split]. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible that Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal could have got through parliament, maybe at the second time of asking. Then I think, a potential second attempt at creating something new might easily had happened, and might even have been more likely than not.\u201d While it was not impossible such a force could happen from within parliament, Boles said it could actually emerge as a campaign outside Westminster. \u201cThe question for people like me is, I guess, is that it?\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout the process where I was having these conversations and planning meetings with various others mainly in the Labour party since I left, a number of people said to me, \u2018Nick, I admire what you\u2019re trying to do, I wish you all the success, but this is not how it is going to work\u2019.

And the longer and harder you look at it, the more to have to tip your hat to the NFL\u2019s brilliance in making a chess move Bobby Fischer would admire.</p> <p>ESPN\u2019s has Adam Schefter reported that several executives with teams have reached out as a courtesy to Colin Kaepernick\u2019s representatives saying they couldn\u2019t attend the workout, adding they were confused by the NFL\u2019s purpose in scheduling it on a Saturday and on five days\u2019 notice.</p> <p>Well, I\u2019m not confused at all. The NFL is fully aware that the majority of teams do not typically conduct workouts on Saturdays, when all the real decision-makers are scouting college players or traveling with their clubs for Sunday\u2019s games. Which is why Kaepernick\u2019s team requested to have it rescheduled for a Tuesday. Not surprisingly, the request <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2019-11-13/reports-colin-kaepernick-tried-to-reschedule-his-nfl-workout-and-the-league-refused\">was denied</a>.</p> <p>The NFL has basically told Kaepernick to take it or leave it, creating for the league a no-lose situation no matter how Saturday plays out. Here\u2019s a walk through every scenario.</p> <p><strong>1) Kaepernick declines the NFL\u2019s offer of a workout</strong></p> <p>If Kaepernick refuses to accept the NFL\u2019s less-than-ideal terms and doesn\u2019t show, then commissioner Roger Goodell will have the plausible deniability they\u2019ve wanted from day one. The spin will be: \u201cWe tried to offer him a chance to come back, but he declined. We\u2019re not whiteballing him from the league. We would welcome him back with open arms. Look at the great lengths we went to in order to provide him with an opportunity to resume his playing career. We can\u2019t force him to play. We\u2019ve done all we could.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/19/three-years-in-the-nfl-wilderness-what-colin-kaepernick-lost-and-won\">Three years in the NFL wilderness: what Colin Kaepernick lost \u2013 and won</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>2) Kaepernick attends the workout but doesn\u2019t perform well</strong></p> <p>Maybe Kaepernick\u2019s performance at this last-minute workout fails to impress the scouts who do attend. More plausible deniability. The spin will be: \u201cWhile we respect the fact that Kaepernick has a desire to resume his football career, the numbers are what they are. He just isn\u2019t good enough. He has to be able to have a balance between being an activist, which we all respect, and being able to perform at the level of an NFL quarterback. We will do everything we possibly can to further the cause that he raised through our efforts with the Players Coalition, our social justice program Inspire Change and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/16/jay-z-takes-heat-for-business-deal-with-nfl-slammed-as-betraying-kaepernick\">our partnership with Jay-Z and Roc Nation</a> to bring actionable items to make a difference. We wish Colin Kaepernick good luck in all his future endeavors.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3) Kaepernick performs well enough to warrant a contract offer, but doesn\u2019t promise to stand for the anthem</strong></p> <p>Saturday\u2019s workout, as with most events like these, will include an interview session in addition to the on-field evaluation. Let\u2019s say Kaepernick performs well enough for a contract offer, but scares off interested suitors by not guaranteeing that he will stand for the national anthem.</p> <p>The spin will be: \u201cWell, we wanted to give him a job, but he just was unwilling to convince teams that he wouldn\u2019t be a distraction. Teams want to win football games, and we can\u2019t force them to accept someone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/23/nfl-protest-national-anthem-new-rules-fine\">won\u2019t even agree to follow the rules</a>, which clearly state that a player is to either remain in the locker room or stand respectfully at attention for the anthem. We have acquiesced to his right to express himself by giving him the option of remaining in the locker room, against the wishes of the president of the United States and our fans who want to see players stand and honor our veterans and respect this wonderful country we live in that affords NFL players to receive million-dollar contracts they enjoy. We have done all we could possibly do and, apparently, it\u2019s still not enough.\u201d</p> <p><strong>4) Kaepernick is signed by a team, accepting the condition he never kneels again</strong></p> <p>What if Kaepernick takes a deal on the condition he stands for the anthem, as some sources have speculated will be asked of him. Then it will be: \u201cThis fraud who you have idolized and held up as a hero is nothing but a phony. He was paid by Nike to tell everyone to \u2018Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything\u2019, but doesn\u2019t follow his own advice.

      "bodyText": "The NFL\u2019s decision to organize a private workout for Colin Kaepernick on Saturday in Atlanta is not what it looks like on the surface. Mostly it feels like a guy inviting an old girlfriend to dinner and getting her hopes up at the thought of reconciling when he really has zero interest other than ending the relationship on good terms. He wants her to think he\u2019s a good guy so she tells all her friends that he isn\u2019t the lying and manipulating pig they all know him to be. Those were my first thoughts after hearing about the \u201copportunity\u201d for Colin Kaepernick, the 32-year-old quarterback who has been out of football for more than two seasons, whiteballed by the NFL for kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police violence. And the longer and harder you look at it, the more to have to tip your hat to the NFL\u2019s brilliance in making a chess move Bobby Fischer would admire. ESPN\u2019s has Adam Schefter reported that several executives with teams have reached out as a courtesy to Colin Kaepernick\u2019s representatives saying they couldn\u2019t attend the workout, adding they were confused by the NFL\u2019s purpose in scheduling it on a Saturday and on five days\u2019 notice. Well, I\u2019m not confused at all. The NFL is fully aware that the majority of teams do not typically conduct workouts on Saturdays, when all the real decision-makers are scouting college players or traveling with their clubs for Sunday\u2019s games. Which is why Kaepernick\u2019s team requested to have it rescheduled for a Tuesday. Not surprisingly, the request was denied. The NFL has basically told Kaepernick to take it or leave it, creating for the league a no-lose situation no matter how Saturday plays out. Here\u2019s a walk through every scenario. 1) Kaepernick declines the NFL\u2019s offer of a workout If Kaepernick refuses to accept the NFL\u2019s less-than-ideal terms and doesn\u2019t show, then commissioner Roger Goodell will have the plausible deniability they\u2019ve wanted from day one. The spin will be: \u201cWe tried to offer him a chance to come back, but he declined. We\u2019re not whiteballing him from the league. We would welcome him back with open arms. Look at the great lengths we went to in order to provide him with an opportunity to resume his playing career. We can\u2019t force him to play. We\u2019ve done all we could.\u201d 2) Kaepernick attends the workout but doesn\u2019t perform well Maybe Kaepernick\u2019s performance at this last-minute workout fails to impress the scouts who do attend. More plausible deniability. The spin will be: \u201cWhile we respect the fact that Kaepernick has a desire to resume his football career, the numbers are what they are. He just isn\u2019t good enough. He has to be able to have a balance between being an activist, which we all respect, and being able to perform at the level of an NFL quarterback. We will do everything we possibly can to further the cause that he raised through our efforts with the Players Coalition, our social justice program Inspire Change and our partnership with Jay-Z and Roc Nation to bring actionable items to make a difference. We wish Colin Kaepernick good luck in all his future endeavors.\u201d 3) Kaepernick performs well enough to warrant a contract offer, but doesn\u2019t promise to stand for the anthem Saturday\u2019s workout, as with most events like these, will include an interview session in addition to the on-field evaluation. Let\u2019s say Kaepernick performs well enough for a contract offer, but scares off interested suitors by not guaranteeing that he will stand for the national anthem. The spin will be: \u201cWell, we wanted to give him a job, but he just was unwilling to convince teams that he wouldn\u2019t be a distraction. Teams want to win football games, and we can\u2019t force them to accept someone who won\u2019t even agree to follow the rules, which clearly state that a player is to either remain in the locker room or stand respectfully at attention for the anthem. We have acquiesced to his right to express himself by giving him the option of remaining in the locker room, against the wishes of the president of the United States and our fans who want to see players stand and honor our veterans and respect this wonderful country we live in that affords NFL players to receive million-dollar contracts they enjoy. We have done all we could possibly do and, apparently, it\u2019s still not enough.\u201d 4) Kaepernick is signed by a team, accepting the condition he never kneels again What if Kaepernick takes a deal on the condition he stands for the anthem, as some sources have speculated will be asked of him. Then it will be: \u201cThis fraud who you have idolized and held up as a hero is nothing but a phony. He was paid by Nike to tell everyone to \u2018Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything\u2019, but doesn\u2019t follow his own advice. He\u2019s no Ali, he is only about the money.\u201d Cue every right-wing commentator across the country taking this narrative on a victory lap, having discredited someone who had become a cultural icon. 5) Kaepernick is signed by a team, no strings attached The spin will be: \u201cWe, along with the help of our trusted ally Jay-Z, have been successful at proving to the world that we are truly a league that values black people, black lives and freedom of expression. We are going to continue our plan for progress as we set up concert series across the country with Roc Nation and deliver inspirational messages and actionable items towards a greater tomorrow. By putting this issue to bed, we along with Jay-Z and Roc Nation will continue our goal to Make the NFL Great Again.\u201d Like back in the day when Don King would be patiently waiting at ringside to embrace whichever fighter won, jumping into the ring with a big smile and open arms regardless of the outcome, that\u2019s exactly the no-lose situation what the NFL has set up which will in addition extricate themselves from the PR catastrophe they made for themselves.

      "body": "<p>The Conservatives received a boost last week when Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, announced he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/brexit-party-will-not-contest-317-tory-seats-nigel-farage-says\" title=\"\">not be standing candidates</a> in Tory seats. But the advantage is not what it seems.</p> <p>Brexit party candidates are still standing in most Labour-held seats, including those the Conservatives are targeting. This damages the prospects of Conservative challengers, who draw their support heavily from Leave voters, and are therefore more vulnerable to Brexit party competition than Labour incumbents, whose support comes predominantly from Remainers even in seats that voted heavily for Leave. Farage\u2019s \u201ccountry before party\u201d initiative therefore looks more like an \u201cincumbents before challengers\u201d initiative \u2013 the party founded to shake up the establishment is helping both Conservative and Labour MPs keep their jobs.</p> <p>Farage\u2019s decision has broader implications. By standing down hundreds of candidates, Farage, who just weeks ago was threatening to campaign against Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal up and down the country, is tacitly endorsing it. As a result, we won\u2019t see him on the nation\u2019s TV screens railing against the Conservatives\u2019 \u201cbetrayal of Brexit\u201d. Many Leave voters tempted by the Brexit party, and who often have little trust in the Conservatives or their leader but much affection for Farage, will take the hint. Yet while a Farage endorsement will cement Leave support, it risks repelling Conservative Remainers by reinforcing their concerns that the Tory party is being taken over by extreme Brexiters.</p> <p>The complicated effects of the Brexit party initiative illustrate a broader dilemma for the parties, one often overlooked by those arguing for local pacts to maximise the prospects of Leave or Remain candidates. Parties need to weigh the effects of such pacts on national reputations as well as local contests. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 contortions over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/lib-dem-candidate-stands-aside-to-avoid-nightmare-of-tory-win\" title=\"\">Canterbury candidates</a> last week illustrated the headaches this can produce. Lib Dem candidate Tim Walker announced he was standing down to maximise the chances of the local Labour MP holding off her Conservative challenger. He was backed in this decision by the local party, but immediately overruled by the national leadership, who imposed a new candidate.</p> <p>On the face of it, this behaviour seems bizarre. The Lib Dems are out of the running in Canterbury, so why would the national leadership antagonise local activists and boost Conservative prospects by insisting on standing a candidate? The answer lies on the broader electoral battlefield. Most Lib Dem targets are Conservative-held and usually Remain-leaning seats in suburbia and south England. Attracting wavering Conservative Remainers is crucial for Lib Dem prospects in such seats, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour is anathema to such voters. Hence local Lib-Lab pacts are off the table, even with strongly Remain Labour MPs, because the Liberal Democrats cannot afford to look like friends of Corbyn in their Conservative-held targets.</p> <p>Yet rebuffing Labour too strongly also poses risks, because the Lib Dems also need tactical Labour voters in most of their target seats. The decision to veto local co-operation initiatives risks tarnishing the party\u2019s appeal with Labour voters, who may be more reluctant to lend \u201cstop Brexit\u201d votes to a party that appears reluctant to reciprocate elsewhere. And even if the fuss over Canterbury is soon forgotten, continued expressions of opposition to a Corbyn-led government from Jo Swinson will make it harder for the party to portray itself as a friend to Labour voters in target seats.</p> <p>Similar local v national dilemmas also arise for the three parties \u2013 the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats \u2013 who have agreed to co-operate under the \u201cUnite to Remain\u201d banner in 60 seats. This pact may reap fewer votes than past election results suggest. Many Green and Plaid Cymru voters are well to the left of the Lib Dems, and remain suspicious of the party in the wake of its former coalition with the Conservatives. They may opt to ignore their party\u2019s endorsement and instead back Labour, or stay at home. Reciprocal suspicions exist among many more centrist Lib Dem voters about the Greens and Plaid Cymru. And these reputational effects that stretch beyond the seats where the pact operates will change the national image of the pact members in unpredictable ways.</p> <p>What about Labour? They are the intended target of the Brexit party\u2019s candidate strategy, though it may harm them less than intended, and they stand to lose from Lib Dem competition for Remain votes. They also face an uphill struggle in Scotland, where the SNP is seeking to squeeze Labour Remain voters to deliver a 2015-style Westminster landslide. Yet there may be some upside to these local weaknesses. Many wavering Remain voters dearly want to stop Brexit, yet do not want a radical Labour government. If both local competition patterns and national polling suggest a Labour majority is impossible, it may be easier to persuade such voters that backing Labour will deliver a weak, constrained and Brexit-focused Labour minority, not a majority that unleashes Corbynism.

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives received a boost last week when Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, announced he would not be standing candidates in Tory seats. But the advantage is not what it seems. Brexit party candidates are still standing in most Labour-held seats, including those the Conservatives are targeting. This damages the prospects of Conservative challengers, who draw their support heavily from Leave voters, and are therefore more vulnerable to Brexit party competition than Labour incumbents, whose support comes predominantly from Remainers even in seats that voted heavily for Leave. Farage\u2019s \u201ccountry before party\u201d initiative therefore looks more like an \u201cincumbents before challengers\u201d initiative \u2013 the party founded to shake up the establishment is helping both Conservative and Labour MPs keep their jobs. Farage\u2019s decision has broader implications. By standing down hundreds of candidates, Farage, who just weeks ago was threatening to campaign against Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal up and down the country, is tacitly endorsing it. As a result, we won\u2019t see him on the nation\u2019s TV screens railing against the Conservatives\u2019 \u201cbetrayal of Brexit\u201d. Many Leave voters tempted by the Brexit party, and who often have little trust in the Conservatives or their leader but much affection for Farage, will take the hint. Yet while a Farage endorsement will cement Leave support, it risks repelling Conservative Remainers by reinforcing their concerns that the Tory party is being taken over by extreme Brexiters. The complicated effects of the Brexit party initiative illustrate a broader dilemma for the parties, one often overlooked by those arguing for local pacts to maximise the prospects of Leave or Remain candidates. Parties need to weigh the effects of such pacts on national reputations as well as local contests. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 contortions over Canterbury candidates last week illustrated the headaches this can produce. Lib Dem candidate Tim Walker announced he was standing down to maximise the chances of the local Labour MP holding off her Conservative challenger. He was backed in this decision by the local party, but immediately overruled by the national leadership, who imposed a new candidate. On the face of it, this behaviour seems bizarre. The Lib Dems are out of the running in Canterbury, so why would the national leadership antagonise local activists and boost Conservative prospects by insisting on standing a candidate? The answer lies on the broader electoral battlefield. Most Lib Dem targets are Conservative-held and usually Remain-leaning seats in suburbia and south England. Attracting wavering Conservative Remainers is crucial for Lib Dem prospects in such seats, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour is anathema to such voters. Hence local Lib-Lab pacts are off the table, even with strongly Remain Labour MPs, because the Liberal Democrats cannot afford to look like friends of Corbyn in their Conservative-held targets. Yet rebuffing Labour too strongly also poses risks, because the Lib Dems also need tactical Labour voters in most of their target seats. The decision to veto local co-operation initiatives risks tarnishing the party\u2019s appeal with Labour voters, who may be more reluctant to lend \u201cstop Brexit\u201d votes to a party that appears reluctant to reciprocate elsewhere. And even if the fuss over Canterbury is soon forgotten, continued expressions of opposition to a Corbyn-led government from Jo Swinson will make it harder for the party to portray itself as a friend to Labour voters in target seats. Similar local v national dilemmas also arise for the three parties \u2013 the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats \u2013 who have agreed to co-operate under the \u201cUnite to Remain\u201d banner in 60 seats. This pact may reap fewer votes than past election results suggest. Many Green and Plaid Cymru voters are well to the left of the Lib Dems, and remain suspicious of the party in the wake of its former coalition with the Conservatives. They may opt to ignore their party\u2019s endorsement and instead back Labour, or stay at home. Reciprocal suspicions exist among many more centrist Lib Dem voters about the Greens and Plaid Cymru. And these reputational effects that stretch beyond the seats where the pact operates will change the national image of the pact members in unpredictable ways. What about Labour? They are the intended target of the Brexit party\u2019s candidate strategy, though it may harm them less than intended, and they stand to lose from Lib Dem competition for Remain votes. They also face an uphill struggle in Scotland, where the SNP is seeking to squeeze Labour Remain voters to deliver a 2015-style Westminster landslide. Yet there may be some upside to these local weaknesses. Many wavering Remain voters dearly want to stop Brexit, yet do not want a radical Labour government. If both local competition patterns and national polling suggest a Labour majority is impossible, it may be easier to persuade such voters that backing Labour will deliver a weak, constrained and Brexit-focused Labour minority, not a majority that unleashes Corbynism. Sometimes local pacts do more harm than good nationally, and sometimes local weakness can be a national strength. Robert Ford is professor of politics at the University of Manchester",

Take the offside rule. The rule has become more complicated in recent years, but in essence it states that a player is offside if any part of his body is nearer to the opponents\u2019 goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent.

Instead, the technology can rule even the slightest hint of a supposed infringement \u201coffside\u201d.

That the Premier League could tweet that explanation for the decision in all seriousness shows much of what is wrong with VAR.</p> <p>So, what can we learn from VAR about the broader use of technology? First, that human judgment is indispensable. Technology can help us make better decisions. But, in important issues, it can rarely replace human decision-making.</p> <p>Second, VAR reminds us that context matters. Whether in football or in society, we don\u2019t start with the rules that have to be followed. We start with a vision of how we want the game, or society, to be and use rules, or laws, to achieve those ends. Mechanically enforcing rules or laws, irrespective of the context, makes little sense. Too often, we forget that what algorithms lack is precisely that understanding of context.</p> <p>Third, there are trade-offs. In football, stoppages to check VAR kill the flow of the game and expunge the joy of celebrating a goal that may later be disallowed through a VAR check. Many fans would rather accept old-fashioned refereeing errors to retain the old-fashioned thrill of the game. Similar trade-offs exist in our social lives, for instance, between the ease that technology provides and the loss of privacy it often entails. We need a proper acknowledgement of, and public debate about, such trade-offs.</p> <p>Finally, VAR shows that we should be wary of imagining technology as necessarily providing more objective answers. A machine or an algorithm is only as good as the humans who created it and the data with which it\u2019s fed. That is why algorithms are <a href=\"https://www.mtu.edu/magazine/2019-1/stories/algorithm-bias/\" title=\"\">often biased in their working</a>. And why debates about refereeing don\u2019t end with the introduction of VAR. Technology may amplify rather than eliminate the flaws of human judgment.</p> <p>Technology is a boon. We should, however, be wary of overestimating its ability to provide better answers and underestimating the significance of human judgment.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

That the Premier League could tweet that explanation for the decision in all seriousness shows much of what is wrong with VAR. So, what can we learn from VAR about the broader use of technology? First, that human judgment is indispensable. Technology can help us make better decisions. But, in important issues, it can rarely replace human decision-making. Second, VAR reminds us that context matters. Whether in football or in society, we don\u2019t start with the rules that have to be followed. We start with a vision of how we want the game, or society, to be and use rules, or laws, to achieve those ends. Mechanically enforcing rules or laws, irrespective of the context, makes little sense. Too often, we forget that what algorithms lack is precisely that understanding of context. Third, there are trade-offs. In football, stoppages to check VAR kill the flow of the game and expunge the joy of celebrating a goal that may later be disallowed through a VAR check. Many fans would rather accept old-fashioned refereeing errors to retain the old-fashioned thrill of the game. Similar trade-offs exist in our social lives, for instance, between the ease that technology provides and the loss of privacy it often entails. We need a proper acknowledgement of, and public debate about, such trade-offs. Finally, VAR shows that we should be wary of imagining technology as necessarily providing more objective answers. A machine or an algorithm is only as good as the humans who created it and the data with which it\u2019s fed. That is why algorithms are often biased in their working. And why debates about refereeing don\u2019t end with the introduction of VAR. Technology may amplify rather than eliminate the flaws of human judgment. Technology is a boon. We should, however, be wary of overestimating its ability to provide better answers and underestimating the significance of human judgment. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

And they demand the green light for full access to Britain\u2019s public health system for private profit.</p> <p>Our public services are not bargaining chips to be traded in secret deals. I pledge a Labour government will exclude the NHS, medicines and public services from any trade deals \u2013 and make that binding in law.</p> <p>Mega-corporations see Johnson\u2019s toxic alliance with Donald Trump as a chance to make billions from sick people in Britain and around the world. His hard-right Brexit plans depend on a corporate-driven trade deal with America post-election.</p> <p>Claims that this is scaremongering simply ignore the facts. US and British government officials have met six times in secret and discussed the cost of medicines. British officials have even met US drugs firms directly. When campaigners forced the release of reports about the meetings, <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2019/nov/14/boris-johnson-must-release-secret-trump-trade-files-general-election\" title=\"\">the government censored almost every word in them</a>, with page after page of blacked out lines.</p> <p>Johnson must come clean and immediately publish in full all documents relating to those meetings. And he must finally publish the UK\u2019s official negotiating objectives \u2013 as the US has. The public deserves to know what is being sold off in a deal with Trump.</p> <p><a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Summary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf\" title=\"\">US negotiating objectives</a> demand \u201cfull market access\u201d in the UK for American pharmaceutical companies: meaning an end to drug price controls in plain language. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44087735\" title=\"\">complained loudly</a> about what he calls the \u201cunreasonably low prices\u201d other countries pay for medicines, and the US insisted on including pharmaceuticals in recent trade deals with Canada, Mexico and South Korea.</p> <p>Trump is determined to push up the price we pay for drugs so US big pharma can suck out more profits from the provision of vital medicines to patients. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/nhs-drugs-bill-could-soar-if-johnson-signs-trump-trade-deal-report\" title=\"\">As senior NHS managers have warned</a>, the planned Trump trade deal will \u201cpass on costs to both patients and the NHS\u201d.</p> <p>Lives will certainly be put at risk, and \u00a3500m a week would more than wipe out Johnson\u2019s commitments to the NHS: the equivalent of a new hospital, 20,000 newly qualified nurses, or 50,000 hip operations lost every week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7aa02da59b79f07e91b407aa5ec4c1749c1e3bc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aa02da59b79f07e91b407aa5ec4c1749c1e3bc6/0_11_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allowing US companies to force up the price of drugs would wipe out Boris Johnson\u2019s commitments to the NHS.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allowing US companies to force up the price of drugs would wipe out Boris Johnson\u2019s commitments to the NHS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some have claimed the \u00a3500m figure is fantasy. Not so. The calculation comes from Dr Andrew Hill of Liverpool University, an adviser to the World Health Organisation. It is based on the extra cost if we have to pay US prices for drugs, which are on average 250% higher than ours.</p> <p>The fact that only a proportion of the medicines we buy come from the US provides no comfort. Trump\u2019s demands would not just benefit US pharma corporations, they would dismantle the entire UK system for controlling drug prices.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.phrma.org/-/media/Project/PhRMA/PhRMA-Org/PhRMA-Org/PDF/PhRMA-Comments-on-US-UK-Trade-Agreement.pdf\" title=\"\">That has been made explicit</a> by the multibillion dollar US pharmaceutical industry, which has singled out Nice, which approves treatments for use by the NHS, as a \u201cbarrier\u201d to be \u201celiminated\u201d in trade talks because they correctly see it as a \u201ccost containment tool\u201d. Break the NHS\u2019s ability to negotiate, and prices will soar in a US-style rigged market. Trump will use this standard to force up prices around the world.</p> <p>Drug prices used to be similar on both sides of the Atlantic, but the relentless pressure of the pharma lobby warped the US system. Big pharma has ripped off and imperilled the health of the American people ever since. Now it wants to do the same to us as part of a post-election sellout Brexit trade deal with Johnson.</p> <p>US big business is licking its lips. Just this month, <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/report/services-priorities-future-us-uk-trade-agreement\" title=\"\">two powerful business bodies</a> enthusiasticallypredicted public opposition to the inclusion of the NHS in trade talks would be \u201ceasier to overcome\u201d with Johnson in charge.</p> <p>But why, some commentators ask, would a Conservative government agree to this? The answer is that any trade deal involves both parties getting at least something they want. For Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, that means \u201cas much market access as possible for UK financial services\u201d to break into the US, as former trade minister Greg Hands has revealed. As ever, the Tories\u2019 priority is looking out for the bankers and hedge fund speculators who fund them.</p> <p>The Conservatives have form when it comes to selling out our NHS \u2013 they have tried to include health services in every recent trade negotiation. So under Johnson\u2019s Conservatives we can look forward to far more privatisation in the NHS as part of his hard-right Brexit deal. Or we can reject the toxic alliance of Johnson, Trump and Nigel Farage \u2013 the three privateers \u2013 and elect a Labour government to rescue our NHS with 24,000 more nurses, 5,000 more GPs, shorter waiting times and a publicly owned medicine company.</p> <p>Our NHS is not for sale.

      "bodyText": "There is a plot against our NHS. Boris Johnson is engaged in a cover-up of secret talks for a sell-out American trade deal that would drive up the cost of medicines and lead to runaway privatisation of our health service. US corporations want to force up the price we pay for drugs, which could drain \u00a3500m a week from the NHS. And they demand the green light for full access to Britain\u2019s public health system for private profit. Our public services are not bargaining chips to be traded in secret deals. I pledge a Labour government will exclude the NHS, medicines and public services from any trade deals \u2013 and make that binding in law. Mega-corporations see Johnson\u2019s toxic alliance with Donald Trump as a chance to make billions from sick people in Britain and around the world. His hard-right Brexit plans depend on a corporate-driven trade deal with America post-election. Claims that this is scaremongering simply ignore the facts. US and British government officials have met six times in secret and discussed the cost of medicines. British officials have even met US drugs firms directly. When campaigners forced the release of reports about the meetings, the government censored almost every word in them, with page after page of blacked out lines. Johnson must come clean and immediately publish in full all documents relating to those meetings. And he must finally publish the UK\u2019s official negotiating objectives \u2013 as the US has. The public deserves to know what is being sold off in a deal with Trump. US negotiating objectives demand \u201cfull market access\u201d in the UK for American pharmaceutical companies: meaning an end to drug price controls in plain language. Trump has complained loudly about what he calls the \u201cunreasonably low prices\u201d other countries pay for medicines, and the US insisted on including pharmaceuticals in recent trade deals with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. Trump is determined to push up the price we pay for drugs so US big pharma can suck out more profits from the provision of vital medicines to patients. As senior NHS managers have warned, the planned Trump trade deal will \u201cpass on costs to both patients and the NHS\u201d. Lives will certainly be put at risk, and \u00a3500m a week would more than wipe out Johnson\u2019s commitments to the NHS: the equivalent of a new hospital, 20,000 newly qualified nurses, or 50,000 hip operations lost every week. Some have claimed the \u00a3500m figure is fantasy. Not so. The calculation comes from Dr Andrew Hill of Liverpool University, an adviser to the World Health Organisation. It is based on the extra cost if we have to pay US prices for drugs, which are on average 250% higher than ours. The fact that only a proportion of the medicines we buy come from the US provides no comfort. Trump\u2019s demands would not just benefit US pharma corporations, they would dismantle the entire UK system for controlling drug prices. That has been made explicit by the multibillion dollar US pharmaceutical industry, which has singled out Nice, which approves treatments for use by the NHS, as a \u201cbarrier\u201d to be \u201celiminated\u201d in trade talks because they correctly see it as a \u201ccost containment tool\u201d. Break the NHS\u2019s ability to negotiate, and prices will soar in a US-style rigged market. Trump will use this standard to force up prices around the world. Drug prices used to be similar on both sides of the Atlantic, but the relentless pressure of the pharma lobby warped the US system. Big pharma has ripped off and imperilled the health of the American people ever since. Now it wants to do the same to us as part of a post-election sellout Brexit trade deal with Johnson. US big business is licking its lips. Just this month, two powerful business bodies enthusiasticallypredicted public opposition to the inclusion of the NHS in trade talks would be \u201ceasier to overcome\u201d with Johnson in charge. But why, some commentators ask, would a Conservative government agree to this? The answer is that any trade deal involves both parties getting at least something they want. For Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, that means \u201cas much market access as possible for UK financial services\u201d to break into the US, as former trade minister Greg Hands has revealed. As ever, the Tories\u2019 priority is looking out for the bankers and hedge fund speculators who fund them. The Conservatives have form when it comes to selling out our NHS \u2013 they have tried to include health services in every recent trade negotiation. So under Johnson\u2019s Conservatives we can look forward to far more privatisation in the NHS as part of his hard-right Brexit deal. Or we can reject the toxic alliance of Johnson, Trump and Nigel Farage \u2013 the three privateers \u2013 and elect a Labour government to rescue our NHS with 24,000 more nurses, 5,000 more GPs, shorter waiting times and a publicly owned medicine company. Our NHS is not for sale. Labour will invest properly in the health service, develop generic medicines, never hand over an extra \u00a3500m a week to big drugs companies and reverse the privatisation of our NHS.",

      "bodyText": "Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson scored the goals, as Wales kept themselves in contention for automatic qualification. Ryan Giggs speaks: \u201cThe performance could be better but the result was the main thing,\u201d the Wales manager tells Sky Sports. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with a lot of what we did and depending on results elsewhere it sets us up nicely for Tuesday.\u201d On Moore\u2019s performance: \u201cHe\u2019s a threat and always a danger at set-piece,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought they might be weak at set-pieces and it\u2019s nice to get the big man on the scoresheet again.\u201d He goes on to say it\u2019s \u201chard to get too excited\u201d because of Wales a favour, Tuesday\u2019s night match will be very special. Kieffer Moore speaks: \u201cI mean it\u2019s massive for us to get three points,\u201d he says, in an interview with Sky Sports. \u201cRoll on Tuesday. I\u2019m really enjoying [international football] and long may it continue. We came here for the three points and now it\u2019s all guns blazing for Tuesday. We\u2019re very confident - we\u2019ve got a game plan we want to stick to.\u201d A good win for Wales. They\u2019ll be hoping Slovakia drop points against Croatia tonight, in which case a win against Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday would guarantee them a place at Euro 2020. Even if things don\u2019t go their way, they still have a guaranteed play-off place to fall back on in March, but let\u2019s hope that won\u2019t be required. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It\u2019s all over in Baku, where Wales have beaten their hosts courtesy of first half goals by Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson. 90+5 min: Khalilzade wins a free-kick for his side after being tackled from behind by Ben Davies. The ball\u2019s crossed from deep by Garayev, but ends up going wide. 90+3 min: We\u2019re in the third minute of five recommended and Azerbaijan win a free-kick just inside the Wales half. The ball is played wide after Matondo gives the ball away, but Garayev gives it straight back to Kieffer Moore. Correction: Ethan Ampadu was replaced by Will Vaulks, not Sam Vokes. An easy mistake to make, but one for which yours truly humbly apologises nonetheless. 89 min: There are mass handbags down in one corner after a coming together between Connor Roberts and Ramazanov. Shahriyar Rahimov throws in his two cents, going forehead to forehead with the Wales right-back and gets booked for his troubles. 87 min: Wales substitution: Will Vokes on, Ethan Ampadu off, in a state of affairs that suggests Ryan Giggs has somebody reading this minute-by-minute report in the dugout and has asked them \u201cWhat does Barry think we should do?\u201d 85 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Azerbaijan skipper Gara Garayev has a large blue bandage wrapped around his head, which I\u2019m guessing he banged off somebody else\u2019s head. 84 min: Azerbaijan substitution: Javid Huseynov on, Dimitrij Nazarov off. 82 min: Wales substitution: Dan James off, FC Schalke\u2019s Rabbi Matondo on. 81 min: Joe Morrell gets booked for a tap on the ankles of Sheydayev. Free-kick for Azerbaijan in a good position about 30 yards from goal. Nazarov stands over the dead ball, before sending his effort over the bar. 79 min: Already booked, Ampadu continues to skate on thin metaphorical ice, clattering into an opponent from behind as he contests a header. If I was Ryan Giggs, I\u2019d be thinking about taking him off before he gets sent off. 78 min: Ramsey plays the ball wide to Wilson, who sends in a cross. Moore wins the header, but is unable to steer it on target. 77 min: It\u2019s all a bit flat in Baku, despite the best attempts of the Wales fans who are present to drum up a bit of atmosphere with a stirring rendition of their national anthem. 75 min: Ramil Sheydayev wins a corner for his team after finding a yard of space to unleash a shot in the Wales penalty area. Nothing comes from the set-piece. 74 min: Kieffer Moore, who\u2019s really been putting himself about tonight, picks up a pass from James and pulls a low diagonal drive wide of the far upright. 73 min: Dan James makes a good run towards the edge of the Azerbaijan penalty area, but his pass into it is wayward and he fails to pick out a teammate. 70 min: Wales continue to keep their hosts under pressure. Roberts sends a cross in from the left towards Moore, whose flicked header fizzes wide of the back post. 67 min: Connor Roberts goes down in the Azerbaijan box under a challenge from Khalilzade and appeals in vain for a penalty. Seems fair enough to me. Moments later, Ethan Amapadu, on a yellow from the first half, looks nervously at the referee after being penalised for another foul. Herr Ayetkin\u2019s cards stay in his pockets on this occasion. 64 min: Azerbaijan substitution: Abdoullayev off, Agabala Ramazanov on. 62 min: Kieffer Moore receives a pass from Ramsey and sends a low shot wide but it takes a deflection en route. A corner for Wales, which Azerbaijan clear. 61 min: Ramsey gets his first taste of action, down by the Azerbaijan byline and appeals for a free-kick after being brought down. The ref is not having it and awards a goal-kick to the home side. 59 min: Wales substitution: Gareth Bale makes way for Aaron Ramsey, who takes the armband from his friend and colleague and comes on for his first bit of action in this set of qualifiers. 58 min: Dan James plays the ball into the Azerbaijan penalty area, but his pass carries straight through to the goalkeeper. 56 min: A low, diagonal, left-footed drive from Harry Wilson is touched behind by Balayev at full stretch. It was a fine effort by Wilson, but an even better save by the goalkeeper, whose strong left hand prevented his side from going three down. 54 min: Ramil Sheydiyev gets in behind and Connor Roberts, but runs out of road before he can pull the ball back from the byline and into the Wales penalty area in a bid to tee up a teammate. Goal kick. 52 min: Nazarov and Ampadu both need medical attention after a midfield collision in which both players hurt themselves after a clash of knees. Both are passed fit to continue and play resumes. 50 min: Bale and James combine well down the left flank, before the latter sends a cross deep towards Moore. He fails to win the header, but will settle for the corner instead. From the ensuing inswinger, Tom Lockyer stoops to head home from close range, but his \u201cgoal\u201d won\u2019t stand, as Ethan Ampadu is adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper Emil Balayev as he came for the ball. 49 min: Azerbaijan continue to put Wales under pressure during their best spell of the game so far. They win another corner, which is cleared by Moore before the ball is helped on its way by Bale. 47 min: Another corner for Azerbaijan, which is taken short. Under a heavy press, they fail to get a cross into the Wales penalty area and the ball ends up at the feet of their goalkeeper Emil Balayev at the far end of the pitch. 46 min: Play resumes, with one change on the Azerbaijan team. Anton Krivotsyuk makes way for the more attack-minded Tamkin Khalilzade ... I think. Azerbaijan win an early corner, but the delivery is poor and over-hit. Goal kick for Wales. A good 45 minutes for Wales: Kieffer Moore opened the scoring with a back post header at a corner, before Harry Wilson doubled Wales\u2019s lead in Baku when finding himself in the right place at the right time to capitalise after Dan James hit the woodwork with a fine shot. Wales are in the driving seat and it\u2019s no more than they deserve. 45 min: Nazarov is lucky to avoid a second yellow for \u201cFernandinho-ing\u201d Dan James in a bid to break up a Wales counter-attack. 44 min: Dan James has another shot at goal, but sends this one high and wide. Looking at replays of that Lockyer \u201chandball\u201d, I think Mr Nazarov might have had a point when he argued his side\u2019s case for a penalty. There\u2019s no VAR in operation during these Euro qualifiers, but I think if referee Deniz Aytekin had video assistance he might have changed his mind on that one. 43 min: Azerbaijan win another corner, which is cleared at the near post by Moore. 39 min: Led by Nazarov, Azerbaijan appeal for a penalty for hand-ball, when a shot from close range strikes the arm of Tom Lockyer. The ref agrees the player handled but explains he had no chance of getting his arm out of the way and books Nazarov for his troubles. 36 min: That was a splendid effort from Dan James, who cut inside and beat Balayev with a curling shot, only to be thwarted by the woodwork. Luckily for Wales, the ball bounced kindly for Wilson, whose task could not have been simpler. Wales double their lead! On the coutner-attack, Daniel James hits the woodwork while trying to rifle the ball into the top corner. With the goalkeeper beaten all ends up, the ball drops down and bounces up for Harry Wilson, who is on hand to nod home into the empty goal from a couple of yards out. 31 min: Wales blow a great chance to double their lead, with Balyev coming quickly out to save at the feet of Moore with his outstretched leg when the player found himself through on goal with only the goalkeeper to beat after latching on to a brilliantly weighted pass into the penalty area from Dan James. 30 min: Free-kick for Wales about 35 metres from goal after Moore almost has the shirt ripped off his back. Wilson plays the ball to the far post, where Moore was in place to head across the face of goal. Azerbaijan clear. 28 min: Kieffer Moore heads straight at Balayev after great build-up play down the right flank by Gareth Bale, who picked out his team-mate with a right-footed cross from near the corner flag. 27 min: Wales win another corner and the ball is swung into the penalty area. Moore rises to get his head to the ball, but his looping header doesn\u2019t trouble Balayev in the Azerbaijan goal. 25 min: Rahimov and Krivotsyuk combine down the left flank and send a cross into the Wales penalty area. Connor Roberts rises to head clear and the ball drops kindly for Garayev. Is shot from distance sails over the bar. 23 min: Ethan Ampadu shepherds the ball out of play under pressure from Shahriyar Rahimov after Azerbaijan get forward again. Goal-kick for Wales. 21 min: Ethan Ampadu wins the second ball and plays it into space down the right channel for Moore to chase. Azerbaijan clear, with Anton Krivotsyuk doing the leg-work. 20 min: Another cross into the Wales box from the right and this time it\u2019s dealt with by Mepham, albeit unconvincingly. Wales have been sitting back since scoring and are allowing Azerbaijan to work their way into the game. 18 min: Connor Roberts steps up to leather a cross from the right up the pitch. It comes back his way and this time Ben Davies shepherds it out of play and Wales have a goal kick. 16 min: Wilson dribbles the ball towards the edge of the Azerbaijan penalty area, before playing the ball into the path of Bale, who had made a run. the home side clear. 14 min: Ethan Ampadu is booked for a late challenge on Gara Garayev, catching the Azrbaijan captain on the shin in the process. 12 min: Azerbaijan win their first corner of the game. It\u2019s played short and eventually crossed into the Wales penalty area. Richard Almeida gets his head to the ball, but is unable to steer it goalwards. 11 min: The Wigan striker\u2019s header took a deflection off the shoulder of an Azerbaijan defender on its way into the goal, but there\u2019s no doubting who\u2019ll be credited with the goal. Wales lead! From the corner, taken by Harry Wilson, Kieffer Moore rises highest to head home at the far post from a couple of yards out. 9 min: Joe Morrell brings a smart save out of Balayev with a good strike from distance. Corner for Wales ... 7 min: Gareth Bale sends a cross into the Azerbaijan penalty area, looking for Kieffer Moore. The defensive header from Bahlul Mustafazade is poor and the ball breaks to Harry Wilson. He takes too many touches before shooting. Azerbaijan goalkeeper Emil Balayev dives to save his shot, which was going wide anyway. 6 min: Chris Mepham tries to release Ben Davies up the left flank, but the full-back is unable to reach the ball. Moments later, Mepham concedes a free-kick just for a late tackle. His inclusion tonight at the expense of Ashley Williams is possibly the controversial selection by Ryan Giggs. Mepham is not playing for Bournemouth at the moment, while Williams is a regular in the Bristol City ranks. 4 min: On his competitive debut for his country, Joe Morrell appeals for a free-kick on the edge of the Azerbaijan penalty area after being barged over by Nazarov. None is forthcoming. 3 min: Wayne Hennessey gets his first touch of the evening in the Welsh goal. He controls a back-pass and hoofs the ball far up the pitch. 1 min: Wales play keep-ball inside the Azerbaijan half, probing for an opening. An early cross into the penalty area from Dan James is headed clear by Dimitrij Nazarov. 1 min: Azerbaijan get the ball rolling in Baku and Wales immediately win possession and go on the attack. They win an early throw-in, deep in Azerbaijan territory. Not long now: The players line up in the tunnel and make their way out on to the pitch in the 11,000 capacity Bakcell Arena. The players of Azerbaijan wear blue shirts, blue shorts and blue socks. Their visitors, led out by Gareth Bale, wear red shirts, red shorts and red socks. The stadium is far from full, but there are a hardy band of travelling Welshman occupying one section. We\u2019re a couple of national anthems and a coin-toss away from kick-off ... Azerbaijan: Balayev, Pashaev, Mustafazade, Badavi Huseynov, Krivotsyuk, Abdullayev, Nazarov, Garayev, Richard, Rahimov, Sheydayev. Subs: Sahriyar Aliyev, Renat Dadashov, Isgenderli, Cavid Huseynov, Dzhenetov, Abbas Huseynov, Mahmudov, Ramazanov, Khalilzade, Agayev, Camalov. Wales: Hennessey, Connor Roberts, Lockyer, Mepham, Ben Davies, Wilson, Ampadu, Morrell, James, Bale, Moore. Subs: Levitt, King, Matondo, Vokes, Ramsey, Tyler Roberts, Vaulks, Smith, Adam Davies, Williams, Gunter, Jamie Lawrence. Latest team news Gareth Bale will captain Wales this evening, despite not having played for over a month because of a calf problem. Aaron Ramsey, yet to play in Euro 2020 qualifying, will have to wait a little longer to make his bow after being named on the bench.

For Labour, they are a chance to showcase their popular spending plans on free broadband and the NHS \u2013 and demonstrate that Corbyn can hold his own against Johnson.

Politicians do things for no discernible reason other than to be seen to be doing something, or to put on a show that will elevate their profile or position. Once the New South Wales and Queensland fires reached a critical level, politicians were always going to do all they could to be seen to be involved. The problem is that during such a crisis there is very little for a prime minister to do. He actually has no role \u2013 the fire services are state based, and anything that will require federal coordination, whether it be Australian federal police or Australian Defence Force, does not really need the prime minister at all. In reality, he just gets in the way. But getting in the way is expected of prime ministers at such times. When an emergency such as this occurs, the PM is expected to be there, touring around, being seen listening to briefings by the local emergency services chief, with a bit of looking at maps and so forth, and showing emotion. Scott Morrison this week was not actually doing anything of note \u2013 and to be honest, neither was the ALP leader, Anthony Albanese, who also toured parts of NSW and received a briefing on the situation. About the best the PM could have done this week was made sure the NSW fires services had the phone number of the ADF to contact and then to let them get on with their work. But had he done that, the criticism of course would have been about where was he, why hadn\u2019t he visited the scene, talked with emergency services and so on.

Andrew Bolt wrote a column in which he was at pains to say that while he thought her tears were genuine, \u201cit will seem calculated to some\u201d because she needed to show that she was not wooden.) Morrison, the man from marketing, sure as heck was not going to make the mistake of appearing too wooden \u2013 he is very much a politician in tune with the performative nature of the job. We saw this during the election campaign when he would \u201cdo things\u201d that made the travelling press pack happy because it gave them something to report about. He also knows how to make use of a crisis. Does anyone remember the crisis of needles in strawberries? In reality the biggest concern was the risk of copycat acts due to the attention Morrison gave the contamination scare, but nevertheless he used the occasion to perform the role of the leader who was tough on crime. He also used the occasion to rush through laws that were neither asked for nor needed, but which show that while we might dismiss the performative art of politics as a sideshow, politicians on their game will use it to push their agenda and get their way. Our media system is driven by what Italian media academic Gianpietro Mazzoleni calls \u201cspectacularisation\u201d \u2013 the demand for the spectacle in our political news \u2013 and good politicians use it to their advantage. And so Morrison brings in a lump of coal to parliament. Why? The performance \u2013 it annoys the left and it is a good spectacle. The ALP this week has tried their best to not provide any spectacle. There was no fightback of any real note against the idiocy of Barnaby Joyce or Michael McCormack \u2013 a lot of \u201cnow is not the time\u201d. And that might seem the mature and sensible response, and yet with the spectacle and the performative aspect of politics comes the opportunity to sell your policy and push your agenda Australia is burning, and it is burning because of climate change. Scientists and fire chiefs know this \u2013 and they have been ignored by the government. That\u2019s reason enough for the ALP to raise the issue with fervour. This week the Swedish central bank sold off Australian government bonds because of our high emissions dependency. That won\u2019t be the last time climate change has a major impact in international finance. We all know it is coming, but the government chooses to ignore it and suggests we put off discussion for another time. We should be talking about it now \u2013 no debate on climate change is going to hamper the ability of firefighters to do their job. No firefighter is standing off to the side waiting for Albanese and Morrison to finish their debate so they can go off and put out a fire. It might seem mature to wait for a more appropriate occasion to talk about climate change and bushfires, but politics is about capturing the moment. The conservative side of politics knows this, and uses it again and again on issues of national security and crime. Conservatives want to wait, because they want to wait until a time when the public will be less invested, less angry and less attentive. Next month it will be Christmas holidays and the attention of voters will be gone. Progressives too often cower and take the mature road and let opportunities go begging. The performance and spectacle of politics might be annoying and distracting but it can\u2019t be ignored. The ALP did not need to come out this week going over the top like Joyce and McCormack, but they need to use these occasions to capture the imagination of the public and push for action. Because if you can\u2019t bring yourself to talk about climate change while the country is burning, then you can\u2019t blame voters for thinking it must not be that big of a deal, or just as bad, that the ALP doesn\u2019t really care. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "When John Andrews was 51, he lost his job. It was the early 1990s, Bob Hawke was prime minister, Paul Keating treasurer, and Australia was in deep recession. Unemployment was close to 11%. Andrews was just one of the many, suddenly out of work after three decades working in IT. \u201cAs the saying goes, they let me go.\u201d Andrews had never been out of work and the experience changed him. He got short-term jobs here and there, but didn\u2019t find a permanent role for five years. For most of that time he survived on unemployment benefits. It wasn\u2019t just the recession; it was his age, a form of discrimination that lingers still. \u201cI soon found out that it was hard for a 50-year-old to get employment,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing that I remember most is when I was being interviewed by one of these placement organisations and the person interviewing me said something like, \u2018well the manager of this area is 35 and my feeling is that he won\u2019t be entirely happy having 50-year-olds working for him\u2019.\u201d At the same time, Andrews\u2019 son Paul, aged 20, had graduated with an arts degree at the University of Sydney and couldn\u2019t find a job. He, too, went on unemployment benefits. \u201cI walked straight bang into a year\u2019s worth of unemployment; it was not a predicament I ever expected myself to be in.\u201d Recessions hit young people especially hard. Companies cut back apprenticeships and put on fewer trainees. In 1992, the unemployment rate for 20-to-24-year-olds reached 17%. Behind economic data, inflation reports, consumer confidence measures, interest rates, business investment, there are human beings. Buffeted by international headwinds, Australia\u2019s economic growth is at its lowest since the global financial crisis a decade ago, with stagnant wage growth and limp consumer confidence and business investment. Last week saw another hint of a stumbling economy \u2013 with lacklustre retail spending the weakest since the 1990s recession \u2013 and this week saw the jobs rate drop for the first time in three years. But economists such as Stephen Koukoulas don\u2019t believe a recession is likely, taking into account factors such as infrastructure spending and healthy exports. The reserve bank\u2019s interest rate cuts may begin to have an impact on household spending, although they have not done so yet. Whether or not a recession is likely, few Australians remember what a recession actually is. Sixty percent of the current workforce was too young to be in work when the last recession hit in 1990, 29 years ago. The conventional definition of recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product growth \u2013 is often considered inadequate, with high unemployment also critical. But in the September quarter of 1990, there had been a 1.8% fall in GDP, which measures the size of the economy in terms of the monetary value of goods and services during a defined period. The formal recession continued until the September quarter of 1991, although unemployment remained stubbornly high for several years. It was the \u201cjobless recovery\u201d. The causes of that recession, which were global \u2013 and whether the Australian government could have made it less severe \u2013 are debated still. But recessions are awful. As Greg Jericho wrote for Guardian Australia recently: \u201cRecessions not only wreck the economy and lives; they utterly change society.\u201d Recovery is slow and uneven, and some people never fully recover. Jobs are lost and relationships fray. Thirty-one out of 38 studies on the impact of recessions found that suicide rates increase during downturns. Andrews, now 78, says it changed the way he viewed the world. \u201cA friend that we have had forever and still have, she told me I could get a job if I wanted to. It\u2019s still the case that many people think that unemployed people choose to be unemployed, and many poor people choose to be poor. So these people revealed themselves to me as being basically heartless.\u201d At one point, he received a letter in the mail recommending increased security against burglary because there were so many unemployed people in the area. He was furious. He and his wife, Sue, sold their house in Northbridge to buy somewhere cheaper. \u201cWe thought we should prepare for never getting a job again.\u201d Five years later, he did get a permanent job working in IT at Macquarie University, on less pay than he had received before. His years of unemployment made him think deeply about what we owe each other. \u201cThe 1990s experience made me angry and made me far stronger in my belief that were all in this together.\u201d For son Paul, now media manager at St Vincent\u2019s Health Australia, it meant beginning his working life unable to get work. His family wasn\u2019t desperate, and he was able to live at home, but his confidence in his future wavered. \u201cIt was a classic thing, hitting brick walls for the jobs that you wanted, and suddenly, it\u2019s a bit dire, applying for second-rung or third-rung jobs I had no interest in or no conception of a career in, and getting knockbacks for those, too. \u201cIt was like a big vacuum sucking out of the room all your aspirations.\u201d Flick through the newspapers of the time and the issues and the politics were different \u2013 Maggie Thatcher lost office and Patrick White died, and the first Gulf war dominated headlines for months. Yet there are echoes of today\u2019s debate. There was denial. Two days before the March 1990 election, Keating stated \u201cwe won\u2019t let there be a recession\u201d.

There were only three jobs for every 100 people unemployed. Bankruptcies soared \u2013 more than 30% higher in the September quarter of 1990 than in the same period of the previous year \u2013 spurred by crippling interest rates of 17%. The economic downturn and the Gulf crisis pushed consumer confidence to an all-time low. School leavers at the end of 1990 were advised to delay their post-school holidays and apply for work immediately. Then there were the unexpected impacts.

The economy and the workforce were different then, but there are echoes of the debate now about whether the government should be stimulating the economy more rather than holding to its top priority of achieving a budget surplus to prepare for future shocks. The 1990-91 recession was not Australia\u2019s first, but Koukoulas believed it was \u201cabout as bad as they got since the great depression\u201d. And while he didn\u2019t suffer personally, he said that: \u201cPeople do suffer greatly \u2026 you do whatever it takes, even if it means radical policies, to avoid it.\u201d Then industry minister John Button described the recession as a time when \u201cmisery and despair descended on the country like a yellow fog\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It was just over 25 years ago that the Keating government minister Ros Kelly resigned over what had become known as the \u201csports rorts\u201d affair. Pork barrelling in the lead-up to the 1993 election had seen grants for small sporting clubs directed to marginal Labor-held electorates, with the auditor general tabling a report that savaged the administration of the program. Kelly had explained her use of a \u201cbig white board\u201d when deciding which projects to support, and the rolling scandal led to her resignation from cabinet in February 1994. Fast-forward 10 years and it was the Coalition\u2019s turn, with the Regional Partnerships program making headlines and the Nationals on the back foot over its own \u201cregional rorts\u201d program. \u201cThe Regional Partnerships program is nothing more than a Nationals slush fund, a $150m pork barrel administered by the leader of the Nationals himself,\u201d Labor\u2019s Kelvin Thomson said. It was a case of deja vu when the national audit office last week delivered its report into the Coalition\u2019s $221m Regional Jobs and Investment Packages program \u2013 tabled quietly on Tuesday afternoon while much of the nation was watching the Melbourne Cup. The auditor general, Grant Hehir, pulled no punches in his review of the program, finding it had been poorly administered, with conflicts of interest undeclared and ministers ignoring departmental advice about which projects to fund. The most damning statistic was the number of projects approved against the advice of the department. The ministerial panel that made the decisions declined to fund 28% of grant applications recommended to them by officials, but approved 17% of applications that had not been recommended to them. Of the 232 projects approved, there were 132 applications where the panel\u2019s ultimate funding decision differed from the departmental recommendation. There were two ministerial panels overseeing the grants program. The first three regions were decided by a panel chaired by the then infrastructure minister, Darren Chester, along with the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, and the Liberal senators James McGrath and Michaelia Cash. The remaining regions were decided by a second panel chaired by then minister for regional development, John McVeigh, along with McCormack, McGrath and the then local government minister, Bridget McKenzie, who replaced Cash. The audit found that the ministerial panel overturned decisions by objecting to the scoring of certain projects, but they were never reassessed. \u201cThis adversely affected accountability as it meant there was not a clear line of sight between the departmental assessment results, the subsequent adjustments by the ministerial panel and the funding decisions,\u201d Hehir said. \u201cApplications were not soundly assessed in accordance with the program guidelines.\u201d The RJIP scheme was hatched during Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s marathon eight-week election campaign in mid-2016, which was centred on the campaign slogan of \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. Turnbull hailed the $200m scheme as needed to diversify regional economies, boost export opportunities and create jobs. It was relished by regional marginal-seat MPs who promoted the benefits of the commitment to their constituents in the lead-up to the 2016 poll. In the two years following \u2013 in the run-up to Scott Morrison\u2019s election this year \u2013 the cash began to flow, providing countless media opportunities for ministers and marginal seat MPs. The objective of the initiative was to create jobs in regions in five states \u2013 the Bowen Basin, tropical north Queensland and Wide Bay Burnett in Queensland; the north and south coast of New South Wales; the upper Spencer Gulf in South Australia; Geelong, the Goulburn Valley and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, and regional Tasmania. Under the requirements of the grant scheme, applicants were required to spend a matching amount to the government contribution, with the guidelines emphasising the importance of leveraging investment from the private sector. This element of the scheme has been promoted extensively by the government, with the Coalition claiming the $220.5m in taxpayer funded grants has leveraged $467.8m from the private sector that would stimulate regional development and jobs. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cDespite assertions being made and the cherry-picking of certain sections of the ANAO report, it is worth noting the report concluded there was no bias evident in the assessment and decision-making process concerning funding of projects in RJIP regions over others,\u201d a spokeswoman for McCormack said following the audit\u2019s release. But since the auditor\u2019s report, Guardian Australia has uncovered a series of projects that have raised further concerns about the administration of the scheme, and in particular, the ability of some applicants to meet the co-funding requirements. In the NSW marginal seat of Gilmore, the Coalition awarded a $205,000 grant to a dog breeder to build an aquaculture project on the south coast, with the venture to be funded by raising $5m on the blockchain market by issuing \u201caqua tokens\u201d that offered a return to investors based on the price of fish. The project has stalled. Another project in the same electorate received $750,000 while possibly trading insolvent, and in another instance, a grant in north Queensland was provided to a bus and ferry project that is losing money and is unlikely to happen for two more years. The auditor general also revealed that two projects that were granted co-funding exemption were given the reprieve in breach of the program\u2019s guidelines, while big political donors have also benefited from the scheme. Scrutiny of the project will continue. So far, the government has refused to reveal which projects were approved against the recommendations of the department, claiming information relating to individual projects is commercial-in-confidence. Following a Senate order to produce the departmental briefings that underpinned decisions made by ministers, the government refused, defying the order and saying it needed more time to assess the request. \u201cAdditional time is required to identify what documents and information may be or may not be acceptable to publicly release, and over which a claim for public interest immunity may need to be made,\u201d the letter from Nationals senator Matt Canavan to the Senate president, Scott Ryan, tabled on Thursday, said. The government has said it will respond to the order on the next sitting day of parliament on 25 November. But Labor is not going to let the government off the hook. The shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, has written to the chair of the joint committee of public accounts and audit, requesting an inquiry into the audit\u2019s findings, saying it is needed to examine the \u201cmaladministration by the Morrison government\u201d uncovered by the auditor. McCormack, who has struggled to assert his authority as Nationals leader, is also expected to come under pressure over the program\u2019s management when parliament returns. \u201cHow many more revelations of cash for aqua tokens, food vans and failing ferries will we need to see before deputy prime minister McCormack offers a full explanation in response to this scathing audit?,\u201d King told Guardian Australia.",

There are however, some exceptions.</p> <h2>The cleaning products you do need</h2> <p><strong>Multipurpose cleaner<br></strong>Rather than buying separate kitchen, multipurpose and floor cleaners, Iredale suggests that a single bottle of multipurpose cleaner will do the trick in most instances. In Choice\u2019s tests, Nifty\u2019s multipurpose cleaner <a href=\"https://www.choice.com.au/home-and-living/laundry-and-cleaning/surface-cleaners/articles/the-best-and-worst-cleaning-products\">proved the most effective</a>.

You\u2019re probably going to want more of an antibacterial treatment for a toilet cleaner.\u201d</p> <p>This is a purchase you\u2019re going to want to get right, because a bad toilet cleaner is worse than none at all. \u201cWhat actually happens is the poor performing ones \u2013 instead of removing stains \u2013 they\u2019ll actually lubricate the stain so your sponge or scrubbing brush will glide over the top of it rather than biting in and cleaning.\u201d Though toilet cleaners were not part of Choice\u2019s latest test, you can find a list of the cleaners it recommends <a href=\"https://www.choice.com.au/home-and-living/laundry-and-cleaning/surface-cleaners/review-and-compare/toilet-cleaners\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Window cleaner<br></strong>Because glass windows have a tendency to streak, you\u2019ll need a specialised cleaner. \u201cIn our recent test we measured not just cleaning performance but how well they deal with streaking. We have a panel assessment ranking from 0 to 4 which is a range of no streaking whatsoever to very heavy streaking. So a score of 50% is 50% streak resistance.\u201d In these tests, Windex products came out on top by a significant margin.</p> <p>However, if you have tinted windows watch out. Iredale warns that \u201ca lot of them contain ammonia which can damage your window tint\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Bathroom cleaner<br></strong>Unlike your kitchen surfaces, your bathtub and sink are likely to build up with soap scum, which other cleaning types, including multipurpose cleaners, aren\u2019t equipped to handle, Iredale says.

      "bodyText": "The Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s newly elected president once called Great Barrier Reef science \u201cunsubstantiated scaremongering\u201d, which has prompted calls for the suspension of the organisation\u2019s reef foundation grants. The peak body for Queensland farmers, the QFF manages water quality improvement grants from the Great Barrier Reef Foundation totalling $4.6m \u2013 among the most awarded to a single organisation under a controversial $443m federal funding deal. Its new president, Bundaberg cane grower Allan Dingle, recently sought to cast doubt on the consensus science that farm pollution is harming the reef. \u201cMuch of the science being used to justify the attempted regulation of our region is more about funding for a particular belief, it lacks science and is backed up instead by some dodgy modelling,\u201d Dingle, who is the chair of Canegrowers Bundaberg, wrote in that organisation\u2019s newsletter this year. \u201cThe Bundaberg sugar industry does not accept without question the science provided to justify the claims made and will not accept guilt for a crime that we have not committed.\u201d Dingle has this week backed away from those statements \u2013 including some made just three months ago \u2013 and told Guardian Australia they do not represent the views of the QFF or its members. Some farmers say they are concerned his elevation could damage an already strained relationship with the Queensland government after a bruising debate about water quality regulations that veered into science denial and conspiracy. Dingle introduced the contrarian scientist, Peter Ridd, at an event in Bundaberg in August and helped to promote the talk by saying: \u201cCane farmers are being pushed to the wall by overregulation based on unsubstantiated scaremongering around the Great Barrier Reef, and Ridd is setting the record straight.\u201d In Senate estimates last month, federal bureaucrats revealed they had written to Queensland Canegrowers \u2013 of which Dingle is a board member \u2013 using \u201cstrong wording\u201d to seek clarification about whether the organisation was \u201cconflicted\u201d by promoting Ridd\u2019s speaking tour while also managing Great Barrier Reef Foundation grants. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said Dingle\u2019s appointment was a \u201cconcerning development\u201d and that further reef foundation grants to the QFF should be paused. \u201cThe foundation shouldn\u2019t be giving public money to any recipient who is not fully committed to environmental outcomes based on the best available science,\u201d Whish-Wilson said. \u201cThe foundation should put on hold any further grants to the QFF until the foundation is satisfied that the QFF are fully committed to restoring and advocating for the best health of the reef.\u201d An overwhelming majority of experts say the Great Barrier Reef is at risk from pollution by agricultural chemicals. A recent study revealed the extent of controversial pesticides found in the reef catchment. The debate about reef regulations ultimately highlighted stark differences in approach among the agricultural sector. Cane growers\u2019 groups and AgForce, which represents pastoralists and grain producers, attempted to undermine the science. Many other farming organisations took the moderate position that there were flaws in the regulations but did not dispute the science or the need to play a role. The QFF\u2019s position acknowledges that climate change is the clearly greatest threat to the reef, but that runoff from farming is a problem that requires increased efforts. \u201cQFF does not question that land-based runoff remains a problem and that efforts must be increased if we are going to meet the ambitious targets set by governments,\u201d former CEO Travis Tobin said in September. It is understood the QFF has sought to reassure some of its member groups that Dingle will cut his association with Canegrowers Bundaberg and the Bundaberg Regional Irrigators\u2019 Group and now toe the organisation\u2019s policy line. Dingle said in a detailed statement that he was in the process of stepping down from various board positions since he was confirmed as QFF president on Thursday. \u201cThe comments referred to were made in my capacity as the chairman of Canegrowers Bundaberg, not as president of the Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation and therefore do not represent the views of QFF or its industry members. \u201cQFF\u2019s position on the Great Barrier Reef and natural resource management has been, and remains, that a sustainable and profitable Queensland agriculture sector is essential to the longevity and prosperity of our sector and the environment.\u201d Some in the sector remain unconvinced.

Temperature goes up, it gets drier, and then the fires go up,\u201d says Beer.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s bushfire season has started early this year, with fire chiefs saying the length, extent and intensity of the fires is unprecedented.</p> <p>More than a million hectares has been burned, entire towns and communities have been decimated and lives have been lost. In just one week in NSW, 259 homes have been destroyed.</p> <p>With months of firefighting ahead of them, fire chiefs are starting to worry about the fatigue and stress on volunteer firefighters. Now, as more dangerous fire weather is forecast, Beer and Pearman are asking what else they could have done as scientists who were sounding the early warning bells for the current suffering. Why did the science not lead to action?</p> <p>\u201cI would blame most of that on the lobbying\u201d,\u201d says Pearman, now 78. \u201cThat lobbying has been extremely powerful in a country driven by the resource sector that includes uranium, coal and gas.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge reluctance to reign that part of our economy in with a more strategic perspective.\u201d</p> <h2>Picturing climate change scenario no simple task</h2> <p>The story of Beer\u2019s paper starts with Pearman who, says Beer, deserves credit for driving climate change research within CSIRO in the 1980s.</p> <p>Pearman had taken an early climate change scenario developed by colleagues <a href=\"http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P005997b.htm\">Barrie Pittock</a> and <a href=\"https://csiropedia.csiro.au/henry-nix/\">Henry Nix</a>, and handed it to scores of specialist scientists across the country.</p> <p>Pearman wanted to get a picture of how climate change might impact issues including Australia\u2019s agriculture, ecology, insurance industry, hydrology, irrigation, farmers and power generators.</p> <p>\u201cWe went to all these scientists and said, in a year, we want a paper prepared to see what it means for your area. That was the basis for Tom Beer\u2019s paper. That was a year before the Greenhouse \u201887 meeting \u2013 a watershed. At the end of the day it was a risk assessment. \u201d</p> <p>Beer recalls it this way. \u201cGraeme Pearman said to me, you do bushfires, and I clicked my heels and saluted, and just got on with it.\u201d</p> <p>The task wasn\u2019t simple, and Beer\u2019s initial hopes that he would \u201cjust need to go and crank the computer handle\u201d were challenged. The climate scenario was based on global average temperatures going up by about 3.5C \u2013 but there are a lot more ingredients driving fires than just temperature.</p> <p>Beer says the devastating <a href=\"https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/bushfire-ash-wednesday-1983/\">Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983</a> had driven interest inside CSIRO for research. A national bushfire research unit was established, and he moved to Melbourne to work.</p> <p>This interest in the issue, he says, was in contrast with the relative scepticism on climate of his boss, Brian Tucker, who was chief of CSIRO\u2019s atmospheric research division.</p> <p>\u201cTucker thought there was no future in this climate change business,\u201d says Beer, adding that Tucker was more interested in the prospects of an impending ice age. When Tucker left CSIRO, he took up a position at the Institute of Public Affairs, where <a href=\"https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/1211162606_document_review1997_vol.50no.1.pdf\">he wrote articles</a> sceptical of the risks of human caused climate change.</p> <p>But, says Beer, \u201cTucker had Graeme Pearman breathing down his neck\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be wrong to say Tucker was holding [Pearman and Pittock] back, but he wasn\u2019t advancing or promoting their research either.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It didn\u2019t seem to have an impact\u2019</h2> <p>Beer\u2019s paper was one of more than 50 presented at the 1987 conference, and then in a book that was 745 pages long. Beer did media interviews and travelled to the US to talk to wildfire specialists about his work.</p> <p>He also got a \u201cblistering\u201d letter from a WA forestry director, attacking his findings as \u201cshoddy\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWhat happens then?\u201d asks Beer. \u201cThey forget it, because there are no big bushfires for another 10 years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/13/we-mustnt-bring-politics-into-the-disastrous-situation-that-was-created-by-wait-for-it-politics\">We mustn\u2019t bring politics into the disastrous situation that was created by ... wait for it ... POLITICS | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That lack of major bushfires saw CSIRO\u2019s institutional interest wane on the issue, and after five years or so, Beer had moved away from researching bushfires. But that wasn\u2019t before he helped write a <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01094015\">second paper in 1995</a> using more sophisticated climate models, which backed up his earlier findings.</p> <p>Now, Beer admits to being frustrated that the warnings coming from the CSIRO didn\u2019t turn into action. But there\u2019s also a sense of guilt.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had really believed how bad it was going to get, I should have been out there asking for more funding for firefighters,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose I was young enough to believe that doing the science was going to be enough and miraculously, people would act on it. That was a naive view, but I think that was probably fairly common among working scientists.\u201d</p> <p>Beer retired from CSIRO in 2014 as the head of the climate research program. Pearman took over from Tucker as as the head of of the atmospheric research division, and retired in 2004.</p> <p>During his time at CSIRO, Pearman gave climate change presentations to prime ministers Hawke, Keating and Howard. \u201cThere was an opportunity to deliver a perspective to these leaders \u2026 yet it didn\u2019t seem to have an impact,\u201d Pearman says.</p> <h2>Current debate has echoes of \u201987</h2> <p>What Pearman is seeing play out now, in the bushfire crisis and the drought, \u201cis what we were talking about at the Greenhouse 87 meeting. That was about the changes that we anticipated, based on basic physics of the climate system.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the fact that Pearman gave more than 500 presentations on climate change between 2000 and 2010, he still asks himself if he could have done more.</p> <p>\u201cWhat could I have done? What did I do wrong?\u201d he asks. \u201cThere are times when you look and think, there\u2019s something we did wrong in trying to communicate this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/nsw-public-servants-at-climate-conference-told-not-to-discuss-link-with-bushfires\">NSW public servants at climate conference told not to discuss link with bushfires</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are times when I get \u2013 maybe not quite as far as depressed \u2013 but I think that the value of the science investment is being belittled by people with ideological views on how the world is, rather than a view of the world that\u2019s based on observations.\u201d</p> <p>Pearman is still active in climate issues as a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne\u2019s climate and energy college.</p> <p>He reserves some criticism for his old organisation that he says has become too focussed on work to drive \u201ceconomic benefit\u201d. He knows, too, that human nature and psychology also blocks action.</p> <p>But he reserves his rhetorical fire for the fossil fuel industry. \u201cThose investing in the fossil fuel industry worked diligently to try to stop action on the reduction of emissions,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a scientist you think many years ahead and out to the turn of the century and beyond.</p> <p>\u201cBut in a business with investment in a coal mine, their interest is in what happens in the next five years.

      "bodyText": "From his lounge in Brunswick, Melbourne, 72-year-old Dr Tom Beer has been watching the fury of an unprecedented Australian bushfire season unfolding on his television screen. \u201cI feel really sorry for the firefighters who\u2019ve got extraordinarily tough jobs ahead, and it\u2019s only going to get tougher,\u201d says Beer. \u201cBut I feel maybe I was not enough of a prophet crying in the wilderness.\u201d Back in 1986, Beer was working as a CSIRO meteorologist looking at bushfires when he was asked by his boss, Dr Graeme Pearman, to go and find out what the greenhouse effect might mean for the future of fires. Beer\u2019s findings in 1987, published in 1988 as \u201cAustralian bushfire danger under changing climatic regimes\u201d, became the first study in the world to ask what climate change was going to mean for wildfires. \u201cIt seems obvious, but actually we found the correlation was not temperature and fires, but relative humidity and fires. Temperature goes up, it gets drier, and then the fires go up,\u201d says Beer. Australia\u2019s bushfire season has started early this year, with fire chiefs saying the length, extent and intensity of the fires is unprecedented. More than a million hectares has been burned, entire towns and communities have been decimated and lives have been lost. In just one week in NSW, 259 homes have been destroyed. With months of firefighting ahead of them, fire chiefs are starting to worry about the fatigue and stress on volunteer firefighters. Now, as more dangerous fire weather is forecast, Beer and Pearman are asking what else they could have done as scientists who were sounding the early warning bells for the current suffering. Why did the science not lead to action? \u201cI would blame most of that on the lobbying\u201d,\u201d says Pearman, now 78. \u201cThat lobbying has been extremely powerful in a country driven by the resource sector that includes uranium, coal and gas. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge reluctance to reign that part of our economy in with a more strategic perspective.\u201d Picturing climate change scenario no simple task The story of Beer\u2019s paper starts with Pearman who, says Beer, deserves credit for driving climate change research within CSIRO in the 1980s. Pearman had taken an early climate change scenario developed by colleagues Barrie Pittock and Henry Nix, and handed it to scores of specialist scientists across the country. Pearman wanted to get a picture of how climate change might impact issues including Australia\u2019s agriculture, ecology, insurance industry, hydrology, irrigation, farmers and power generators. \u201cWe went to all these scientists and said, in a year, we want a paper prepared to see what it means for your area. That was the basis for Tom Beer\u2019s paper. That was a year before the Greenhouse \u201887 meeting \u2013 a watershed. At the end of the day it was a risk assessment. \u201d Beer recalls it this way. \u201cGraeme Pearman said to me, you do bushfires, and I clicked my heels and saluted, and just got on with it.\u201d The task wasn\u2019t simple, and Beer\u2019s initial hopes that he would \u201cjust need to go and crank the computer handle\u201d were challenged. The climate scenario was based on global average temperatures going up by about 3.5C \u2013 but there are a lot more ingredients driving fires than just temperature. Beer says the devastating Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983 had driven interest inside CSIRO for research. A national bushfire research unit was established, and he moved to Melbourne to work. This interest in the issue, he says, was in contrast with the relative scepticism on climate of his boss, Brian Tucker, who was chief of CSIRO\u2019s atmospheric research division. \u201cTucker thought there was no future in this climate change business,\u201d says Beer, adding that Tucker was more interested in the prospects of an impending ice age. When Tucker left CSIRO, he took up a position at the Institute of Public Affairs, where he wrote articles sceptical of the risks of human caused climate change. But, says Beer, \u201cTucker had Graeme Pearman breathing down his neck\u201d. \u201cIt would be wrong to say Tucker was holding [Pearman and Pittock] back, but he wasn\u2019t advancing or promoting their research either.\u201d \u2018It didn\u2019t seem to have an impact\u2019 Beer\u2019s paper was one of more than 50 presented at the 1987 conference, and then in a book that was 745 pages long. Beer did media interviews and travelled to the US to talk to wildfire specialists about his work. He also got a \u201cblistering\u201d letter from a WA forestry director, attacking his findings as \u201cshoddy\u201d. \u201cWhat happens then?\u201d asks Beer. \u201cThey forget it, because there are no big bushfires for another 10 years.\u201d That lack of major bushfires saw CSIRO\u2019s institutional interest wane on the issue, and after five years or so, Beer had moved away from researching bushfires. But that wasn\u2019t before he helped write a second paper in 1995 using more sophisticated climate models, which backed up his earlier findings. Now, Beer admits to being frustrated that the warnings coming from the CSIRO didn\u2019t turn into action. But there\u2019s also a sense of guilt. \u201cIf I had really believed how bad it was going to get, I should have been out there asking for more funding for firefighters,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose I was young enough to believe that doing the science was going to be enough and miraculously, people would act on it. That was a naive view, but I think that was probably fairly common among working scientists.\u201d Beer retired from CSIRO in 2014 as the head of the climate research program. Pearman took over from Tucker as as the head of of the atmospheric research division, and retired in 2004. During his time at CSIRO, Pearman gave climate change presentations to prime ministers Hawke, Keating and Howard. \u201cThere was an opportunity to deliver a perspective to these leaders \u2026 yet it didn\u2019t seem to have an impact,\u201d Pearman says. Current debate has echoes of \u201987 What Pearman is seeing play out now, in the bushfire crisis and the drought, \u201cis what we were talking about at the Greenhouse 87 meeting. That was about the changes that we anticipated, based on basic physics of the climate system.\u201d Despite the fact that Pearman gave more than 500 presentations on climate change between 2000 and 2010, he still asks himself if he could have done more. \u201cWhat could I have done? What did I do wrong?\u201d he asks. \u201cThere are times when you look and think, there\u2019s something we did wrong in trying to communicate this. \u201cThere are times when I get \u2013 maybe not quite as far as depressed \u2013 but I think that the value of the science investment is being belittled by people with ideological views on how the world is, rather than a view of the world that\u2019s based on observations.\u201d Pearman is still active in climate issues as a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne\u2019s climate and energy college. He reserves some criticism for his old organisation that he says has become too focussed on work to drive \u201ceconomic benefit\u201d. He knows, too, that human nature and psychology also blocks action. But he reserves his rhetorical fire for the fossil fuel industry. \u201cThose investing in the fossil fuel industry worked diligently to try to stop action on the reduction of emissions,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a scientist you think many years ahead and out to the turn of the century and beyond. \u201cBut in a business with investment in a coal mine, their interest is in what happens in the next five years. Those industries have been very effective.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Even for modern Australian political discourse, it jarred. Michael McCormack, deputy prime minister and representative of regional and rural electorates, began the week by \u201ccalling out\u201d those \u201craving inner-city lunatics\u201d who dared to link climate change with Australia\u2019s worsening bushfire season. \u201cWe\u2019ve had fires in Australia since time began, and what people need now is a little bit of sympathy, understanding and real assistance \u2013 they need help, they need shelter,\u201d McCormack told the national broadcaster. \u201cThey don\u2019t need the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this time, when they\u2019re trying to save their homes, when in fact they\u2019re going out in many cases saving other peoples\u2019 homes and leaving their own homes at risk.\u201d The comments were made early Monday morning as the nation woke to learn it was facing a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire emergency along much of the east coast, with worse conditions to come. Emotions were already high. Three people \u2013 Julie Fletcher, George Nole and Vivian Chaplain \u2013 had died in the 48 hours prior, as a firestorm swept across their northern New South Wales properties. Australia has always equated the start of summer with bushfire season. But every year it seems to get earlier. It began in September, the first month of spring, for Queensland, when fire crews battled to save life and property in areas which had stood untouched by bushfires for decades. Then, rainforest burned. Just over four weeks later and rural firefighter volunteers and emergency service personnel got the call again, with fires stretching from the mid-north coast of NSW to the Queensland border. Summer was yet to begin, and Australia was already on fire. McCormack\u2019s comments followed criticism of a prime ministerial tweet offering \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d as the bushfire crisis took hold. Scott Morrison, who less than three years ago smuggled a piece of coal into parliament as a question time prop, imploring \u201cthis is coal \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t be scared\u201d at the opposition, and now leads a government threatening to crack down on environmental activism against the resource sector, was condemned by Greens MPs for inaction on climate change. It was in that context that McCormack, in the face of disgruntled rumblings within his own party room, where a former leader who maintains electoral popularity and media cut-through still sits, turned his outrage meter to 11, sparking Australia\u2019s week of stupid in the process. From the ABC studios in Sydney, the interview spread as quickly as smoke. From Ballarat in the south-east to South Australia\u2019s border towns, Townsville in the north, Perth in the west and everywhere in between, McCormack\u2019s \u201craving inner-city lunatics\u201d comments overshadowed almost everything but the fire coverage itself. It set the tone for the week in political discourse. Wanting to talk about climate change as a cause of the increasingly unpredicted and unprecedented bushfires marked you as a \u201cleftie\u201d. Those on the right pointed to \u201cGreen party\u201d policies as having stymied hazard reduction efforts and other fire preparations. Neither was true. But McCormack\u2019s comments took hold, fuelling debate about whether or not Australia was allowed to have a debate on climate change as more than 100 fires scarred the landscape and capital cities were choked by smoky haze. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning More than 2,000 news articles, opinion pieces, radio slots and TV segments were taken up by the comments.

Joyce had raised his view of the deceased\u2019s voting preference apropos of nothing. He\u2019d been asked about firefighting resources, but the man once described as Australia\u2019s \u201cbest retail politician\u201d strayed into voting beliefs in a garbled bid to explain sections of his northern NSW electorate. \u201cI acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party, so I am not going to start attacking them,\u201d he told Sky News, in comments that flashed around the nation. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I want to do.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, Emma Dent Coad was elected as Labour\u2019s first-ever MP for Kensington. Now she risks being the party\u2019s first-ever candidate there to come third. The Observer is publishing the results from the first three of a series of constituency surveys in seats that could determine who governs Britain after 12 December. All three are London seats that were closely fought between Labour and Conservative in 2017; as well as Kensington, Deltapoll has surveyed Finchley and Golders Green, and Wimbledon. In all three, the Conservatives now hold narrow leads; in all three, the Liberal Democrats are close behind. The surveys have been funded by donations from individuals acting separately from any party or campaign group. Their aim is not to endorse any candidate, but to provide objective data for constituencies where the nature of the local contest is in doubt \u2013 in particular where three parties all believe they have a real chance of victory. Each week, alongside the main findings reported by the Observer, full details of each survey will be published online. The first group of seats are London marginals that overwhelmingly voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum. In all three, the Lib Dems have been boosted by their stance on Brexit, mainly at Labour\u2019s expense. Finchley and Golders Green has seen the biggest shift, with a 25% swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats. Here the Lib Dem challenger is Luciana Berger, who left Labour earlier this year, criticising its stance on antisemitism. However, she still trails Mike Freer, the Conservative incumbent, by 14 points. The Tory leads in the other two seats are far narrower: three points in Kensington, where Sam Gyimah, a former Conservative minister, is the Lib Dem candidate, and just two points in Wimbledon, where Stephen Hammond is seeking re-election. He lost the Conservative whip temporarily following his rebellion two months ago against Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy. Two years ago, Conservative support in these seats was evenly divided between pro- and anti-Brexit voters. Their support among Leave voters is rock solid; but Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy has gone down badly with many pro-European Tories. Around half of the party\u2019s Remain voters have deserted it. Most of this group now back the Lib Dems; there are also a number of ex-Tory Remain \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d who have yet to decide how to vote. Nevertheless, the Conservatives are currently leading in these strongly Remain seats, because the anti-hard-Brexit majority is divided between Labour and the Lib Dems. Could this change? Deltapoll asked respondents how they would vote under two scenarios \u2013 if they thought that the only two candidates with a realistic chance of victory were, first, the Conservatives or Labour, and second, the Conservatives or Liberal Democrat. In all three seats, the pattern is similar: Most Labour and Lib Dem supporters are prepared to vote tactically if their preferred party is out of the running. Labour supporters are willing to switch to the Lib Dems in overwhelming numbers \u2013 in all three seats by enough to give the Lib Dems victory. Lib Dem supporters tend to prefer Labour, but far less decisively. If they can\u2019t have a Lib Dem MP, quite a few would vote Conservative, in each case by enough to increase the Tory majority. These surveys uncover the reasons why the tactical choices of Labour and Lib Dem supporters are different. Labour supporters are hostile to both Johnson and Brexit; a switch to the Lib Dems accords with both sentiments. Many Lib Dem supporters are more conflicted. They are almost exclusively anti-Brexit. But most are also hostile to Jeremy Corbyn, and in all three seats, most think the Tories would be better than Labour for the economy.

A \u201ccurly haired\u201d <em>Guardian</em> reporter (\u201cLucy Goodbody\u201d) has \u2013 clue to her ultimate redemption \u2013 \u201cloads of pretty white teeth\u201d.

A scant biography explains why Johnson\u2019s fantasy researcher craves, above all, submission to \u201can alpha male\u201d. She \u201chad a deep and sexist reverence for men who really knew stuff.

      "bodyText": "The report on Russian interference in UK politics, which might be damaging to Boris Johnson, has been suppressed. Another, on whether to investigate his alleged favours for Jennifer Arcuri, that not obviously qualified recipient of various public subsidies, is postponed until it, too, can\u2019t change voters\u2019 minds. But there remains one document with enough emetic and cautionary detail to test, if only among women, the despairing view that every form of amorality and criminality, possibly short of cruelty to animals, has already been \u201cpriced in\u201d. Supposing Johnson does not kill Dilyn before 12 December, his horrendous \u2013 and happily ineradicable \u2013 comico-political novel, Seventy-Two Virgins, amounts to a compelling case for character reappraisal, or it would if women could be persuaded to read it. As it is, the author\u2019s difficulties with more traditional women voters have yet, his supporters fear, to be completely dispelled by repeated appearances with his May-December love match from central office. But less squeamish women, willing to tolerate a leader who combines an apparent aversion to precautionary measures with a history of matchless infidelity, could yet recoil from the inescapable message of Seventy-Two Virgins: that Johnson evaluates their entire sex, and not just his unfortunate intimates and colleagues, according to their fuckability on the \u2013 sometimes eccentric \u2013 Johnson scale. Does this priority promise much interest in addressing, for instance, sex discrimination, harassment, the gender pay gap? There could, however, be a dentistry upside. Teeth emerge as almost as critical for Johnson the novelist, when he dreams up a female paragon, as breast size, hair type and the propensity to weep. A \u201ccurly haired\u201d Guardian reporter (\u201cLucy Goodbody\u201d) has \u2013 clue to her ultimate redemption \u2013 \u201cloads of pretty white teeth\u201d. His heroine\u2019s teeth are so fine he pictures them being weirdly inspected \u2013 \u201copen wide the pearly gates\u201d \u2013 by his hero and alter-ego, a married tooth fetishist called Roger. Only afterwards does Roger, a scandal-hit MP, ask this parliamentary researcher: \u201cYou\u2019re quite happy for me to check your teeth?\u201d Mislaying her, Roger/Boris asks if anyone has spotted \u201can exceptionally good-looking researcher of about twenty-three with good teeth and blonde hair\u201d. Which is not to say that this fine object is not supplied with a backstory, the better to account for her sexual appetite. A scant biography explains why Johnson\u2019s fantasy researcher craves, above all, submission to \u201can alpha male\u201d. She \u201chad a deep and sexist reverence for men who really knew stuff. It amazed her sometimes how little appearances mattered. He could be bald, he could be spindly or sweaty or tubby, but if that man\u2019s disquisition had enough interest, fluency and authority, it would speak directly to her groin.\u201d And thus Johnson\u2019s Churchill impressions can finally be understood: he\u2019s speaking Groinish. Groinwise, we find Johnson the narrator taking the opposite approach to female characters; no disquisition lets them off physical screening. Hello \u201csvelte young female MP\u201d, goodbye to a woman whose sole function is to get a parking ticket: \u201cShe had long blonde hair, dark eyebrows, a tight black T-shirt over a willowy figure and a belt made out of copper plates.

      "body": "<p>Just as they begin to falter on the domestic front, Exeter finally find some form in Europe. Typical. It looks as if Saracens are going to adopt a philosophical position on Europe for a season. If so, one of their most vocal critics may just be about to step up and show those sceptics on the continent that the Premiership challenge amounts to more than just that of the defamed champions.</p> <p>This was a wonderfully hard and clinical performance from the Chiefs in one of the more ferocious dens of French rugby, which is saying something. La Rochelle are appearing in their second campaign in this tournament, but they fairly lit up their first and have not lost here in nine matches, or eight months. Four tries and 31 points speaks of quite the dismantling. Nor does it flatter.</p> <p>Exeter\u2019s fans travelled in their numbers and had the measure of the locals as much as their heroes did on the field. By the time Sam Simmonds registered the bonus-point try with more than a quarter of an hour to play, we might as well have been at Sandy Park.</p> <p>That said, last Sunday Exeter\u2019s stronghold fell deathly silent when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/10/exeter-chiefs-bristol-bears-match-report\" title=\"\">Bristol snatched an outrageous victory</a> with the last play of the game to leave Exeter nonplussed after their opening four fixtures of the domestic season \u2013 two wins, two losses. This was some way to respond, in a competition that has yet to see the best of them.</p> <p>The manner of this landmark win was as impressive as the fact. The Joe Simmonds era appears to be established now. With Sam\u2019s younger brother at the helm and Henry Slade as an alternative pivot outside him, the Chiefs seem to be developing their game beyond the relentless phase-recycling for which they have received criticism in the past. Not only deadly from the tee, Simmons Jr is bringing out the best of the talents outside, no less a threat than Stuart Hogg now numbering himself among the usual suspects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/bath-ulster-european-champions-cup-match-report-rugby-union\">Jacob Stockdale helps Ulster hang on for hard-fought victory at Bath</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An early try by Dave Dennis set the tone, sparked by some lovely interplay between Tommy O\u2019Flaherty \u2013 a future star for sure \u2013 and Harry Williams.</p> <p>Exeter\u2019s defensive detail was as exacting as one might expect and they forced La Rochelle into error after error. The home team thought they had an equalising score a few minutes later, but the TMO ruled Alexis Bales\u2019s pass had gone forward. The reminder of La Rochelle\u2019s threat resounded all the same.</p> <p>Exeter resisted it admirably, and then struck for a second time just before the break. O\u2019Flaherty this time turned scorer, the young winger finishing expertly in the corner after Joe Simmonds\u2019s lovely cut-out pass. The conversion was the second successful kick of another five from five from Exeter\u2019s fly-half. He has not missed one this season.</p> <p>La Rochelle responded with a brilliant try by Geoffrey Doumayrou five minutes into the second half.

      "bodyText": "Just as they begin to falter on the domestic front, Exeter finally find some form in Europe. Typical. It looks as if Saracens are going to adopt a philosophical position on Europe for a season. If so, one of their most vocal critics may just be about to step up and show those sceptics on the continent that the Premiership challenge amounts to more than just that of the defamed champions. This was a wonderfully hard and clinical performance from the Chiefs in one of the more ferocious dens of French rugby, which is saying something. La Rochelle are appearing in their second campaign in this tournament, but they fairly lit up their first and have not lost here in nine matches, or eight months. Four tries and 31 points speaks of quite the dismantling. Nor does it flatter. Exeter\u2019s fans travelled in their numbers and had the measure of the locals as much as their heroes did on the field. By the time Sam Simmonds registered the bonus-point try with more than a quarter of an hour to play, we might as well have been at Sandy Park. That said, last Sunday Exeter\u2019s stronghold fell deathly silent when Bristol snatched an outrageous victory with the last play of the game to leave Exeter nonplussed after their opening four fixtures of the domestic season \u2013 two wins, two losses. This was some way to respond, in a competition that has yet to see the best of them. The manner of this landmark win was as impressive as the fact. The Joe Simmonds era appears to be established now. With Sam\u2019s younger brother at the helm and Henry Slade as an alternative pivot outside him, the Chiefs seem to be developing their game beyond the relentless phase-recycling for which they have received criticism in the past. Not only deadly from the tee, Simmons Jr is bringing out the best of the talents outside, no less a threat than Stuart Hogg now numbering himself among the usual suspects. An early try by Dave Dennis set the tone, sparked by some lovely interplay between Tommy O\u2019Flaherty \u2013 a future star for sure \u2013 and Harry Williams. Exeter\u2019s defensive detail was as exacting as one might expect and they forced La Rochelle into error after error. The home team thought they had an equalising score a few minutes later, but the TMO ruled Alexis Bales\u2019s pass had gone forward. The reminder of La Rochelle\u2019s threat resounded all the same. Exeter resisted it admirably, and then struck for a second time just before the break. O\u2019Flaherty this time turned scorer, the young winger finishing expertly in the corner after Joe Simmonds\u2019s lovely cut-out pass. The conversion was the second successful kick of another five from five from Exeter\u2019s fly-half. He has not missed one this season. La Rochelle responded with a brilliant try by Geoffrey Doumayrou five minutes into the second half. Vincent Rattez set Doumayrou and Arthur Retiere off on an outrageous combination down the right, which the latter finished. Just as they looked as if they might build on that, Slade plucked Jeremy Sinzelle\u2019s pass out of the air to canter home in that increasingly familiar style of his. Fifteen minutes into the second half, at 21-5 to the visitors, the game was all but done. Simmonds Sr put matters beyond doubt. Alex Cuthbert, a third Lion to populate Exeter\u2019s wide outside with Jack Nowell entering the fray in the final quarter, cut in from his wing to set the stage. Simmonds dummied and drove through the tackle of Retiere, claiming the bonus point with more than quarter of an hour to play. His younger brother landed a penalty with five to go and the Chiefs\u2019 new statement on Europe had been declared. There was time for La Rochelle to show what might have been with a typically extravagant score. Brock James\u2019s cross-kick was taken by Sinzelle, who flicked the ball nonchalantly inside to Kini Murimurivalu for a try at the death. It was not undeserved but will have been of limited consolation. They are not used to losing at home. Exeter look at last as if they might be getting to grips with Europe.",

      "bodyText": "One local newspaper described the sales listing, with calculated understatement, as a \u201cmid-century fixer-upper\u201d: an underground bunker built to withstand a nuclear attack, and to house the fire power to retaliate. The decommissioned nuclear silo in southern Arizona was once home to the Titan II, the largest intercontinental ballistic missile deployed by the US Air Force. The silo\u2019s owner, Rick Ellis, told the Arizona Daily Star newspaper that he was selling the property because he\u2019s \u201cbored\u201d. Ellis said he originally bought the silo to turn into a commercial data storage center because it is shielded from electromagnetic pulses that can scramble electronics, but his plans were waylaid by the economic recession. So far, he said he has rejected serious offers from a buyer who wanted to turn it into a greenhouse for medical marijuana and another who planned to use it as a porn studio. The threshold to tour the property is much higher than for a typical open house. Interested buyers must prove they have the money to cover the $395,000 cost and sign a liability waiver before descending a 40ft staircase into the bunker to tour the property. \u201cPrivate yet not too remote,\u201d says the listing for the property, which includes more than 12 acres of desert. There are 18 decommissioned nuclear silos which surround Tucson and were operational from June 1963 into the 1980s. They were on alert to launch, or respond, to nuclear attacks with the Titan II missiles, which carried warheads with nine megatons of explosive power \u2013 the equivalent to a yield 600 times that of \u201cLittle Boy\u201d, the bomb dropped over Hiroshima. When the bunkers were decommissioned, the government demolished them, filled them with rubble and sealed the entrances with concrete. Ellis took on a major excavation after purchasing the property, which still includes some original equipment such as floor-to-ceiling springs which isolated each level of the basement from seismic shocks and signs revealing the bunker\u2019s designated smoking area. Premier Media Group created a 3D tour of the bunker which showcases pools of stagnant water and the 6,000lb blast door which can be closed with one hand. For those who can\u2019t provide the paperwork necessary to tour the property, realtors Grant Hampton and Kori Ward recommend a visit to the nearby Titan Missile Museum in Sahuarita, Arizona, which is inside a decommissioned silo.",

The home secretary, Priti Patel, made a last-minute intervention to block a rescue operation to bring British orphans and unaccompanied minors home from Syria, it emerged. Vince Cable predicted the election would end in a hung parliament, sparking a referendum and another general election. The former leader of the Liberal Democrats said there is a \u201cone in a million\u201d chance that Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister. Labour\u2019s manifesto could be released this Thursday, according to social media posts from two shadow cabinet ministers following a meeting today. Police are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud after claims the Tories offered peerages to senior Brexit party figures to persuade them to stand down in the general election after Labour peer Lord Falconer wrote to the Metropolitan police commissioner and director of public prosecutions calling for an investigation into what he said were \u201cexceptionally serious allegations\u201d. Michael Gove dismissed the claims peerages were offered as \u201cnonsensical\u201d although he referred to Boris Johnson\u2019s admission that \u201cconversations may have taken place\u201d However, Brexit party MEP Ben Habib rebuffed the Tory denials: \u201cThey\u2019re being economical with the truth for sure.\u201d The Liberal Democrats came under renewed criticism over their \u201cmisleading\u201d leaflets. The fact-checking charity Full Fact warned that the misrepresentation of polling data to claim electoral advantage over rivals could have long-term implications for trust in politicians. A record number of women are expected to stand in next month\u2019s general election. More than 1,100 women have registered as candidates, making up a third of nominations, marking an increase from 29% in 2017 and 26% in 2015. The Conservative party has said it will triple tree-planting rates if it wins the general election, while the Liberal Democrats have promised they will plant twice as many trees as the Tories. Jeremy Corbyn has hit back at Boris Johnson after the prime minister claimed his plans to nationalise the UK\u2019s broadband network were part of a \u201ccrazed communist scheme\u201d. He tweeted that the Conservatives would dismiss proposals, if made today, to create the NHS as \u201chealth communism\u201d. The government is coming under heightened scrutiny after Brexit party officials alleged that key figures among their ranks were offered government positions and peerages in exchange for standing aside in Labour-held marginals. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has come out this afternoon saying: Nothing would surprise me about the Conservatives these days given what they\u2019ve been prepared to do. If Boris Johnson\u2019s prepared to lie to the Queen, lie to the country, you know, I\u2019m going to stop being shocked at where his lack of boundaries lies. In an interview, the Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: I think it\u2019s unbelievable what\u2019s happened here. It really is. If what Nigel Farage suggests is true, that Brexit Party members have been approached by senior Conservatives asking to step down with the result being peerages, what state of affairs is our politics in? It\u2019s an absolute outrage. This could be political corruption of the highest order and in addition to that it could be seen as criminal activity. This cannot be accepted. There should be undoubtedly an investigation into the situation. Earlier, speaking on behalf of the government, Michael Gove said: The Prime Minister acknowledged that there may have been \u2018conversations\u2019 between senior Tories and people in the Brexit Party, but flatly denied there had been any offers of peerages, saying that was \u2018just not the way we operate\u2019. Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib, when asked if the Tory Party\u2019s denials were a lie, told Sky: Well I\u2019m saying they\u2019re being economical with the truth for sure. Absolutely. It has been going on. Without a shadow of a doubt. Meanwhile, the SNP has demanded a Cabinet Office probe into the allegations. Tommy Sheppard, the party\u2019s candidate for Edinburgh East and its Cabinet Office spokesman, said the allegations \u201cgo to the heart of the abuse of the peerage system\u201d: While the SNP campaign every day to outline our positive vision for Scotland, the Westminster parties seem more consumed with dodgy back-room deals to rig the system in their own favour. This is unacceptable. This is from the Observer\u2019s Mark Townsend. Evidence that could lead to criminal charges against an anti-abortion group targeting a prominent Labour MP has been passed by police to the criminal prosecution authorities. The Metropolitan Police has submitted a case file to the Crown Prosecution Service and asked for advice over whether the targeting of Stella Creasy last month by supporters of the UK branch of the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform (CBR UK), an American anti-abortion organisation, constituted harassment. The development comes as a separate group has surfaced in Creasy\u2019s Walthamstow constituency with the stated aim of ousting her for her pro-choice stance. The Christian Peoples Alliance (CPA), which is opposed to equal marriage and abortion, says it will focus on attempting to depose the heavily pregnant Labour candidate, who led successful Westminster efforts to decriminalise terminations in Northern Ireland. The University of Bolton\u2019s student union president Ansh Sachdeva has taken the prime minister Boris Johnson on a short tour through the Chancellor\u2019s Mall building where donations of clothing, food, toiletries, other essentials and even phone chargers have flooded in. Johnson hailed the \u201cincredible response\u201d from the community after appeals were made via social media to help students displaced from the fire. He had brief handshakes with a number of the affected students and also met Prof William Morris, the university\u2019s deputy chair of the board of governors, who told the Prime Minister: It\u2019s been a terrific response, just marvellous. Luckily nobody was badly hurt, the fear here was tangible. The PM then travelled to the town centre where Dave Keelan, assistant chief fire officer at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, showed him the fire-damaged building and the ongoing recovery effort. A record number of women are expected to stand in next month\u2019s general election. More than 1,100 women have registered as candidates, making up a third of nominations, marking an increase from 29% in 2017 and 26% in 2015. The Guardian\u2019s Molly Blackall reports: The Labour party has become the first major political party in the UK to offer a majority of female candidates, with 53% of nominated candidates women \u2013 an 11% increase since the last election. Women make up 30% of the Conservative nominations, up just 1% since 2017, while the Liberal Democrats have increased their gender balance by 29% since the last election, to reach 31%. Of the Green party\u2019s candidates, 41% are female \u2013 the second highest of the major parties \u2013 followed by the Scottish National party\u2019s 34%. A quarter of Plaid Cymru\u2019s candidates are women, with the Brexit party fielding 20%. Vince Cable predicts the election will end in a hung parliament, sparking a referendum and another general election. The former leader of the Liberal Democrats said there is a \u201cone in a million\u201d chance that Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister. \u201cThe idea of Jeremy Corbyn winning and becoming Prime Minister, one in a million. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Cable told Sophy Ridge on Sky News. \u201cI think we\u2019re faced with either a Johnson majority, it could happen. Although I think more likely, no majority, but hung in a different way, with more of us and more SNP.\u201d When asked if Corbyn gets into Number 10 in the event of a hung parliament, Vince said: \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t and we\u2019ve been absolutely clear we couldn\u2019t possibly allow that to happen. \u201cIt would probably be some more neutral figure and then leading into a referendum to resolve the Brexit issue and another General Election soon after that.\u201d Labour\u2019s manifesto could drop this Thursday, according to social media posts from two shadow cabinet ministers. In a video posted on her Twitter account, shadow education secretory Angela Rayner said: \u201cToday I am going to our manifesto meeting where the trade unions, senior members of the Labour party, and the shadow cabinet will all get together to decide what goes in our manifesto. \u201cThank you to everyone who has contributed so far. My lips are going to have to be sealed until Thursday when we formally annouce it.\u201d Dan Carden, the shadow secretary of state for international development, also tweeted that the manifesto will be announced on Thursday The home secretary, Priti Patel, made a last-minute intervention to block a rescue operation to bring British orphans and unaccompanied minors home from Syria, the Observer has revealed. Patel was backed by several other ministers, including the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, when she objected to the extraction of British children from the war-ravaged country during National Security Council meetings last month and internal discussions. Mark Townsend, the Observer\u2019s home affairs editor, reports: More than 60 British minors, including at least three orphans, had been identified, and a quick and safe route identified to take them out of north-east Syria and then to Erbil, Iraq, where they would be flown home direct to the UK. It has also emerged that not only had the extraction plan been prepared but that a number of councils in the UK had offered the care package and reintegration programme necessary for the children following their arrival in the UK. The charity Save the Children, which has officials working in north-east Syria, described the resistance from ministers such as Patel as \u201cgrievous irresponsibility\u201d and said that \u201cplaying politics\u201d with children\u2019s lives was unacceptable. Nicola Sturgeon campaigns in Arbroath, Scotland. The first minister is visiting pro-Brexit communities in north-east Scotland to warn against the economic harm that will be done by a Tory Brexit A 71-year-old told Boris Johnson to deliver on his Brexit promises or face receiving an \u201cunpleasant\u201d letter. Johnson was out campaigning in Mansfield for Tory candidate Ben Bradley, who won the seat from Labour in 2017 by a majority of 1,057. While Johnson was warmly received by the residents in the four houses they visited in Millersdale Avenue, one woman sought reassurances from Johnson. This is from PA Media: Susan Kitchen, 71, answered at the third house and held her dog Peggy while speaking to the PM about the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. She said afterwards her heart was going \u201cten to the dozen\u201d and she was \u201cabsolutely shocked\u201d to see Mr Johnson. She told the PA news agency: \u201cI told him I was worried about the deal he was making and asked him specifically if their laws could overrule our laws because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. \u201cHe said no, absolutely not, so I says to him if you\u2019re wrong I\u2019m going to write you a letter - and it won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d This is from PA Media: Boris Johnson has been told to deliver on his Brexit promises or face receiving an unpleasant letter. The prime minister knocked on doors in Mansfield in a bid to boost the election cause of Tory candidate Ben Bradley, who won the seat from Labour in 2017 by a majority of 1,057. They received a positive response from the four houses they visited in Millersdale Avenue, although one resident sought assurances over the Brexit deal on offer. Susan Kitchen, 71, answered at the third house and held her dog Peggy while speaking to the PM about the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. She said afterwards her heart was going \u201cten to the dozen\u201d and she was \u201cabsolutely shocked\u201d to see Mr Johnson. She told the PA news agency: \u201cI told him I was worried about the deal he was making and asked him specifically if their laws could overrule our laws because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. \u201cHe said no, absolutely not, so I says to him if you\u2019re wrong I\u2019m going to write you a letter - and it won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d At the first house, Lucy Camm met the PM outside before he could reach the door and took a photo with him. She said: \u201cJesus Christ, I cannot believe you are outside my mum and dad\u2019s house. I cannot believe you\u2019re in our street. \u201cYou have definitely got our vote. We do not like Jeremy (Corbyn).\u201d Camm told PA: \u201cI just can\u2019t believe he\u2019s here. I wish I was kind of dressed a bit more appropriately and didn\u2019t come running out in my socks, but it\u2019s good though.\u201d Johnson received a positive response at the second property while at the final house one man greeted him by saying: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you young man.\u201d Further planned Nottinghamshire visits to plant a tree, in connection with one of the party\u2019s pledges, and to meet farmers were cancelled due to a change in the PM\u2019s schedule. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has planted a tree in north London at a campaign event. The move was intended to highlight the Lib Dem pledge to plant 60m trees a year if they gain power. The battle to win this election will be fought on many fronts and there will be many, many trees. The Conservative party has said it will triple tree-planting rates if it wins the general election, while the Liberal Democrats have promised they will plant twice as many trees as the Tories. Boris Johnson announced a \u00a3640m Nature for Climate fund which would increase tree planting in England, with the government aiming to work with the devolved administrations to boost tree-planting rates to 30,000 hectares every year, which the party said could mean 30m more trees. But the Liberal Democrats have said they will plant 60m trees every year, describing it as \u201cthe largest tree-planting programme in UK history\u201d. The party leader, Jo Swinson, planted a tree in north London at a campaign event this morning to highlight the party\u2019s pledge. As reported by Frances Perraudin this morning, the UK is one of the least forested countries in Europe, with just 10% of England covered by woodland, compared with 31% of France and 37% of Spain. The Brexit party MEP Ben Habib has said he thinks staying in the European Union would be better than going ahead with Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement. Habib sees the prime minister\u2019s deal as \u201cmuch worse\u201d than remaining in the bloc and that Johnson needs to be steered away from his plan. Habib told Sophy Ridge on Sky: \u201cWhat we really need to do is get the prime minister to pivot away from the withdrawal agreement.\u201d He added: \u201cI see the withdrawal agreement as much worse than remain, frankly,\u201d and that under Johnson\u2019s deal Northern Ireland would be \u201cbereft\u201d. Asked if it is the official Brexit party position that remaining in the EU is better than the prime minister\u2019s deal, he said: \u201cThat may or may not be our position. That\u2019s certainly my view.\u201d Explaining his party\u2019s decision not to stand in Tory-held seats, Habib said his party feared creating a hung parliament or giving power to the Labour party. \u201cThe key for us was to try and get a leave-sympathetic majority of parliamentarians in parliament, and we could have cut that cake in a number of different ways, but the way we decided to do it was to simply stand down against the Tories in those 317 seats,\u201d he said. When asked why the Brexit party was still standing in marginal seats held by Labour MPs, he said: \u201cWhat we\u2019d hoped was that the Tories would respond positively to the enormously generous offer that we made two weeks ago which was for them to stand down in the 150-odd seats that they haven\u2019t won for over a hundred years in the Labour heartlands.\u201d The shadow cabinet and other senior figures are slowly arriving at the party\u2019s clause V meeting in London, and have had their own messages for protesters calling on Labour to back freedom of movement. But who had the best response? The leader of Unite the Union, Len McCluskey, arriving moments after Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, approached protesters and shouted over them: \u201cI\u2019m going to support free movement, and I support migrant workers.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: \u201cEnd racism.\u201d The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, spoke briefly about Labour\u2019s immigration policy, saying: \u201cWe need to make sure we\u2019ve got international staff \u2013 nurses and doctors who continue to work for the NHS.\u201d Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have both thanked emergency services after a large fire at a student accommodation building in Bolton. Images posted on social media showed firefighters tackling the blaze on the top floors of a six-storey building. One witness described the fire as \u201ccrawl[ing] up the cladding like it was nothing\u201d. If you are looking for a break from the hectic news cycle this morning, check out the Guardian\u2019s Gary Younge. In the first of a three-part series he returns to his home town, Stevenage, to see how the bellwether constituency views the election. This is a tale of two Lewises. One, Lewis Silkin, was the minister for town and country planning in Labour\u2019s post-war government. Stevenage, the country\u2019s first new town built in 1946, was his baby. He envisioned it becoming a \u201cgay and bright place\u201d that would take the community-minded \u201cspirit of the slums\u201d and place it in the middle of the countryside with wonderful amenities and good municipal houses with gardens front and back. The other is Lewis Hamilton, Formula One champion and Stevenage\u2019s most famous son, who misspoke during the Sports Personality of the Year awards last year. In an unscripted moment, he said: \u201cIt really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums.\u201d He immediately corrected himself and later apologised. Somewhere up there Silkin stared down mouth agape, while back in Stevenage many looked on askance. Stevenage has no slums. That was the whole point. But it has seen better days. The police are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud after claims the Tories offered peerages to senior Brexit party figures to persuade them to stand down in the general election. The Labour peer Lord Falconer has written to the Metropolitan police commissioner and director of public prosecutions calling for an investigation into what he said were \u201cexceptionally serious allegations\u201d. Falconer said these allegations should be investigated as a matter of urgency in order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the election. The Met said: \u201cThe MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] has received two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice in relation to the 2019 general election. \u201cThe MPS special inquiry team is responsible for investigating all such criminal allegations. Both allegations are currently being assessed. \u201cThe MPS will not be providing comment about individual cases.\u201d The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has refused to back freedom of movement ahead of Labour\u2019s clause V meeting on Saturday. Burnham described immigration as a \u201cdifficult\u201d issue on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge show as there were \u201cstill different perspectives\u201d within the Labour party. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re right to be talking about a practical deal that keeps us as close to Europe as possible,\u201d he said. When asked whether he thinks Labour should back a position where free movement of people ends after Brexit, Burnham said: \u201cI think the public voted for change in the way the immigration arrangements work with Europe. \u201cTo deny that I think would be to deny what many people were saying when they went to vote in 2016, and that\u2019s just in my view, a fact. And it doesn\u2019t help politicians, it doesn\u2019t help parliament, if they look like they\u2019re kind of cocooned away from that public view. \u201cBut I think what we shouldn\u2019t do is introduce wholesale change. Just some greater management of the system.\u201d Burnham added he saw evidence of free movement allowing the undercutting of wages, where people were brought in by agencies from other European countries. \u201cThose are the issues that need to be addressed,\u201d he said. The Liberal Democrats have been criticised for their selective use of polling data on leaflets. The factchecking charity Full Fact has warned that attempts to mislead voters by using polling data to claim electoral advantage over rivals could have long-term implications for trust in politicians. Lisa O\u2019Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent, reports that leaflets across the country show the Liberal Democrats appear to be using bar charts to press home a message that they have a good chance of winning, even in seats where the likes of the Tories\u2019 Jacob Rees-Mogg or Labour stalwarts are seen as unlikely to be dislodged. In some leaflets the party omitted spectacular results for the Brexit party in bar charts showing the European election results, while in others it projected local election results to forecast wins in the general election. The party has also been criticised for using data from Flavible, an obscure company that is not a member of the British Polling Council. Good morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin and welcome to the politics live blog. We\u2019re liveblogging every weekend as well as weekdays during the election. Lucky you! All eyes will be on Labour\u2019s manifesto, which Jeremy Corbyn vowed would \u201cknock your socks off\u201d. The manifesto will be finalised in today\u2019s clause V meeting and immigration has re-emerged as a key battleground. The Daily Telegraph reported that Corbyn faces a frontbench split, referring to claims that a draft version of Labour\u2019s manifesto contains a commitment to freedom of movement. The newspaper quoted a shadow cabinet source as saying: \u201cIf we maintain a close relationship with the single market then we are going to have to maintain freedom of movement. That\u2019s a given.\u201d The Independent reported that policies of extending free movement and giving foreign nationals the right to vote in all UK elections, which passed at the party\u2019s annual conference on Saturday, are expected to be watered down or scrapped. Meanwhile, Wiley, the so-called godfather of grime, has come out in support of Corbyn. The endorsement follows reports that some of the artists involved with the Grime4Corbyn movement, which launched two years ago with the aim of connecting energised fans with the Labour leader\u2019s politics, now question the effectiveness of the campaign. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the action and keeping you updated on all the developments. To send me your tips and favourite Wiley songs, your best bet is to tweet me @aamnamohdin",

      "body": "<p>Marlene Hobsbawm is the author of <em>Meet Me in Buenos Aires</em> \u2013 a memoir described by Claire Tomalin as a \u201cdelight \u2013 courageous and warm-hearted\u201d. Now 87, she fled with her family from Vienna in 1938 and grew up in Manchester. A talented linguist, she worked in France and Italy in her 20s and spent a year in what was then the Congo before settling in London, where she met and married <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm\" title=\"\">Eric Hobsbawm</a>. A lifelong Marxist whose socio-political convictions were reflected in his work, Hobsbawm was one of the 20th century\u2019s best known historians. They were together for 50 years until his death at 95 in 2012 and had two children, Andy and Julia.</p> <p><strong>What made you decide to write a memoir?</strong><br>Soon after Eric died, Richard J Evans [the historian] came to me and asked if he could write his biography. It took him seven years to finish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/10/eric-hobsbawm-life-in-history-richard-j-evans-review\" title=\"\"><em>Eric Hobsbawm: A Life in History</em></a>,<em> </em>and it is very good, marvellous on the history, the politics and the books. But I felt it would be nice if there were a complementary book showing my version of my own life and our life together. And I didn\u2019t want to die before getting my story down on paper for my grandchildren.</p> <p><strong>Your early life</strong><strong> sounds wildly adventurous for a young woman in the 1940s and 50s, leaving home at 16 to </strong><strong>work first in Paris, then Rome\u2026</strong><br>It was a much less dangerous world at that time. It seemed like nothing for a girl to go to places alone. When I went to work for the UN in the Congo it never crossed my mind that I might come to any harm. It felt like a much safer world for women.</p> <p><strong>Did you really play footsie with Kirk Douglas on an Italian train?</strong><br>Actually, he played footsie with me. It was the 1950s and my friend Mariella worked at [the film studio] Cinecitt\u00e0. She had been sent to Capri to find Kirk Douglas, who hadn\u2019t returned from a holiday there, and bring him back. I went along to keep her company and we had a lot of fun on the way back to Rome. Mr Douglas was rather outrageous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our phone was tapped. I  felt sorry for the person listening in: all they heard was me talking to mother about nappies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Your account of first meeting Eric at the home of your brother Walter Schwarz [a foreign correspondent for the <em>Guardian</em>] sounds like a classic <em>coup de foudre</em>. Is that how it felt?</strong><br>There was chemistry immediately between us. I wore an ocelot coat of my cousin\u2019s and I told him I\u2019d shot it in Africa. He believed me \u2013 at least for a minute. He had this wonderful voice, a light tenor, which I liked. And I could see that even when he was talking to other people he always knew where I was in the room. When he said he was about to go off on a long trip to Cuba I remember thinking \u201cwhat a shame\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Neal Ascherson </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/10/eric-hobsbawm-life-in-history-richard-j-evans-review\" title=\"\"><strong>wrote in his review</strong></a><strong> of Richard Evans\u2019s biography that marrying you \u201creally saved\u201d Eric, who had been living a somewhat rackety life up to then. Do you agree?</strong><br>In a way, I do. His first wife had left him after having an abortion and he\u2019d had a breakdown. He was for 10 years alone. He had many friends because he was good company, but things had been very difficult for him. As soon as we met life for him became good, everything came together, so I did save him in that sense. He\u2019d thought he would never have children but he was the most wonderful father.</p> <p><strong>In your book you describe marriage to Eric as like living with \u201ca human encyclop</strong><strong>edia\u201d. Did his intellect ever feel daunting?</strong><br>Never. My mother often said she didn\u2019t know how I managed living with someone who asked so many questions. She couldn\u2019t understand how I had ended up with the cleverest man in Europe. But Eric wasn\u2019t intimidating to me. He was just an ordinary person at home. He could relax. And he liked talking about all sorts of things. He was very gregarious. We had fun and we were in love. It wasn\u2019t complicated.</p> <p><strong>Your married life sounds very sociable and your dinner guests sound like a who\u2019s who of London\u2019s intelligentsia: </strong><strong>Michael Frayn, </strong><strong>Marina Warner, Neal Ascherson, David Cannadine, Roy Foster</strong><strong>, the list goes on...</strong><br>We had a wonderful core group of friends, many of them stemming from Cambridge, and big dinner parties were the norm. I spent a lot of time planning and organising who would fit together. There is an art to it. But it wasn\u2019t fancy. We wanted peace and quiet to talk and you couldn\u2019t do that if you ate out because the music in restaurants in those days was awful.</p> <p><strong>It emerged a few years ago that your family </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/mi5-spied-historians-eric-hobsbawm-christopher-hill-secret-files\" title=\"\"><strong>was spied on by MI5 for decades</strong></a><strong>. Were you aware of this at the time?</strong><br>Oh yes, of course. I knew our phone was tapped. There was a click every time you used it. I used to feel sorry for the person listening in: all they heard most of the time was me talking to my mother about children and nappies.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br><em>The Sorrows of Young Werther </em>by Goethe, a book I first read only recently, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/07/collected-stories-lydia-davis-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis</em></a>. Her writing is so fresh and different. Also in the pile is <em>Clean Young Englishman</em> by John Gale, the autobiography of a soldier and foreign correspondent [for the <em>Observer</em>] who was driven to depression and suicide by the atrocities he saw reporting from war zones. I return to it again and again. It\u2019s absolutely a golden book, perhaps the best I have ever read \u2013 so moving and beautifully written.</p> <p><strong>Which novelists and nonfiction writers working today do you admire?</strong><br>I love Jane Glover and very much want to read her new book, <em>Handel in London: The Making of a Genius</em>. I also like Elizabeth Strout. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/02/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-elizabeth-strout\" title=\"\"><em>My Name Is Lucy Barton</em></a><em> </em>was wonderful. I liked the way it had the feel of a memoir.</p> <p><strong>What sort of a reader were you as a child?</strong><br>I didn\u2019t read much as a child. I was six when my family emigrated from Vienna and for a year or so afterwards I became a self-imposed mute. I didn\u2019t know it at the time but it was a protest. I was furious about being uprooted. My cover was blown when my mother overheard me talking to my dolls in perfect English. But I was very screwed up as a child because of the war. I hated being evacuated and loathed being sent to boarding school, supposedly for my own safety. I ran away when I was 10.

      "bodyText": "Marlene Hobsbawm is the author of Meet Me in Buenos Aires \u2013 a memoir described by Claire Tomalin as a \u201cdelight \u2013 courageous and warm-hearted\u201d. Now 87, she fled with her family from Vienna in 1938 and grew up in Manchester. A talented linguist, she worked in France and Italy in her 20s and spent a year in what was then the Congo before settling in London, where she met and married Eric Hobsbawm. A lifelong Marxist whose socio-political convictions were reflected in his work, Hobsbawm was one of the 20th century\u2019s best known historians. They were together for 50 years until his death at 95 in 2012 and had two children, Andy and Julia. What made you decide to write a memoir? Soon after Eric died, Richard J Evans [the historian] came to me and asked if he could write his biography. It took him seven years to finish Eric Hobsbawm: A Life in History, and it is very good, marvellous on the history, the politics and the books. But I felt it would be nice if there were a complementary book showing my version of my own life and our life together. And I didn\u2019t want to die before getting my story down on paper for my grandchildren. Your early life sounds wildly adventurous for a young woman in the 1940s and 50s, leaving home at 16 to work first in Paris, then Rome\u2026 It was a much less dangerous world at that time. It seemed like nothing for a girl to go to places alone. When I went to work for the UN in the Congo it never crossed my mind that I might come to any harm. It felt like a much safer world for women. Did you really play footsie with Kirk Douglas on an Italian train? Actually, he played footsie with me. It was the 1950s and my friend Mariella worked at [the film studio] Cinecitt\u00e0. She had been sent to Capri to find Kirk Douglas, who hadn\u2019t returned from a holiday there, and bring him back. I went along to keep her company and we had a lot of fun on the way back to Rome. Mr Douglas was rather outrageous. Your account of first meeting Eric at the home of your brother Walter Schwarz [a foreign correspondent for the Guardian] sounds like a classic coup de foudre. Is that how it felt? There was chemistry immediately between us. I wore an ocelot coat of my cousin\u2019s and I told him I\u2019d shot it in Africa. He believed me \u2013 at least for a minute. He had this wonderful voice, a light tenor, which I liked. And I could see that even when he was talking to other people he always knew where I was in the room. When he said he was about to go off on a long trip to Cuba I remember thinking \u201cwhat a shame\u201d. Neal Ascherson wrote in his review of Richard Evans\u2019s biography that marrying you \u201creally saved\u201d Eric, who had been living a somewhat rackety life up to then. Do you agree? In a way, I do. His first wife had left him after having an abortion and he\u2019d had a breakdown. He was for 10 years alone. He had many friends because he was good company, but things had been very difficult for him. As soon as we met life for him became good, everything came together, so I did save him in that sense. He\u2019d thought he would never have children but he was the most wonderful father. In your book you describe marriage to Eric as like living with \u201ca human encyclopedia\u201d. Did his intellect ever feel daunting? Never. My mother often said she didn\u2019t know how I managed living with someone who asked so many questions. She couldn\u2019t understand how I had ended up with the cleverest man in Europe. But Eric wasn\u2019t intimidating to me. He was just an ordinary person at home. He could relax. And he liked talking about all sorts of things. He was very gregarious. We had fun and we were in love. It wasn\u2019t complicated. Your married life sounds very sociable and your dinner guests sound like a who\u2019s who of London\u2019s intelligentsia: Michael Frayn, Marina Warner, Neal Ascherson, David Cannadine, Roy Foster, the list goes on... We had a wonderful core group of friends, many of them stemming from Cambridge, and big dinner parties were the norm. I spent a lot of time planning and organising who would fit together. There is an art to it. But it wasn\u2019t fancy. We wanted peace and quiet to talk and you couldn\u2019t do that if you ate out because the music in restaurants in those days was awful. It emerged a few years ago that your family was spied on by MI5 for decades. Were you aware of this at the time? Oh yes, of course. I knew our phone was tapped. There was a click every time you used it. I used to feel sorry for the person listening in: all they heard most of the time was me talking to my mother about children and nappies. What books are on your bedside table? The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe, a book I first read only recently, and The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis. Her writing is so fresh and different. Also in the pile is Clean Young Englishman by John Gale, the autobiography of a soldier and foreign correspondent [for the Observer] who was driven to depression and suicide by the atrocities he saw reporting from war zones. I return to it again and again. It\u2019s absolutely a golden book, perhaps the best I have ever read \u2013 so moving and beautifully written. Which novelists and nonfiction writers working today do you admire? I love Jane Glover and very much want to read her new book, Handel in London: The Making of a Genius. I also like Elizabeth Strout. My Name Is Lucy Barton was wonderful. I liked the way it had the feel of a memoir. What sort of a reader were you as a child? I didn\u2019t read much as a child. I was six when my family emigrated from Vienna and for a year or so afterwards I became a self-imposed mute. I didn\u2019t know it at the time but it was a protest. I was furious about being uprooted. My cover was blown when my mother overheard me talking to my dolls in perfect English. But I was very screwed up as a child because of the war. I hated being evacuated and loathed being sent to boarding school, supposedly for my own safety. I ran away when I was 10. Once my parents realised I just wanted to be allowed to stay at home I was fine, I was happy. You have so many books \u2013 how do you organise them? They\u2019re arranged by genre. We had so many more books when Eric was alive. A lot of them have been sold or are in storage. But quite a few of them I still have on my shelves. So you see, he is still here. \u2022 Meet Me in Buenos Aires by Marlene Hobsbawm is published by Muswell Press (\u00a312.99)",

About 200 were in the town of Worksop, where two homeless men almost drowned when they became trapped in an industrial wheelie bin they had been sleeping in.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like we have been forgotten a bit,\u201d said Kathy Frankland, a Cliff Richard mega-fan who had to be rescued by dinghy from the Riverside Caravan Park, where she has been the site manager for 23 years. Her own caravan was ruined, along with 15 others, and her car was a write-off.</p> <p>Like many in Worksop, including Bassetlaw\u2019s council leader, Simon Greaves, Frankland believes the flooding could have been avoided. At 8am on Thursday, 7 November, she says she made the first of many calls to the floods emergency line run by the Canal and River Trust, which looks after Britain\u2019s waterways, asking them to open a sluice gate that would divert water out of the River Ryton into the Chesterfield Canal.</p> <p>Council employees made similar pleas, but all fell on deaf ears at the Canal and River Trust, said Greaves. Eventually, shortly before midnight, he watched as the fire service opened the gate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ed654522c11bd2c26e8409e80f666173aeae37b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ed654522c11bd2c26e8409e80f666173aeae37b/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Stiff, proprietor of Top Locks hairdressers in Worksop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Stiff, proprietor of Top Locks hairdressers in Worksop: \u2018I\u2019ve just found out my insurance isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eight days later, last Friday, the Trust insisted that the sluice was not designed to drain the river. \u201cDefinitively, it would not have alleviated the flooding in the town. The water would have stayed in the area as the feeder, canal and river all run in parallel a very short distance apart,\u201d said a spokesman.</p> <p>Greaves rejects what he thinks is an \u201cexcuse\u201d. He believes small towns such as his are deemed less important to protect than bigger, wealthier conurbations. \u201cIn terms of flood defence funding, we don\u2019t have the GVA [gross value added] of Sheffield, we don\u2019t have the million-pound properties or businesses. And priority is given for areas of what would be considered greatest economic need. I\u2019m sure somewhere that decision makes sense, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, and it doesn\u2019t make sense if you are in a flood-damaged property in Worksop, where you were flooded in 2007 and again now and you are thinking: this is a house that I am never going to be able to sell.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/flood_towns/giv-3902Q7SxwVowI7WO/\" data-alt=\"flood towns graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/flood_towns/giv-3902Q7SxwVowI7WO/\">flood towns graphic</a> </figure>  <p>At the Top Locks hairdresser on Worksop\u2019s Central Avenue, which backs on to the Ryton, owner Jonathan Stiff was wondering how he would pay for the damage to his shop, having just read the small print of his insurance policy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just found out that it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on.

One of the worst hit areas was Bassetlaw, the most northerly district of Nottinghamshire, where around 300 homes and businesses were flooded. About 200 were in the town of Worksop, where two homeless men almost drowned when they became trapped in an industrial wheelie bin they had been sleeping in. \u201cIt feels like we have been forgotten a bit,\u201d said Kathy Frankland, a Cliff Richard mega-fan who had to be rescued by dinghy from the Riverside Caravan Park, where she has been the site manager for 23 years. Her own caravan was ruined, along with 15 others, and her car was a write-off. Like many in Worksop, including Bassetlaw\u2019s council leader, Simon Greaves, Frankland believes the flooding could have been avoided. At 8am on Thursday, 7 November, she says she made the first of many calls to the floods emergency line run by the Canal and River Trust, which looks after Britain\u2019s waterways, asking them to open a sluice gate that would divert water out of the River Ryton into the Chesterfield Canal. Council employees made similar pleas, but all fell on deaf ears at the Canal and River Trust, said Greaves. Eventually, shortly before midnight, he watched as the fire service opened the gate. Eight days later, last Friday, the Trust insisted that the sluice was not designed to drain the river. \u201cDefinitively, it would not have alleviated the flooding in the town. The water would have stayed in the area as the feeder, canal and river all run in parallel a very short distance apart,\u201d said a spokesman. Greaves rejects what he thinks is an \u201cexcuse\u201d. He believes small towns such as his are deemed less important to protect than bigger, wealthier conurbations. \u201cIn terms of flood defence funding, we don\u2019t have the GVA [gross value added] of Sheffield, we don\u2019t have the million-pound properties or businesses. And priority is given for areas of what would be considered greatest economic need. I\u2019m sure somewhere that decision makes sense, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, and it doesn\u2019t make sense if you are in a flood-damaged property in Worksop, where you were flooded in 2007 and again now and you are thinking: this is a house that I am never going to be able to sell.\u201d At the Top Locks hairdresser on Worksop\u2019s Central Avenue, which backs on to the Ryton, owner Jonathan Stiff was wondering how he would pay for the damage to his shop, having just read the small print of his insurance policy. \u201cI\u2019ve just found out that it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on. Even though, whenever I get insurance, I start the conversation saying \u2018by the way, we back on to a river\u2019, I\u2019ve just realised there is a clause which says the property has to be 250 metres away from a watercourse. It means it\u2019s invalid. There is no way I can afford to pay to put this all right.\u201d",

Reviewing on this year, you have had a good year, 100 titles and a Grand Slam final. What do you have to do next year to make sure you\u2019re back here and the younger ones don\u2019t dominate the top 8?<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Federer: I think, you know, I\u2019ve got to keep on playing at the level like I have this year, and then I will create some chances. I thought I played some consistent, solid tennis. Got to take care of my body, listen to the signs, work well with the team, get the balance right with everything that\u2019s happening in my life.</p> <p>Then when the matches come, it\u2019s not maybe as easy as it was maybe 10, 15 years ago where you\u2019re just going to play very good day in, day out, maybe you need to do extra effort sometimes for that to happen. Maybe that\u2019s what it felt like today is just things were complicated, but I\u2019ve got to maybe do even a better job at figuring these moments out, because the opportunities were there today, for instance. </p> <p>They were there in other moments as well this season, maybe Indian Wells or Wimbledon or whatever. That can change an entire season around, the confidence around, the flow of things. But, you know, I\u2019m happy how I played this season, and I\u2019m extremely excited for next season.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-16T17:32:53.579Z\">at 5.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dd026438f08eeb483f18c58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-16T16:41:05.514Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More from Stefanos Tsitsipas:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, it\u2019s not easy to copy Federer. This guy does magic on the court so for me. I\u2019m trying to do half of what he does [laughs]. He can be so good sometimes! You know, obviously we have different gamestyles. I\u2019m a one-handed backhand, he\u2019s a one-handed backhand too but we all come in different shapes and sizes. Also, Dominic is part of our \u2018community\u2019, let\u2019s call it. Really nice to see the single-handed backhand being alive and there\u2019s so much for me to learn from all these players. Roger as well, I grew up watching Roger as a kid. Watching him here at the Nitto finals, watching him at the Wimbledon, plenty of finals. Wished I could step out on the court one day and face him. Today I\u2019m here and living the dream. I remember myself being one of these kids here watching the event. For me, it was just, you know, I could never picture myself standing here but it did happen. I mean, dreams do come true.</p> <p>I have no preference [for the final]. I played Sascha in the groups. Obviously everything can happen now in the finals. Sascha proved it to us last year when he was defeated by Novak [in the group stage] and he went out in the final and beat him, so anything can happen now. I just need to be super careful. I need to have a good schedule before my match tomorrow, and let\u2019s hope for a good semi-final.

Tsitsipas buried a glorious backhand down the line winner after a long point. The game is so long and these points are so good that Tsitsipas reacted by laughing out loud. On his sixth set points, Tsitsipas sent a forehand long after a big crosscourt forehand from Federer. Finally, the Greek found two big serves in a row to take the set on his<em> seventh </em>set point.

Both in Dubai and a few weeks ago at home in Basel, Federer seemed to enjoy how his game matches up with Tsitsipas\u2019s, winning both matches 6-4 6-4 with a break in each set. Both matches were quite routine.</p> <p>Federer will look to do what he did in those recent matches and also against Djokovic - serve incredibly well, be extremely aggressive behind his serve and look to come into the net. As usual, he will play at an extremely fast pace to match those fast courts. Tsitsipas\u2019 plan will be quite similar, but the big challenge is whether he can match Federer\u2019s serving rate and efficiency. </p> <p>The one big worry for Tsitsipas fans should be on return. Despite how well he played against Nadal, he failed to generate a single break point after nearly three hours on court. For a top player, that is unacceptable unless facing Ivo Karlovic. It\u2019s clear that he has specific problems with Nadal\u2019s lefty serve, but his return is his one big weakness in general. He takes too many big cuts at the ball and he is still learning to effectively block returns back. Federer will look to make as many returns as possible and unless Tsitsipas is super sharp, that could be the difference.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-16T13:33:38.814Z\">at 1.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dcff7148f08aab51e1c0423\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-16T13:19:28.497Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And here is Roger Federer after his sublime 6-4 6-3 victory over Djokovic on Thursday.</strong></p> <p>Q.

That was a good feeling to have, but then again, that doesn\u2019t mean much because Novak has done an unbelievable job in his career to find ways to either make you play bad or to just be better on you on the day or squeeze another victory out like the way he did at Wimbledon.</p> <p>So I knew the beginning wasn\u2019t key, but I knew it was important. I had a great run on the serve, as well, throughout I think that first set.</p> <p>I was able to keep the pressure going and mix up my game, because he was playing incredibly aggressive at one point midway through the first set, which surprised me a little bit.</p> <p>Yeah, I think things just worked very well for me.

We begin today with an enormous match as Roger Federer, the last remaining member of the big 3, takes on Stefanos Tsitsipas for a place in the final. Later on, good friends Alexander Zverev and Dominic Thiem will take to the court in their first match of the year.</p> <p>We\u2019re eleven months into 2019 yet few moments this year have been as joyous and have seemed as significant as Tsitsipas\u2019 four-set defeat of Federer en route to the Australian Open semi-final in January. It was the moment the Greek announced himself on the big stage and the rest of this season has been such a learning curve for him, filled with both massive moments and lows that have forced him to learn and improve.</p> <p>Both players arrive in this match having played some incredible tennis. Tsitsipas blasted through his opening two matches against Daniil Medvedev 7-6(5) 6-4 and Zverev 6-3 6-2 before barely losing an incredible match against an on-fire Nadal Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 7-5 yesterday afternoon. The amount of trust he has with his serve, forehand and net game is so impressive, as is how intelligently he uses all of those strokes at such a young age.</p> <p>Across the net, he faces a Federer who started slowly with a meek loss to Thiem, but he improved in his 7-6(2) 6-3 win over Matteo Berrettini and then played one of his matches of the year to tear through Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3. His serving was astounding and he backed it up with unflinching aggression. It blows the mind to see him still producing such a high level at 38, yet here we are.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from that cracking semi-final: Roger Federer is already looking forward to next year. Q. Reviewing on this year, you have had a good year, 100 titles and a Grand Slam final. What do you have to do next year to make sure you\u2019re back here and the younger ones don\u2019t dominate the top 8? Federer: I think, you know, I\u2019ve got to keep on playing at the level like I have this year, and then I will create some chances. I thought I played some consistent, solid tennis. Got to take care of my body, listen to the signs, work well with the team, get the balance right with everything that\u2019s happening in my life. Then when the matches come, it\u2019s not maybe as easy as it was maybe 10, 15 years ago where you\u2019re just going to play very good day in, day out, maybe you need to do extra effort sometimes for that to happen. Maybe that\u2019s what it felt like today is just things were complicated, but I\u2019ve got to maybe do even a better job at figuring these moments out, because the opportunities were there today, for instance. They were there in other moments as well this season, maybe Indian Wells or Wimbledon or whatever. That can change an entire season around, the confidence around, the flow of things. But, you know, I\u2019m happy how I played this season, and I\u2019m extremely excited for next season. More from Stefanos Tsitsipas: Well, it\u2019s not easy to copy Federer. This guy does magic on the court so for me. I\u2019m trying to do half of what he does [laughs]. He can be so good sometimes! You know, obviously we have different gamestyles. I\u2019m a one-handed backhand, he\u2019s a one-handed backhand too but we all come in different shapes and sizes. Also, Dominic is part of our \u2018community\u2019, let\u2019s call it. Really nice to see the single-handed backhand being alive and there\u2019s so much for me to learn from all these players. Roger as well, I grew up watching Roger as a kid. Watching him here at the Nitto finals, watching him at the Wimbledon, plenty of finals. Wished I could step out on the court one day and face him. Today I\u2019m here and living the dream. I remember myself being one of these kids here watching the event. For me, it was just, you know, I could never picture myself standing here but it did happen. I mean, dreams do come true. I have no preference [for the final]. I played Sascha in the groups. Obviously everything can happen now in the finals. Sascha proved it to us last year when he was defeated by Novak [in the group stage] and he went out in the final and beat him, so anything can happen now. I just need to be super careful. I need to have a good schedule before my match tomorrow, and let\u2019s hope for a good semi-final. I\u2019m gonna watch it. If Roger Federer is looking for any consolation, perhaps he should turn on the TV right now. There is a special retirement ceremony going on with many familiar names and plenty of people who are younger than him: Nicolas Almagro, Marcos Baghdatis, Tomas Berdych, Victor Estrella Burgos, David Ferrer, Marcin Matkowski, Max Mirnyi, Radek Stepanek and Mikhail Youzhny. Former French Open finalist Ferrer and former Wimbledon finalist Berdych will go down as two of the best players of the previous generation. They both enjoyed incredible careers and were clearly unlucky to have played in the same generation as the big 3. Stefanos Tsitsipas after his win: Wow! Jesus. I\u2019m so proud of myself today. Great performance and once again, people were great. I really enjoyed my time on the court and sometimes matches like this, you wonder yourself how you overcome all those difficulties, all those break points down. It\u2019s really, like, a mental struggle. So I\u2019m really proud that I managed to save so many break points today. You know, I was trying not to give an easy time to Roger. He was playing good and shout out to him as well. He did pretty well this week in Nitto. I mean, an inspration, obviously, as always. Playing him, it\u2019s the biggest honour I could have. Today\u2019s win, victory is probably one of my best matches of this season. And these are the moments that I always wait for and these are the moments that I want to prove the best out of my game. The nerves in that final game were just excruciating. Tsitsipas opened with a forehand error off a low Federer slice, then again at 15-15, he sent a routine forehand flying out. Federer worked the 15-30 point really well, moving the ball around, opening the court and then crushing a forehand down the line. But it ended with a dire, nervy backhand shank from Tsitsipas. The theme today has been their respective performances from break points down, and it was again at 15-40. Federer shanked a bad forehand wide on the first break point and then screamed at himself. From there, Tsitsipas took control. He found a big serve on the second break point and eventually closed out a brilliant win with another big serve. What a tournament. What a year. The 21 year old from Greece will contest his first ever final in London. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 *5-4 Roger Federer: Federer holds from deuce to force the Greek to serve out the match, sealed with a big serve down the T. He continues to make life harder for himself though - he missed a dire routine forehand at 30-15. Let\u2019s see what he has to offer here. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 5-3* Roger Federer: Tsitsipas throws in another hold to move within a game of victory, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Federer opened the game with a brilliant crosscourt pass and then Tsitsipas threw in a double fault at 15-30. But the Greek has been spectacular with his back to the wall today. From 15-30, Tsitsipas stood on the baseline and forced an error out of Federer with two booming forehands. A service winner followed, then Federer shanked a bad backhand out to limply hand over the game. Almost there. Tennis never stops... Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 *4-3 Roger Federer: Federer keeps himself in the match by holding to 30, closing off with a great forehand crosscourt to force a Tsitsipas forehand error and then an unreturned first serve. But even in that game he made life far too difficult for himself, throwing in two errors from 30-0 up. He has now hit 8 winners and 11 unforced errors in this set. That, my friends, is not good at all. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 4-2* Roger Federer: After two long deuce games and two breaks, Tsitsipas once again shows himself to be the sharper player today by clinching down a great hold to 15. He finished with a brilliant forehand down the line at 30-15 before his backhand down the line passing shot was just good enough to force a forehand volley error from Federer and secure the hold. Some of these points are gruelling. Both players look tired and frustrated at times, but Tsitsipas\u2019 athleticism is really helping him right now. Can he keep this lead? Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 *3-2 Roger Federer: Roger Federer finally converted a break point, only to let too many game points go. That was a nervy, nervy service game. The Swiss shanked a forehand at 30-30 to fall down break point, but his response was two brilliant service winners to bring up game point. Federer dragged a forehand wide on the first game point and Tsitsipas crushed a backhand down the line, as good as a winner, on the second. On break point, Tsitsipas stepped in and crushed a forehand winner crosscourt. The Greek is showing his mental fortitude today and he refuses to go away. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 2-2* Roger Federer: Federer finally breaks! It only took 9 break points for it to happen. Federer continues to return incredibly well and he moved up 0-40 after two spectacular forehand returns. But on break points, Federer has been another player today. He missed his 7th and 8th break points with two dire backhand return errors. Tsitsipas eradicated the final with a great overhead. The Swiss persevered, saving the game point with a precise forehand down the line and then connecting with a beautiful dropshot. Tsitsipas finally shanked a forehand wide on the eighth break point, and Federer is back in it. The bullet backhand return from Federer on one of the many set points. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 *2-1 Roger Federer: Well, that was a horrible service game from Roger Federer. There is not much else to say. He failed to get a single first serve in play and hit three routine groundstroke errors to fall down 0-40. A tame forehand into the net from Federer sealed the break. Suddenly, this looks like an extremely tough task. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 1-1* Roger Federer: After a couple of incredibly difficult holds and countless break points saved, Tsitsipas gets onto the board in set two with an easy hold to 15. He struck a brilliant backhand down the line to hold. He will be looking for more service games like that one. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 *0-1 Roger Federer: No problem for Federer on serve as he slipped in a quick love hold to begin the second set. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 Roger Federer: Tsitsipas takes the first set after the most spectacular game of the entire week. Tsitsipas opened with two quite dire backhand errors to fall down 0-30 but he once again recovered well to bring them level at 30-30. But after a long point where both players prodded the other and moved, Federer found an incredible combination of angled forehands to bring up a break point. Tsitsipas again responded with some nerveless forehands, and he screamed at himself in glee after saving the first break point. Little did he know what was to come. Federer saved Tsitsipas\u2019 first set point with an incredible bullet of a backhand winner, Tsitsipas double faulted on the second, and then Federer landed a great forehand return on the third. The pressure seemed to be proving too much for the Greek as Tsitsipas sent a backhand long to give Federer break point. Yet on break point, it was Federer\u2019s time to feel the nerves, sending a routine backhand long. Tsitsipas responded with an ace to bring up another set point point, but then Federer won an incredible point with a whistling backhand down the line. Tsitsipas buried a glorious backhand down the line winner after a long point. The game is so long and these points are so good that Tsitsipas reacted by laughing out loud. On his sixth set points, Tsitsipas sent a forehand long after a big crosscourt forehand from Federer. Finally, the Greek found two big serves in a row to take the set on his seventh set point. What a game! First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *5-3 Roger Federer: Federer flits through another a quick love hold with ample big serves to put the pressure right back on Tsitsipas\u2019 shoulders. This is far from spectacular from the Swiss. Even the serving isn\u2019t that impressive, but he\u2019s in this now and he needs to take his chances when they come. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 5-2* Roger Federer: That was some hold from Stefanos Tsitsipas, who recovers from triple break point down to retain his lead and move to within a game of the first set. Instead of panicking at 0-40, the Greek responded with two huge forehands and then a gutsy unreturned second serve. He his crushing his forehand and it is so impressive to see how much he trusts it. With a missed second serve return by Federer on break point, he moves on. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *4-2 Roger Federer: Another good hold for the Swiss. Federer seems to be finding his rhythm on his first serve and moving to the net well. A glorious drop volley from Federer at 15-0 helped him to 40-0. It took a couple of attempts, but at 40-30 a great backhand down the line from Federer forced a Tsitsipas forehand error. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 4-1* Roger Federer: Tsitsipas\u2019s serve to forehand one-two punch is working very well so far, and he needs it to continue like this. He opened the game with a big forehand winner after the first serve, and again to move up 40-15. Federer fought well to bring Tsitsipas back to deuce, but at deuce Tsitsipas crushed another forehand winner after a big first serve. A sloppy backhand error from Federer and Tsitsipas is able to maintain the break lead. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *3-1 Roger Federer: Much better work from Federer to put his name on the board. He opened by dispatching a couple of nice volleys at the net, then snuck into the net again to pick off a backhand volley at 30-0. With a missed backhand return from Tsitsipas, Federer is on the board with a great love hold. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 3-0* Roger Federer: This could have been an awful start for Tsitsipas as he reckoned with break point in the opening game. Instead, it has been a great one. Some really solid serving from the Greek to move ahead: Very nice use of the body serve at 30-15, then he slammed an ace down the T to hold. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *2-0 Roger Federer: Federer did look sharp in his opening few points, but it has been quite dire since the break point. He started his opening service game with a couple of loose errors to immediately fall down 0-30. He recovered well to 30-30, then badly missed an overhead. Tsitsipas sensed the opportunity on break point and went on the attack, burying a forehand down the line to take the first break. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 1-0* Roger Federer: A tough opening service game for Tsitsipas, who recovers from break point down to secure his first hold. Federer is already moving extremely well and looks quite sharp. He unleashed a big crosscourt forehand to force an error and bring Tsitsipas to 30-30, then he chased down a decent dropshot from the Greek and slipped a backhand reply past him at the net. A shanked missed return from Federer scuppered the break point, then he eventually sent a forehand long on the Greek\u2019s second game point. We begin. Before we begin this very serious match, a less serious moment between these two in September at the Laver Cup. The players are now on the court. Roger Federer won the toss and elected to receive. Dominance. In the first doubles semi-final, Raven Klassen and Michael Venus just recovered from a set down to defeat top seeds Robert Farah and Juan Sebastian Cabal. A huge win. They await the winner of Nicolas Mahut/Pierre Hugues Herbert vs Lukasz Kubot/Marcelo Melo this evening. You can find highlights of their Dubai final here. So, who will win today? Although everyone looks to that first meeting between Tsitsipas and Federer as their most notable battle, the pair have played twice since on smaller stages. Both in Dubai and a few weeks ago at home in Basel, Federer seemed to enjoy how his game matches up with Tsitsipas\u2019s, winning both matches 6-4 6-4 with a break in each set. Both matches were quite routine. Federer will look to do what he did in those recent matches and also against Djokovic - serve incredibly well, be extremely aggressive behind his serve and look to come into the net. As usual, he will play at an extremely fast pace to match those fast courts. Tsitsipas\u2019 plan will be quite similar, but the big challenge is whether he can match Federer\u2019s serving rate and efficiency. The one big worry for Tsitsipas fans should be on return. Despite how well he played against Nadal, he failed to generate a single break point after nearly three hours on court. For a top player, that is unacceptable unless facing Ivo Karlovic. It\u2019s clear that he has specific problems with Nadal\u2019s lefty serve, but his return is his one big weakness in general. He takes too many big cuts at the ball and he is still learning to effectively block returns back. Federer will look to make as many returns as possible and unless Tsitsipas is super sharp, that could be the difference. And here is Roger Federer after his sublime 6-4 6-3 victory over Djokovic on Thursday. Q. You were on fire from the first point to the last point. Can you just give us your views on the way this match went and your excitement at the end when it was finally done? ROGER FEDERER: I mean, yeah, there is a lot that goes into a match like this. I spoke at length to the team before, probably over an hour 15 about all the different possibilities about what can happen. They told me what they think is going to happen. We shared those feelings. When you walk out, you just don\u2019t know if any of it is going to work out or come the way it will. I felt from the get-go I had good rhythm off the baseline and on the serve and that I felt like he was living dangerously if he was not going to play great tennis. That was a good feeling to have, but then again, that doesn\u2019t mean much because Novak has done an unbelievable job in his career to find ways to either make you play bad or to just be better on you on the day or squeeze another victory out like the way he did at Wimbledon. So I knew the beginning wasn\u2019t key, but I knew it was important. I had a great run on the serve, as well, throughout I think that first set. I was able to keep the pressure going and mix up my game, because he was playing incredibly aggressive at one point midway through the first set, which surprised me a little bit. Yeah, I think things just worked very well for me. Tonight was one of those nights where, you know, I was clear in the game plan. I got what I kind of expected, and it was a great feeling at the very end. The reaction showed. Tsitsipas was asked about the semi-final before he knew who he would face. Here is his answer: Q. You have either Roger or Thiem tomorrow. Any preference either way? Can you just talk about the matchup with both of them? STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: Well, Thiem plays with a lot of intensity, uses his forehand very well. Roger is very aggressive. I mean, both very aggressive players but different styles. I would compare that one is just flawless and doesn\u2019t use too much of his power to play. The other one is really forcing much. So for me I\u2019m going to -- I mean, I\u2019m going to take it pretty much the same way, both single-handed backhands. I have played them both. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not much to say about them. I respect them, and I have to play well. I know that, because everything is -- everything counts in the semifinals of the O2. Here are the highlights of that huge encounter in Melbourne. Hello! Welcome to our coverage on semi-final day of the ATP Finals from the O2 Arena. We begin today with an enormous match as Roger Federer, the last remaining member of the big 3, takes on Stefanos Tsitsipas for a place in the final. Later on, good friends Alexander Zverev and Dominic Thiem will take to the court in their first match of the year. We\u2019re eleven months into 2019 yet few moments this year have been as joyous and have seemed as significant as Tsitsipas\u2019 four-set defeat of Federer en route to the Australian Open semi-final in January. It was the moment the Greek announced himself on the big stage and the rest of this season has been such a learning curve for him, filled with both massive moments and lows that have forced him to learn and improve. Both players arrive in this match having played some incredible tennis. Tsitsipas blasted through his opening two matches against Daniil Medvedev 7-6(5) 6-4 and Zverev 6-3 6-2 before barely losing an incredible match against an on-fire Nadal Nadal 6-7(4) 6-4 7-5 yesterday afternoon. The amount of trust he has with his serve, forehand and net game is so impressive, as is how intelligently he uses all of those strokes at such a young age. Across the net, he faces a Federer who started slowly with a meek loss to Thiem, but he improved in his 7-6(2) 6-3 win over Matteo Berrettini and then played one of his matches of the year to tear through Novak Djokovic 6-4 6-3. His serving was astounding and he backed it up with unflinching aggression. It blows the mind to see him still producing such a high level at 38, yet here we are.",

According to Holmes, Trump was speaking so loudly that Sondland \u201cheld the phone away from his ear for a period of time\u201d.</p> <p>Sondland, a wealthy hotelier who donated $1m to Trump\u2019s inauguration celebration, assured Trump that Zelenskiy \u201cloves your ass\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI then heard President Trump ask, \u2018So, he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u2019 Ambassador Sondland replied that \u2018he\u2019s gonna do it\u2019,\u201d adding that Zelenskiy will do \u201canything you ask him to\u201d, Holmes testified in his opening statement to House investigators, which was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-holmes-statement-impeachment-inquiry-full-opening-statement/\">leaked to US media</a>.</p> <p>After the call, Holmes asked Sondland about the president\u2019s feelings about Ukraine, asking if it was true that Trump \u201cdid not give a shit\u201d about Ukraine.</p> <p>Holmes recalled: \u201cAmbassador Sondland agreed that the President did not \u2018give a shit about Ukraine\u2019. I asked why not, and Ambassador Sondland stated that the president only cares about \u2018big stuff\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Holmes went on: \u201cI noted that there was \u2018big stuff\u2019 going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant \u2018big stuff\u2019 that benefits the president, like the \u2018Biden investigation\u2019 that Mr Giuliani was pushing.\u201d</p> <p>Rudy Giuliani, former New York mayor and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, had for some months been running a parallel negotiating channel with the Ukrainian government, which was focused on persuading Kyiv to investigate an energy company called Burisma, which had put Hunter Biden on its board, and announce another investigation into claims that Ukraine\u2019s meddling on the Democrats\u2019 behalf in the 2016 election. Those claims were based on conspiracy theories debunked by the US intelligence community.</p> <p>The Trump-Sondland phone call was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/trump-impeachment-inquiry-public-hearings-democrats-republicans\">first revealed</a> on Wednesday by Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Kyiv, who told investigators Holmes had informed him about it. The significance of the Holmes testimony is that it proves Trump was personally directing the pressure being exerted on Zelenskiy, and that Sondland was reporting to him on a daily basis. After Sondland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/05/trump-impeachment-sondland-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-latest\">amended his own testimony</a> to admit that military aid to Ukraine was being made conditional on the specific investigations, Trump had sought to distance himself, claiming \u201cI hardly know the gentleman\u201d.</p> <p>The 26 July call, to which there are reportedly other witnesses, also deepens Sondland\u2019s legal jeopardy. He has already altered his testimony once, but had not disclosed this conversation with the president. He told investigators he had had a phone conversation with the president the previous day, but described it as \u201ca nothing call\u201d. Holmes also testified that he had been asked by the embassy to take notes at a meeting earlier on 26 July in Kyiv between Sondland and a Ukrainian presidential aide, Andriy Yermak, but by the time Holmes reached Yermak\u2019s office he had been shut out, and told that Sondland and Yermak, had insisted on a one-to-one meeting with no note-taker present. Sondland also failed to disclose the contents of this meeting in his congressional testimony.</p> <p>There will also be questions about his decision to place a call from his mobile phone to the president from a Kyiv restaurant. Such conversations are normally carried out from secure facilities on encrypted lines. Another impeachment witness, former national security council senior director Fiona Hill, has already testified on her concerns that Sondland was a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/gordon-sondland-intelligence-risk.html\">counter-intelligence risk</a>.</p> <p>Holmes\u2019s dramatic testimony capped a devastating week for Trump in terms of the evidence presented to the impeachment inquiry. Taylor provided detailed testimony about the efforts of Giuliani and others to compel Zelenskiy to dig up dirt on the Bidens. And on Friday morning, Taylor\u2019s predecessor in Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch, gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/15/trump-impeachment-inquiry-marie-yovanovitch\">an account</a> of how Trump and Giuliani had hounded her from her post.</p> <p>Yovanovitch said she felt \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d by Trump\u2019s personal attacks on her, and that she was \u201camazed\u201d corrupt elements in Ukraine who saw her as an obstacle had found willing US allies, including the president. Trump himself illustrated her concerns by tweeting an attack on her during her testimony, bizarrely blaming the bloodshed and chaos in Somalia on Yovanovitch because she had been posted there as a junior diplomat some three decades ago.</p> <p>However, Republicans closed ranks to defend Trump and attack his accusers, reinforcing expectations that the process is likely to be decided by party loyalty, with the Democrat-run House of Representatives voting to impeach the president, but the Republican-majority Senate, acting as jury, voting to acquit him.</p> <p>On Saturday morning, House impeachment investigators met in private with a White House budget official, Mark Sandy, the first official from the Office of Management and Budget to defy Trump\u2019s instructions not to testify.</p> <p>Like others, he received a subpoena to appear.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump personally kept up pressure on Ukraine to carry out investigations he had requested in a phone call with a senior US diplomat, who then observed the president did not \u201cgive a shit\u201d about Ukraine and only cared about what would benefit him politically, according to dramatic new testimony in congressional impeachment hearings. In a deposition to the House committees investigating the Ukraine scandal, David Holmes, a diplomat at the US embassy in Kiev, described an extraordinary phone call between Trump and the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, on 26 July. It was the day after Trump had spoken to the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, requesting a \u201cfavour\u201d and suggesting the Ukrainians investigate former vice-president Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. Sondland placed the 26 July call to Trump from a Kyiv restaurant, where he was having lunch with Holmes and two other US colleagues. According to Holmes, Trump was speaking so loudly that Sondland \u201cheld the phone away from his ear for a period of time\u201d. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier who donated $1m to Trump\u2019s inauguration celebration, assured Trump that Zelenskiy \u201cloves your ass\u201d. \u201cI then heard President Trump ask, \u2018So, he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u2019 Ambassador Sondland replied that \u2018he\u2019s gonna do it\u2019,\u201d adding that Zelenskiy will do \u201canything you ask him to\u201d, Holmes testified in his opening statement to House investigators, which was leaked to US media. After the call, Holmes asked Sondland about the president\u2019s feelings about Ukraine, asking if it was true that Trump \u201cdid not give a shit\u201d about Ukraine. Holmes recalled: \u201cAmbassador Sondland agreed that the President did not \u2018give a shit about Ukraine\u2019. I asked why not, and Ambassador Sondland stated that the president only cares about \u2018big stuff\u2019.\u201d Holmes went on: \u201cI noted that there was \u2018big stuff\u2019 going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant \u2018big stuff\u2019 that benefits the president, like the \u2018Biden investigation\u2019 that Mr Giuliani was pushing.\u201d Rudy Giuliani, former New York mayor and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, had for some months been running a parallel negotiating channel with the Ukrainian government, which was focused on persuading Kyiv to investigate an energy company called Burisma, which had put Hunter Biden on its board, and announce another investigation into claims that Ukraine\u2019s meddling on the Democrats\u2019 behalf in the 2016 election. Those claims were based on conspiracy theories debunked by the US intelligence community. The Trump-Sondland phone call was first revealed on Wednesday by Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Kyiv, who told investigators Holmes had informed him about it. The significance of the Holmes testimony is that it proves Trump was personally directing the pressure being exerted on Zelenskiy, and that Sondland was reporting to him on a daily basis. After Sondland amended his own testimony to admit that military aid to Ukraine was being made conditional on the specific investigations, Trump had sought to distance himself, claiming \u201cI hardly know the gentleman\u201d. The 26 July call, to which there are reportedly other witnesses, also deepens Sondland\u2019s legal jeopardy. He has already altered his testimony once, but had not disclosed this conversation with the president. He told investigators he had had a phone conversation with the president the previous day, but described it as \u201ca nothing call\u201d. Holmes also testified that he had been asked by the embassy to take notes at a meeting earlier on 26 July in Kyiv between Sondland and a Ukrainian presidential aide, Andriy Yermak, but by the time Holmes reached Yermak\u2019s office he had been shut out, and told that Sondland and Yermak, had insisted on a one-to-one meeting with no note-taker present. Sondland also failed to disclose the contents of this meeting in his congressional testimony. There will also be questions about his decision to place a call from his mobile phone to the president from a Kyiv restaurant. Such conversations are normally carried out from secure facilities on encrypted lines. Another impeachment witness, former national security council senior director Fiona Hill, has already testified on her concerns that Sondland was a counter-intelligence risk. Holmes\u2019s dramatic testimony capped a devastating week for Trump in terms of the evidence presented to the impeachment inquiry. Taylor provided detailed testimony about the efforts of Giuliani and others to compel Zelenskiy to dig up dirt on the Bidens. And on Friday morning, Taylor\u2019s predecessor in Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch, gave an account of how Trump and Giuliani had hounded her from her post. Yovanovitch said she felt \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d by Trump\u2019s personal attacks on her, and that she was \u201camazed\u201d corrupt elements in Ukraine who saw her as an obstacle had found willing US allies, including the president. Trump himself illustrated her concerns by tweeting an attack on her during her testimony, bizarrely blaming the bloodshed and chaos in Somalia on Yovanovitch because she had been posted there as a junior diplomat some three decades ago. However, Republicans closed ranks to defend Trump and attack his accusers, reinforcing expectations that the process is likely to be decided by party loyalty, with the Democrat-run House of Representatives voting to impeach the president, but the Republican-majority Senate, acting as jury, voting to acquit him. On Saturday morning, House impeachment investigators met in private with a White House budget official, Mark Sandy, the first official from the Office of Management and Budget to defy Trump\u2019s instructions not to testify. Like others, he received a subpoena to appear.",

I could never picture myself standing here.

Nadal beat the Greek and Daniil Medvedev in two of his three round-robin matches and left town as the oldest year-end No 1 in tennis at 33.</p> \n<p>Now the 21-year-old Tsitsipas had to find a way to make Federer\u2019s 38-year-old legs buckle to his will.

I was obsessed with her double chocolate chip cookies \u2013 really chewy but still with granules of demerara sugar. I still haven\u2019t had a double chocolate chip cookie as good. </p> <p><strong>We always had dinner at the table</strong>. Mum and Dad thought it was important to have that communal time. We weren\u2019t allowed to have dinner in front of the telly, ever. Even when I was a teen. Mum\u2019s dessert was always kept secret. If we\u2019d known what it was, we might have rushed or not finished our main course. Me, my brother, my sister and Dad were all obsessed by desserts, so Mum had to keep a very close eye on us.</p> <p><strong>Sometimes, when dessert came, </strong>I was disappointed. Natural yogurt and raisins were in the house, so I always thought disappointment was a possibility. She knew that what was hoped for was something outrageously sugary. I think yogurt and raisins is delicious nowadays, but back then I thought I\u2019d suffered the biggest injustice known to man.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s an interesting sensory experience </strong>I\u2019m sure and I can\u2019t remember what it tasted like, but my mother says I wee-ed up into my mouth when I was a baby. She kept the story in her back pocket in case she wanted to end a conversation and stop me in my tracks if I was getting a bit cocky, usually when friends were round. Apparently, it arched up. I had a look of surprise, as if it was her fault. I kind of loved Mum telling the story because I was sort of part of a joke with her.</p> <p><strong>The earliest memory I have </strong>of eating while listening to music was when I was six, at a party, and ate Nik Naks while watching everybody dance to a compilation titled <em>The Greatest Album of All Time</em>. I loved song after song of it Hi-Ho Silver Lining, Down Under, Centerfold\u2026 . I loved it so much that I kept going back to the table and getting more and more and more lemon and scampi Nik Naks until I was horribly sick.

So, at Easter I concentrate on the chocolate eggs and have as many as I can.</p> <p><strong>Once a year, Dad</strong><strong> would make a meal</strong>, always on pancake day. It\u2019s crazy looking back, but it was a tradition that he\u2019d make the pancakes only. He did them well, to his credit.</p> <p><strong>I left school halfway through the sixth form</strong> and then did a BTEC in music practice and formed a band, the Capri-Sun Quartet \u2013 so called because every lunchtime we\u2019d go to the canteen and drink Capri-Suns. So I was the Capri-Sun Quartet\u2019s William Strawberry, from my middle name and my favourite flavour.

I also did an episode of <em>Drunk History</em> with me getting sugary drunk on pina coladas and then trying to recall an event from history, which I couldn\u2019t do because I was continually going to the toilet. I also visited, in my online documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbh68QUTi4U\" title=\"\">Sweet Home Ketteringa</a></em>, the Weetabix factory in Burton Latimer where I saw there was no binding agent in Weetabix.

This puts extra strain on the NHS, with care required for cancers, heart problems, knee replacements and other obesity-related conditions. All of which recalls Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, terming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/31/obesity-new-smoking-nhs-england-chief-executive\" title=\"\">the obesity crisis</a> \u201cthe new smoking\u201d in terms of the calamitous effect on the NHS. However, obesity differs in one key societal respect: people suffering from smoking-derived illnesses aren\u2019t routinely mocked and insulted.</p> <p>We know the drill with obesity by now or should do. While personal responsibility should never be discounted, there are well-documented complex social factors contributing to obesity, including poverty, inadequate health and nutritional education, while food companies flood the marketplace with cheap calorific food full of sugar, fat and salt. Once people enter the downward spiral of obesity, it can be terrifyingly difficult (confusing, exhausting, expensive) to extract themselves. As with other addictions, there are also elements of self-harm and self-medication: eating because you hate yourself; eating to feel better.

People with lung cancer aren\u2019t harangued; emphysema sufferers aren\u2019t scorned. Why is there such a marked difference in attitudes? Smoking can kill you, but so can obesity. Cigarettes are highly addictive, but so is junk food. For years, tobacco companies were allowed to promote their product as cool and glamorous; food companies are \u201cregulated\u201d with inadequate sugar taxes and so on.</p> <p>In rational terms, obese people deserve a degree of public compassion that they rarely receive. When did people decide to give themselves permission to be crueller, more judgmental, towards the obese than to almost any other struggling social group?</p> <p>It matters, because this entrenched vitriol has evolved into the kind of everyday sizeism that people feel they can get away with.

      "bodyText": "A report from Diabetes UK says that the number of obese people in the UK has doubled over the past 20 years, with record numbers treated for type 2 diabetes. There are now 13 million adults with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 (defining obesity), which is just under 30% of over-16s, with 20% of children obese by the time they leave primary school. This puts extra strain on the NHS, with care required for cancers, heart problems, knee replacements and other obesity-related conditions. All of which recalls Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, terming the obesity crisis \u201cthe new smoking\u201d in terms of the calamitous effect on the NHS. However, obesity differs in one key societal respect: people suffering from smoking-derived illnesses aren\u2019t routinely mocked and insulted. We know the drill with obesity by now or should do. While personal responsibility should never be discounted, there are well-documented complex social factors contributing to obesity, including poverty, inadequate health and nutritional education, while food companies flood the marketplace with cheap calorific food full of sugar, fat and salt. Once people enter the downward spiral of obesity, it can be terrifyingly difficult (confusing, exhausting, expensive) to extract themselves. As with other addictions, there are also elements of self-harm and self-medication: eating because you hate yourself; eating to feel better. It can\u2019t help that obese people are demoralised and stigmatised by a society that feels entitled to blame, castigate and ridicule them.

Its centre was so badly damaged that it was fenced off from public view, like a racehorse about to be put down, lest citizens be demoralised by the sight. But even as the rubble was being cleared, a new and orderly plan was prepared by Patrick Abercrombie, the leading planner of his day, and the city engineer, J Paton Watson. With the support of such eminences as Lord Reith, the father of the BBC acting in his wartime role as first commissioner of works, and the city\u2019s lord mayor, Lord Astor, the plan was approved in 1944 and put into practice after the war.</p> <p>As a major port squashed into hilly Devonian terrain, Plymouth had been dense and crowded. In the 19th century it was reported \u2013 on what evidence I don\u2019t know \u2013 that it had the worst slums in Europe apart from Warsaw. Abercrombie\u2019s plan brought space and air. A boulevard, Armada Way, would run north-south from the railway station to Plymouth Hoe, the promontory where Francis Drake was playing bowls when the Spanish Armada was spotted. It would be 200ft wide, enough to make room for a garden running down its middle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"27f9796139de5ce8ea5ef8cf1455bdbc383d73a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27f9796139de5ce8ea5ef8cf1455bdbc383d73a9/0_0_4388_6621/663.jpg\" alt=\"Plymouth\u2019s modernist civic centre, 1962, by Jellicoe, Ballantyne and Coleridge.\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plymouth\u2019s modernist civic centre, 1962, by Jellicoe, Ballantyne &amp; Coleridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John East</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new centre was laid out on a grid of right-angled streets. Traffic was consigned to a ring road, leaving Armada Way and its tributaries free for pedestrians. New buildings were clad in Portland stone. Art was integrated into the architecture, and the design of landscape and street furniture were harmonised with the buildings. The plan, following the orthodoxies of the time, consigned activities to different zones \u2013 commercial, cultural, residential. There is, curiously, an ecclesiastical quarter, in which are gathered the places of worship of different denominations.</p> <p>It\u2019s customary, when discussing town planning of this era, to reach for the adjective \u201cutopian\u201d and allude to the urban fantasies of Le Corbusier. Such labels don\u2019t fit Plymouth exactly \u2013 it was as much a case of taking principles that had been applied to colonial cities such as New Delhi and Canberra and bringing them back to the mother country. The architects employed in the early phases were not so much young radicals as established names striving to move with the times. The last work of Giles Gilbert Scott, designer of red telephone boxes and Liverpool\u2019s Anglican cathedral, is a Catholic church in Plymouth. Later, younger architects got to do bolder buildings, such as the sublime concrete vaults of the Pannier covered market, by the unsung local firm of <a href=\"https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/history/gallery/fabulous-old-pictures-plymouth-market-3268553\" title=\"\">Walls and Pearn</a>, or the civic centre, a bold, 14-storey slab poised above low podium.</p> <p>Abercrombie\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t perfect. His zoning, for example, leaves an under-inhabited centre that could be improved by bringing more homes there. But its bones are good. It retains a spirit of hopefulness and dignity that has survived the wear of time. Combined with historic fabric that survived the war \u2013 narrow streets running down to the original harbour, baroque gateways adorning robust 17th-century fortifications \u2013 it makes Plymouth into a remarkable hybrid city, unlike any other in the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4d4ee42f6489d039f480de04efd6d73a1f55fed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4d4ee42f6489d039f480de04efd6d73a1f55fed/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pannier covered market hall, 1960, by local architects Walls and Pearn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pannier covered market hall, 1960, by local architects Walls and Pearn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Hill/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Its designation as a conservation area hasn\u2019t been universally welcomed. Why, went one response to the council\u2019s public consultation, do \u201cwe need to preserve featureless concrete boxes\u201d? But for Richard Sroka, chairman of the Plymouth Civic Society, the centre offers \u201cattention to detail and a feeling of space\u201d. It\u2019s a place where landscape and the composition of the whole count for as much as the design of individual buildings, which are exactly the qualities that a conservation area should protect. The designation should mean that a bit more love and care are devoted to the spaces between the buildings \u2013 that the fountains and planting around the civic centre, for example, which is due to be converted into flats by the developers Urban Splash, are returned to their original glory.</p> <p>Next year is the 400th anniversary of the departure of the Mayflower from Plymouth to the New World, which will be marked by the opening of <a href=\"https://plymhearts.org/thebox/\" title=\"\">the Box</a>, a shiny, lottery-funded museum. The qualities of Abercrombie\u2019s plan are relatively subtle, but the war and the reconstruction are as much part of the city\u2019s rich history as the Armada and the departure of the Pilgrim Fathers.</p>",

In the 19th century it was reported \u2013 on what evidence I don\u2019t know \u2013 that it had the worst slums in Europe apart from Warsaw. Abercrombie\u2019s plan brought space and air. A boulevard, Armada Way, would run north-south from the railway station to Plymouth Hoe, the promontory where Francis Drake was playing bowls when the Spanish Armada was spotted. It would be 200ft wide, enough to make room for a garden running down its middle. The new centre was laid out on a grid of right-angled streets. Traffic was consigned to a ring road, leaving Armada Way and its tributaries free for pedestrians. New buildings were clad in Portland stone. Art was integrated into the architecture, and the design of landscape and street furniture were harmonised with the buildings. The plan, following the orthodoxies of the time, consigned activities to different zones \u2013 commercial, cultural, residential. There is, curiously, an ecclesiastical quarter, in which are gathered the places of worship of different denominations. It\u2019s customary, when discussing town planning of this era, to reach for the adjective \u201cutopian\u201d and allude to the urban fantasies of Le Corbusier. Such labels don\u2019t fit Plymouth exactly \u2013 it was as much a case of taking principles that had been applied to colonial cities such as New Delhi and Canberra and bringing them back to the mother country. The architects employed in the early phases were not so much young radicals as established names striving to move with the times. The last work of Giles Gilbert Scott, designer of red telephone boxes and Liverpool\u2019s Anglican cathedral, is a Catholic church in Plymouth. Later, younger architects got to do bolder buildings, such as the sublime concrete vaults of the Pannier covered market, by the unsung local firm of Walls and Pearn, or the civic centre, a bold, 14-storey slab poised above low podium. Abercrombie\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t perfect. His zoning, for example, leaves an under-inhabited centre that could be improved by bringing more homes there. But its bones are good. It retains a spirit of hopefulness and dignity that has survived the wear of time. Combined with historic fabric that survived the war \u2013 narrow streets running down to the original harbour, baroque gateways adorning robust 17th-century fortifications \u2013 it makes Plymouth into a remarkable hybrid city, unlike any other in the country. Its designation as a conservation area hasn\u2019t been universally welcomed. Why, went one response to the council\u2019s public consultation, do \u201cwe need to preserve featureless concrete boxes\u201d? But for Richard Sroka, chairman of the Plymouth Civic Society, the centre offers \u201cattention to detail and a feeling of space\u201d. It\u2019s a place where landscape and the composition of the whole count for as much as the design of individual buildings, which are exactly the qualities that a conservation area should protect. The designation should mean that a bit more love and care are devoted to the spaces between the buildings \u2013 that the fountains and planting around the civic centre, for example, which is due to be converted into flats by the developers Urban Splash, are returned to their original glory. Next year is the 400th anniversary of the departure of the Mayflower from Plymouth to the New World, which will be marked by the opening of the Box, a shiny, lottery-funded museum. The qualities of Abercrombie\u2019s plan are relatively subtle, but the war and the reconstruction are as much part of the city\u2019s rich history as the Armada and the departure of the Pilgrim Fathers.",

      "body": "<p>Bola Adegbulu\u2019s idea came to him by accident \u2013 literally. Narrowly avoiding a car crash inspired the Londoner\u2019s idea for smart navigation software that could predict the safest route for drivers and prevent some of the 1.3 million deaths due to road accidents globally each year. With more than 90% of those fatalities taking place in developing nations, including Adegbulu\u2019s native Nigeria, the concept hit home.</p> <p>The 30-year-old spent two years working on the pilot for his company, Predina, with co-founder Meha Nelson, before clinching funding from Impact X Capital Partners: a new black-owned-and-run venture capital firm in London aiming to reverse the lack of funding for startups led by, or serving, women and people of colour.</p> <p>The total amount of funding Predina clinched last month is still under wraps, but the duo \u2013 who recently launched an app for consumers, Waymaker \u2013 plan to spend the money on extra staff to help develop their product with the aim of selling it to big businesses, including car manufacturers, across the globe.</p> <p>Impact X, which quietly launched last year, is now on a fundraising drive of its own and is tapping wealthy individuals and institutional investors along the way. Its chief executive, Eric Collins, is hoping to attract \u00a3100m to invest in companies his team believes will not only deliver financial returns, but have a positive social impact on under-represented communities across Europe.</p> <p>That for-us-and-by-us approach has already attracted high profile investors from across the black community, including the comedian Lenny Henry, the actor Adrian Lester, and Uber board member Ursula Burns \u2013 the first black woman to run a Fortune 500 company when she served as the head of Xerox. It has now backed nine companies, ranging from iPhone subscription services to film production companies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Venture capitalists like to invest with the people they went to college with, the people they rowed on the crew team with</p> <footer> <cite>Paula Groves</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Collins, 53, said venture capitalists had been investing in marginalised groups in his native US for decades, but that European talent had been relatively untouched.</p> <p>\u201cVenture capital funds in Europe have not done so much investing in these categories. It allows us to have a fantastic green field of opportunity,\u201d Collins explained. \u201cLess than 1% of venture capital goes to people of colour, less than 4% of venture capital goes to women. And given the numbers that exist in Europe, it\u2019s a great time to be investing in under-represented populations.\u201d</p> <p>But reversing that trend is a big task in a business that, stereotypically, backs the same young white men that venture capital bosses rubbed shoulders with at university and has fuelled a \u201cfrat bro\u201d culture often synonymous with Silicon Valley.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to put our resources into something which is actually going to benefit under-represented entrepreneurs,\u201d said Collins. \u201cIn Silicon Valley, if you look at entrepreneurs and even workforces, there are just so few people of colour, there are so few women. Let\u2019s not replicate that in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was not that black entrepreneurs were rejected for funding after making a pitch, he said: it was that they struggled to even get in the door. When it is a matter of who you know, the chances of success for marginalised communities decline.</p> <p>Collins\u2019s co-founder, Paula Groves, said: \u201cVenture capitalists like to invest with the people they know, the people they went to college with, the people they rowed on the crew team with, people that they attended weddings with.\u201d The 55-year-old American \u2013 originally from New Orleans but now commuting between Colorado and London \u2013 has been working in venture capital since the 1990s, when she founded Axxon Capital. The \u00a354m fund, aimed at investing in minority- and female-owned startups, backed firms such as online security company Guardent, which sold for $140m, before Groves left in 2004.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dafa2fbaff29055746188a97a875b45d36b76872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dafa2fbaff29055746188a97a875b45d36b76872/0_404_5976_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Collins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Collins: \u2018Less than 1% of venture capital goes to people of colour, less than 4% of venture capital goes to women.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Groves said the Impact X team had been drawing on their own networks for up-and-coming talent. They include members of the black communities from their Ivy League university days, who are now spread around the globe, as well as local colleges and tech incubators across Europe and the UK: \u201cWe think we can identify gems from under-represented communities just in the way Silicon Valley has identified gems in their communities.\u201d</p> <p>They have scouted out 400 firms in the past year, nine of which have made the cut \u2013 Predina among them. They include Pace, which uses AI to help hoteliers determine what price to set for rooms, and Raylo, an iPhone leasing service offering a new handset every two years for a monthly subscription of less than \u00a350, before selling the devices abroad. Impact X plans to vet a similar number of firms each year as new talent crops up in sectors spanning lifestyle, media and entertainment, tech, health and education.</p> <p>The small five-person team is based in London, but while they are constantly on the hunt for new investment opportunities, Collins encourages entrepreneurs who are not approached to get in touch by email.</p> <p>Collins, originally from Alabama, had his first brush with venture capital in the late 1990s. The son of a university professor and a music teacher, he graduated from Princeton University and spent some time in working as a strategy consultant specialising in deals and mergers before founding SpeedSolve, a consumer complaint tracking platform that he took to Groves for funding. That firm was gradually wound down just as the dotcom bubble burst in 2001, but Collins was not deterred.</p> <p>Over the next 20 years, he helped launch and sell a handful of firms \u2013 including predictive text firm SwiftKey, which was bought by Microsoft for a reported \u00a3250m in 2016 \u2013 before joining forces with Groves to start Impact X.</p> <p>Collins said the venture should have been launched decades ago, but the opportunities in Europe were now too vast to ignore. \u201cWe want to find the young woman in Bristol, we want to find the man in Edinburgh, who is an under-represented individual who has an idea which is going to change the world and benefit it greatly, and we think we actually can identify those through our backgrounds.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bola Adegbulu\u2019s idea came to him by accident \u2013 literally. Narrowly avoiding a car crash inspired the Londoner\u2019s idea for smart navigation software that could predict the safest route for drivers and prevent some of the 1.3 million deaths due to road accidents globally each year. With more than 90% of those fatalities taking place in developing nations, including Adegbulu\u2019s native Nigeria, the concept hit home. The 30-year-old spent two years working on the pilot for his company, Predina, with co-founder Meha Nelson, before clinching funding from Impact X Capital Partners: a new black-owned-and-run venture capital firm in London aiming to reverse the lack of funding for startups led by, or serving, women and people of colour. The total amount of funding Predina clinched last month is still under wraps, but the duo \u2013 who recently launched an app for consumers, Waymaker \u2013 plan to spend the money on extra staff to help develop their product with the aim of selling it to big businesses, including car manufacturers, across the globe. Impact X, which quietly launched last year, is now on a fundraising drive of its own and is tapping wealthy individuals and institutional investors along the way. Its chief executive, Eric Collins, is hoping to attract \u00a3100m to invest in companies his team believes will not only deliver financial returns, but have a positive social impact on under-represented communities across Europe. That for-us-and-by-us approach has already attracted high profile investors from across the black community, including the comedian Lenny Henry, the actor Adrian Lester, and Uber board member Ursula Burns \u2013 the first black woman to run a Fortune 500 company when she served as the head of Xerox. It has now backed nine companies, ranging from iPhone subscription services to film production companies. Collins, 53, said venture capitalists had been investing in marginalised groups in his native US for decades, but that European talent had been relatively untouched. \u201cVenture capital funds in Europe have not done so much investing in these categories. It allows us to have a fantastic green field of opportunity,\u201d Collins explained. \u201cLess than 1% of venture capital goes to people of colour, less than 4% of venture capital goes to women. And given the numbers that exist in Europe, it\u2019s a great time to be investing in under-represented populations.\u201d But reversing that trend is a big task in a business that, stereotypically, backs the same young white men that venture capital bosses rubbed shoulders with at university and has fuelled a \u201cfrat bro\u201d culture often synonymous with Silicon Valley. \u201cWe want to put our resources into something which is actually going to benefit under-represented entrepreneurs,\u201d said Collins. \u201cIn Silicon Valley, if you look at entrepreneurs and even workforces, there are just so few people of colour, there are so few women. Let\u2019s not replicate that in Europe.\u201d The problem was not that black entrepreneurs were rejected for funding after making a pitch, he said: it was that they struggled to even get in the door. When it is a matter of who you know, the chances of success for marginalised communities decline. Collins\u2019s co-founder, Paula Groves, said: \u201cVenture capitalists like to invest with the people they know, the people they went to college with, the people they rowed on the crew team with, people that they attended weddings with.\u201d The 55-year-old American \u2013 originally from New Orleans but now commuting between Colorado and London \u2013 has been working in venture capital since the 1990s, when she founded Axxon Capital. The \u00a354m fund, aimed at investing in minority- and female-owned startups, backed firms such as online security company Guardent, which sold for $140m, before Groves left in 2004. Groves said the Impact X team had been drawing on their own networks for up-and-coming talent. They include members of the black communities from their Ivy League university days, who are now spread around the globe, as well as local colleges and tech incubators across Europe and the UK: \u201cWe think we can identify gems from under-represented communities just in the way Silicon Valley has identified gems in their communities.\u201d They have scouted out 400 firms in the past year, nine of which have made the cut \u2013 Predina among them. They include Pace, which uses AI to help hoteliers determine what price to set for rooms, and Raylo, an iPhone leasing service offering a new handset every two years for a monthly subscription of less than \u00a350, before selling the devices abroad. Impact X plans to vet a similar number of firms each year as new talent crops up in sectors spanning lifestyle, media and entertainment, tech, health and education. The small five-person team is based in London, but while they are constantly on the hunt for new investment opportunities, Collins encourages entrepreneurs who are not approached to get in touch by email. Collins, originally from Alabama, had his first brush with venture capital in the late 1990s. The son of a university professor and a music teacher, he graduated from Princeton University and spent some time in working as a strategy consultant specialising in deals and mergers before founding SpeedSolve, a consumer complaint tracking platform that he took to Groves for funding. That firm was gradually wound down just as the dotcom bubble burst in 2001, but Collins was not deterred. Over the next 20 years, he helped launch and sell a handful of firms \u2013 including predictive text firm SwiftKey, which was bought by Microsoft for a reported \u00a3250m in 2016 \u2013 before joining forces with Groves to start Impact X. Collins said the venture should have been launched decades ago, but the opportunities in Europe were now too vast to ignore. \u201cWe want to find the young woman in Bristol, we want to find the man in Edinburgh, who is an under-represented individual who has an idea which is going to change the world and benefit it greatly, and we think we actually can identify those through our backgrounds.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a match report for you: But was it better than Christie\u2019s? A cracking strike from Efrem: McGinn: \u201cObviously there\u2019s a lot of new faces in the squad and that\u2019s a game we might have drawn or lost in the past. It\u2019s good to get the winning mentality going into March.\u201d Christie on Cyprus\u2019 non-goal: \u201cWhere I was it looked over the line but I\u2019ve not seen it back. We rode our luck there.\u201d Cyprus just lacked a little bit of quality in the final third. Eifrem had come excellent moments but no one looked particularly clinical against a patchwork Scotland defence. I am sure they will be disappointed they did not come out of the game with a point. The key thing to take from this for Scotland is that they can hold their own even without their biggest names. McGinn is a cut above anything else available to Clarke, who will be pleased by how his side coped against a half-decent Cyprus team away from home. It was a very tight game but Scotland probably just edged it. They were solid at the back and had the players to make the difference in the final third when it mattered. Saying that, Cyprus had enough chances to get more than one but fluffed their lines at the crucial moment. I, however, will remember this game for how bad the referee was. 90+3 mins: Great play from Cyprus results in the ball being backheeled into the path of Papoulis who whacks the ball miles over from eight yards. He really should have equalised. 90+2 mins: Harald Lechner is the name of the referee and I am now going to follow his career with great interest as he has been utterly awful. Booking players for nothing and getting most decisions wrong. Devlin replaces Christie for Scotland. 90 mins: Scotland are wasting time in the corner. The referee books Palmer for moaning about Cyprus players not being far enough away when taking a corner. Five minutes added on. 89 mins: Scotland are playing very deep currently and inviting pressure from Cyprus. They need to move up the pitch even though there\u2019s only a few minutes left on the clock. 87 mins: McGinn wins the ball on the edge of the Cyprus area but overhits his pass to McBurnie who was in space and through, allowing the goalkeeper to collect. 85 mins: McGinn chasing down Merkis but clips his heels in order to get the ball, if he had dispossessed him legally he would have been away. Cyprus take a quick corner but McBurnie reads it and heads clear. The referee gives Scotland a free-kick anyway because he\u2019s not whistled for 15 seconds. 83 mins: Cyprus get a couple of corners in quick succession but Scotland deal with them well and clear without fuss. JR wants to discuss other bad referees: \u201cI\u2019ve been watching the Green Army Derby instead of this game. League leaders Forest Green are down at home 0-1 to Plymouth.The camera is on ground level so it feels like I\u2019m running around on the pitch with the players. It\u2019s pretty neat. \u201cAs for the Scotland game, your description of the crap referee has me intrigued. There\u2019s something fascinating about watching a really terrible refereeing performance. I think I\u2019ll have to watch this game later.\u201d 81 mins: McBurnie latches onto a pass and drives forward, before delaying to wait for teammates. In the end he sends a poor cross behind Burke who has to double back, ending the threat. 79 mins: McBurnie holds off the centre-back and flicks the ball into the path of Burke but his cross is easily cleared. Christie is clipped on the right touchline and then whips in the free-kick. The goalkeeper comes but gets nowhere near it. Luckily for Pardo, the referee gives a free-kick because McBurnie breathed on him. 77 mins: McKenna is left one-on-one at the back but reads the danger and beats Sotiriou to the ball after good play from Papoulis. 75 mins: Joe makes a valuable point about the referee: \u201cAt least he\u2019s been consistent: EVERY corner and goal kick has been called wrong.\u201d 73 mins: Burke is on for Scotland, replacing Forrest down the left. Alaves\u2019 finest will be looking to have another impact against Cyprus, having scored the winner in the reverse fixture. 71 mins: Palmer is up and about after some treatment. Simon has been in touch regarding the post at 1500. He says: \u201cI think Alun will find that it was Dave Jones who handled at Anfield in 1977. Clearest penalty I\u2019ve ever seen. Even VAR would have given it, but only after a 42 year delay?! BTW, a Lawrence Shankland-less Dundee United have just taken the lead against Queen of the South at Tannadice.\u201d 69 mins: Papoulis sends out the ball to Demetriou on the right flank, he lifts in a cross for Kosti to attack at the back post but his diving header from six yards out goes inches wide of the post. There is a problem for Scotland, though, as Palmer goes down in his own box. 67 mins: The referee gives handball against Ioannou, who seemed to chest the ball. God this ref is dreadful. How is he in charge of this match? 65 mins: Forrest breaks down the left but his cross is straight at the goalkeeper. The Cypriot fans have finally woken up, having been quiet for the majority of the match. 63 mins: The delay for treatment to Naismith an introduction of McBurnie have slowed things down again. 61 mins: Naismith goes down in a heap after seemingly getting his foot stuck in the turf. He manages to get himself up in the end but McBurnie is waiting to come on. 59 mins: Demetriou and Taylor clash on the touchline after the former kicks the Scotland full-back on the knee. Taylor didn\u2019t actually do anything in response but is still booked. The main reason for his caution is that the referee is awful. Demetriou should have been sent off. Cyprus get a corner and it is headed behind again by a Scotland defender but the referee gives a goal kick, obviously. 57 mins: McGinn goes in the book for a cynical trip on Demetriou to stop a counter-attack. 55 mins: Naismith has not played much this season and is looking a bit tired already. Maybe we will see McBurnie soon. It\u2019s that man McGinn again! Forrest and Taylor combine on the left, with the latter sending a bouncing cross which McGinn manages to control into the bottom corner. It\u2019s an excellent finish from the Villa man. Five goals in five for McGinn! 51 mins: Palmer bursts into the box and pulls the ball back for his forwards to attack. After a few failed attempts to shoot, the ball lands at Naismith\u2019s feet but he gets stuck and his shot is weak. 49 mins: I think that goal is just what this game needs. Scotland looked sluggish for a while before the break, meaning they might be take the hint. McKenna goes into the book after lunging from behind on Kosti for absolutely no reason whatsoever. The resulting free-kick is lifted into the box and headed as far as Efrem who watches the ball drop and volleys it into the top corner from 16 yards with great technique. WHAT A FINISH! Here we go again! Scotland have had some luck in the past ... but Alun needs to move on. Just made a caretiere, so hopefully I will not break it and stand on a shard of glass for the sake of a political anecdote. 13?! We are getting to see the Christie goal again, which is a lovely sight. I think when a player opens up their body and a curl a shot into the corner is one of the most aesthetically pleasing. Belgium are also in this group, so read this cracking interview with Vincent Kompany. Cyprus should have taken the lead but the officials failed to notice the ball crossing the line. Instead it is Scotland who go into the break with the advantage thanks to their finest moment of the match, a wonderful curling shot from distance, courtesy of Ryan Christie. The most interesting thing so far is how bad the referee is. Oh ... he\u2019s just booked the Cyprus head coach for moaning about a free-kick going against his team. Classic. 45 mins: The tempo of the game has slowed considerably in recent minutes. The Cyprus substitution did not help matters but it seems everyone is just waiting for the half-time whistle. Two minutes added on. 44 mins: Gallagher tries to clear it but instead just whacks it into McGinn\u2019s face from five yards away and watches the ball bounce away for a throw-in. 42 mins: Scotland camp themselves on the edge of the Cyprus box but cannot find enough space to do anything of note. In the end, Forrest has a shot which is blocked. 40 mins: Cyprus need to make a change. Karo\u2019s got a problem with his back and it being walked off the pitch. His replacement is Kastanos. 38 mins: Christie whips in a corner from the right but it is headed up and out, only for Palmer to take control of it and fire a shot from 30 yards, which is deflected wide. 36 mins: Friend of the show Nicholas Ioannou is actually playing left-back today. The Apoel skipper is usually a centre-back but he is doing a decent job of getting forward and puts in a dangerous cross only for a deflection to take it into the arms of Marshall. 34 mins: The referee blows his whistle for more pushing in the box. I am not sure our man in pink, Harald Lechner, has ever seen a game of professional football before. 32 mins: Naismith flicks the ball on for McGinn to chase, he then gets into a tussle with Karo in the box, which the referee lets go despite having his whistle in his mouth. Cyprus eventually recover the ball and clear. 30 mins: Jack sends a ball through for Naismith to chase but his age catches up with him and he\u2019s beaten to it by 36-year-old Pardo. Christie whips in a corner, which lands straight on the head of an unmarked McKenna but he knocks the ball down and straight into the goalkeeper\u2019s hands. 28 mins: Scotland haven\u2019t done much since scoring, to be honest, it\u2019s been all Cyprus. Clarke needs to get them going again and they will struggle to absorb so much possession. A match summary from Phil. 26 mins: Cyprus break after McGregor is dispossessed, they work it into the box where Sotiriou fires a low shot but Marshall gets down well and palms it clear. It\u2019s a stat of sorts. 24 mins: Cyprus get another corner after Merkis heads the ball wide with no Scotland player near him. This referee is ruddy awful. He makes amends with a soft free-kick for pushing in the box. 22 mins: Papoulis has chucked himself to the ground twice in the last few minutes. The first one was deemed a dive but he manages to win a free-kick second time around. It\u2019s whipped in by Efrem but McGinn reads it and heads it behind. 20 mins: Cyprus like to pass the ball around the back and then whack it long, which seems counter-productive. It works, though, as a fine pass is sent out to Papoulis, whose cross almost found the marauding Ioannou before being turned behind. 18 mins: I am getting a headache from all the whistling. The referee gives a free-kick for pushing in the box after Scotland take one of their own. I think the referee might not be very good. 16 mins: Speaking of the referee (and his assistants) ... they have already missed a goal and have been very strict on everything else. McGregor was booked for passing a spare back to the corner taker and knocking the other ball from its spot. How very odd. 14 mins: Cyprus will be even more aggrieved by their non-goal now. They go down the other end in an attempt to get a quick equaliser but Gallagher does his best to put off Efrem and heads it behind. The referee books McGregor for very little. CRASH! BANG! WALLOP! WHAT A GOAL! Christie gets the ball on the right from McGinn, cuts inside, dribbles and then picks his spot, curling the ball with his left foot into the top corner from 20 yards. No chance the keeper could save that! 10 mins: Scotland are trying to play at a high tempo, that\u2019s for sure. They just need to get their foot on the ball a bit more to influence things going forward, as they are too quick to force things at the moment. 8 mins: There\u2019s no goal-line technology in play here and the Austrian assistant was not in a great position to see where the ball landed after crashing off the bar. Cyprus will not be too happy with that. A wake-up call for Scotland. 6 mins: Cyprus break through down the middle, with the ball finally played into Efrem in the box, he shimmies to get away from McKenna, makes room for the shot then whacks it off the underside of the bar and just beyond the goal-line but nothing is given! 4 mins: McGinn is not giving anyone in the Cyprus midfield any time to settles on the ball, harassing them from the moment they take possession. 2 mins: Scotland start brightly and force a corner after 22 seconds but nothing comes from it. Clarke can take the positives from his team looking eager, at least. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! I do like Cyprus\u2019 goalkeeper, Urko Pardo. Born in Belgium to a Basque father and Galician mother, only to end up playing international football for Cyprus having spent years playing in the country. The teams are out on the pitch! Scotland in their traditional blue, while Cyprus wear white. A classic! Let\u2019s hope for more of same today. Richard Gough was the hero in this World Cup qualifier. John McGinn! Scotland are not the only team to have players withdraw ... It really does look like a nice day in Nicosia, so no one can complain about the conditions. This chap will be a miss today. And if you want some other relatable Euro 2020 news. I spoke to Finland\u2019s captain, Tim Sparv, before their historic qualification. If you change the tenses in your mind, it still makes a lot of sense. I have been brought in for this MBM due to my in-depth knowledge of Cypriot football. Earlier this year I spoke to their centre-back Nicholas Ioannou. His mum is from Norwich! Aha! Second to reach a milestone is Steven Naismith who is notching his 50th cap. The forward joined Hearts in the summer after leaving Norwich, despite having offers from abroad, and has put himself firmly in Steve Clarke\u2019s plans. \u201cThe biggest thing playing in Scotland does is put you in the limelight with the coverage,\u201d Naismith said. \u201cIt was part of my decision. If I was to go abroad and choose one of the offers further afield then that would have probably suggested I would not earn more caps, but I didn\u2019t want to give up on that.\u201d There are a couple of milestones in the Scotland team today. Declan Gallagher is earning his first cap in defence. It\u2019s been a long road for the Motherwell centre-back who was sentenced to three years in prison in 2015 for his involvement in an assault which left the victim with a fractured skull. He left prison after 16 months of his sentence and joined Livingston, impressing there before joining Motherwell where he has continued his fine form. Former Scotland international Dominic Matteo is in hospital after undergoing surgery on a brain tumour. Get well soon, Dom! Cyprus: Urko Pardo; Karo, Merkis, Kousoulos, Ioannou; Efrem, Demetriou; Kyriakou, Costi, Papoulis; Sotiriou Scotland: Marshall; Palmer, Jack, Gallagher, Taylor; McGregor, McKenna, McGinn; Christie, Naismith, Forrest. Good afternoon! Roughly 73,629 players have dropped out of this Scotland squad, with Brian McClair and Gary McAllister on standby. Under Steve Clarke, Scotland have won just twice in his six games in charge. Seeing as qualifying from the group is out of the window, today is all about showing they have somehow improved since he took over. Without Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay and Ryan Fraser the task is all the more difficult. Cyprus are one place above them the group and can even boast a positive goal difference in the group, so overhauling them with a victory would be a great boon to a team heading towards a March playoff. It\u2019s currently 24C in Nicosia, so at least it\u2019s a nice November away day. Let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s an enjoyable watch for all! Kick-off: 2pm GMT",

On Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee, charged by House speaker Nancy Pelosi with spearheading the investigation, answered those complaints by opening public hearings. Deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs George P Kent and Charge d\u2019Affaires for Ukraine William Taylor were the first public witnesses on Wednesday. On Friday, former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was the third, testifying about the events surrounding her abrupt removal from her position in May 2019.</p> <p>For all their complicated names and dates, what has emerged at the hearings is a clear picture of an epic battle between the rule of oligarchs, who pervert government to suit their own interests, and the rule of law, in which everyone has the same right to representation and legal protection.</p> <p>The witnesses have explained that under both Republican and Democratic presidents, America\u2019s policy toward Ukraine has been to bolster the rule of law after that country\u2019s domination by oligarchs. Led after August 2016 by senior diplomat Yovanovitch \u2013 the most senior female diplomat in the US Diplomatic Corps \u2013 they tried to curb corrupt rulers and bring Ukraine out from under the influence of Russia and closer to Europe and America.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s leaders were accustomed to wielding power by prosecuting their political opponents for corruption, and Yovanovitch\u2019s push to end that practice earned their ire. In February 2019, in what appears to have been the first incarnation of the idea that investigating Burisma, the company on whose board Hunter Biden sat, could help Trump\u2019s reelection, Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor Lutsenko began to feed stories to the American media smearing Yovanovich and suggesting a new investigation into Burisma. On 25 April, while she was at an event honoring Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Kateryna Handziuk, who was murdered by a man wielding sulfuric acid, Yovanovitch got a phone call from a superior warning her she must leave the country on the next plane. A day later, she did.</p> <p>This week\u2019s testimony reveals that the battle over the rule of law in Ukraine ties directly to the same fight in America.

Her duties then fell to ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a major donor to the Trump campaign. According to George Kent, after Volodymr Zelensky beat the former Ukraine president, Petro Porshenko, in a landslide, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney tapped Sondland, together with energy secretary Rick Perry and diplomat Kurt Volker, to pressure Zelensky into continuing the smear campaign against the Bidens launched by his predecessor\u2019s chief prosecutor Lutsenko.

But here\u2019s where the hearings did their work. For the people watching, the story was simple. The witnesses were not simply outlining the battle; they were illustrating it.</p> <p>On the one hand were solid, calm, professionals, with stellar credentials, carefully explaining the rules under which they served and explaining exactly how Giuliani, Fruman, Parnas and others broke those rules. Committee chair Adam Schiff, speaking slowly and calmly, drew out their story, letting them have their say.</p> <p>On the other hand were Republican defenders of the president, bullying, badgering, grandstanding and refusing to let the witnesses answer. On Wednesday, Jordan scoffed at William Taylor\u2019s testimony, sneering that if he was the best the Democrats could do as a \u201cstar witness,\u201d they truly had nothing, and John Ratcliffe, a Republican representative from Texas yelled at Taylor to answer \u201cYES OR NO!\u201d after a leading question, clearly trying to manipulate him to deliver a sound bite for their base audience at the Fox News Channel.</p> <p>On Friday, the demonstration of the battle between the rule of law and oligarchy became personal. Ambasssador Yovanovitch, a 33-year state department veteran, made an impassioned plea for the rule of law. \u201cUkrainians wanted the law to apply equally to all persons, whether the individual in question is the president or any other citizen.

      "bodyText": "Evidence that could lead to criminal charges against an anti-abortion group targeting a prominent Labour MP has been passed by police to the criminal prosecution authorities. The Metropolitan Police has submitted a case file to the Crown Prosecution Service and asked for advice over whether the targeting of Stella Creasy last month by supporters of the UK branch of the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform (CBR UK), an American anti-abortion organisation, constituted harassment. The development comes as a separate group has surfaced in Creasy\u2019s Walthamstow constituency with the stated aim of ousting her for her pro-choice stance. The Christian Peoples Alliance (CPA), which is opposed to equal marriage and abortion, says it will focus on attempting to depose the heavily pregnant Labour candidate, who led successful Westminster efforts to decriminalise terminations in Northern Ireland. Last month CBR UK placed graphic advertisements showing an unborn foetus with the words \u201cStop Stella\u201d in several locations around Walthamstow, along with street protests. Since then Scotland Yard revealed it was continuing to work with council officials to develop a \u201cproportionate policing approach\u201d to each protest. But it is the emergence of the CPA \u2013 which despite fielding 30 candidates, mainly in London, has admitted its primary ambition is targeting Creasy \u2013 that is the most recent cause of consternation to many in the constituency Last week the group began distributing leaflets \u2013 on which the name Walthamstow was spelt incorrectly \u2013 with the prominent message: \u201cStop killing pre-born children.\u201d Creasy said: \u201cI may be heavily pregnant but I can promise residents that won\u2019t stop me fighting tooth and nail to protect my hometown from such toxic attempts to divide us.\u201d The CPA has consistently contested elections to the London Assembly but failed to gain any seats. A crowdfunding campaign to raise a \u00a3500 deposit by last Thursday for registration as a candidate for the Walthamstow seat in the general election, and another \u00a3500 for leaflets and campaigning, had raised more than \u00a3600 by Friday evening.

Is it a terrifying trend we\u2019ll all pay for in gallons of undercoat, or does this colour craving signify something else?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a seismic shift in how we\u2019re thinking about colour,\u201d says Farrow &amp; Ball\u2019s long-standing colour curator, <a href=\"https://www.farrow-ball.com/the-chromologist/features/in-conversation-with-joa-studholme\" title=\"\">Joa Studholme</a>. \u201cI am convinced the rise of bold colour comes down to the fact that the world is in such a mess. We want to go home and have colours that nourish us, that give us a hug. Pure white walls simply don\u2019t do that. They don\u2019t look after you.\u201d</p> <p>For interior designer <a href=\"https://hardingandread.com/about/\" title=\"\">Nicola Harding</a>, one half of the design studio <a href=\"https://hardingandread.com/\" title=\"\">Harding &amp; Read</a>, colour correlates to feeling. \u201cCertain combinations can key into something on a deeper level, they can transport you to a moment in time. That\u2019s the alchemy of colour.\u201d More than a mere surface decision, it seems we are searching for something altogether more enriching when we pop the lid on a tester pot.</p> <h2>How to begin</h2> <p>If you are tempted to try colour on some of your neutral walls, the advice is refreshingly simple: choose a colour you actually like. \u201cIt sounds stupidly obvious,\u201d says interior designer <a href=\"http://rowanplowden.com/about/\" title=\"\">Francesca Rowan Plowden</a>, \u201cbut don\u2019t go for a colour because it\u2019s on trend, or you\u2019ve seen it in a magazine. You have got to live with it.\u201d</p> <p>Rowan Plowden, whose colourful, cossetting interiors can be experienced in the heritage rental properties at Goodnestone Park, Battel Hall and Elmley Nature Reserve, suggests you seek inspiration from your natural surroundings, a treasured accessory, favourite fabric or painting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9e5d01a1ca228e6a34a6e14d20b6523d114a566\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9e5d01a1ca228e6a34a6e14d20b6523d114a566/9_239_1721_1033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cabinet shuffle: Harding &amp; Read used bold colours below the eyeline for this striking Plain English kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cabinet shuffle: Harding &amp; Read used bold colours below the eyeline for this striking Plain English<strong> </strong>kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Massey/Plain English</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPaintings are quite often a starting point for me,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there\u2019s a painting you love, look at the palette and choose your colours based on what\u2019s in it. A recent palette of yellow woodwork and rust-coloured chairs was based on the colours in a painting I found at <a href=\"https://www.iacf.co.uk/ardingly\" title=\"\">Ardingly Antiques Fair</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Studholme agrees with this approach: \u201cYou must do what resonates with you.\u201d If you\u2019re wary of full colour, she suggests testing your tolerance with smaller spaces, such as the inside of a cupboard, or a bright window reveal. \u201cIf every time you open the cupboard it gives you joy, you can start to take it further,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>Make an entrance</h2> <p>For Studholme, the hallway is the best place to use bold colour because \u201cIt gives you drama when you first enter your home.\u201d Studholme, who offers customers personalised colour consultations, has seen a proliferation of \u201csexy\u201d deep green, charcoal and inky blue hallways (\u201cAlthough I think blue is slightly on the wane now,\u201d she confides).</p> <p>Artist and designer <a href=\"https://lukeedwardhall.com/\" title=\"\">Luke Edward Hall</a>,<strong> </strong>who has painted the entrance to his Camden flat a glossy, yolk yellow, agrees: \u201cWhen I come home and it\u2019s grey and grim, it instantly puts a smile on my face. Colour for me is linked to optimism. It\u2019s about bringing joy and cheer into the home.\u201d Hall and his partner, designer Duncan Campbell, are currently decorating their cottage in Gloucestershire. It\u2019s still a work-in-progress, but so far every room in the house has been painted a different colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"605435c7a1b02bfbcb39303687d4b235afdf4e6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/605435c7a1b02bfbcb39303687d4b235afdf4e6b/0_413_1172_703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hallway with a gloss \u2018tide line\u2019 painted up to an imaginary dado rail, with matte paint in the same colour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inky blues: a hallway with a gloss \u2018tide line\u2019 painted up to an imaginary dado rail, with matte paint in the same colour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Merrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe knew we wanted an olive-green living space and a mustard-coloured dining room. From there, we\u2019ve chosen lilac, bright blue and arsenic rooms \u2013 it\u2019s completely mad,\u201d he admits. Each room has been approached individually, but there is an overall sense of balance. \u201cYou see glimpses of the rooms throughout the house, so you do have to think about which colours will work together.\u201d</p> <p>Harding often uses painted woodwork to pull connecting rooms together. \u201cWe frequently paint the woodwork a darker colour to the walls \u2013 it feels so much more comfortable. This includes skirting, doors, window frames and bars. This has the added benefit of bringing the outside into the home, because your eye passes through the frame to the view beyond.\u201d</p> <h2>Colour tricks</h2> <p>Rowan Plowden suggests painting woodwork the same shade as the walls, sometimes in a gloss. \u201cIt looks really chic and makes the room look bigger,\u201d she says. In kitchens, overhead cupboards are also painted the same colour as the wall, which makes the space feel \u201cless kitcheny\u201d. Conversely, says Studholme, kitchen islands are crying out for bold colour: \u201cIt\u2019s below your eyeline, so it\u2019s not too scary and it will make everything around it feel bigger and lighter.\u201d</p> <p>Both Harding and Studholme are known to take colour above the eyeline, too. \u201cA painted ceiling is a magical thing, without being too in-your-face,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cI love using ceilings, rather than letting them become an afterthought,\u201d Harding adds. \u201cA painted ceiling affects how the space feels.\u201d</p> <h2>Filling the room</h2> <p>When choosing a colour, the advice is to paint a large, thick piece of card in your test colour and move it around the room at different times throughout the day. Even so, you should be prepared for some shocks, says Rowan Plowden. \u201cWhen the colour [Farrow &amp; Ball\u2019s Eating Room Red] for the library in Battel Hall first went on I thought: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve created a womb.\u2019 Seeing the room empty in the colour you\u2019ve chosen will scare you,\u201d she warns, \u201cbut you need to push through that and start filling the room. If your colour choice has come from a place of inspiration, be brave and stick with it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eff756f0693e0d8fa62818060880e1961bd55b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eff756f0693e0d8fa62818060880e1961bd55b5/0_1399_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the pink: a rhubarb bedroom with dark gloss floors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: a rhubarb bedroom with dark gloss floors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harding &amp; Read</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bold walls also affect the objects in a room. \u201cA blue velvet chair against a pale grey wall can look quite tame,\u201d explains Rowan Plowden. \u201cPut a blue velvet chair against a deep blue wall and it will immediately look more luxurious.\u201d</p> <p>For Harding, bold-painted furniture is an affordable way of sharpening a scheme and injecting colour. Studholme agrees: \u201cTry taking an old dining chair and painting it a gloss red,\u201d Studholme suggests. \u201cIt will create a little moment in your house which you can move around or change.

Each room has been approached individually, but there is an overall sense of balance. \u201cYou see glimpses of the rooms throughout the house, so you do have to think about which colours will work together.\u201d Harding often uses painted woodwork to pull connecting rooms together. \u201cWe frequently paint the woodwork a darker colour to the walls \u2013 it feels so much more comfortable. This includes skirting, doors, window frames and bars. This has the added benefit of bringing the outside into the home, because your eye passes through the frame to the view beyond.\u201d Colour tricks Rowan Plowden suggests painting woodwork the same shade as the walls, sometimes in a gloss. \u201cIt looks really chic and makes the room look bigger,\u201d she says. In kitchens, overhead cupboards are also painted the same colour as the wall, which makes the space feel \u201cless kitcheny\u201d. Conversely, says Studholme, kitchen islands are crying out for bold colour: \u201cIt\u2019s below your eyeline, so it\u2019s not too scary and it will make everything around it feel bigger and lighter.\u201d Both Harding and Studholme are known to take colour above the eyeline, too. \u201cA painted ceiling is a magical thing, without being too in-your-face,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cI love using ceilings, rather than letting them become an afterthought,\u201d Harding adds. \u201cA painted ceiling affects how the space feels.\u201d Filling the room When choosing a colour, the advice is to paint a large, thick piece of card in your test colour and move it around the room at different times throughout the day. Even so, you should be prepared for some shocks, says Rowan Plowden. \u201cWhen the colour [Farrow &amp; Ball\u2019s Eating Room Red] for the library in Battel Hall first went on I thought: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve created a womb.\u2019 Seeing the room empty in the colour you\u2019ve chosen will scare you,\u201d she warns, \u201cbut you need to push through that and start filling the room. If your colour choice has come from a place of inspiration, be brave and stick with it.\u201d Bold walls also affect the objects in a room. \u201cA blue velvet chair against a pale grey wall can look quite tame,\u201d explains Rowan Plowden. \u201cPut a blue velvet chair against a deep blue wall and it will immediately look more luxurious.\u201d For Harding, bold-painted furniture is an affordable way of sharpening a scheme and injecting colour. Studholme agrees: \u201cTry taking an old dining chair and painting it a gloss red,\u201d Studholme suggests. \u201cIt will create a little moment in your house which you can move around or change. What could be more fun?\u201d Joa Studholme\u2019s Recipes for Decorating is \u00a326.40 at guardianbookshop.com. Luke Edward Hall\u2019s Greco Disco is \u00a339.60 at guardianbookshop.com",

At a similar moment after previous crises \u2013 in the elections of 1945 and 1979 \u2013 our economic model was radically reformed. This election might prove a comparable moment of change.\u201d</p> <p>Keiran Pedley, a research director at pollster Ipsos Mori, was more circumspect, saying that while his firm\u2019s research indicated an increased appetite for extra spending on public services during the past decade \u2013 even if that means some increases to taxes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/09/nationalise-rail-gas-water-privately-owned\" title=\"\">Labour was not necessarily the beneficiary</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe question becomes \u2018what taxes\u2019 and whether Labour is trusted to spend that money. Our recent polling shows the Conservatives are still more trusted on the economy than Labour, so whereas there might be an appetite for change and to increase public spending, Labour still has work to do to prove to voters that they are up to the job,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The poll also tested the public\u2019s appetite for ministers to play a greater role in \u201cguiding how private companies invest their money\u201d and for a return to collective union bargaining.</p> <p>On both these issues the public was cool, with only 22% offering their support for interfering in private investment decisions and 33% saying they approved of a greater role for trade unions, compared with 29% saying they disapproved.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s plans to hand shares to workers gained 54% support, much of it from the 43% of Tory voters who back the idea. There was even more support for a requirement on companies to share their profits with workers more generously (66%) and to have worker representatives in the boardroom, also 66%.</p> <p>David Runciman, professor of politics at Cambridge University and the author of <em>The Politics of Good Intentions</em>, said earlier this year that while it might have taken the public more than 10 years to conclude a change of direction was needed, the UK had reached that point.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of getting back to politics as usual is increasingly absurd. We can\u2019t carry on like this, but we can\u2019t carry on like we used to carry on either,\u201d he said.</p>",

Read the report: Public support for a paradigm shift in economic policy The IPPR thinktank, which commissioned the survey, said it was clear from the results that \u201cthe desire for change is widespread across the electorate\u201d and that most people see the government as the main agent of change. Carys Roberts, the IPPR\u2019s chief economist, said it was striking that only 2% of respondents ticked the box for no change. \u201cAs might be expected, Labour supporters are most in favour of the most dramatic shift, while Conservative supporters were more likely to favour smaller changes,\u201d she said. The poll was conducted before Labour revealed its plan to take control of BT\u2019s broadband business, install a \u00a320bn super-fast public network by 2030 and offer it free to households. Jeremy Corbyn said rolling out full-fibre broadband to every part of the country would, among other benefits, encourage businesses to locate in smaller towns, limiting commuting and carbon emissions. The survey asked who supported or opposed a significant increase in public spending to limit climate change and more than 60% of respondents said they did. Illustrating how green politics has broken out of its leftwing confines to be embraced by a wider audience, a majority of Tory voters (53%) either strongly agreed or tended to agree, along with 91% of Liberal Democrats and 83% of Labour party supporters. A large minority of Brexit party supporters (48%) backed government intervention to tackle climate change, either strongly or to some extent, but they were opposed by a quarter of those in the party led by Nigel Farage. Around 20% of Tory voters were opposed to government action compared with 3% of Labour voters and 2% of Lib Dems. YouGov asked whether respondents would support investments in renewable energy, home insulation and public transport as ways for the government to cut carbon, so it cannot be said that the respondents backed investments in digital broadband. However, there appears to be a growing realisation that, 11 years after the most devastating financial crash of the postwar era, the direction of travel must change. Most respondents believe the economy is run for the benefit of companies or the richest households, and 44% of Tories \u2013 a surprisingly high number, says Roberts \u2013 support increasing the level of tax on those earning more than \u00a3100,000 a year. Almost 70% of Conservative voters agreed that capital gains and income from wealth should be taxed more heavily than income from work or at least should be taxed equally. At the moment, the combined effect of income tax and national insurance rates means that workers earning more than \u00a312,000 a year face a higher marginal tax rate than someone drawing hundreds of thousands of pounds a year from investments. Michael Jacobs, a professor of political economy at the University of Sheffield, said the YouGov poll showed the political risk from proposing radical policies was diminishing. \u201cThe public \u2013 including many Conservative voters \u2013 do not like the way in which inequality has grown and the way in which the economy seems to benefit mainly the wealthy and big business, and they support a wide range of significant reform policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a clear sense here that over the last 10 years since the financial crisis, the centre ground of politics has shifted quite far to the left. At a similar moment after previous crises \u2013 in the elections of 1945 and 1979 \u2013 our economic model was radically reformed. This election might prove a comparable moment of change.\u201d Keiran Pedley, a research director at pollster Ipsos Mori, was more circumspect, saying that while his firm\u2019s research indicated an increased appetite for extra spending on public services during the past decade \u2013 even if that means some increases to taxes \u2013 Labour was not necessarily the beneficiary. \u201cThe question becomes \u2018what taxes\u2019 and whether Labour is trusted to spend that money. Our recent polling shows the Conservatives are still more trusted on the economy than Labour, so whereas there might be an appetite for change and to increase public spending, Labour still has work to do to prove to voters that they are up to the job,\u201d he said. The poll also tested the public\u2019s appetite for ministers to play a greater role in \u201cguiding how private companies invest their money\u201d and for a return to collective union bargaining. On both these issues the public was cool, with only 22% offering their support for interfering in private investment decisions and 33% saying they approved of a greater role for trade unions, compared with 29% saying they disapproved. Labour\u2019s plans to hand shares to workers gained 54% support, much of it from the 43% of Tory voters who back the idea. There was even more support for a requirement on companies to share their profits with workers more generously (66%) and to have worker representatives in the boardroom, also 66%. David Runciman, professor of politics at Cambridge University and the author of The Politics of Good Intentions, said earlier this year that while it might have taken the public more than 10 years to conclude a change of direction was needed, the UK had reached that point. \u201cThe idea of getting back to politics as usual is increasingly absurd. We can\u2019t carry on like this, but we can\u2019t carry on like we used to carry on either,\u201d he said.",

Saldier is the new favourite for the Champion Hurdle with several bookmakers after showing a sharp turn of foot from the final flight to win the Grade One Morgiana Hurdle on his first start for more than a year. Willie Mullins\u2019s five-year-old had his stable companion, Klassical Dream, last season\u2019s Supreme Novice Hurdle winner, back in third as he beat Petit Mouchoir by a length and a half. Saldier is 4-1 market leader (from 14-1) with Betfair while Paddy Power make him 4-1 joint-favourite with Buveur d\u2019Air, the Champion Hurdle winner in 2017 and 2018. The 2015 champion hurdler, Faugheen, is around 20-1 for the JLT Novice Chase after overcoming some uncertain jumps to make a successful debut over fences at the age of 11.",

Clarke has emerged from seven years of glowering in a blond wig as an excellent comedian and I would watch Emma Thompson chew the scenery in a DFS advert. Critics appear to have been upset by the admittedly bananas plot twist. It would be Grinch-like to spoil it, but it really is based on George Michael\u2019s lyrics. I revelled in the audacious silliness of it and I suspect it would be even more loved after several large eggnogs. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>Of all the characters who appear in the Trojan war, all the men who fight and die in Homer\u2019s epic poem, <em>The Iliad</em>, all those monsters and nymphs who waylay the storm-battered hero of <em>The Odyssey</em>, only one character is so integral to the story that we have added the words \u201cof Troy\u201d to her name. It reflects a fascinating truth about this remarkable myth: it is no less a story about women than it is a story of men. Without Helen, there is no war, no epic, no drama.</p> <p><em>The Iliad </em>is ostensibly the story of one man. Its opening line is, \u201cSing, goddess, of the wrath of Peleus\u2019s son, of Achilles.\u201d Achilles embraces the line \u2013 the first word is his rage, the last word is his name. This poem, we might conclude, will be all about him. And yet, it is not. The poem is called <em>The Iliad</em>. It tells the story not of a man but of a city. Of Ilios, another name for Troy \u2013 the theme of a new show at the British Museum, <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/troy-myth-and-reality?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI07XvhfHs5QIVi7TtCh3SSQNaEAAYASAAEgJYRPD_BwE\" title=\"\">Troy: Myth and Reality</a>.</p> <p>If it were purely the story of an individual, it would be named after him, as <em>The Odyssey</em> is named for Odysseus.

The poet doesn\u2019t claim to be creating it: rather, he attributes it to the goddess, his muse. He doesn\u2019t name her, but she is presumably Calliope, the muse of epic poetry. This isn\u2019t just a poetic convention: the first line of Virgil\u2019s Troy poem, <em>The Aeneid</em>, begins, \u201c<em>arma virumque cano</em>\u201d \u2013 I sing of arms and the man. Virgil isn\u2019t shy about owning his composition, however much divine inspiration he may have. But Homer puts a goddess at the centre of his opening line. The mighty Achilles might distract us from her, but it is her song of him which we are about to hear.</p> <p>And so we find that women are part of every aspect of the Trojan war, from its causes to its terrible consequences even when, like Calliope, they are hiding in plain sight. There is no war without Helen, who obviously does not start her life as Helen of Troy, but as Helen of Sparta. The war only occurs after she elopes with (or in some versions of her story, is abducted by) Paris, a prince of Troy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/archive-zip/giv-3902jU1KUkUrhTMM/\" data-alt=\"troy map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/archive-zip/giv-3902jU1KUkUrhTMM/\">troy map</a> </figure>  <p>Helen\u2019s Greek husband, Menelaus, demands that warriors from all over Greece accompany him to reclaim his wife. They had once sworn an oath to do so if Helen were ever abducted: the only way, it seemed, to ensure that the world\u2019s most beautiful woman was not taken from her home by another man. It didn\u2019t occur to Odysseus \u2013 whose idea it was that tribal leaders across Greece should swear an oath \u2013 that a non-Greek might fancy his chances with Helen, and that this collective pledge could embroil them all in a decade-long conflict.</p> <p>Helen takes the majority of the blame for the war, although the version of her we see in <em>The Iliad</em> has little say about what she does. In the third book of the poem, she expresses her unwillingness to welcome Paris back to Troy after he and Menelaus have fought an inconclusive duel over her. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0d30b786e6d16b4a2e19f7a0d6d53ded05bfcfa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d30b786e6d16b4a2e19f7a0d6d53ded05bfcfa4/159_245_2180_2723/801.jpg\" alt=\"Achilles kills Penthesilea in a scene on an amphora, circa 530BC.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Achilles kills Penthesilea in a scene on an amphora, circa 530BC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other depictions of Helen show her filled with suicidal remorse: a fragment of a lost play by Sophocles has her planning to drink poison. And in Euripides\u2019s play <em>Helen</em>, he draws on an alternate version of her which is as old as Homer, dating to the 8th century BCE. This Helen doesn\u2019t go to Troy at all, she spends the war living blamelessly in Egypt. The gods send an eidolon (an image of Helen, made of air) to Troy instead. The war is fought over the eidolon and the city is destroyed. The Greeks finally reclaim eidolon-Helen, whereupon she disappears into the air from which she was made. A neater metaphor for the futility of war has rarely been found.</p> <p>But even when Helen elopes with Paris, it\u2019s unclear how much say she has in the matter. Helen is a bribe, offered by Aphrodite to Paris because she wants him to award her a golden apple which carries the inscription \u201c<em>Te kalliste\u201d</em> \u2013 for the most beautiful. Three goddesses want this bauble: Hera, Athene and Aphrodite. The apple was thrown into their midst by another goddess, Eris, at the wedding of a fifth goddess, the sea nymph, Thetis. We tend to call this story \u201cThe judgment of Paris\u201d, which rather obscures the almost incidental nature of his role and the centrality of these vying goddesses in causing the downfall of Troy.</p> <p>The war itself is not purely men\u2019s business, either. The fighting of <em>The Iliad</em> is usually man-on-man, although goddesses get involved too: Aphrodite even gets wounded by the Greek warrior Diomedes at one point: a sign of his extraordinary, almost inhuman prowess. But the poem ends before the war ends: Troy still stands, even if her great defender, Hector, lies dead.</p> <p>A lost epic, <em>The Aethiopis</em>, told the next part of the story. We have only fragments of it now, but once we could have read of the exploits of Memnon, the great Ethiopian warrior who fought for Troy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0fc9863c4e7d42e68ed5f55c1d31beabf4283de5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc9863c4e7d42e68ed5f55c1d31beabf4283de5/0_88_3933_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The \u2018Boccanera plaques\u2019, painted Etruscan plaques that show scenes from the Judgment of Paris, circa 560\u2013550 BC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018Boccanera plaques\u2019, painted Etruscan plaques that show scenes from the Judgment of Paris, circa 560\u2013550 BC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 The Trustees of the British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And we could have read of Penthesilea, the Amazon queen who fought Achilles. She and her Amazon women fought and killed many Greek men: battles between Greeks and Amazons are sufficiently common in Greek art that they have a name, amazonomachy. And Penthesilea is so extraordinary, so like a goddess, that she inspires the Trojan women themselves to consider taking up weapons and fighting too. Her glorious death on the battlefield is described in precisely the same way as the deaths of great male warriors.</p> <p>But the women embroiled in the Trojan war really come into their own in its aftermath. Odysseus would be nothing without his beloved Penelope, waiting on Ithaca for him to return (while he is delayed by many more women: Circe, Calypso, Nausicaa, Scylla, the Sirens...). And Penelope\u2019s dark mirror is Clytemnestra, sister of Helen, waiting for her husband Agamemnon to come home and pay the price for his murder of their daughter, Iphigenia.</p> <p>Even the seemingly powerless Trojan survivors are capable of wreaking havoc: in Euripides\u2019s play <em>Hecabe</em>, the queen of Troy takes one of the most vicious revenges in all of Greek tragedy against the Thracian king who killed her youngest son.</p> <p>The vast majority of Euripides\u2019s surviving plays about the war focus on its women: Helen, Hecabe, Andromache, Iphigenia. He always knew what is often forgotten: the drama of war is not always found on the battlefield. It\u2019s in the build-up, the aftermath, the margins. Where the women are waiting.</p> <p><em>Natalie Haynes\u2019s books include A Thousand Ships, published in May.</em></p> <p><em>Troy: Myth and Reality is at the British Museum, London, from Thursday to 8 March</em></p>",

A neater metaphor for the futility of war has rarely been found. But even when Helen elopes with Paris, it\u2019s unclear how much say she has in the matter. Helen is a bribe, offered by Aphrodite to Paris because she wants him to award her a golden apple which carries the inscription \u201cTe kalliste\u201d \u2013 for the most beautiful. Three goddesses want this bauble: Hera, Athene and Aphrodite. The apple was thrown into their midst by another goddess, Eris, at the wedding of a fifth goddess, the sea nymph, Thetis. We tend to call this story \u201cThe judgment of Paris\u201d, which rather obscures the almost incidental nature of his role and the centrality of these vying goddesses in causing the downfall of Troy. The war itself is not purely men\u2019s business, either. The fighting of The Iliad is usually man-on-man, although goddesses get involved too: Aphrodite even gets wounded by the Greek warrior Diomedes at one point: a sign of his extraordinary, almost inhuman prowess. But the poem ends before the war ends: Troy still stands, even if her great defender, Hector, lies dead. A lost epic, The Aethiopis, told the next part of the story. We have only fragments of it now, but once we could have read of the exploits of Memnon, the great Ethiopian warrior who fought for Troy. And we could have read of Penthesilea, the Amazon queen who fought Achilles. She and her Amazon women fought and killed many Greek men: battles between Greeks and Amazons are sufficiently common in Greek art that they have a name, amazonomachy. And Penthesilea is so extraordinary, so like a goddess, that she inspires the Trojan women themselves to consider taking up weapons and fighting too. Her glorious death on the battlefield is described in precisely the same way as the deaths of great male warriors. But the women embroiled in the Trojan war really come into their own in its aftermath. Odysseus would be nothing without his beloved Penelope, waiting on Ithaca for him to return (while he is delayed by many more women: Circe, Calypso, Nausicaa, Scylla, the Sirens...). And Penelope\u2019s dark mirror is Clytemnestra, sister of Helen, waiting for her husband Agamemnon to come home and pay the price for his murder of their daughter, Iphigenia. Even the seemingly powerless Trojan survivors are capable of wreaking havoc: in Euripides\u2019s play Hecabe, the queen of Troy takes one of the most vicious revenges in all of Greek tragedy against the Thracian king who killed her youngest son. The vast majority of Euripides\u2019s surviving plays about the war focus on its women: Helen, Hecabe, Andromache, Iphigenia. He always knew what is often forgotten: the drama of war is not always found on the battlefield. It\u2019s in the build-up, the aftermath, the margins. Where the women are waiting.

Consuming the truffle parts of magic mushrooms is permitted in the Netherlands and my nine fellow guests and I will be eating a variety called Dragon\u2019s Dynamite. We\u2019re not taking recreational drugs, but rather using psychedelics as self-exploratory and therapeutic \u201cplant medicine\u201d. Welcome to the age of the psychedelic retreat.</p> <p><a href=\"https://synthesisretreat.com/about-us\" title=\"\">Synthesis</a> opened its doors in April 2018. It was co-founded by Martijn Schirp, a former poker player who found salvation through psychedelics. \u201cI had my first mushroom trip nine years ago and that changed my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI was walking through this forest and it was so peaceful, it was like a fairy tale. I felt this huge self-critical voice lift off me.\u201d He believes he\u2019d still be estranged from his father if it wasn\u2019t for the perspective psychedelics have given him. His entrepreneurial mind saw that what was missing was a retreat with \u201cmedical supervision, private one-to-one coaching and professional standards in a modern context\u201d.</p> <p>There is no governing body for psychedelic retreats nor are there official figures for the number of retreats around the world, with many held illegally. Schirp estimates there are a dozen or so legal mushroom retreats in the Netherlands, including events also run in the country by the UK-based <a href=\"https://www.psychedelicsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Psychedelic Society</a>. Its prices for a four-day retreat range from \u00a3600 to \u00a31,400, depending on your income. Synthesis charges \u00a31,640 for a three-day programme aimed at beginners. As Schirp explains: \u201cWe introduce psychedelics to people who can benefit from them, but who wouldn\u2019t normally feel safe or be open to them. Most people are still not aware that retreats like this exist. They go through the underground or try to join one of the academic studies.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Studies show magic mushrooms have an effect on depression</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is an abundance of studies, following a pioneering one by Imperial College in 2016, that have examined the therapeutic effects of magic mushrooms on severe depression. The US Food and Drug Administration recently designated a new psilocybin drug a \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d. It\u2019s being developed by UK-based Compass Pathways, which hopes it will be available on the pharmaceutical market within five years.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that the trend for micro dosing on psychedelics is edging closer to social acceptability, despite its widespread illegality. Those keen to experience higher doses under guidance are increasingly travelling to retreats held in countries such as Jamaica, Costa Rica, Peru and the Netherlands.</p> <p>At Synthesis, guests are encouraged to bring three intentions, which might be issues or conflicts that need attention, or, as in my case, a scientific curiosity to explore a different state of consciousness. During the trip, a medic loiters in the living room, but she\u2019s there more for reassurance than necessity. Magic mushrooms are considered the safest and least toxic of illegal recreational drugs. The Global Drugs Survey, conducted by an international panel of researchers and academics, this year analysed data from 123,814 respondents and found that magic mushrooms required the least medical attention, with just 0.4% of users reporting that they sought emergency medical treatment. Their effects on the mind, however, are hard to predict, and as recent clinical trials for treatment resistant depression at Imperial College revealed, while some patients are barely affected others have stronger psychedelic experiences on low doses than on a high dose. With trials ongoing, there remain many unknowns. I\u2019m not advocating this for everyone but on a personal level, I was keen to give it a go.</p> <p>Guests arrive on Friday afternoon. Some are retreat regulars returning for a top-up, or hoping to go deeper, but for most this is their first trip. Attendees travel from all over the world and include doctors, academics, engineers and retirees. We sit in a circle to share our reasons for coming. This is unfamiliar territory for me. I\u2019m an introvert and a stranger to therapy speak.</p> <p>Being here without the comfort blanket of our usual lives and routines, layers of self-defence soon start peeling away before we\u2019ve even gone near the magic mushrooms. We are briefed as a group on potential forms our journeys might take: we might be gripped by a strange energy and start shaking or we might get the \u201cnada\u201d \u2013 a state of lack in which it feels as though nothing is happening. If the trip becomes challenging (the phrase \u201cbad trip\u201d has been retired by the psychedelic community), our hosts assure us they will see it in our faces and help us to relax and breathe through it. Wherever the trip takes us, the idea is that it\u2019s a lesson of some kind. The facilitators press this point firmly with an air of tough love. Our mantra: trust, let go, be open.</p> <p>The ceremony begins around midday on Saturday. We assemble silently, clutching duvets and pillows from our beds. There are flowers, candles and smouldering herbs. The facilitators are dressed in white, the room is flooded with sunlight and birdsong drifts in from the garden. Mattresses are arranged in a circle and once everyone is settled, the truffles are served, accompanied by raisins and ginger tea for palatability.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Wherever it takes us, the idea is that the trip is a lesson of some kind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The formality and sudden solemnity makes me feel claustrophobic, and I don\u2019t like the look of my ugly, greenish-brown truffles. I have chosen the lowest of the three dose options, but there seem to be loads in my bowl. I\u2019m reassured that there is no pressure for me to eat them. I relax and start nibbling. Then I recline, eye mask on, and swirl off into the music. For the next six or so hours I float along with the songs, occasional gong bonging and other sensory stimuli provided by my hosts.</p> <p>The magical feelings come in waves. First, I am lying under a delicate yellow dome formed of living, breathing geometric patterns. I take a stroll around my surprisingly empty cathedral-like mind, enjoying its decluttered state. I spin off into a wild appreciation of language. All the trivial insecurities and frustrations to do with work fall away and I am part of the vast web of all humans communicating through language, music and art. I have a bit of a cry at the beauty of us all. The facilitators said we\u2019d all cry at some point. This comes as no surprise to Katrin Preller, who uses brain imaging to study the effects of psychedelics at the University of Zurich. She has observed \u201ca loosening up of self-focus. People seem to get more open and more empathetic to others,\u201d she says, \u201cand feel more connected with nature and their environment.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Hannes Kettner, </strong></em>a research assistant at Imperial College, has been studying people\u2019s psychedelic experiences in recreational and retreat settings since 2017. While most psychedelic experiences result in increased wellbeing, he says, \u201cthese guided experiences are more robust in the way that people benefit. We have more solid increases in guided settings compared to when people might be at a festival, at home or in nature. We\u2019re finding that experiences of emotional breakthrough depend on the presence of emotional support during ceremonies.\u201d</p> <p>More recently Kettner has started working directly with retreat centres. But the rapid growth of this unregulated industry introduces risks. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same standards everywhere,\u201d says Kettner. Laura Dawn, a US plant medicine devotee attending Synthesis, has heard horror stories in her 20 years of running and attending retreats, often at the shamanist ceremonies that use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/31/ayahuasca-tourists-risk-death-henry-miller-colombia\" title=\"\">ayahuasca</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole mixed bag and people need to know how to navigate these realms.\u201d </p> <p>The final day of the retreat is designed to prepare us for integrating our epiphanies into our lives. \u201cThe work starts here,\u201d we are told. We are encouraged to continue focussing on self care, to write down our thoughts and to meditate. The group is tired and emotional. One of us had thrown up their truffles, missing out on the trip. Everyone else is sharing profound experiences.</p> <p>Returning to the shackles of modern life is a little rough. I notice that my brain feels slow and spongy for a week or two, but I\u2019m told this is nothing to worry about. Preller says, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a fun ride, it\u2019s an exhausting experience, too. It takes a bit of time to recover.\u201d Two months later, not only am I back to my old self, but I think I might be more myself than ever.</p>",

The US Food and Drug Administration recently designated a new psilocybin drug a \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d. It\u2019s being developed by UK-based Compass Pathways, which hopes it will be available on the pharmaceutical market within five years. It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that the trend for micro dosing on psychedelics is edging closer to social acceptability, despite its widespread illegality. Those keen to experience higher doses under guidance are increasingly travelling to retreats held in countries such as Jamaica, Costa Rica, Peru and the Netherlands. At Synthesis, guests are encouraged to bring three intentions, which might be issues or conflicts that need attention, or, as in my case, a scientific curiosity to explore a different state of consciousness. During the trip, a medic loiters in the living room, but she\u2019s there more for reassurance than necessity. Magic mushrooms are considered the safest and least toxic of illegal recreational drugs. The Global Drugs Survey, conducted by an international panel of researchers and academics, this year analysed data from 123,814 respondents and found that magic mushrooms required the least medical attention, with just 0.4% of users reporting that they sought emergency medical treatment. Their effects on the mind, however, are hard to predict, and as recent clinical trials for treatment resistant depression at Imperial College revealed, while some patients are barely affected others have stronger psychedelic experiences on low doses than on a high dose. With trials ongoing, there remain many unknowns. I\u2019m not advocating this for everyone but on a personal level, I was keen to give it a go. Guests arrive on Friday afternoon. Some are retreat regulars returning for a top-up, or hoping to go deeper, but for most this is their first trip. Attendees travel from all over the world and include doctors, academics, engineers and retirees. We sit in a circle to share our reasons for coming. This is unfamiliar territory for me. I\u2019m an introvert and a stranger to therapy speak. Being here without the comfort blanket of our usual lives and routines, layers of self-defence soon start peeling away before we\u2019ve even gone near the magic mushrooms. We are briefed as a group on potential forms our journeys might take: we might be gripped by a strange energy and start shaking or we might get the \u201cnada\u201d \u2013 a state of lack in which it feels as though nothing is happening. If the trip becomes challenging (the phrase \u201cbad trip\u201d has been retired by the psychedelic community), our hosts assure us they will see it in our faces and help us to relax and breathe through it. Wherever the trip takes us, the idea is that it\u2019s a lesson of some kind. The facilitators press this point firmly with an air of tough love. Our mantra: trust, let go, be open. The ceremony begins around midday on Saturday. We assemble silently, clutching duvets and pillows from our beds. There are flowers, candles and smouldering herbs. The facilitators are dressed in white, the room is flooded with sunlight and birdsong drifts in from the garden. Mattresses are arranged in a circle and once everyone is settled, the truffles are served, accompanied by raisins and ginger tea for palatability. The formality and sudden solemnity makes me feel claustrophobic, and I don\u2019t like the look of my ugly, greenish-brown truffles. I have chosen the lowest of the three dose options, but there seem to be loads in my bowl. I\u2019m reassured that there is no pressure for me to eat them. I relax and start nibbling. Then I recline, eye mask on, and swirl off into the music. For the next six or so hours I float along with the songs, occasional gong bonging and other sensory stimuli provided by my hosts. The magical feelings come in waves. First, I am lying under a delicate yellow dome formed of living, breathing geometric patterns. I take a stroll around my surprisingly empty cathedral-like mind, enjoying its decluttered state. I spin off into a wild appreciation of language. All the trivial insecurities and frustrations to do with work fall away and I am part of the vast web of all humans communicating through language, music and art. I have a bit of a cry at the beauty of us all. The facilitators said we\u2019d all cry at some point. This comes as no surprise to Katrin Preller, who uses brain imaging to study the effects of psychedelics at the University of Zurich. She has observed \u201ca loosening up of self-focus. People seem to get more open and more empathetic to others,\u201d she says, \u201cand feel more connected with nature and their environment.\u201d Hannes Kettner, a research assistant at Imperial College, has been studying people\u2019s psychedelic experiences in recreational and retreat settings since 2017. While most psychedelic experiences result in increased wellbeing, he says, \u201cthese guided experiences are more robust in the way that people benefit. We have more solid increases in guided settings compared to when people might be at a festival, at home or in nature. We\u2019re finding that experiences of emotional breakthrough depend on the presence of emotional support during ceremonies.\u201d More recently Kettner has started working directly with retreat centres. But the rapid growth of this unregulated industry introduces risks. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same standards everywhere,\u201d says Kettner. Laura Dawn, a US plant medicine devotee attending Synthesis, has heard horror stories in her 20 years of running and attending retreats, often at the shamanist ceremonies that use ayahuasca. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole mixed bag and people need to know how to navigate these realms.\u201d The final day of the retreat is designed to prepare us for integrating our epiphanies into our lives. \u201cThe work starts here,\u201d we are told. We are encouraged to continue focussing on self care, to write down our thoughts and to meditate. The group is tired and emotional. One of us had thrown up their truffles, missing out on the trip. Everyone else is sharing profound experiences. Returning to the shackles of modern life is a little rough. I notice that my brain feels slow and spongy for a week or two, but I\u2019m told this is nothing to worry about. Preller says, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a fun ride, it\u2019s an exhausting experience, too. It takes a bit of time to recover.\u201d Two months later, not only am I back to my old self, but I think I might be more myself than ever.",

I feel I\u2019ve never played a violent character; I\u2019ve played characters that were in deep conflict, despair and chaos.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t know</strong> where I got the idea to act from. My father used to say, \u201cWhere do you come to be an actor? No one in the family is an actor. You can\u2019t sing. You can\u2019t dance.\u201d That\u2019s the way it was in Brooklyn, where everyone was from a family of immigrants. My parents were smarter than me. They knew what it was to be poor.

In time it faded away, for the most part.</p> <p><strong>I tried Twitter,</strong> but I don\u2019t really do that kind of thing. Technology is wonderful. But as innovative as Silicon Valley has been, it\u2019s a runaway train and we need to get a grip.</p> <p><strong>Fame is a </strong>funny thing. The upside is easy access to good restaurants. The downside is the bill! \u201cMovie star\u201d is a nice term, because it\u2019s poetic and fairytaleish, but it has no truth about it.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t do </strong>\u201cnormal\u201d stuff so much, like going on the subway. I sort of miss it, because you can have interesting experiences.

We have a lot in common in our growing up \u2013 me in Brooklyn, him in Lower East Side.

      "bodyText": "Success isn\u2019t about awards. Success is continuity, a process of discovery. I\u2019ve been very lucky to be a part of movies that were widely appreciated, but there are lesser known movies I\u2019m just as proud of. A lot of people ask me why I\u2019m always playing violent characters. I feel I\u2019ve never played a violent character; I\u2019ve played characters that were in deep conflict, despair and chaos. I don\u2019t know where I got the idea to act from. My father used to say, \u201cWhere do you come to be an actor? No one in the family is an actor. You can\u2019t sing. You can\u2019t dance.\u201d That\u2019s the way it was in Brooklyn, where everyone was from a family of immigrants. My parents were smarter than me. They knew what it was to be poor. They knew I was heading for danger. If I hadn\u2019t been an actor, I\u2019d have been a philosopher. As defined by Mel Brooks in History of the World: \u201cOh, another bullshit artist!\u201d I don\u2019t really know what else I would have done. When I was a little boy I had a real champion stutter. In time it faded away, for the most part. I tried Twitter, but I don\u2019t really do that kind of thing. Technology is wonderful. But as innovative as Silicon Valley has been, it\u2019s a runaway train and we need to get a grip. Fame is a funny thing. The upside is easy access to good restaurants. The downside is the bill! \u201cMovie star\u201d is a nice term, because it\u2019s poetic and fairytaleish, but it has no truth about it. I don\u2019t do \u201cnormal\u201d stuff so much, like going on the subway. I sort of miss it, because you can have interesting experiences. The last time I rode on the subway a man lifted his shirt to show me the bullet wounds he suffered in Vietnam. Making The Irishman was a bit like a school reunion without the booze! I\u2019ve worked a lot with Martin Scorsese. We have a lot in common in our growing up \u2013 me in Brooklyn, him in Lower East Side. That bonded our friendship. Friendship has been one of the most important things in my life. That love, regard, caring for, being amused by\u2026 that something ethereal in friendship is the ultimate. If I could tell my younger self anything, it would be to broaden my field of study to include more art outside of acting. Writing, for example. In my mind I\u2019m always writing, but I don\u2019t really. Retirement? No, not really. I don\u2019t think anyone loses their powers as they get older. As long as you\u2019re involved and interested, then you can\u2019t lose it. That\u2019s how I keep being surprised. Old age is actually infused with youthful things.

      "body": "<p>Whether you\u2019re a PC, console or smartphone gamer, there\u2019s a wealth of accessories that promise to improve your experience \u2013 and your score. But from mechanical keyboards to high dynamic range monitors the choices and jargon can be confusing. Here is our selection of the best gaming peripherals, whatever you play on.</p> <h2>The PC gamer</h2> <p>There are as many \u201cultimate\u201d PC gaming set-ups as there are PC gamers \u2013 because the range of possibilities is vast and it\u2019s such a subjective process. With the mouse, for example, a lot will depend on how big your hands are and whether you prefer to lay your hand flat across the mouse or hold it in a claw-like grip. However, for all-round performance, the <a href=\"https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/gaming-mice/g502-hero-gaming-mouse.html\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Logitech G502</em></strong></a> (\u00a360) is an excellent gaming mouse, lightweight and comfortable, with fully programmable buttons. And it comes with the company\u2019s Hero optical sensor technology for smooth seamless control.</p> <p>For the keyboard, you\u2019ll want a model with mechanical keys, preferably boasting Cherry MX switches. These can be noisy but are much more responsive than cheap membrane keyboards. You can pay more than \u00a3150 for a top-end Corsair or Roccat model, but the <a href=\"https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/K68-RGB-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-%E2%80%94-CHERRY%C2%AE-MX-Red-%28UK%29/p/CH-9102010-UK\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Corsair K68</em></strong></a> (\u00a3120) is an excellent option, reliable and robustly built (complete with spill protection for when you knock over your drink mid-celebration), and offering configurable keys and lighting effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a51a6d01e8b95a157332a903c97d055eb9f9fd6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51a6d01e8b95a157332a903c97d055eb9f9fd6c/0_0_1500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of screen with fire coming out of action character's hand and the words by him saying: Republic of Games\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Asus ROG Swift PG278QR screen is hard to beat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Asus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for the monitor, this will depend on your budget and the specifications of your PC. If you have a monster graphics card you might be tempted by a 4K ultrawide behemoth (which will certainly make you future-proof as more games support 4K going onwards), but that will cost way over \u00a31,000. Most gamers will be happy with a 27-inch 1080p or 1440p display (with 1,080 and 1,440 vertical pixels respectively). It should also have no less than a 120Hz refresh rate \u2013 but preferably 144Hz \u2013 and a response time of one to four milliseconds. You also need to make sure it offers FreeSync technology, which synchronises your graphics card with your screen. If you have an Nvidia GPU you should look for that company\u2019s G-Sync technology.</p> <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/uk/Monitors/ROG-SWIFT-PG279Q/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>ASUS ROG Swift PG279Q</em></strong></a> (\u00a3600) is a tough one to beat,\u201d says Andy Hartup, managing editor of hardware at Future, a specialist publisher. \u201cIt\u2019s a 27-inch IPS (in-plane switching) monitor that ticks plenty of boxes: 1440p resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, G-Sync, and has all the ports and connections you\u2019d expect.\u201d</p> <p>With speakers, unless you\u2019re an absolute audio purist or have your PC in a barn, Creative\u2019s budget-friendly <a href=\"https://uk.creative.com/p/archived-products/sbs-a250\" title=\"\">A250</a> set (\u00a327) is great. Its two satellite speakers and subwoofer sound surprisingly rich and full given the mere nine watts of power. Alternatively, if you\u2019re looking for headphones, we really like the new <a href=\"https://uk.turtlebeach.com/pages/elite-atlas-aero-headset\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>headset<strong><em> </em></strong>(\u00a3130) \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly comfortable over long periods, highly customisable and the \u201cSuperHuman\u201d sound system makes it easier to pick out your enemy\u2019s movements and weapon reloads.</p> <h2>The console gamer</h2> <p>Considering that most of us have our consoles in shared social spaces, a decent headset is the most important accessory you can buy. It\u2019s also a vital element of games such as <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Call of Duty</em>, allowing you to talk to teammates online via a voice mic and to hear the footsteps of your foes. Sound quality is an important factor, obviously, and noise cancellation will keep you completely immersed in the world. However, comfort is key for longer gaming sessions, and manufacturers are now offering technologies such as memory foam head bands and cooling gel in the ear cups. It\u2019s hard to go wrong with any of the high-end options from specialists such as SteelSeries, HyperX, Turtle Beach<strong><em> </em></strong>or Astro Gaming. But if you don\u2019t want to spend more than \u00a3150 and \u2013 like me \u2013 have to share your console accessories with the kids, go for the <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-audio/razer-kraken-x\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Razer Kraken X</em></strong></a> (\u00a350), which looks cool, feels comfortable and works with everything.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1f1ba38266b9b9f4fc00e6d20a391f4940034e97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f1ba38266b9b9f4fc00e6d20a391f4940034e97/420_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Controller with joystick in top left and several buttons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nacon Revolution Unlimited Pro is highly ergonomic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nacon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for controllers, most players are best served by the pads that come with the machines. However, if you\u2019re looking for greater precision and responsiveness from buttons and analogue sticks, or want extra options in terms of button layouts, a pro controller might be worth the extra money. For the PS4, the <a href=\"https://www.game.co.uk/en/nacon-revolution-unlimited-wireless-pro-controller-2592421\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Nacon Revolution Unlimited Pro</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>(\u00a3120) is a beautiful, highly ergonomic pad boasting customisable analogue sticks, programmable buttons and even little weights to slide into the controller grips, for those who like a little more heft in their hands. Microsoft\u2019s own<strong><em> </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/elite-wireless-controller-series-2\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Elite Series 2</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>controller (\u00a3160) does a similarly impressive job for Xbox One, complete with adjustable-tension thumb sticks and variable locks on the triggers so you can fire your laser gun faster.</p> <p>If you\u2019re buying a TV just for gaming, you\u2019ll want a 4K display with HDR 10 (high dynamic range) imaging functionality to get the most from your Xbox One or PS4. Look for models that offer low input lag \u2013 the delay between your console sending a signal and your TV displaying it. Some sets provide dedicated game modes, which tweak the settings to cut this down to a few milliseconds. I have always trusted Samsung for gaming, and if you want a mid-range TV that will see you into the next generation of Xbox and PlayStation 5 machines the <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/tvs/qledtv-q70r/QE55Q70RATXXU/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Samsung Q70R 4K QLED</em></strong></a> (\u00a31,000) is an excellent option, with lovely picture quality, great Smart TV functionality and that all-important game mode, which cuts the input lag down to 16 milliseconds.</p> <h2>The smartphone gamer</h2> <p>Whether you\u2019re an Apple or Android owner, the first accessory you need for a better gaming experience is a Bluetooth controller. Danish e-sports specialist SteelSeries is known for its quality headsets, mice and keyboards, but we also love its smartphone models. <strong><em>The </em></strong><a href=\"https://steelseries.com/gaming-controllers/stratus-duo\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Stratus Duo</em></strong></a> (\u00a365) for Android and the <a href=\"https://steelseries.com/gaming-controllers/nimbus\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Nimbus</em></strong></a> (\u00a350) for iOS are solid, proper gaming controllers with responsive buttons and more than 20 hours of play on a single battery charge. A separate <a href=\"https://steelseries.com/gaming-accessories/smartgrip\" title=\"\">\u00a310 SmartGrip</a> will fix your phone to the pad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f2f9781f0e098349ea272bb5996a2249b748e08f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f9781f0e098349ea272bb5996a2249b748e08f/237_170_1054_789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Razer\u2019s Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Razer\u2019s Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds are aimed specifically at gamers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Razer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are a few earbuds around aimed specifically at gamers. Razer has just released its <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-audio/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Hammerhead True Wireless</em></strong></a> set (\u00a3100), which boast an ultra low-latency Bluetooth connection, meaning sound effects should stay in perfect synchronicity with your game \u2013 very important for when you\u2019re listening out for footsteps in <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <p>Games can be particularly draining on your phone battery, so keep a pocket-sized power bank to hand, preferably one with a rapid charge feature so you\u2019re not left waiting hours before you can start playing <em>Candy Crush</em> again. The <a href=\"https://www.aukey.com/products/10000mah-power-bank-18w-usb-c-portable-charger-with-power-delivery-3-0-quick-charge-3-0-pb-y13\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Aukey PB-Y13</em></strong></a> (\u00a325) is a good slimline option, offering 10,000mAh (roughly 2.5 times the full charge of a smartphone) and quick charge capabilities. It\u2019ll also power your Nintendo Switch.</p> <h2>The VR gamer</h2> <p>The past five years have seen an explosion in virtual reality systems, from the low-end Google Cardboard to the high-spec HTC Vive Pro, which requires connection to a suitably powerful PC. But if you just want a standalone system that will let you easily experience \u2013 and share \u2013 the magic of virtual reality, the best option right now is the <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/quest/?locale=en_GB\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Oculus Quest</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>(\u00a3400), a surprisingly light and comfortable headset that doesn\u2019t need to be connected to a PC via a long cable (read: trip hazard) so you can move around freely. It also comes with its own wireless controllers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing device that overcomes so many of the pitfalls that consumer VR has been suffering with,\u201d says Dan Page, creative director of the annual VR World Congress event. \u201cit\u2019s relatively affordable, all-in-one, incredibly easy to set up, has pretty minimal screen door effect, doesn\u2019t require the user to be massively technical to use it and it just kinda works\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59673dc3517c1981acd3bd57a5213dc7cc1515a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59673dc3517c1981acd3bd57a5213dc7cc1515a1/0_0_1145_1280/895.jpg\" alt=\"Oculus Quest\" width=\"895\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Light and comfortable: Oculus Quest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oculus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the image quality is not quite as good as high-end sets such as the Vive, most users won\u2019t notice, and you will soon be able to link the headset to a PC via a USC-C cable to get a boost in performance.</p> <p>Oculus does sell its own earphones to go with the system, but if you prefer full headphones, the light and comfortable <a href=\"https://uk.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-350vr-headset\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Turtle Beach Stealth 350VR</em></strong></a> (\u00a355) set is specially designed for virtual reality and you can replace the detachable cable with a shorter one so that it doesn\u2019t dangle around your face.</p> <p>If you\u2019re taking the Quest on the move with you, a high-capacity battery pack such as the <a href=\"https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore--26800/A1374011\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Anker PowerCore 26800</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>(\u00a335) is the perfect companion. Or if you\u2019re playing mostly at home, the <a href=\"https://www.vrgomini.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>VRGO Mini</em></strong></a> (currently on Kickstarter, for \u00a3170) is a movement controller that looks like a chair cushion \u2013 you sit on it and explore virtual worlds simply by tilting in different directions. It cuts down on motion sickness and provides haptic feedback, so you actually feel things like explosions or the rumble of a spaceship engine. In short, you\u2019re getting a virtual reality experience <em>and</em> a lower back massage. </p> <h2>The laptop gamer</h2> <p>If you want to take your gaming habit on the road, the first thing to understand is that it isn\u2019t going to be cheap. Unless you\u2019re restricting yourself to classic games or less demanding independent titles, you\u2019ll want something with an Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX or RTX card, 16GB of RAM and at least a 512GB SSD.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4484af1890076101ae8755dea9a339f177237155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4484af1890076101ae8755dea9a339f177237155/0_172_1000_670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ASUS ROG Zephyrus GA502.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the best: ASUS ROG Zephyrus GA502.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ASUS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of the best value we\u2019ve seen is the <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ROG-Zephyrus-G-GA502/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>ASUS ROG Zephyrus GA502</em></strong></a>,\u201d says <em>Future</em>\u2019s Andy Hartup. \u201cIt has a Ryzen 7-3750H processor (good), a GTX 1660 Ti graphics card (good enough), 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD\u201d. That will be around \u00a31,000.</p> <p>A lighter headset is a good idea if you\u2019re doing a lot of travelling. \u201cThe new <a href=\"https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-1-wireless\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Steelseries Arctis 1</em></strong></a> wireless (\u00a3100) is a good bet,\u201d says Hartup. \u201cIt\u2019s subtle in design, so people won\u2019t know it\u2019s a gaming headset. It\u2019s got a USB-C wireless dongle, so it\u2019s wireless for the Nintendo Switch too, and is quite light. The sound is good too.\u201d</p> <p>As for the mouse, if you\u2019ve already gone all out with a gaming laptop you may as well aim high. As such, we\u2019ll opt for the new <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-mice/razer-viper-ultimate\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Razer Viper Ultimate</em></strong></a> (\u00a3150), which is very light at 74g, ambidextrous and offers an incredibly responsive performance for a wireless device.</p> <p>At least now you can\u2019t blame your disappointing <em>Overwatch</em> performance on an imprecise mouse.</p>",

It should also have no less than a 120Hz refresh rate \u2013 but preferably 144Hz \u2013 and a response time of one to four milliseconds. You also need to make sure it offers FreeSync technology, which synchronises your graphics card with your screen. If you have an Nvidia GPU you should look for that company\u2019s G-Sync technology. \u201cThe ASUS ROG Swift PG279Q (\u00a3600) is a tough one to beat,\u201d says Andy Hartup, managing editor of hardware at Future, a specialist publisher. \u201cIt\u2019s a 27-inch IPS (in-plane switching) monitor that ticks plenty of boxes: 1440p resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, G-Sync, and has all the ports and connections you\u2019d expect.\u201d With speakers, unless you\u2019re an absolute audio purist or have your PC in a barn, Creative\u2019s budget-friendly A250 set (\u00a327) is great. Its two satellite speakers and subwoofer sound surprisingly rich and full given the mere nine watts of power. Alternatively, if you\u2019re looking for headphones, we really like the new Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero headset (\u00a3130) \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly comfortable over long periods, highly customisable and the \u201cSuperHuman\u201d sound system makes it easier to pick out your enemy\u2019s movements and weapon reloads. The console gamer Considering that most of us have our consoles in shared social spaces, a decent headset is the most important accessory you can buy. It\u2019s also a vital element of games such as Fortnite or Call of Duty, allowing you to talk to teammates online via a voice mic and to hear the footsteps of your foes. Sound quality is an important factor, obviously, and noise cancellation will keep you completely immersed in the world. However, comfort is key for longer gaming sessions, and manufacturers are now offering technologies such as memory foam head bands and cooling gel in the ear cups. It\u2019s hard to go wrong with any of the high-end options from specialists such as SteelSeries, HyperX, Turtle Beach or Astro Gaming. But if you don\u2019t want to spend more than \u00a3150 and \u2013 like me \u2013 have to share your console accessories with the kids, go for the Razer Kraken X (\u00a350), which looks cool, feels comfortable and works with everything. As for controllers, most players are best served by the pads that come with the machines. However, if you\u2019re looking for greater precision and responsiveness from buttons and analogue sticks, or want extra options in terms of button layouts, a pro controller might be worth the extra money. For the PS4, the Nacon Revolution Unlimited Pro (\u00a3120) is a beautiful, highly ergonomic pad boasting customisable analogue sticks, programmable buttons and even little weights to slide into the controller grips, for those who like a little more heft in their hands. Microsoft\u2019s own Elite Series 2 controller (\u00a3160) does a similarly impressive job for Xbox One, complete with adjustable-tension thumb sticks and variable locks on the triggers so you can fire your laser gun faster. If you\u2019re buying a TV just for gaming, you\u2019ll want a 4K display with HDR 10 (high dynamic range) imaging functionality to get the most from your Xbox One or PS4. Look for models that offer low input lag \u2013 the delay between your console sending a signal and your TV displaying it. Some sets provide dedicated game modes, which tweak the settings to cut this down to a few milliseconds. I have always trusted Samsung for gaming, and if you want a mid-range TV that will see you into the next generation of Xbox and PlayStation 5 machines the Samsung Q70R 4K QLED (\u00a31,000) is an excellent option, with lovely picture quality, great Smart TV functionality and that all-important game mode, which cuts the input lag down to 16 milliseconds. The smartphone gamer Whether you\u2019re an Apple or Android owner, the first accessory you need for a better gaming experience is a Bluetooth controller. Danish e-sports specialist SteelSeries is known for its quality headsets, mice and keyboards, but we also love its smartphone models. The Stratus Duo (\u00a365) for Android and the Nimbus (\u00a350) for iOS are solid, proper gaming controllers with responsive buttons and more than 20 hours of play on a single battery charge. A separate \u00a310 SmartGrip will fix your phone to the pad. There are a few earbuds around aimed specifically at gamers. Razer has just released its Hammerhead True Wireless set (\u00a3100), which boast an ultra low-latency Bluetooth connection, meaning sound effects should stay in perfect synchronicity with your game \u2013 very important for when you\u2019re listening out for footsteps in Fortnite. Games can be particularly draining on your phone battery, so keep a pocket-sized power bank to hand, preferably one with a rapid charge feature so you\u2019re not left waiting hours before you can start playing Candy Crush again. The Aukey PB-Y13 (\u00a325) is a good slimline option, offering 10,000mAh (roughly 2.5 times the full charge of a smartphone) and quick charge capabilities. It\u2019ll also power your Nintendo Switch. The VR gamer The past five years have seen an explosion in virtual reality systems, from the low-end Google Cardboard to the high-spec HTC Vive Pro, which requires connection to a suitably powerful PC. But if you just want a standalone system that will let you easily experience \u2013 and share \u2013 the magic of virtual reality, the best option right now is the Oculus Quest (\u00a3400), a surprisingly light and comfortable headset that doesn\u2019t need to be connected to a PC via a long cable (read: trip hazard) so you can move around freely. It also comes with its own wireless controllers. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing device that overcomes so many of the pitfalls that consumer VR has been suffering with,\u201d says Dan Page, creative director of the annual VR World Congress event. \u201cit\u2019s relatively affordable, all-in-one, incredibly easy to set up, has pretty minimal screen door effect, doesn\u2019t require the user to be massively technical to use it and it just kinda works\u201d. Although the image quality is not quite as good as high-end sets such as the Vive, most users won\u2019t notice, and you will soon be able to link the headset to a PC via a USC-C cable to get a boost in performance. Oculus does sell its own earphones to go with the system, but if you prefer full headphones, the light and comfortable Turtle Beach Stealth 350VR (\u00a355) set is specially designed for virtual reality and you can replace the detachable cable with a shorter one so that it doesn\u2019t dangle around your face. If you\u2019re taking the Quest on the move with you, a high-capacity battery pack such as the Anker PowerCore 26800 (\u00a335) is the perfect companion. Or if you\u2019re playing mostly at home, the VRGO Mini (currently on Kickstarter, for \u00a3170) is a movement controller that looks like a chair cushion \u2013 you sit on it and explore virtual worlds simply by tilting in different directions. It cuts down on motion sickness and provides haptic feedback, so you actually feel things like explosions or the rumble of a spaceship engine. In short, you\u2019re getting a virtual reality experience and a lower back massage. The laptop gamer If you want to take your gaming habit on the road, the first thing to understand is that it isn\u2019t going to be cheap. Unless you\u2019re restricting yourself to classic games or less demanding independent titles, you\u2019ll want something with an Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX or RTX card, 16GB of RAM and at least a 512GB SSD. \u201cOne of the best value we\u2019ve seen is the ASUS ROG Zephyrus GA502,\u201d says Future\u2019s Andy Hartup. \u201cIt has a Ryzen 7-3750H processor (good), a GTX 1660 Ti graphics card (good enough), 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD\u201d. That will be around \u00a31,000. A lighter headset is a good idea if you\u2019re doing a lot of travelling. \u201cThe new Steelseries Arctis 1 wireless (\u00a3100) is a good bet,\u201d says Hartup. \u201cIt\u2019s subtle in design, so people won\u2019t know it\u2019s a gaming headset. It\u2019s got a USB-C wireless dongle, so it\u2019s wireless for the Nintendo Switch too, and is quite light. The sound is good too.\u201d As for the mouse, if you\u2019ve already gone all out with a gaming laptop you may as well aim high. As such, we\u2019ll opt for the new Razer Viper Ultimate (\u00a3150), which is very light at 74g, ambidextrous and offers an incredibly responsive performance for a wireless device. At least now you can\u2019t blame your disappointing Overwatch performance on an imprecise mouse.",

Does your partner or roommate always get their way when it comes to how hot your house is? If you answered \u201cyes\u201d then stay strong \u2013 you\u2019re not alone. According to a new study, conducted by researchers from Ohio State University, a lot of households contain a <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/60938-thermostat-conflict-men-women\">\u201cthermostat dictator\u201d</a> who rules the temperature dial with an iron fist. As it turns out there\u2019s a gendered nature to this \u2013 the thermostat dictator is normally a man.</p> <p>The study, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224198\">Thermostat wars? The roles of gender and thermal comfort negotiations in household energy use behavior</a>, examined temperature discussions in 112 Ohio households. They found that men tend to get their way while women are more likely to be forced to compromise.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that women are losing the thermostat battle,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/health/thermostat-wars-wellness/index.html\">told CNN</a>. \u201cThis hints at a status quo gender bias in thermostat settings that leads to a home thermal environment that does not cater to women\u2019s preferences.\u201d Women\u2019s preferences, by the way, tend to veer towards warmer environments, while men prefer it chilly. There is actually a fascinating scientific reason for this: it is because men are from Mars (where it\u2019s normally a cool -81F), while women are from Venus (a toasty 864F).</p> <p>Temperature is about more than just comfort. Studies show that <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/157448/female-productivity-warmer-temperature/\">women are more productive</a> and perform better on math and verbal tasks in warmer temperatures. However, as you may have noticed yourself, most offices are freezing, catering to men\u2019s preferred temperatures. According a 2015 study, the optimal office climate has been tailored to the work clothing and metabolic rates of a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woman-feel-colder-office-old-formula-set-temperature-based-men-study-reveals/\">154-pound, 40-year-old man.</a></p> <p>While there has been a fair amount of research and discussion around <a href=\"https://qz.com/work/1373402/air-conditioning-is-sexist-and-cynthia-nixon-and-andrew-cuomos-debate-about-it-shows-it/\">\u201csexist</a><a href=\"https://qz.com/work/1373402/air-conditioning-is-sexist-and-cynthia-nixon-and-andrew-cuomos-debate-about-it-shows-it/\">\u201d air-conditioning</a> in the workplace, this latest study is the first to focus on household temperature settings. It should be noted, of course, that the sample size was pretty small, so the findings aren\u2019t exactly definitive. And it\u2019s also worth noting that living in a single-sex household isn\u2019t a failsafe way to end the thermostat wars. My otherwise perfect girlfriend likes to sleep in morgue-like temperatures while I prefer not to lose feeling in my feet during the night. Seriously, the first person who can invent dual-temperature beds deserves a Nobel peace prize.</p> <h2>Oklahoma woman free after serving time for boyfriend\u2019s crime</h2> <p>If all the talk of thermostat wars has got you feeling chilly, don\u2019t worry \u2013 this next bit is guaranteed to make your blood boil. In 2004, a woman called Tondalao Hall and her then boyfriend, Robert Braxton, were arrested on child abuse charges. Braxton had beaten Hall\u2019s three-month-old daughter, breaking her ribs and femur. Hall hadn\u2019t abused the child but she hadn\u2019t reported it either \u2013 because Braxton also abused and terrorized her. He pleaded guilty to child abuse, she pleaded guilty to enabling it. Guess how much time each of them served? Braxton spent two years in jail, and Hall spent 15 years in jail (she was sentenced to 30). Let me repeat that: she served more than seven times as long in prison for his crime. She <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tondalao-hall-oklahoma-woman-imprisoned-for-child-abuse-committed-by-boyfriend-freed-after-15-years-2019-11-09/\">only got out of prison last weekend</a>. Oklahoma, it\u2019s worth noting, has the highest rate of <a href=\"https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/incarcerated-women-and-girls/\">female imprisonment</a> in America. And more than half of these women, like Hall, are also victims of domestic or sexual violence.</p> <h2>Australian man avoids prison for live-streamed assault</h2> <p>Luke James, 27, accidentally live-streamed himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/fortnite-gamer-who-assaulted-pregnant-partner-during-livestream-avoids-jail\">assaulting his pregnant girlfriend</a>. He got zero jail time for the attack and his lawyer downplayed the whole thing as \u201cjust as a slap\u201d.</p> <h2>Facebook sucks (up to Brett Kavanaugh)</h2> <p>Sorry, I mean FACEBOOK. While the company may have had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/04/facebook-rebrands-as-facebook-can-capital-letters-save-a-toxic-brand\">recent rebrand</a>, its values (or lack thereof) don\u2019t appear to have changed at all. On Thursday, the tech giant was the \u201cgold circle\u201d sponsor for the rightwing Federalist Society\u2019s annual gala dinner. The keynote speaker at this was none other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/14/facebook-federalist-society-brett-kavanaugh-gala\">Brett Kavanaugh</a>. This isn\u2019t the first time Facebook has appeared to support Kavanaugh; during the Senate hearings in 2018 the company\u2019s head of global public policy turned up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/06/kavanaugh-joel-kaplan-facebook-women-survivors\">support his pal</a>.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for The week in patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. The gender wars are heating up Are you a victim of thermal bullying? Does your partner or roommate always get their way when it comes to how hot your house is? If you answered \u201cyes\u201d then stay strong \u2013 you\u2019re not alone. According to a new study, conducted by researchers from Ohio State University, a lot of households contain a \u201cthermostat dictator\u201d who rules the temperature dial with an iron fist. As it turns out there\u2019s a gendered nature to this \u2013 the thermostat dictator is normally a man. The study, Thermostat wars? The roles of gender and thermal comfort negotiations in household energy use behavior, examined temperature discussions in 112 Ohio households. They found that men tend to get their way while women are more likely to be forced to compromise. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that women are losing the thermostat battle,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author told CNN. \u201cThis hints at a status quo gender bias in thermostat settings that leads to a home thermal environment that does not cater to women\u2019s preferences.\u201d Women\u2019s preferences, by the way, tend to veer towards warmer environments, while men prefer it chilly. There is actually a fascinating scientific reason for this: it is because men are from Mars (where it\u2019s normally a cool -81F), while women are from Venus (a toasty 864F). Temperature is about more than just comfort. Studies show that women are more productive and perform better on math and verbal tasks in warmer temperatures. However, as you may have noticed yourself, most offices are freezing, catering to men\u2019s preferred temperatures. According a 2015 study, the optimal office climate has been tailored to the work clothing and metabolic rates of a 154-pound, 40-year-old man. While there has been a fair amount of research and discussion around \u201csexist\u201d air-conditioning in the workplace, this latest study is the first to focus on household temperature settings. It should be noted, of course, that the sample size was pretty small, so the findings aren\u2019t exactly definitive. And it\u2019s also worth noting that living in a single-sex household isn\u2019t a failsafe way to end the thermostat wars. My otherwise perfect girlfriend likes to sleep in morgue-like temperatures while I prefer not to lose feeling in my feet during the night. Seriously, the first person who can invent dual-temperature beds deserves a Nobel peace prize. Oklahoma woman free after serving time for boyfriend\u2019s crime If all the talk of thermostat wars has got you feeling chilly, don\u2019t worry \u2013 this next bit is guaranteed to make your blood boil. In 2004, a woman called Tondalao Hall and her then boyfriend, Robert Braxton, were arrested on child abuse charges. Braxton had beaten Hall\u2019s three-month-old daughter, breaking her ribs and femur. Hall hadn\u2019t abused the child but she hadn\u2019t reported it either \u2013 because Braxton also abused and terrorized her. He pleaded guilty to child abuse, she pleaded guilty to enabling it. Guess how much time each of them served? Braxton spent two years in jail, and Hall spent 15 years in jail (she was sentenced to 30). Let me repeat that: she served more than seven times as long in prison for his crime. She only got out of prison last weekend. Oklahoma, it\u2019s worth noting, has the highest rate of female imprisonment in America. And more than half of these women, like Hall, are also victims of domestic or sexual violence. Australian man avoids prison for live-streamed assault Luke James, 27, accidentally live-streamed himself assaulting his pregnant girlfriend. He got zero jail time for the attack and his lawyer downplayed the whole thing as \u201cjust as a slap\u201d. Facebook sucks (up to Brett Kavanaugh) Sorry, I mean FACEBOOK. While the company may have had a recent rebrand, its values (or lack thereof) don\u2019t appear to have changed at all. On Thursday, the tech giant was the \u201cgold circle\u201d sponsor for the rightwing Federalist Society\u2019s annual gala dinner. The keynote speaker at this was none other than Brett Kavanaugh. This isn\u2019t the first time Facebook has appeared to support Kavanaugh; during the Senate hearings in 2018 the company\u2019s head of global public policy turned up to support his pal. Facebook\u2019s sponsorship generated a massive outcry and protestors interrupted his speech with rape whistles.

      "body": "<p>For such an intricate band, Vampire Weekend know well the power of simple joys. During the encore, at the end of 26 songs played over nearly two hours, four giant planet Earth beach balls are unleashed on to the heads of the crowd at Alexandra Palace.</p> <p>Various band members \u2013 first Chris Baio, the band\u2019s bassist, later main man Ezra Koenig \u2013 rush to knock the globes back at the audience when they hit the stage. You don\u2019t expect this kind of cheesy, dumb fun from an outfit who, just over a decade ago, peddled African-inflected post-punk tunes set in the niche milieu of higher education.</p> <p>Four albums in, however, and Vampire Weekend have long combined a searching intelligence with vast singalongs, and a restless musicality with the most accessible of melodies. The scale of their success mandates, perhaps, a little corniness in these big venues. There is probably an unspoken entente between this band and the over-thinkers who form their fanbase that playing volleyball with plastic planet Earths is inherently absurd. (Also, they won\u2019t biodegrade any time soon.)</p> <p>A 3D spinning world is also centre stage tonight. Released in May, the band\u2019s magnificent fourth album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/04/vampire-weekend-father-of-the-bride-review\" title=\"\">Father of the Bride</a></em>, is a record full of love songs that thrums with anxiety about the climate emergency and the rise of extremism. \u201cHow long \u2019til we sink to the bottom of the sea,\u201d wonders How Long?, a piano-strewn highlight of the encore. \u201cWhy\u2019s it felt like Halloween since Christmas 2017?\u201d wonders the same song, about US politics. The planet is on the cover of the record, in a cartoon departure from the band\u2019s signature atmospheric photography \u2013 just one of the step changes that mark this new iteration of Vampire Weekend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From the guitar solos to the beach balls, there is a feeling of hair being let down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet, for all the angst at the core of <em>Father of the Bride</em>, it is one of the band\u2019s most mellifluous outings, \u2013 an easy listen, full of country duets and lush musicianship. The vibe is \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cnot that serious\u201d, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2L0d4uUp24\" title=\"\">half-quote Koenig in one of the album\u2019s ad-libs</a>.</p> <p>Before the beach balls, this mighty seven-strong band play the hell out of it, and a great tranche of the band\u2019s catalogue. Often, the tour-hardened outfit \u2013 circling the globe for the first time without founder member Rostam Batmanglij, who left in 2016 to pursue other projects \u2013 stick to the script, especially for sacrosanct first-album cuts such as A-Punk.</p> <p>Just as often, they unmoor. On record, in the rush to consider Koenig\u2019s oblique lyrics, it\u2019s often tempting to take the band\u2019s engrossing music for granted. Tonight, the band make full use of the martial firepower of two drummers \u2013 core member Chris Tomson and touring percussionist Garrett Ray, heavy on the gourds and bongos.</p> <p>This exhibition hall\u2019s sound is infamously muddy; tonight is no exception. But the distorting bass ultimately adds to the density of instrumentation on offer \u2013 a pile-on of keyboards of every vintage, and guitars of most stripes. On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2L0d4uUp24\" title=\"\">Sympathy</a>, a flamenco-scented cut from <em>Father of the Bride</em>, there are three pell-mell acoustic guitars.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gccLqkYQZL8\" title=\"\">My Mistake</a> has elegant jazz club piano, courtesy of keyboard player Will Canzoneri, who also adds louche honky-tonk touches on a tremendous Harmony Hall, a huge singalong tonight. The song\u2019s lyrics seemingly allude to the rise of antisemitism in spaces previously believed to be safe, and to the shrillness of online echo chambers. Its guitar motif, meanwhile, radiates a calm beauty. Last January, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa1t5bjJbms\" title=\"\">120-minute loop appeared on YouTube</a>, a trailer for the album doubling as excellent ambient music to work to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b26b86bed0df5a01517c12321723be3f3da1792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b26b86bed0df5a01517c12321723be3f3da1792/0_455_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ezra Koenig: letting the music do the talking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ezra Koenig: letting the music do the talking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The loss of Batmanglij and a move to the west coast paved the way for Koenig to throw open Vampire Weekend to fresh influences. Clad in a tie-dye T-shirt and board shorts, as though impervious to the drear of London in November, is live guitarist Brian Robert Jones. Emblematic of the band\u2019s LA rebirth, and taking on the role of album guest Steve Lacy, Jones adds the lysergic guitar sunshine of the Grateful Dead and Jimi Hendrix to this most east coast of bands. Vampire Weekend were, once, perhaps, the very definition of an uptight band \u2013 not any more. From the guitar solos to the beach balls, there is the feeling of hair being let down, of beds unmade, of warm layers cast aside.</p> <p>As ever, Koenig doesn\u2019t really say much, other than to note the passage of nine years since Vampire Weekend last played here, and to take requests at the end. (Diplomat\u2019s Son, and a 2008 song called Ottoman, from a film soundtrack). The band\u2019s music, it follows, does even more talking than usual \u2013 although some reports of Vampire Weekend turning into a \u201cjam band\u201d on this tour have been exaggerated.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs0xe9DQEPc\" title=\"\">New Dorp, New York</a> \u2013 a SBTRKT track to which Koenig lent vocals back in 2014 \u2013 the band achieve the first of several lift-offs.

      "bodyText": "For such an intricate band, Vampire Weekend know well the power of simple joys. During the encore, at the end of 26 songs played over nearly two hours, four giant planet Earth beach balls are unleashed on to the heads of the crowd at Alexandra Palace. Various band members \u2013 first Chris Baio, the band\u2019s bassist, later main man Ezra Koenig \u2013 rush to knock the globes back at the audience when they hit the stage. You don\u2019t expect this kind of cheesy, dumb fun from an outfit who, just over a decade ago, peddled African-inflected post-punk tunes set in the niche milieu of higher education. Four albums in, however, and Vampire Weekend have long combined a searching intelligence with vast singalongs, and a restless musicality with the most accessible of melodies. The scale of their success mandates, perhaps, a little corniness in these big venues. There is probably an unspoken entente between this band and the over-thinkers who form their fanbase that playing volleyball with plastic planet Earths is inherently absurd. (Also, they won\u2019t biodegrade any time soon.) A 3D spinning world is also centre stage tonight. Released in May, the band\u2019s magnificent fourth album, Father of the Bride, is a record full of love songs that thrums with anxiety about the climate emergency and the rise of extremism. \u201cHow long \u2019til we sink to the bottom of the sea,\u201d wonders How Long?, a piano-strewn highlight of the encore. \u201cWhy\u2019s it felt like Halloween since Christmas 2017?\u201d wonders the same song, about US politics. The planet is on the cover of the record, in a cartoon departure from the band\u2019s signature atmospheric photography \u2013 just one of the step changes that mark this new iteration of Vampire Weekend. And yet, for all the angst at the core of Father of the Bride, it is one of the band\u2019s most mellifluous outings, \u2013 an easy listen, full of country duets and lush musicianship. The vibe is \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cnot that serious\u201d, to half-quote Koenig in one of the album\u2019s ad-libs. Before the beach balls, this mighty seven-strong band play the hell out of it, and a great tranche of the band\u2019s catalogue. Often, the tour-hardened outfit \u2013 circling the globe for the first time without founder member Rostam Batmanglij, who left in 2016 to pursue other projects \u2013 stick to the script, especially for sacrosanct first-album cuts such as A-Punk. Just as often, they unmoor. On record, in the rush to consider Koenig\u2019s oblique lyrics, it\u2019s often tempting to take the band\u2019s engrossing music for granted. Tonight, the band make full use of the martial firepower of two drummers \u2013 core member Chris Tomson and touring percussionist Garrett Ray, heavy on the gourds and bongos. This exhibition hall\u2019s sound is infamously muddy; tonight is no exception. But the distorting bass ultimately adds to the density of instrumentation on offer \u2013 a pile-on of keyboards of every vintage, and guitars of most stripes. On Sympathy, a flamenco-scented cut from Father of the Bride, there are three pell-mell acoustic guitars. My Mistake has elegant jazz club piano, courtesy of keyboard player Will Canzoneri, who also adds louche honky-tonk touches on a tremendous Harmony Hall, a huge singalong tonight. The song\u2019s lyrics seemingly allude to the rise of antisemitism in spaces previously believed to be safe, and to the shrillness of online echo chambers. Its guitar motif, meanwhile, radiates a calm beauty. Last January, a 120-minute loop appeared on YouTube, a trailer for the album doubling as excellent ambient music to work to. The loss of Batmanglij and a move to the west coast paved the way for Koenig to throw open Vampire Weekend to fresh influences. Clad in a tie-dye T-shirt and board shorts, as though impervious to the drear of London in November, is live guitarist Brian Robert Jones. Emblematic of the band\u2019s LA rebirth, and taking on the role of album guest Steve Lacy, Jones adds the lysergic guitar sunshine of the Grateful Dead and Jimi Hendrix to this most east coast of bands. Vampire Weekend were, once, perhaps, the very definition of an uptight band \u2013 not any more. From the guitar solos to the beach balls, there is the feeling of hair being let down, of beds unmade, of warm layers cast aside. As ever, Koenig doesn\u2019t really say much, other than to note the passage of nine years since Vampire Weekend last played here, and to take requests at the end. (Diplomat\u2019s Son, and a 2008 song called Ottoman, from a film soundtrack). The band\u2019s music, it follows, does even more talking than usual \u2013 although some reports of Vampire Weekend turning into a \u201cjam band\u201d on this tour have been exaggerated. On New Dorp, New York \u2013 a SBTRKT track to which Koenig lent vocals back in 2014 \u2013 the band achieve the first of several lift-offs. Jones\u2019s guitar work turns gnarly, before the band pivot to dancefloor space-funk. Even more beautiful is Sunflower, where Koenig and Jones\u2019s guitars face off against one another, doubling up on the song\u2019s intricate guitar figure. It eventually climaxes in a blues-rock choogle that lends this version the nickname \u201cStoneflower\u201d. More playful yet is 2021, the most pristine electronic track on Father of the Bride, rendered more resonantly tonight, with the added fun of Koenig singing into a talkbox. And who could predict that Jerusalem, New York, Berlin would end up as a full-on rave? It is, after all, a sombre song about the Balfour declaration, and cities significant to the Jewish diaspora. The take-home tonight from this sunnier Vampire Weekend seems to be that even over-thinkers need to cut loose and kick some inflatables about \u2013 that music can deliver succour.",

After two loan spells she joined permanently at the start of 2018. \u201cI just wanted to settle down and play my football somewhere.

When you\u2019re on loan and you\u2019re going back and forth it\u2019s hard to settle.\u201d</p> <p>It was in Everton\u2019s second game of the season that Kelly stole the show. A weaving first goal was followed by a screaming long-distance effort that went viral. \u201cI had confidence from the first one really. Then the second one came to me and I took one step and hit it. It was from a standing start really, which is difficult, but I got a lot of power in it.</p> <p>\u201cPreviously, you might not have taken that shot, but just because you\u2019re confident in that moment you hit it and soon as it leaves your boot you know that it is going in.\u201d</p> <p>It was enough to secure the September award. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely buzzing with the start I\u2019ve had to the season.

At the moment I\u2019m doing well, but there\u2019s more to come.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly credits clever recruitment and the togetherness of the team as key components in Everton\u2019s change in fortunes. \u201cThe balance of the team is great. The staff did a great job in recruiting not just good players, but great people to be around and that helps the team dynamics. There\u2019s a more competitive side to us this year, every day you know that if you\u2019re not performing, someone else is and they\u2019ll take your shirt straight off you.\u201d</p> <p>They are full of confidence, and resilient after rebounding from back-to-back league defeats with victory against Brighton, but there is no room for complacency in an increasingly tough league. \u201cWe can\u2019t ever slip off,\u201d Kelly says.</p> <p>\u201cThe league is competitive and anyone can get the three points any weekend so it\u2019s just about performing. There\u2019s no game that you go in thinking that\u2019s an easy three points, but that\u2019s the way it should be and it helps women football grow. It\u2019s an exciting time, the WSL is pushing on.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chloe Kelly betrays a hint of sympathy for the trials of Everton\u2019s Merseyside rivals. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters how Liverpool are doing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know exactly what it\u2019s like down there \u2013 it\u2019s tough.\u201d Liverpool are struggling, with a single league point and are rock bottom of the Women\u2019s Super League. Everton are preparing to pounce on their vulnerable neighbours in the first WSL game to be played at Anfield. \u201cThree points at Southport or Anfield, it doesn\u2019t really matter where it is, three points against Liverpool is always great for the club,\u201d says Kelly. While Everton are this season\u2019s surprise package, having matched their three wins of last term in five games instead of 20, Kelly is not quite ready to lord their turnaround over Liverpool on Women\u2019s Football Weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ll do our work on the pitch. We definitely we want to go to Anfield and cause an upset but that\u2019s got to come from us being good, not how Liverpool play.\u201d No one encapsulates the turnaround at Everton more than Kelly. The 21-year-old forward spent the second half of last season on the sidelines after having ankle surgery. Now, though, she is flying and picked up the first Barclays player of the month award, for September, and was shortlisted for October\u2019s. \u201cIt was definitely a difficult time for me,\u201d she says of her spell off the pitch. \u201cBut it was a time for me to work on areas that I wasn\u2019t strong in. I wasn\u2019t ever the best in the gym and I knew that. But it gave me an opportunity to focus on getting my body strong. \u201cIt was a difficult time and seeing the team low, the lowest, was quite difficult. When you can\u2019t really impact on the pitch it\u2019s hard but it was just about being positive around the team.\u201d Time out working on her game has led to her going one goal ahead of Arsenal\u2019s Danielle van de Donk as league top-scorer with four goals \u2013 the total she managed across the last two seasons \u2013 in five games. \u201cWhen I was first back on the pitch I was rusty and I was getting frustrated,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt\u2019s just about getting your feet right and just slowly gradually getting back into things.\u201d It is a reward for the patience Everton have afforded her. After two loan spells she joined permanently at the start of 2018. \u201cI just wanted to settle down and play my football somewhere. Everton was the place for me and I settled in nicely and the club welcomed me very well. When you\u2019re on loan and you\u2019re going back and forth it\u2019s hard to settle.\u201d It was in Everton\u2019s second game of the season that Kelly stole the show. A weaving first goal was followed by a screaming long-distance effort that went viral. \u201cI had confidence from the first one really. Then the second one came to me and I took one step and hit it. It was from a standing start really, which is difficult, but I got a lot of power in it. \u201cPreviously, you might not have taken that shot, but just because you\u2019re confident in that moment you hit it and soon as it leaves your boot you know that it is going in.\u201d It was enough to secure the September award. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely buzzing with the start I\u2019ve had to the season. But it\u2019s the team that allows me to go and express myself. I could be playing well, but the team might not and you won\u2019t hear as much about it, but it\u2019s because the team is doing so well that you hear my name a bit more.\u201d It also earned her a call-up to train with Phil Neville\u2019s Lionesses during the international break. \u201cI\u2019m at my happiest really. I feel like there\u2019s no pressure on me. I\u2019m just being free. Willie Kirk [the Everton manager] has been great with me for that,\u201d she says. \u201cWillie said to me I\u2019m still playing at 70%. At the moment I\u2019m doing well, but there\u2019s more to come.\u201d Kelly credits clever recruitment and the togetherness of the team as key components in Everton\u2019s change in fortunes. \u201cThe balance of the team is great. The staff did a great job in recruiting not just good players, but great people to be around and that helps the team dynamics. There\u2019s a more competitive side to us this year, every day you know that if you\u2019re not performing, someone else is and they\u2019ll take your shirt straight off you.\u201d They are full of confidence, and resilient after rebounding from back-to-back league defeats with victory against Brighton, but there is no room for complacency in an increasingly tough league. \u201cWe can\u2019t ever slip off,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThe league is competitive and anyone can get the three points any weekend so it\u2019s just about performing. There\u2019s no game that you go in thinking that\u2019s an easy three points, but that\u2019s the way it should be and it helps women football grow. It\u2019s an exciting time, the WSL is pushing on.\u201d",

During National Security Council meetings last month and internal discussions, Patel, backed by several other ministers including defence secretary Ben Wallace, objected to the extraction of British children from the war-ravaged country, sources say. Their opposition meant that a discussed late October rescue operation was abandoned at the last minute because Patel, Wallace and chancellor Sajid Javid felt the children posed \u201csecurity concerns\u201d. More than 60 British minors, including at least three orphans, had been identified, and a quick and safe route identified to take them out of north-east Syria and then to Erbil, Iraq, where they would be flown home direct to the UK. It has also emerged that not only had the extraction plan been prepared but that a number of councils in the UK had offered the care package and reintegration programme necessary for the children following their arrival in the UK. The charity Save the Children, which has officials working in north-east Syria, described the resistance from ministers such as Patel as \u201cgrievous irresponsibility\u201d and said that \u201cplaying politics\u201d with children\u2019s lives was unacceptable.

      "body": "<p>The author Bill Bryson is sitting before a lectern in Audible\u2019s London headquarters, narrating his latest book, a disquisition on human biology called The Body: A Guide For Occupants. Seen through the window of the recording booth, Bryson\u2019s face is largely obscured by the microphone in front of him, but his voice is clear and measured. On the other side of the glass, Bryson\u2019s producer follows the text on an iPad, adding cryptic marks to the margins with a stylus.</p> <p>Bryson makes steady progress until he runs into the word glomerulonephritis, which he can\u2019t get his tongue around. He backs up to the beginning of the sentence, as if preparing to charge at a thicket, but when he reaches the word it defeats him again. \u201cFucking hell,\u201d he says, under his breath.</p> <p>Bryson\u2019s audiobook experience goes back 20 years, when he was living in New Hampshire and the nearest recording studio was in the neighbouring state of Vermont. \u201cNow I\u2019ve probably worked with five or six producers,\u201d he says, \u201cand they\u2019re all really kind, and they\u2019re always very encouraging, but I can\u2019t help feel that I should be better at this, that I should be able to pronounce the words in my own book.\u201d Does he not realise by now that when he commits a word like glomerulonephritis to print, he will eventually have to record it? \u201cYou would think so, but no,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re writing \u2013 you don\u2019t think about anything, really, except trying to get words right to yourself on the page.\u201d</p> <p>In the two decades since Bryson recorded his first narration, the audiobook market has grown from a publishing industry side hustle into a huge global business. In a climate where print and ebook sales are stagnant, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/26/new-chapter-uk-print-book-sales-fall-while-audiobooks-surge-43\" title=\"\">the</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/26/new-chapter-uk-print-book-sales-fall-while-audiobooks-surge-43\" title=\"\"> UK audiobook market rose</a> to \u00a369m in 2018, an increase of 43% on the previous year. In the US, audiobook downloads generate revenue of <a href=\"https://publishingperspectives.com/2019/07/audio-publishers-association-survey-nearly-1-billion-in-2018-sales/\" title=\"\">close to a billion dollars annually</a>. This growth has largely been driven by the rise of Audible, the Amazon-owned platform that dominates the digital audiobook market through its subscription streaming service, though there are other players, including Storytel, which operates largely in Scandinavian countries. In the 1990s, before the iPod was launched, Audible was selling a proprietary digital media player that held about two hours of audio downloaded from its online library. Today, Audible\u2019s catalogue contains more than 400,000 titles; in 2018, its members downloaded nearly three billion hours of content.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019ve got to stay still. Any movement creates extraneous noise: fabric rustling, chair creaking, foot tapping\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while technology has transformed the industry, it still relies on an army of audiobook narrators to meet the demand. \u201cI\u2019m so impressed with professional readers,\u201d says Bryson, \u201cthe Martin Jarvises of this world, or people like Stephen Fry, who can really bring extra dimensions to it.\u201d</p> <p>The real professionals, however, are people you might not have heard of. In the US, 81-year-old actor George Guidall is considered narration\u2019s undisputed heavyweight champion: his baritone voice has graced more than 1,300 audiobook recordings, including works by Dostoevsky, Jonathan Franzen and Stephen King. Some of the biggest British voices in audiobooks belong to faces you might not recognise, but may well have seen \u2013 on stage, on Coronation Street, or in any number of Carry On films.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Narration may sound like an easy way to make money \u2013 you just sit there and read \u2013 but I can assure you, it isn\u2019t. I narrated my own audiobook in 2014, an experience that I described at the time as being akin to an exorcism: three long days in a dark room, tripping through the minefield of my own words. All I could think was: if I\u2019d known I was going to have to say this whole book out loud, I would have written a better one. Or maybe I wouldn\u2019t have written one at all.</p> <p>I\u2019ve done two more audiobooks since \u2013 most recently, last spring \u2013 with the gently increasing confidence that comes of never, ever listening back to previous recordings. The first time, I agreed to the challenge only because I was assured it was not unusual for a first-person, non-fiction book to be read by its inexperienced author. But I never met anyone else like that in my three days at the studio. I met only professionals.</p> <p>Clare Corbett isn\u2019t sure, but she thinks she\u2019s narrated about 300 audiobooks since she left drama school to join the BBC\u2019s Radio Drama Company. \u201cThat started my passion for radio, and for mic stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I went into TV and theatre, and [audiobooks] just carried alongside it, beautifully.\u201d She was one of three narrators of The Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins (the book itself features alternating narrations), which won an Audie award for best audiobook in 2016. More recently she narrated Flights, The Man Booker international prize winner by Polish author \u2013 and now Nobel prize winner \u2013 Olga Tokarczuk. \u201cApproaching that was very difficult,\u201d says Corbett. \u201cThere was Russian and Polish language in it, and Russian, Polish and Croatian pronunciations.\u201d In the end, she contacted some other women from her local area who spoke the languages and could guide her through the pronunciations. \u201cI\u2019m meeting my community at the same time,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Most professional readers are also trained actors \u2013 as early as 2013, Audible\u2019s founder Donald Katz was claiming his company was probably the largest single employer of actors in the New York area \u2013 but narration comes with its own peculiar constraints. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is, you\u2019ve got to stay still,\u201d says Corbett. \u201cWhen I first started, I was very animated. I was told to stop.\u201d Any movement in the booth creates extraneous noise: fabric rustling, chair creaking, foot tapping.

Like a lot of readers, she combines audiobook narration with acting work, though not, if she can help it, at the same time. \u201cI did do one, when I was doing a show in town,\u201d she says. \u201cThis box arrived at the stage door; it was the paperback version of the book, which was about 800 pages long.\u201d The book \u2013 Citadel, by Kate Mosse \u2013 is actually 976 pages in paperback. \u201cIt had Latin in it,\u201d says Williams. \u201cAnd German and Spanish and Medieval French. So I spent a whole day doing that, and then I went to the theatre, did the play and went home. I woke up the next morning and burst into tears and said, \u2018Please don\u2019t send me back!\u2019 But we did get it finished.\u201d</p> <p>Some drama schools offer audiobook workshops, but most narrators had to develop their own techniques as they went along. Jim Dale, the veteran stage actor and star of 10 Carry On films, began his narration career at the deep end, in 1999. \u201cThe audiobook company were looking for an actor, preferably an English actor, who would be capable of creating voices for at least 30 different characters,\u201d he says, speaking on the phone from New York. The book was the first in the Harry Potter series, and Dale went on to narrate all seven instalments, winning two spoken word Grammys (Stephen Fry narrates the books in the UK, also in multiple voices, but the US audio rights are held separately). On his first day, however, Dale struggled.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The final Harry Potter has 143 characters. The narrator drew on voices from comics, his aunt, a man he heard in a lift</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was very unnerving,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter fluffing just the title a few times, I recorded the first 10 pages, and after a coffee break the editor said, \u2018We have to ask you to record the first sentence again.\u2019\u201d When he heard the playback, Dale was mortified by how it sounded. \u201cI said, \u2018Please can we record all 10 pages again?\u2019 They said no \u2013 there\u2019s no time.\u201d Dale learned something important that day: audiobook recording runs to a tight schedule. \u201cIn film and television you can have 10, 20 takes,\u201d he says. \u201cIn audiobook recording it\u2019s take one \u2013 you keep recording until you make a mistake.\u201d Good narrators inhabit characters and engage listeners, but they also get through 100 pages of text a day.</p> <p>Dale developed his own system for keeping track of different voices. \u201cWhen I come across a new character, I tend to record their first sentence on a small tape recorder. Then I make a note of it on a pad, together with the number of the page and the name of the character, so that when I\u2019m recording and I get to that new character, I stop everything and I play the tape back.\u201d In the final Harry Potter book, there were 143 characters: the voices, says Dale, were drawn from his past, from old radio comedians to his Scottish aunt. Dobbie he recalled from a crowded department store lift. \u201cI heard this little voice behind me saying, \u2018Excuse me sir, could you take your bum out of my face?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Other readers have their own version of Dale\u2019s system. \u201cFor fiction, I\u2019ll mark up all the characters\u2019 speeches, so it becomes like a script for me,\u201d says Tania Rodrigues, who is the voice of, among other books, Kamila Shamsie\u2019s Home Fire (her TV credits include EastEnders, Doctors and Holby City). \u201cI colour code them so when you\u2019ve got conversations you know who\u2019s speaking when.\u201d It transpires that Rodrigues and I have met once before, when I was doing my first audiobook and she was narrating a popular fantasy fiction book series. She spoke about the challenges of maintaining the narrative drive while keeping the characters\u2019 voices distinct; I told her I couldn\u2019t even do my own voice.</p> <p>Rodrigues says that, over 17 years of narration, she\u2019s learned to remember \u201cthe fact that you are literally in someone\u2019s ear. You don\u2019t have to do any kind of crazy projection.\u201d As a performance, Rodrigues says an audiobook is \u201cactually quite a treat, because you get to play all the parts. You get to be cast as characters you\u2019d never normally get cast as.\u201d At the same time, a certain restraint is key. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve been learning is when not to disturb the listener by putting too much of my own imposition on something. I\u2019d never randomly give someone a Birmingham accent if it wasn\u2019t in there.\u201d</p> <p>Corbett also admits to treading very carefully around accents. \u201cMost of them I can do, but Geordie is always one I have to make sure I get right, because there are lots of Geordies out there who\u2019ll say, \u2018That\u2019s not how you do it\u2019. I\u2019m from Bristol originally, so sometimes I get Bristolian books.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f3c88ca36bf7ab8772e03fa077b818e511a2a40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f3c88ca36bf7ab8772e03fa077b818e511a2a40/0_0_6388_4259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photographs of famous actors reading for Audible audiobooks, on the wall at the company's studio in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wall of fame at Audible\u2019s studio in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pairing of narrator and text is a very specific kind of casting. \u201cThe most fun bit of my job is getting to cast things, and there are lots of considerations,\u201d says Fionnuala Barrett, editorial director of audio at HarperCollins. Research suggests that for newcomers to audiobooks, the quality of the narration is central to the success of their first experience. \u201cIf that is not the voice of Lizzie Bennet as far as you\u2019re concerned, you\u2019ll just throw in the towel,\u201d Barrett says. The right narrator, on the other hand, can lead a listener to other authors. \u201cThere are definitely people with a following.\u201d She mentions Cathleen McCarron, who read the bestseller Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, and is currently one of Audible\u2019s highest-rated narrators.</p> <p>Patch McQuaid, who founded iD Audio 20 years ago and produces audiobooks for big publishers, including HarperCollins and Penguin Random House, says that casting often comes down to the quality of the voice itself. \u201cSome people just sound good,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have the right lilt and cadence, and all that stuff.\u201d Williams, who graces several top 10 lists of audiobook narrators, is pleased to hear that her voice has been described as \u201clightly gravelled\u201d. \u201cLike a driveway!\u201d she says. \u201cIronically at drama school I was told I didn\u2019t have a voice conducive for radio.\u201d</p> <p>Audiobook narration may sound effortless when you listen to it on headphones in the park, but sitting in a booth watching Olivia Dowd read The Lost Ones by Anita Frank, it suddenly seems nothing short of extraordinary. Dowd, who this year played Macbeth in the National Youth Theatre\u2019s gender-fluid Shakespeare adaptation, shifts seamlessly from one character to another, and then back to a more understated narrative voice, with barely a mistake in a whole chapter \u2013 she stops only to check the pronunciation of \u201cantimacassar\u201d. I notice her text is unannotated. How does she keep track? \u201cYou just sort of remember: oh, this bit\u2019s coming up,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re always scanning ahead, like you might do if you\u2019re skim-reading.\u201d</p> <p>Most narrators spend at least as long in preparation as they will in the studio: it\u2019s in their interest, because they get paid per recorded hour. But not everyone is so conscientious. McQuaid once got a call from one of his engineers several days into a session. \u201cHe said, \u2018We just got to page 380, and it mentions the fact that he\u2019s got this terrible stutter.\u2019 The actor hadn\u2019t read it [in advance]. Everybody\u2019s got a story like that.\u201d He\u2019s right: everybody I speak to does have a story like that: tales in which Australian or Irish accents weren\u2019t revealed until the final chapter, or place names were mispronounced repeatedly over hundreds of pages. One mentioned a well-known actor who turned up to the studio on the first morning, clapped his hands together and said, \u201cSo! What are we reading today?\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, for reasons of authenticity, the best person to narrate a book is its author, although authenticity is itself a slippery notion. Dani Dyer is the only imaginable narrator for her book What Would Dani Do? My Guide To Living Your Best Life, even if she didn\u2019t actually write it (in the print version, she thanks the ghostwriter). Generally, though, the author\u2019s familiarity with the text is considered a plus \u2013 if she isn\u2019t prepared, who is? Unique among narrators, authors can adjust the text there and then. \u201cThat\u2019s the only person you need to consult,\u201d says Barrett. \u201cIf you just can\u2019t get \u2018necessitous\u2019 out, and the author\u2019s happy with it, you can go for \u2018needy\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2ed2171123122c33a85429fbd5a747550ec7f245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ed2171123122c33a85429fbd5a747550ec7f245/0_195_6132_4285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Bill Bryson sitting by a mic at the Audible audiobook studio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Bryson: \u2018I can\u2019t help feel I should be able to pronounce the words in my own book.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But an untrained reader is a risk and, in my experience, no one ever asks you if you might struggle. They find that out within an hour of you showing up for the gig. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not even an hour in,\u201d says McQuaid, who shepherded me through my inaugural narration. \u201cIt\u2019s 25 seconds in.\u201d He tells me a story about John Bird, the founder of The Big Issue and a highly regarded public speaker. \u201cHe came in to do a short book,\u201d he says. \u201cHe started, and about four lines down \u2013 after he\u2019d done them 10 times \u2013 he just put it down and said, \u2018Shall we get some other cunt to do this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The audiobook has a history that predates even the technology to make it possible. In The Untold Story Of The Talking Book, author Matthew Rubery points out that 19th-century utopian literature repeatedly described a future in which books recorded on wax cylinders would save mankind from the drudgery \u2013 and eyestrain \u2013 of reading.</p> <p>An 1894 article in Scribner\u2019s magazine, titled The End Of Books, envisaged wearable phonographic devices with tubes connected to the listener\u2019s ears, and predicted that \u201cauthors who are not sensitive to vocal harmonies, or who lack the flexibility of voice necessary to a fine utterance, will avail themselves of the services of hired actors or singers to warehouse their work\u201d.</p> <p>It was not until the 1930s that the National Institute for the Blind (now the RNIB) began producing book-length narrations on shellac discs, predominantly for soldiers who were blinded during the first world war. From its inception, the talking book faced a lot of the same questions over its relationship to text that audiobooks do today. Does listening to a book count as reading it? How should narration best serve the written word? Is it documentation, recitation, or performance? \u201cBack in the 30s and 40s, stylistically you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s a really dry read,\u201d says Daryl Chapman, the RNIB studio manager. \u201cThere\u2019s very little characterisation from the narrator.\u201d</p> <p>Rodrigues recorded her first book \u2013 Brick Lane by Monica Ali \u2013 for the RNIB in 2003. \u201cAt that time they were pretty much the only people doing audiobooks, and the books used to come on actual cassette tapes,\u201d she says. In the US, unabridged recordings had already found a market: bored long-haul commuters. But in the UK, most publishers assumed it wasn\u2019t something the non-visually impaired public would be interested in. \u201cThe analogy that people would use is, the market for this is somebody who is driving along the M4,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cWhen he puts in his cassette in London, he wants the story to be finished by the time he gets out in Swindon.\u201d</p> <p>According to Barrett, the last decade\u2019s audiobook explosion has been largely driven by tech-adopting young men, not traditionally a big demographic for publishers. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t see themselves as book buyers, so they wouldn\u2019t be in Waterstones necessarily, but they would be browsing through the app store.\u201d She mentions Ant Middleton, the former soldier and presenter of SAS: Who Dare Wins, whose self-narrated audiobooks are big sellers. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Ant really spoke to that audience in particular.\u201d</p> <p>Audiobooks may constitute a publishing revolution, but they remain a low-margin product, with a large chunk of the profits going to Audible. \u201cPeople do slag them off, including me,\u201d says McQuaid. \u201cBut without them this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d On top of its profit share, Audible is increasingly securing audiobook rights directly from authors (as it has done with Bill Bryson\u2019s audiobook outside the US), and producing its own recordings.</p> <p>One of the major trends is the casting of big names, even multiple big names, to read fiction. The audiobook of George Saunders\u2019 Lincoln In The Bardo has a star-studded cast of 166 voices, including Ben Stiller, Susan Sarandon, Julianne Moore and the author himself. Audible is now pairing stars with popular classics \u2013 Andrew Scott reading Beatrix Potter, Rosamund Pike doing Pride And Prejudice \u2013 and publishers are following suit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/05/hear-this-the-best-audiobooks-of-2019-so-far\">Hear this! The best audiobooks of 2019 \u2013 so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re casting them for the right reasons, then a big name is brilliant,\u201d says Barrett, who got Kenneth Branagh to narrate Murder On The Orient Express. \u201cHe was the new Poirot. He was director of the film. Those were good reasons and he did a fantastic job.\u201d But a celebrity narrator can present as many challenges as a first-time author. \u201cI have had other experiences,\u201d says Barrett, \u201cwhere wiser heads such as mine did not prevail, and we went with a starrier casting.\u201d She will not be drawn further. \u201cYou have to live with your recording for a long time,\u201d is all she says.</p> <p>Above all, a celebrity may not be prepared for what an exhausting experience recording is. Williams says, until you\u2019ve voiced an audiobook, you can\u2019t understand \u201chow utterly poleaxed you feel by the end of the day. Your throat hurts. Your back hurts. Your legs hurt. Your brain hurts.\u201d Everyone I speak to agrees that it\u2019s also a lonely business, listening to your own voice all day, with only the occasional interruption from someone telling you you\u2019ve made a mistake. Everyone, that is, except Bryson.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s exactly the opposite,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cWriting is the really lonely bit\u2026 This is getting me out in the world. You get up to make a cup of tea and there\u2019s people all around. When I come in in the morning, it feels like I have a job to go to.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Dench has narrated several audiobooks.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The author Bill Bryson is sitting before a lectern in Audible\u2019s London headquarters, narrating his latest book, a disquisition on human biology called The Body: A Guide For Occupants. Seen through the window of the recording booth, Bryson\u2019s face is largely obscured by the microphone in front of him, but his voice is clear and measured. On the other side of the glass, Bryson\u2019s producer follows the text on an iPad, adding cryptic marks to the margins with a stylus. Bryson makes steady progress until he runs into the word glomerulonephritis, which he can\u2019t get his tongue around. He backs up to the beginning of the sentence, as if preparing to charge at a thicket, but when he reaches the word it defeats him again. \u201cFucking hell,\u201d he says, under his breath. Bryson\u2019s audiobook experience goes back 20 years, when he was living in New Hampshire and the nearest recording studio was in the neighbouring state of Vermont. \u201cNow I\u2019ve probably worked with five or six producers,\u201d he says, \u201cand they\u2019re all really kind, and they\u2019re always very encouraging, but I can\u2019t help feel that I should be better at this, that I should be able to pronounce the words in my own book.\u201d Does he not realise by now that when he commits a word like glomerulonephritis to print, he will eventually have to record it? \u201cYou would think so, but no,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re writing \u2013 you don\u2019t think about anything, really, except trying to get words right to yourself on the page.\u201d In the two decades since Bryson recorded his first narration, the audiobook market has grown from a publishing industry side hustle into a huge global business. In a climate where print and ebook sales are stagnant, the UK audiobook market rose to \u00a369m in 2018, an increase of 43% on the previous year. In the US, audiobook downloads generate revenue of close to a billion dollars annually. This growth has largely been driven by the rise of Audible, the Amazon-owned platform that dominates the digital audiobook market through its subscription streaming service, though there are other players, including Storytel, which operates largely in Scandinavian countries. In the 1990s, before the iPod was launched, Audible was selling a proprietary digital media player that held about two hours of audio downloaded from its online library. Today, Audible\u2019s catalogue contains more than 400,000 titles; in 2018, its members downloaded nearly three billion hours of content. But while technology has transformed the industry, it still relies on an army of audiobook narrators to meet the demand. \u201cI\u2019m so impressed with professional readers,\u201d says Bryson, \u201cthe Martin Jarvises of this world, or people like Stephen Fry, who can really bring extra dimensions to it.\u201d The real professionals, however, are people you might not have heard of. In the US, 81-year-old actor George Guidall is considered narration\u2019s undisputed heavyweight champion: his baritone voice has graced more than 1,300 audiobook recordings, including works by Dostoevsky, Jonathan Franzen and Stephen King. Some of the biggest British voices in audiobooks belong to faces you might not recognise, but may well have seen \u2013 on stage, on Coronation Street, or in any number of Carry On films. *** Narration may sound like an easy way to make money \u2013 you just sit there and read \u2013 but I can assure you, it isn\u2019t. I narrated my own audiobook in 2014, an experience that I described at the time as being akin to an exorcism: three long days in a dark room, tripping through the minefield of my own words. All I could think was: if I\u2019d known I was going to have to say this whole book out loud, I would have written a better one. Or maybe I wouldn\u2019t have written one at all. I\u2019ve done two more audiobooks since \u2013 most recently, last spring \u2013 with the gently increasing confidence that comes of never, ever listening back to previous recordings. The first time, I agreed to the challenge only because I was assured it was not unusual for a first-person, non-fiction book to be read by its inexperienced author. But I never met anyone else like that in my three days at the studio. I met only professionals. Clare Corbett isn\u2019t sure, but she thinks she\u2019s narrated about 300 audiobooks since she left drama school to join the BBC\u2019s Radio Drama Company. \u201cThat started my passion for radio, and for mic stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I went into TV and theatre, and [audiobooks] just carried alongside it, beautifully.\u201d She was one of three narrators of The Girl On The Train by Paula Hawkins (the book itself features alternating narrations), which won an Audie award for best audiobook in 2016. More recently she narrated Flights, The Man Booker international prize winner by Polish author \u2013 and now Nobel prize winner \u2013 Olga Tokarczuk. \u201cApproaching that was very difficult,\u201d says Corbett. \u201cThere was Russian and Polish language in it, and Russian, Polish and Croatian pronunciations.\u201d In the end, she contacted some other women from her local area who spoke the languages and could guide her through the pronunciations. \u201cI\u2019m meeting my community at the same time,\u201d she says. Most professional readers are also trained actors \u2013 as early as 2013, Audible\u2019s founder Donald Katz was claiming his company was probably the largest single employer of actors in the New York area \u2013 but narration comes with its own peculiar constraints. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is, you\u2019ve got to stay still,\u201d says Corbett. \u201cWhen I first started, I was very animated. I was told to stop.\u201d Any movement in the booth creates extraneous noise: fabric rustling, chair creaking, foot tapping. Before the introduction of the iPad, even the turning of pages was an editing headache. Beyond keeping still, there are other considerations. \u201cIf you\u2019re narrating in the first person, I find it\u2019s much more like doing TV or theatre,\u201d says Corbett. \u201cYou can enter into it as if you are that character.\u201d If, however, the book has a neutral, third person narrator and several speaking characters, reading becomes a complex mix of acting and storytelling, requiring tremendous concentration and plenty of preparation. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good actor it doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019re going to be a good narrator,\u201d Corbett says. Finty Williams, who has been reading audiobooks for about 18 years, agrees that narration is a discipline distinct from acting. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with rhythm, and understanding how we naturally speak,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we get to the middle of a paragraph we speak slightly quicker, and then we tend to slow down.\u201d While experience helps, she\u2019s not sure it can be taught. \u201cIt\u2019s a knack,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a knack that my mother doesn\u2019t have.\u201d If her eyes contain a flicker of irony as she says this, it\u2019s because her mother is Dame Judi Dench. \u201cThe only audiobook she ever did she had to leave after the first day, because she couldn\u2019t string two sentences together,\u201d says Williams [see footnote]. \u201cIt\u2019s about the only thing she can\u2019t do.\u201d I meet Williams a few days after her run in Night Of The Iguana in London\u2019s West End. Like a lot of readers, she combines audiobook narration with acting work, though not, if she can help it, at the same time. \u201cI did do one, when I was doing a show in town,\u201d she says. \u201cThis box arrived at the stage door; it was the paperback version of the book, which was about 800 pages long.\u201d The book \u2013 Citadel, by Kate Mosse \u2013 is actually 976 pages in paperback. \u201cIt had Latin in it,\u201d says Williams. \u201cAnd German and Spanish and Medieval French. So I spent a whole day doing that, and then I went to the theatre, did the play and went home. I woke up the next morning and burst into tears and said, \u2018Please don\u2019t send me back!\u2019 But we did get it finished.\u201d Some drama schools offer audiobook workshops, but most narrators had to develop their own techniques as they went along. Jim Dale, the veteran stage actor and star of 10 Carry On films, began his narration career at the deep end, in 1999. \u201cThe audiobook company were looking for an actor, preferably an English actor, who would be capable of creating voices for at least 30 different characters,\u201d he says, speaking on the phone from New York. The book was the first in the Harry Potter series, and Dale went on to narrate all seven instalments, winning two spoken word Grammys (Stephen Fry narrates the books in the UK, also in multiple voices, but the US audio rights are held separately). On his first day, however, Dale struggled. \u201cIt was very unnerving,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter fluffing just the title a few times, I recorded the first 10 pages, and after a coffee break the editor said, \u2018We have to ask you to record the first sentence again.\u2019\u201d When he heard the playback, Dale was mortified by how it sounded. \u201cI said, \u2018Please can we record all 10 pages again?\u2019 They said no \u2013 there\u2019s no time.\u201d Dale learned something important that day: audiobook recording runs to a tight schedule. \u201cIn film and television you can have 10, 20 takes,\u201d he says. \u201cIn audiobook recording it\u2019s take one \u2013 you keep recording until you make a mistake.\u201d Good narrators inhabit characters and engage listeners, but they also get through 100 pages of text a day. Dale developed his own system for keeping track of different voices. \u201cWhen I come across a new character, I tend to record their first sentence on a small tape recorder. Then I make a note of it on a pad, together with the number of the page and the name of the character, so that when I\u2019m recording and I get to that new character, I stop everything and I play the tape back.\u201d In the final Harry Potter book, there were 143 characters: the voices, says Dale, were drawn from his past, from old radio comedians to his Scottish aunt. Dobbie he recalled from a crowded department store lift. \u201cI heard this little voice behind me saying, \u2018Excuse me sir, could you take your bum out of my face?\u2019\u201d Other readers have their own version of Dale\u2019s system. \u201cFor fiction, I\u2019ll mark up all the characters\u2019 speeches, so it becomes like a script for me,\u201d says Tania Rodrigues, who is the voice of, among other books, Kamila Shamsie\u2019s Home Fire (her TV credits include EastEnders, Doctors and Holby City). \u201cI colour code them so when you\u2019ve got conversations you know who\u2019s speaking when.\u201d It transpires that Rodrigues and I have met once before, when I was doing my first audiobook and she was narrating a popular fantasy fiction book series. She spoke about the challenges of maintaining the narrative drive while keeping the characters\u2019 voices distinct; I told her I couldn\u2019t even do my own voice. Rodrigues says that, over 17 years of narration, she\u2019s learned to remember \u201cthe fact that you are literally in someone\u2019s ear. You don\u2019t have to do any kind of crazy projection.\u201d As a performance, Rodrigues says an audiobook is \u201cactually quite a treat, because you get to play all the parts. You get to be cast as characters you\u2019d never normally get cast as.\u201d At the same time, a certain restraint is key. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve been learning is when not to disturb the listener by putting too much of my own imposition on something. I\u2019d never randomly give someone a Birmingham accent if it wasn\u2019t in there.\u201d Corbett also admits to treading very carefully around accents. \u201cMost of them I can do, but Geordie is always one I have to make sure I get right, because there are lots of Geordies out there who\u2019ll say, \u2018That\u2019s not how you do it\u2019. I\u2019m from Bristol originally, so sometimes I get Bristolian books.\u201d The pairing of narrator and text is a very specific kind of casting. \u201cThe most fun bit of my job is getting to cast things, and there are lots of considerations,\u201d says Fionnuala Barrett, editorial director of audio at HarperCollins. Research suggests that for newcomers to audiobooks, the quality of the narration is central to the success of their first experience. \u201cIf that is not the voice of Lizzie Bennet as far as you\u2019re concerned, you\u2019ll just throw in the towel,\u201d Barrett says. The right narrator, on the other hand, can lead a listener to other authors. \u201cThere are definitely people with a following.\u201d She mentions Cathleen McCarron, who read the bestseller Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, and is currently one of Audible\u2019s highest-rated narrators. Patch McQuaid, who founded iD Audio 20 years ago and produces audiobooks for big publishers, including HarperCollins and Penguin Random House, says that casting often comes down to the quality of the voice itself. \u201cSome people just sound good,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have the right lilt and cadence, and all that stuff.\u201d Williams, who graces several top 10 lists of audiobook narrators, is pleased to hear that her voice has been described as \u201clightly gravelled\u201d. \u201cLike a driveway!\u201d she says. \u201cIronically at drama school I was told I didn\u2019t have a voice conducive for radio.\u201d Audiobook narration may sound effortless when you listen to it on headphones in the park, but sitting in a booth watching Olivia Dowd read The Lost Ones by Anita Frank, it suddenly seems nothing short of extraordinary. Dowd, who this year played Macbeth in the National Youth Theatre\u2019s gender-fluid Shakespeare adaptation, shifts seamlessly from one character to another, and then back to a more understated narrative voice, with barely a mistake in a whole chapter \u2013 she stops only to check the pronunciation of \u201cantimacassar\u201d. I notice her text is unannotated. How does she keep track? \u201cYou just sort of remember: oh, this bit\u2019s coming up,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re always scanning ahead, like you might do if you\u2019re skim-reading.\u201d Most narrators spend at least as long in preparation as they will in the studio: it\u2019s in their interest, because they get paid per recorded hour. But not everyone is so conscientious. McQuaid once got a call from one of his engineers several days into a session. \u201cHe said, \u2018We just got to page 380, and it mentions the fact that he\u2019s got this terrible stutter.\u2019 The actor hadn\u2019t read it [in advance]. Everybody\u2019s got a story like that.\u201d He\u2019s right: everybody I speak to does have a story like that: tales in which Australian or Irish accents weren\u2019t revealed until the final chapter, or place names were mispronounced repeatedly over hundreds of pages. One mentioned a well-known actor who turned up to the studio on the first morning, clapped his hands together and said, \u201cSo! What are we reading today?\u201d Sometimes, for reasons of authenticity, the best person to narrate a book is its author, although authenticity is itself a slippery notion. Dani Dyer is the only imaginable narrator for her book What Would Dani Do? My Guide To Living Your Best Life, even if she didn\u2019t actually write it (in the print version, she thanks the ghostwriter). Generally, though, the author\u2019s familiarity with the text is considered a plus \u2013 if she isn\u2019t prepared, who is? Unique among narrators, authors can adjust the text there and then. \u201cThat\u2019s the only person you need to consult,\u201d says Barrett. \u201cIf you just can\u2019t get \u2018necessitous\u2019 out, and the author\u2019s happy with it, you can go for \u2018needy\u2019.\u201d But an untrained reader is a risk and, in my experience, no one ever asks you if you might struggle. They find that out within an hour of you showing up for the gig. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not even an hour in,\u201d says McQuaid, who shepherded me through my inaugural narration. \u201cIt\u2019s 25 seconds in.\u201d He tells me a story about John Bird, the founder of The Big Issue and a highly regarded public speaker. \u201cHe came in to do a short book,\u201d he says. \u201cHe started, and about four lines down \u2013 after he\u2019d done them 10 times \u2013 he just put it down and said, \u2018Shall we get some other cunt to do this?\u2019\u201d *** The audiobook has a history that predates even the technology to make it possible. In The Untold Story Of The Talking Book, author Matthew Rubery points out that 19th-century utopian literature repeatedly described a future in which books recorded on wax cylinders would save mankind from the drudgery \u2013 and eyestrain \u2013 of reading. An 1894 article in Scribner\u2019s magazine, titled The End Of Books, envisaged wearable phonographic devices with tubes connected to the listener\u2019s ears, and predicted that \u201cauthors who are not sensitive to vocal harmonies, or who lack the flexibility of voice necessary to a fine utterance, will avail themselves of the services of hired actors or singers to warehouse their work\u201d. It was not until the 1930s that the National Institute for the Blind (now the RNIB) began producing book-length narrations on shellac discs, predominantly for soldiers who were blinded during the first world war. From its inception, the talking book faced a lot of the same questions over its relationship to text that audiobooks do today. Does listening to a book count as reading it? How should narration best serve the written word? Is it documentation, recitation, or performance? \u201cBack in the 30s and 40s, stylistically you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s a really dry read,\u201d says Daryl Chapman, the RNIB studio manager. \u201cThere\u2019s very little characterisation from the narrator.\u201d Rodrigues recorded her first book \u2013 Brick Lane by Monica Ali \u2013 for the RNIB in 2003. \u201cAt that time they were pretty much the only people doing audiobooks, and the books used to come on actual cassette tapes,\u201d she says. In the US, unabridged recordings had already found a market: bored long-haul commuters. But in the UK, most publishers assumed it wasn\u2019t something the non-visually impaired public would be interested in. \u201cThe analogy that people would use is, the market for this is somebody who is driving along the M4,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cWhen he puts in his cassette in London, he wants the story to be finished by the time he gets out in Swindon.\u201d According to Barrett, the last decade\u2019s audiobook explosion has been largely driven by tech-adopting young men, not traditionally a big demographic for publishers. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t see themselves as book buyers, so they wouldn\u2019t be in Waterstones necessarily, but they would be browsing through the app store.\u201d She mentions Ant Middleton, the former soldier and presenter of SAS: Who Dare Wins, whose self-narrated audiobooks are big sellers. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Ant really spoke to that audience in particular.\u201d Audiobooks may constitute a publishing revolution, but they remain a low-margin product, with a large chunk of the profits going to Audible. \u201cPeople do slag them off, including me,\u201d says McQuaid. \u201cBut without them this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d On top of its profit share, Audible is increasingly securing audiobook rights directly from authors (as it has done with Bill Bryson\u2019s audiobook outside the US), and producing its own recordings. One of the major trends is the casting of big names, even multiple big names, to read fiction. The audiobook of George Saunders\u2019 Lincoln In The Bardo has a star-studded cast of 166 voices, including Ben Stiller, Susan Sarandon, Julianne Moore and the author himself. Audible is now pairing stars with popular classics \u2013 Andrew Scott reading Beatrix Potter, Rosamund Pike doing Pride And Prejudice \u2013 and publishers are following suit. \u201cIf you\u2019re casting them for the right reasons, then a big name is brilliant,\u201d says Barrett, who got Kenneth Branagh to narrate Murder On The Orient Express. \u201cHe was the new Poirot. He was director of the film. Those were good reasons and he did a fantastic job.\u201d But a celebrity narrator can present as many challenges as a first-time author. \u201cI have had other experiences,\u201d says Barrett, \u201cwhere wiser heads such as mine did not prevail, and we went with a starrier casting.\u201d She will not be drawn further. \u201cYou have to live with your recording for a long time,\u201d is all she says. Above all, a celebrity may not be prepared for what an exhausting experience recording is. Williams says, until you\u2019ve voiced an audiobook, you can\u2019t understand \u201chow utterly poleaxed you feel by the end of the day. Your throat hurts. Your back hurts. Your legs hurt. Your brain hurts.\u201d Everyone I speak to agrees that it\u2019s also a lonely business, listening to your own voice all day, with only the occasional interruption from someone telling you you\u2019ve made a mistake. Everyone, that is, except Bryson. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s exactly the opposite,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cWriting is the really lonely bit\u2026 This is getting me out in the world. You get up to make a cup of tea and there\u2019s people all around. When I come in in the morning, it feels like I have a job to go to.\u201d \u2022 Dench has narrated several audiobooks. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Many of these events \u2013 and the awards shows that go with them \u2013 seem fundamentally premised on grift: selling vague statements with no discernible content by people with no discernible authority to young women at vast expense. It can be hard, in these contexts, to see a distinction between badass and asshole, between mannerism and conviction, between what it means to be a badass in the service of some demonstrable end and to be a badass as an end in itself. Would I read Gutsy Women to my daughters? I guess so. And I guess I am, in the broadest sense, raising them to be badass. But the whole thing leaves me cold. At best, badass celebrates outspoken women. At worst, it is a cute, empty performance of power; a verbal karate kick that shades into kitsch. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",

Shape the dough into a ball, transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove until it has doubled in size \u2013 one to two hours. For the filling, mix the butter, sugar and spices to a smooth paste, and set aside. For the apples, pop them in a saucepan with the butter, sugar, salt and spices. Cook on a low-medium heat until the apple pieces are slightly tender. Once the dough has risen, tip it out on to a lightly floured surface, and roll into a 35cm x 25cm rectangle. Spread the spiced butter evenly over the dough with a palette or table knife, and top with the chopped apple and raisins. Starting with the longest edge closest to you, roll the dough into a cylinder, then cut into 12 even slices. Put each roll into the lined muffin tin cut side down, put in a large plastic bag and loosely close. Leave to prove at room temperature for 50 minutes, or until well risen. Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/gas 6. Brush the tops of the buns with beaten egg, bake for 15\u201320 minutes, until dark golden brown, then transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly. While the buns are cooling, put the toffees, double cream and vanilla in a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring constantly, until it forms a smooth sauce. Give each bun a good dousing of sauce, then sprinkle with the granola and a light dusting of icing sugar.",

But after the break the Heat went about putting on an absolute clinic in defending a small total and showed why they are the defending premiers. Jess Jonassen was at her damaging best, taking 4-13 in a performance that stifled first and foremost and took wickets when the chance was there. It was a brilliantly opportunistic display and a well deserved victory. New Zealander Amelia Kerr was awarded player of the match, taking 1-16 and an important 21 not out from 16 balls.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought he wicket was a little bit tough and the outfield was slow, so to get to 128, we knew we could defend it from there,\u201d she said after the match.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HeatBBL/status/1195660940336713730\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">4\u20e3 wins in a row\ud83d\udcaa<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BringTheHeat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BringTheHeat</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WBBL05?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WBBL05</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oAoSLeoTeB\">pic.twitter.com/oAoSLeoTeB</a></p>&mdash; Brisbane Heat (@HeatBBL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatBBL/status/1195660940336713730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 16, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dcfd6728f08eeb483f18a8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-16T11:03:16.422Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>WBBL: </strong>Rene Farrell charges down the wicket and tries to smash one back over Jonassen\u2019s head, but it goes comfortably to Grace Harris for a catch instead.

Newcastle deservedly took the lead after 36 minutes through 19-year-old striker Angus Thurgate and while United grew into the game, they were unable to find a response at GMHBA Stadium on Saturday.</p> <p>United were bolstered by Besart Berisha\u2019s return, while Josh Risdon made it back from international duty in time to start, but Panagiotis Kone was missing with a hamstring injury. In Kone\u2019s absence United struggled to control the midfield, with industrious Newcastle duo Steven Ugarkovic and Ben Kantarovski keeping the Jets ticking over.</p> <p>On a number of occasions the bustling Jets were able to win possession and create a numerical advantage on the counter - only to stumble at the final hurdle with poor decisions going forward. Scott McDonald was impressive for United early, consistently drifting into dangerous positions and creating a couple of good chances while Alessandro Diamanti was typically dynamic on the ball.</p> <p>But Newcastle\u2019s Thurgate came closest to opening the scoring in the 31st minute when his skidding shot just inside the box forced a difficult diving save from Filip Kurto. Five minutes later, it would be Thurgate who broke the deadlock. Matt Millar found Thurgate, who showed some terrific hold-up play to one-touch the ball to Dimi Petratos and continue his run. Petratos fed a well-weighted ball back through to Thurgate, who slid a delightful finish past Kurto for his second career A-League goal.</p> <p>United were better in the second half, with Diamanti consistently threatening to equalise, but he was unable to find the back of the net. Risdon looked to have equalised in the 70th minute when Diamanti cut inside the left flank onto his right foot and sent a curling ball to the back post for the defender to head home, but the goal was ruled out after a VAR review showed Berisha had been offside in the build-up. From there, the Jets would hold on for a gutsy victory.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dcfd29c8f08aab51e1c0359\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-16T10:45:05.488Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>WBBL: </strong>Would you believe it, another LBW from the Heat!

The Mariners were seemingly on their way to an upset on Saturday when Milan Duric converted a penalty in just the fifth minute.</p> <p>But the 5773 crowd in Gosford was left stunned when Nikola Mileusnic, Ben Halloran and Kristian Opseth all scored before halftime. The win means Gertjan Verbeek\u2019s side can finish the round in fourth spot should Sydney FC get beaten soundly on Sunday by Melbourne Victory. For the Mariners, coach Alen Stajcic will go back to the drawing board after his side had allowed their opposition almost double the looks on goal as them.</p> <p>The home side made a bright start when Samuel Silvera latched onto a long header and drew a fifth-minute foul from Michael Marrone inside the box. And while Adelaide gloveman Paul Izzo guessing correctly, Duric drilled his penalty with some height to the left for his third goal of the season.</p> <p>Despite the early setback, the Reds slowly worked their way back into the contest before taking the lead off the back of Michael Maria\u2019s strong play. The Dutch import was the catalyst for Halloran\u2019s leveller, dribbling into the heart of the Mariners defence before finding his opposite winger. Halloran executed a crisp one-two with in-form teammate Riley McGree and beat Mark Birighitti at his near post in the 26th minute.</p> <p>Maria was also pivotal in the go-ahead goal soon after, creating space down the left flank and cutting back for Mileusnic to volley into the top left corner. Halloran delivered the hammer blow moments before halftime, taking advantage of some sloppy defending to cross for an Opseth tap-in. Opseth should\u2019ve made it a double when McGree drew a foul from Giancarlo Gallifuoco in the box in the 58th minute, but his penalty was denied by Birighitti.</p> <p>On a sour note for Adelaide, captain Michael Jakobsen suffered a suspected back injury in the second half.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dcfb1218f08aab51e1c02e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-16T08:23:06.828Z\">8.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>WBBL: </strong>The Sydney Thunder have got off to a great start after a disappointing loss to cross-town rivals the Sixers last night.

But Pakistan struggled to make inroads from that point on, with a 122-run stand between Jonathan Merlo (78) and Matthew Spoors (54no) frustrating the visitors.</p> <p>The CA XI outfit, which features just five players with first-class experience, went to tea on day two at 4-152. Pakistan batsman Imam-ul-Haq went off the field for treatment after jarring his neck while fielding a ball during the morning session. Although the injury didn\u2019t appear serious, he will be monitored ahead of the first Test at the Gabba, starting next Thursday.</p> <p>The mercury soared past 40C on Saturday, and Pakistan made the hottest of starts to the day after declaring on their overnight score. Jake Carder fell for an 18-ball duck when he chopped Abbas onto his stumps. And Jayden Goodwin made just six before he edged Musa behind, leaving the home side in early strife. But the prospect of Pakistan ripping through the rest of the CA XI line-up was thwarted by fighting efforts from Merlo and Spoors. </p> <p>The brave display was in stark contrast to the powerful Australia A outfit who got rolled by Pakistan for 122 at Optus Stadium earlier in the week. That performance sent a powerful message to Australia about the talent of Pakistan\u2019s pace attack, but the visitors weren\u2019t able to back it up with a glut of wickets against the CA XI.</p> <p>Naseem Shah, a 16-year-old who has been likened to Dennis Lillee, unleashed some ferocious bouncers on Saturday but wasn\u2019t able to snare a wicket during the first two sessions. Abbas (2-22 from 14 overs) was excellent, while Musa (1-24 from 10 overs) was economical.</p> <p>Imran Khan, who snared 5-32 against Australia A earlier in the week, and 19-year-old Shaheem Afridi are yet to bowl in the warm-up match, with Pakistan rotating through 15 players. Asad Shafiq\u2019s unbeaten 101 was the highlight of day one, with teenage spinner Lloyd Pope (5-100) also impressing.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dcfa6cf8f083559fb1cc728\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-16T07:38:32.919Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A-League: </strong>Checking in on the game in Gosford now and the score remains at 3-1 to Adelaide.

      "bodyText": "Another big night of sport, a big upset in the A-League and a dominant performance from the defending premiers in the WBBL capped off a fascinating night of sport. Come back tomorrow for plenty of W-League and even more A-League and WBBL as Scott Heinrich takes you through a huge Sunday Sportwatch. The Thunder looked to be on top after the Heat\u2019s innings, as they took regular wickets and restricted the Queenslanders to a small total where no one was able to bring up a big total. But after the break the Heat went about putting on an absolute clinic in defending a small total and showed why they are the defending premiers. Jess Jonassen was at her damaging best, taking 4-13 in a performance that stifled first and foremost and took wickets when the chance was there. It was a brilliantly opportunistic display and a well deserved victory. New Zealander Amelia Kerr was awarded player of the match, taking 1-16 and an important 21 not out from 16 balls. \u201cWe thought he wicket was a little bit tough and the outfield was slow, so to get to 128, we knew we could defend it from there,\u201d she said after the match. WBBL: Rene Farrell charges down the wicket and tries to smash one back over Jonassen\u2019s head, but it goes comfortably to Grace Harris for a catch instead. You can\u2019t blame Farrell for giving it a shot, there\u2019s no point in the Thunder being conservative from here. Thunder are 81-7 and need 48 runs off 17 balls. Meanwhile the Thunder fans have been enjoying the carnival atmosphere, even though their team have been having a tough time on the field tonight. WBBL: Young Phoebe Litchfield hit one too many high balls for the Thunder and Mikayla Hinkley takes the catch off the bowling of Johnson. And then in the very next over, Delissa Kimmince gets Nida Dar for 10 with a great ball. With the required run rate climbing towards 12 it would be a very brave person to predict a Thunder win from here. They\u2019re 76-6 after 15 overs. A-League: Here\u2019s the full match report from Newcastle\u2019s big win over Western United from AAP: Newcastle Jets have delivered a mighty upset to secure their first A-League win of the season, defeating Western United 1-0 in Geelong. Newcastle deservedly took the lead after 36 minutes through 19-year-old striker Angus Thurgate and while United grew into the game, they were unable to find a response at GMHBA Stadium on Saturday. United were bolstered by Besart Berisha\u2019s return, while Josh Risdon made it back from international duty in time to start, but Panagiotis Kone was missing with a hamstring injury. In Kone\u2019s absence United struggled to control the midfield, with industrious Newcastle duo Steven Ugarkovic and Ben Kantarovski keeping the Jets ticking over. On a number of occasions the bustling Jets were able to win possession and create a numerical advantage on the counter - only to stumble at the final hurdle with poor decisions going forward. Scott McDonald was impressive for United early, consistently drifting into dangerous positions and creating a couple of good chances while Alessandro Diamanti was typically dynamic on the ball. But Newcastle\u2019s Thurgate came closest to opening the scoring in the 31st minute when his skidding shot just inside the box forced a difficult diving save from Filip Kurto. Five minutes later, it would be Thurgate who broke the deadlock. Matt Millar found Thurgate, who showed some terrific hold-up play to one-touch the ball to Dimi Petratos and continue his run. Petratos fed a well-weighted ball back through to Thurgate, who slid a delightful finish past Kurto for his second career A-League goal. United were better in the second half, with Diamanti consistently threatening to equalise, but he was unable to find the back of the net. Risdon looked to have equalised in the 70th minute when Diamanti cut inside the left flank onto his right foot and sent a curling ball to the back post for the defender to head home, but the goal was ruled out after a VAR review showed Berisha had been offside in the build-up. From there, the Jets would hold on for a gutsy victory. WBBL: Would you believe it, another LBW from the Heat! This time it\u2019s Jess Jonassen with the big wicket of Alex Blackwell. This is a sensational bowling performance from the Heat. They are just absolutely stifling the Thunder and frustrating them into trying to play shots that aren\u2019t on. It\u2019s a fantastic lesson in how to defend a small total and it\u2019s fascinating to watch. WBBL: Well Tahlia Wilson is gone after another successful LBW shout from the Heat and Amelia Kerr takes the important wicket. Phoebe Litchfield now comes to the crease, can she pull off another big performance to change this game? WBBL: A stifling bowling performance from the Heat has them right back on top in this game. The Thunder are stealing singles here and there but the required run rate is creeping up close to nine runs an over and some acceleration is desperately needed. Tahlia Wilson and Alex Blackwell have the unenviable job of dragging the deficit back in their team\u2019s favour, but both have the strike power to do it if they get going. Thunder are 51-2 after 11 overs. A big win for the Jets, who have been languishing down the bottom of the ladder, to get this important victory over the new kids on the block, who find themselves in second place on the ladder. The first win of the season for the Novacastrians will have them celebrating all the way back over the border. Western United meanwhile will need to regroup and get their heads back in the game before taking on the Central Coast Mariners next week. WBBL: Another wicket for the Heat sees the Thunder captain out for 11. Rachael Haynes was struggling to get her momentum going, striking at only 52, so this may not be the worst news for the Thunder. Georgie Prestwidge again was in the action, taking the wicket after her previous run out. The wicket brings former captain Alex Blackwell to the middle - she has had some good knocks so far this season, so we\u2019ll see if she can dig the Thunder out of this little hole they\u2019re in. They\u2019re 37-2 after eight overs. WBBL: A run out has given the Heat a lift, Georgie Prestwidge did the damage, stopping a boundary and throwing the ball back to find Rachel Priest short of her crease. Tahlia Wilson comes in now - it\u2019s been a slow start for her, but there is plenty of time to take things easy and work into the match before really chipping into this total. Thunder are 23-1 after five overs - Heat were 38-2 at the same point in their innings. A-League: Well it looked like Western United had come through with the equaliser in the 71st minute. Josh Risdon pulled out a beautiful header that evaded the keeper and found the back of the net, but VAR found an offside in the lead up and the score stays at 1-0 to Newcastle. WBBL: It\u2019s a double Rach(a)el start for the Thunder in Drummoyne with Priest and Haynes and it\u2019s a good contest between bat and ball so far. The Heat have mostly kept things tight, but Priest has managed to cut loose and send a few to the boundary. With a low total to chase, it\u2019s not a bad strategy - staying patient and taking the chances when they come. Thunder are 17-0 after three overs. Meanwhile 16-year-old Phoebe Litchfield is having some fun with the cameras in the dug out. A-League: We\u2019re back on in the football and it\u2019s still 1-0 to Newcastle. I realised I\u2019ve been saying the game is happening in Melbourne, but it\u2019s actually Geelong. Same thing, right Victorians? Anyway, since we haven\u2019t had any more scoring action, let\u2019s re-live Thurgate\u2019s first half goal shall we? Rugby league: A clean sweep for Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby tonight, after their women had their first ever Test win, beating England 20-16, the men backed up with a big win over Great Britain, taking the game 28-10. It completed a miserable tour for GB, who finished with no wins from four games. WBBL: Brisbane Heat 128-8 at the innings break Despite regular wickets for the Thunder, the Heat still managed to keep the pressure on, continuing to push the score ahead and refusing to play conservatively. As a result they\u2019ve pulled off a defendable total and Thunder will need to bat a lot better than they did against the Sixers last night to pull off a win. Good death bowling from 17-year-old Hannah Darlington ensured the score didn\u2019t get too out of control, snaring the wicket of Delissa Kimmince with the first ball of the last over. A fascinating Thunder innings awaits us, don\u2019t go anywhere! A-League: Western United 0-1 Newcastle at half-time No more goals in the half and Newcastle will be happy with their lead going into half-time. In a pressure match the slight advantage will multiply as the game goes on. They had another chance close to half-time, but United keeper Filip Kurto was on the ball to hold them out. WBBL: A great catch from Rachel Priest behind the stumps has seen off Heat captain Kirby Short for 11 off the bowling of Samantha Bates. With the Heat into the tail now, it will take a concerted effort to pull off a defendable total in these last three overs. They\u2019re 103-7 after 17 overs. A-League: And it\u2019s Newcastle who break the deadlock first, going up 1-0 in Melbourne. Angus Thurgate did the damage, onrushing Kurto to calmly slot the goal. WBBL: Laura Harris was starting to have a bit of a field day, reverse sweeping for four like nobody\u2019s business. But just as it started to feel like Heat were gaining the ascendancy, in comes Lady Boom Boom with other ideas. Nida Dar smashes middle stump and Harris has to go. The Heat are now 92-6 after 14 overs. A-League: Checking in on the game in Melbourne there is no score as yet between Western United and Newcastle. There is plenty of energy in the game and it looks like the deadlock will be broken at any moment. We\u2019ll keep an eye on proceedings as they unfold. WBBL: What a ball from Shabnim Ismail to dismiss the dangerous Beth Mooney. The commentators noted that it was an interesting call from Thunder captain Rachael Haynes to bowl Ismail out so early in the match, but it was an aggressive move that paid off. Mooney had just been on the mic saying she enjoyed facing Ismail because she liked working with the extra pace. I wonder how she\u2019s feeling about that now? The Heat are now 65-5 after 11 overs. W-League: If the team by team guide wasn\u2019t quite enough to get you jumping around in your seat waiting for the next W-League game, Ella Reily and Samantha Lewis also gave us 10 reasons to get excited about this season. The rise of generation next and the deepening rivalries are two that have really drawn me in, but there are plenty of others in there too. WBBL: And another one gone, Grace Harris must depart for 1 after Alex Blackwell sends the ball speeding back to find Harris desperately short of her crease. She turned blindly and didn\u2019t run with enough hustle to make it back after Beth Mooney was determined to go for two. Her sister Laura Harris now comes in and will try to claw back some momentum for the Heat who are 53-4 after eight overs. WBBL: Another big wicket for the Thunder, Pakistan\u2019s Nida Dar, known to her teammates as \u2018Lady Boom Boom\u2019 grabs the big wicket of Jess Jonassen and Grace Harris is bumped up the order to try to stem the flow of wickets and pile on some runs for the visitors. The Heat are currently 50-3 after seven overs. W-League: Our resident W-League experts, Samantha Lewis and Ella Reilly, got us excited about the start of the competition this week with this cracking team-by-team preview. Check it out and then join Scott Heinrich tomorrow on Sportwatch for a big Sunday of W-League games. WBBL: A huge wicket for the Thunder, with Rene Farrell getting Sammy-Jo Johnson, who had been powering along with 16 off 8. It was a beautiful ball from Farrell, deceiving Johnson to go crashing into the stumps and sending the zing bails flying. Lovely stuff. Side note: I once got Rene Farrell out in pool cricket. I told her at the time that when she was a famous cricketer I would tell everyone about this moment and I have certainly delivered on that. A-League: While we\u2019re waiting for the game between Western United and Newcastle, here\u2019s the full match report on Adelaide\u2019s win over Central Coast. From AAP: Adelaide have reeled off three A-League wins in a row for the first time since their 2015-16 championship after cruising to a 3-1 victory over Central Coast. The Mariners were seemingly on their way to an upset on Saturday when Milan Duric converted a penalty in just the fifth minute. But the 5773 crowd in Gosford was left stunned when Nikola Mileusnic, Ben Halloran and Kristian Opseth all scored before halftime. The win means Gertjan Verbeek\u2019s side can finish the round in fourth spot should Sydney FC get beaten soundly on Sunday by Melbourne Victory. For the Mariners, coach Alen Stajcic will go back to the drawing board after his side had allowed their opposition almost double the looks on goal as them. The home side made a bright start when Samuel Silvera latched onto a long header and drew a fifth-minute foul from Michael Marrone inside the box. And while Adelaide gloveman Paul Izzo guessing correctly, Duric drilled his penalty with some height to the left for his third goal of the season. Despite the early setback, the Reds slowly worked their way back into the contest before taking the lead off the back of Michael Maria\u2019s strong play. The Dutch import was the catalyst for Halloran\u2019s leveller, dribbling into the heart of the Mariners defence before finding his opposite winger. Halloran executed a crisp one-two with in-form teammate Riley McGree and beat Mark Birighitti at his near post in the 26th minute. Maria was also pivotal in the go-ahead goal soon after, creating space down the left flank and cutting back for Mileusnic to volley into the top left corner. Halloran delivered the hammer blow moments before halftime, taking advantage of some sloppy defending to cross for an Opseth tap-in. Opseth should\u2019ve made it a double when McGree drew a foul from Giancarlo Gallifuoco in the box in the 58th minute, but his penalty was denied by Birighitti. On a sour note for Adelaide, captain Michael Jakobsen suffered a suspected back injury in the second half. WBBL: The Sydney Thunder have got off to a great start after a disappointing loss to cross-town rivals the Sixers last night. South African star Shabnim Ismail pulled off a great caught and bowled to dismiss Maddy Green in the first over. Looks like this will be a big game out at Drummoyne tonight. Cricket: Plenty of excitement in the cricket world this week when Katy Perry was announced as the entertainment at women\u2019s T20 World Cup final in Melbourne, to be held on International Women\u2019s Day next year. Though as one commentator on Twitter put it \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t mind only being the second most talented Perry at the game.\u201d Adam Collins took us back to 2009 when the women\u2019s one day World Cup drew a handful of people at North Sydney Oval and reflects how far we\u2019ve come. Thank goodness for that action packed first half because there wasn\u2019t too much happening after the teams returned from the sheds. It was a huge effort for Ben Halloran, who managed to score a goal for Adelaide despite apparently not knowing where he was playing? After he finally figured out the name of the stadium he was in, he seemed quite pleased to have scored his first goal there. \u201cI\u2019m just rapt to get the win and now three wins on the trot for the boys, so we\u2019re stoked,\u201d he said after the game. Rugby league: Yes that\u2019s right, there\u2019s also some rugby league on tonight! Great Britain are attempting to make their southern hemisphere tour a little less miserable in their game against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby. Currently they\u2019re doing an okay job of that, leading 10-0 after 27 minutes, but there is still plenty of time for them to fall in a heap, so we can keep holding on to hope. But more importantly, in the women\u2019s game earlier tonight the PNG Orchids won their first ever rugby league test, defeating England 20-16! If you don\u2019t know much about this amazing team, do yourself a favour and check out Joanna Lester\u2019s film Power Meri - one of the best sports documentaries you will ever watch. Cricket: Everyone\u2019s favourite Australian cricket team, CAXI, have been at it again, putting together a good knock against Pakistan. Things were looking dire for the youngsters early in their innings, but they pulled it back and currently trail by 221 late on day two of their tour match. From AAP: Pakistan\u2019s raw pace attack have been given a wake-up call ahead of the Test series against Australia after struggling to fire against a youth-laden Cricket Australia XI outfit. In reply to Pakistan\u2019s 7(dec)-386, the CA XI were reeling at 2-6 in the two-day tour match at the WACA Ground after Mohammad Abbas and 19-year-old Muhammad Musa struck early in scorching heat on Saturday. But Pakistan struggled to make inroads from that point on, with a 122-run stand between Jonathan Merlo (78) and Matthew Spoors (54no) frustrating the visitors. The CA XI outfit, which features just five players with first-class experience, went to tea on day two at 4-152. Pakistan batsman Imam-ul-Haq went off the field for treatment after jarring his neck while fielding a ball during the morning session. Although the injury didn\u2019t appear serious, he will be monitored ahead of the first Test at the Gabba, starting next Thursday. The mercury soared past 40C on Saturday, and Pakistan made the hottest of starts to the day after declaring on their overnight score. Jake Carder fell for an 18-ball duck when he chopped Abbas onto his stumps. And Jayden Goodwin made just six before he edged Musa behind, leaving the home side in early strife. But the prospect of Pakistan ripping through the rest of the CA XI line-up was thwarted by fighting efforts from Merlo and Spoors. The brave display was in stark contrast to the powerful Australia A outfit who got rolled by Pakistan for 122 at Optus Stadium earlier in the week. That performance sent a powerful message to Australia about the talent of Pakistan\u2019s pace attack, but the visitors weren\u2019t able to back it up with a glut of wickets against the CA XI. Naseem Shah, a 16-year-old who has been likened to Dennis Lillee, unleashed some ferocious bouncers on Saturday but wasn\u2019t able to snare a wicket during the first two sessions. Abbas (2-22 from 14 overs) was excellent, while Musa (1-24 from 10 overs) was economical. Imran Khan, who snared 5-32 against Australia A earlier in the week, and 19-year-old Shaheem Afridi are yet to bowl in the warm-up match, with Pakistan rotating through 15 players. Asad Shafiq\u2019s unbeaten 101 was the highlight of day one, with teenage spinner Lloyd Pope (5-100) also impressing. A-League: Checking in on the game in Gosford now and the score remains at 3-1 to Adelaide. Not an overly eventful second half so far, but we still have 20 odd minutes remaining, so things could get wild at any time now. Meanwhile, while the Mariners may not be troubling the scorer too much in this match so far, they are doing some good stuff off the field. Women\u2019s sport: And now it\u2019s time for my favourite part of the week, plugging my own articles! This one took quite a lot of work, so I\u2019d appreciate it if you clicked the link and did a lot of \u2018oohing\u2019 and \u2018ahhing\u2019 over all the fancy numbers I managed to dig up. I was delving into the Matildas\u2019 new pay deal and comparing how it stacks up against other women\u2019s team sports. Football: Speaking of inspirational young women, Sam Kerr had everyone talking when she announced her new deal with Chelsea this week. If you missed the finer details of it, Samantha Lewis has you covered in a great article on Kerr\u2019s rise to the top of the football world. Kerr\u2019s meteoric rise has paralleled the growth of women\u2019s football more widely. Her own strides on the field, measured by an increasingly-cluttered trophy cabinet and consecutive goalscoring records, have been matched by an unprecedented global interest in the women\u2019s game, most recently highlighted by over one billion people tuning in to watch the 2019 World Cup.\u201d Cricket: There\u2019s more cricket to come this evening, with the Sydney Thunder and Brisbane Heat match coming up in just over an hour. But before we get there, this thought-provoking piece about 17-year-old Faizah Hashmi from the ever-brilliant Tanya Aldred had me shedding a few tears during the week. I believe in the Qur\u2019an, every line, every sentence can be dissected into deeper meaning. \u2018Verily with hardship comes ease\u2019 \u2026 This is my story of how cricket saved my life.\u201d For five or six minutes, the room listened in stillness as she nakedly, lyrically, described her descent into anorexia. The angry despair, the endless fight, the guilt and the secret pleasure, the lies and the secrecy, and then her path away from its clutches. Football: And while we\u2019re on football, my old buddy Richard Parkin has written a great piece this week on the Socceroos World Cup qualifying chances. While things have gone pretty smoothly so far, there are concerns surrounding the lack of experience and star power in the current side. A very interesting article, a perfect read for this lazy Saturday evening. A-League: Central Coast 1-3 Adelaide at half-time Plenty of action in the first half of the game in Gosford today, but not much of it has gone the way of the home team. A Fardal Opseth goal in the 46th minute was the perfect way to finish the half. After a slow start to the season, Adelaide have been marching up the ladder and will be looking to keep up their dominance in the second half and put pressure on Sydney FC who are currently sitting just ahead of them on the ladder in fourth place. Cricket: It\u2019s been a frantic start with lots of results, but let\u2019s take some time to chill and reminisce on what\u2019s been happening during the week. And why not start with the good news story of the week? Everyone\u2019s favourite Romanian cricketer Pavel Florin was able to get a visa to come and play for Melbourne side Surrey Hills after initially being refused. Florin will take part in a game for the club\u2019s development team tomorrow, with the aim to inspire more people to take up cricket for the pure love of the sport. With the full-time scores locked at 1-1, it was off to a penalty shootout in Melbourne. With teams still unable to be separated after five shots each, further shots were added and at last it was the Brisbane Blaze who broke the deadlock and slotted the winning shot. A tight game from start to finish, the first goal wasn\u2019t scored until 37 minutes in. Both keepers were sensational, with neither team having easy access to goal, even in the penalty shoot out. Hannah Astbury, the Blaze\u2019s keeper, was solid under pressure and her teammates dived on her after the final whistle. Captain Jodie Kenny was effusive in her praise of Astbury, and was delighted with the support of the fans who attended. \u201cFor our supporters to travel to Melbourne is really special, we really thank them,\u201d she said after the match. \u201cAlso to the girls in our team who kept us going when some of the team were off playing for the Hockeyroos, we couldn\u2019t have done it without them.\u201d It was a dominant performance from start to finish by the Strikers, who are really making their mark in this season of the competition and are looking like they will be a major contender come finals. Despite losing Susie Bates for 18 in the sixth over and Tahlia McGrath for 10 in the ninth, the women in blue were in control with the bat. Bridget Patterson batted admirably at number four, finishing with 41 not out from 29 balls. But the story of the day belongs to 30-year-old New Zealand international Sophie Devine who smashed 77 off 58 before backing up with the ball to take 3-13, including the key wickets of Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez. In case you haven\u2019t been following, Hockey One is the new national league for hockey - having gone down the route that every sport has done at some point in the past eight years by saying \u201cWe want to create the Big Bash of (insert sport here).\u201d Hockey\u2019s version of this includes \u201cconversions\u201d that take place after a field goal is scored, where the player who scores the goal gets a set shot opportunity to put another point on the board. A TV deal with Kayo and Foxtel has helped increase visibility of the sport, who often struggle to get coverage outside of the Olympics. A less than stellar crowd assembled for the grand finals at Melbourne\u2019s State Netball and Hockey Centre, but the league will aim to build on this base. In an admirable move, the men\u2019s final was played first, which is a nice break from tradition with double headers in most sports where the women\u2019s game is often seen as a curtain raiser to the men\u2019s game. NSW Pride have had a dominant season in the men\u2019s competition and brought that form into today\u2019s match. While Brisbane scored first, NSW were quick to strike back, with an incredible performance from Kookaburra Tim Brand, who scored three goals in the first half. NSW built on their dominant performance and two late goals from Brisbane wasn\u2019t enough to put them back in the match. Flynn Ogilvie from NSW was named player of the match. Welcome to another big Saturday of sport-watching all around Australia. There\u2019s plenty going on today - grand finals of the new Hockey One league from Melbourne, some A-League action from the Central Coast and Melbourne and WBBL from the Barossa and Drummoyne. Don\u2019t leave me feeling lonely here watching sport all on my lonesome. Slide into the comments, tweet or email me to give me your thoughts on what\u2019s going on around the country. So, let us not drag our heels any longer, time to get cracking!",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/may/07/vincent-kompany-manchester-city-season-future\" title=\"\">former Belgium and Manchester City captain</a>, who now works as a player-manager at his boyhood club, Anderlecht, addresses systemic racism and the bleak rise of populism.

The beautiful side to adversity is you will never learn as much as when you get your arse kicked. It\u2019s the best moment to learn. If you\u2019re able to stare it in the face \u2013 rather than shedding tears or closing your eyes \u2013 you can try and solve the problems. And if you have a problem-solving mind, what can stop you?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/21/vincent-kompany-return-timely-coup-anderlecht\">Vincent Kompany walks into a mess at Anderlecht \u2013 can he save them?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cMy mum and dad instilled this in me. My mum was a [white Belgian] union leader fighting for the rights of the deprived. Justice was crucial to her. And when we talk about justice, we need to remember my dad fought the regime of Mobutu [Sese Seko who ruled Zaire, which became the Democratic Republic of Congo, from 1965 to 1997]. My dad protested in the streets of Kinshasa which saw him lose lots of his fellow students. He had to go to a labour camp for fighting for what he believed in.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 33-year-old pauses. \u201cSo what right do I have to sit quiet? My world is easy in comparison. I just try to do the right thing. If you draw the comparison with the project at Anderlecht, I feel it\u2019s the right path to follow. I\u2019ve analysed and cross-checked and made sure the plan is entirely achievable. So, from that moment, nothing will change my mind. I won\u2019t compromise.\u201d</p> \n<p>Six months ago, only days after Kompany had lifted both the Premier League trophy and the FA Cup to complete City\u2019s unique treble-winning season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/21/vincent-kompany-return-timely-coup-anderlecht\" title=\"\">Anderlecht announced a coup</a> that thrilled their disillusioned supporters. They had just endured a dismal season which meant the Brussels club, the traditional powerhouse of Belgian football, had failed to qualify for Europe for the first time in 56 years. But their embattled owner, Marc Coucke, the sporting director, Michael Verschueren, and technical director, Frank Arnesen, confirmed Kompany\u2019s return to Anderlecht, whose academy he had joined 19 years before. That Kompany had decided to come home, rather than seek another season with a club as lavish as City and a manager as renowned as Guardiola, led to wild celebrations.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith Vincent\u2019s return we have achieved something that everyone thought was impossible,\u201d Verschueren said. \u201cVincent is the child of the house and the person to give a new impulse to the club. Vincent has purple blood. The fans understand that he is a part of our past but at the same time guarantees our future.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, more than a third of the Belgian squad which reached the semi-finals had emerged at Anderlecht. Kompany was joined by Romelu Lukaku, Youri Tielemans, Dries Mertens, Marouane Fellaini, Leander Dendoncker, Michy Batshuayi and Adnan Januzaj. It was just one example of Anderlecht\u2019s traditional supremacy which had seen the club win 34 Belgian league titles and three major European trophies.</p> \n<p>Last season they finished sixth and this campaign, with Kompany experiencing the setback that seems to mark the start of each new stage of his life, began badly. After nine matches they were 13th out of 16 teams, winning only one game and drawing three. They have since risen to 10th.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just gone seven games unbeaten,\u201d Kompany says. \u201cFour wins, three draws \u2013 and one of those should have been another win. There\u2019s some misconception about my role. The classical role of the manager, and the short-term aspect of that, is not what I do. I\u2019m a player as well. But we have set out a vision, and a plan, of how the club could recover its identity and be closer to what the fans want. At the same time, we want to try and compete in the future with the big teams around us, like Ajax and Brugge.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo help people understand I could compare us to other clubs going through a transition. Manchester United, unfortunately, is a very good example. Glasgow Rangers until they got [Steven] Gerrard. And Milan. Even such a big club has to be careful or else they could end up in limbo if they don\u2019t fully commit to a vision and a plan. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time setting out the parameters of that plan. Now we just have to stay calm and work through the process.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eabee38fc5abf6bb9123e96e76b69dccf131f74c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eabee38fc5abf6bb9123e96e76b69dccf131f74c/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vincent Kompany at an Anderlecht game against KV Mechelen earlier this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vincent Kompany at an Anderlecht game against KV Mechelen earlier this season.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MB Media/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Patience could run out when a billionaire owner has to understand that short-term success cannot be bought and fans do not appreciate that a chaotic mess needs time to be untangled. \u201cThat\u2019s why my role is slightly different,\u201d Kompany says. \u201cPatience is not a virtue in football. But, in reality, it\u2019s needed. It takes patience in terms of governance and results.\u201d</p> \n<p>The introduction of Frank Vercauteren, the former Anderlecht manager, as head coach in early October marked a turning point. Was this Kompany\u2019s decision? \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a tricky one to answer. We\u2019ve always been consulting as a group and it\u2019s important to have the consent of everyone. Frank has a wealth of experience internationally and nationally. He\u2019s an emblematic figure of the club and he won European titles with us as a player. He played a World Cup semi-final with that great Belgium generation of 1986. So to bring back a person of such authority was really important in terms of protecting our long-term approach.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was some controversy in Belgium when Kompany was announced, wrongly, as head coach of Anderlecht. \u201cFirst of all I have to finalise my badges and I have a passion for doing this. Secondly, my role is slightly different to how people portray it. I\u2019m still a player, the captain, who has played in a big league and studied for a master\u2019s degree as well. It would be criminal if I didn\u2019t share that knowledge in the Belgian league. The long-term future of Anderlecht will at all times be protected by myself. Right now I am still playing and there is no better place than being on the football pitch. But I am concentrating on helping the club understand how they can realise their full potential.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/11/vincent-kompany-homelessness-charity-manchester-city-testimonial\">Vincent Kompany testimonial draws legends to support homelessness charity</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kompany is in Manchester to promote <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/Treble-Triumph/Vincent-Kompany/9781471190179\" title=\"\">his new book </a>which is an entertaining diary of City\u2019s 2018-19 season. The book is crammed with treble glory, with Kompany scoring the screamer against Leicester that in effect sealed the title for City close to the end of his final home game for the club after 11 seasons. But it is striking how Kompany details his own struggles last season. Guardiola never allowed him to feel settled and Kompany always felt under pressure to prove himself. The uncertainty prompted his decision to leave City.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn hindsight I wouldn\u2019t have had it any different,\u201d Kompany says. \u201cIt got the best out of me. I talk about this pressure at Anderlecht. It doesn\u2019t matter if Belgium is small. We experience a lot of external pressure. But internally the pressure\u2019s nowhere near what it could be. City is the opposite. The external pressure at City \u2013 no matter how big it is \u2013 is nothing. We don\u2019t live with other people\u2019s expectations.

Of course, I would\u2019ve loved to be a part of it but, really, my time is done.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not someone to live with regret. I\u2019m committed to a new path with Anderlecht. But it was a beautiful game. I felt privileged to watch it and, also, take a step back and think: \u2018Wow, I was part of this kind of game.

Do the divisions in Belgian society seem less bruising now that he is back? \u201cCities like Brussels are always complex. It\u2019s too easy to say everything\u2019s got better or worse. But there\u2019s still a lot to work on. My father becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/17/pierre-kompany-long-road-from-drc-camp-to-becoming-belgium-first-black-mayor\" title=\"\">the first black mayor </a>[of Brussels\u2019 Ganshoren district] in the history of Belgium is a step forward. But the same divisions you expect in England are maybe more systemic. Every organisation of authority is massively undiversified.\u201d</p> \n<p>He suffered monkey chants when he played football as a boy and his mother would react with righteous anger, but Kompany is more interested in talking about the underlying racism of white boardrooms. \u201cWhen we debate racism it\u2019s like punching the air. We focus on the surface but in those rooms where the big decisions are made there is no diversity. It\u2019s the same in private corporations and news corporations. If the boardrooms are completely shut off from diversity, the only discussion there is about how can we do something that will make us look good? That will make this thing go away?\u201d</p> \n<p>Is there more diversity in Anderlecht\u2019s boardroom? \u201cNo. But the fact I\u2019ve come into the club with a certain authority will bring more balance to the environment. People now naturally cross-check themselves to see that they are saying or doing the right thing. People will feel more on edge if an act of discrimination happens. It doesn\u2019t mean I have to go and beat the drum about it every day. I don\u2019t come in, and say: \u2018Guys, don\u2019t be racist.\u2019 No. We just want to do right by society. By doing this you\u2019re already fighting racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the fight for equal rights is not just about race. It\u2019s also a gender issue. A lot of victories have been won since my father came to Europe. But is it enough? Definitely not. We have to reach a stage where there is no glass ceiling for anyone. We need to be judged on our competence and our desire to succeed rather than where we\u2019re from, or our gender.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so unenthusiastic in talking about acts of racism individually. Have the people in governance and in charge of policy been checked to make sure that their backgrounds are diverse enough? We have these figures making public decisions in the shadows. It\u2019s very comfortable for them. But if you and me are in the same boardroom, I can hold you accountable. You can hold me accountable. It has a direct impact. Rather than safeguarding our image we can actually tackle the issues.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0671659251f826181efd92fa7229299c6526b92b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0671659251f826181efd92fa7229299c6526b92b/0_0_4845_3230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kompany celebrates winning the Premier League title with Pep Guardiola last season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kompany celebrates winning the Premier League title with Pep Guardiola last season.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester City FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brexit is another source of pain. Kompany must feel the divide even more acutely when he looks at Britain now from a distance. \u201cI\u2019m from Brussels,\u201d he says with a wry smile, \u201cthe capital of European institutions. So I don\u2019t need to sell [the EU]. But one thing I do understand is unity. I always feel the more you can make us interdependent economically and socially, the higher the barrier to war and conflict. This is especially important with the rise of populism. The fact Brexit is so difficult couldn\u2019t be a more powerful sign that European unity works.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know some people want to break away and form their own systems. I know the EU is complex. It\u2019s difficult. I know sometimes it\u2019s unfair. But guess what? You have to sit down and solve the problem together. There\u2019s a lot of value in that. And I tell you what \u2013 war is more expensive. Conflict is more expensive. And selfish behaviour, which is entirely promoted by the populistic and reality TV characters we have today, is exploiting a weakness of our modern age. We need to see right through it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI dislike anybody that makes use of propaganda to simplify very important and complex issues. Historically it\u2019s been proven to be a dangerous game. But it\u2019s an easy game to play. You could easily exploit the fears of people for your self-interest. What happens if we go the way of the populist leaders and break away and do our own little thing? At some stage you forget about history.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut at this time of year you look back at images of what world war two was really like. Forget about the politics behind it. It was young men sent on planes, paratroopers, getting shot in the air, boats of them not even making it to shore, machine guns mowing them down. Families being destroyed. That\u2019s world war two. And it happened because of a succession of acts from very dangerous individuals. Populist leaders.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f467e700-400e-4481-8a17-2d4059d4c5d6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sLIgNLfWN78?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kompany pauses. \u201cEverything should be brought back to that essence. OK, it\u2019s annoying to be part of Europe. I understand. Sometimes it\u2019s unfair. Yes, I understand. But, in reality, I feel safer in that environment where we are in one union.\u201d</p> \n<p>What does he think when he hears empty catchphrases like \u201ctaking back control\u201d? \u201cIt\u2019s criminal. It\u2019s absolutely playing on the darker side of human nature. I wonder how much the population\u2019s really able to, at this moment, make a well-informed decision?\u201d</p> \n<p>He looks out the window at a sombre Mancunian sky. Suddenly, his face softens. \u201cBut my association to Manchester is total. I came here 11 years ago and arriving back here today I feel I\u2019ve come home. I love Brussels equally. I feel at home in Brussels, too. It\u2019s 100% for both. A perfect union.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Treble Triumph by Vincent Kompany is published by Simon &amp; Schuster</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cEvery chapter in my life has started with a setback and a struggle,\u201d Vincent Kompany says, \u201cbut there has been success or glory at the end. That doesn\u2019t come by doubting yourself. It doesn\u2019t come by giving up in difficult circumstances. Quite the opposite. It\u2019s learning and staying calm in adversity. There is such a beautiful side to adversity.\u201d Kompany\u2019s eloquence and intelligence light up a drab Monday morning in Manchester as we begin an interview that is unlike any other I\u2019ve done with a footballer. The former Belgium and Manchester City captain, who now works as a player-manager at his boyhood club, Anderlecht, addresses systemic racism and the bleak rise of populism. He talks about Brexit, the lessons of vulnerability in his last season at City and the spatial awareness of Pep Guardiola. His identity \u2013 \u201c100% Congolese, 100% Belgian, 100% Manc\u201d \u2013 seeps through every subject and allows him to speak so personally and openly. \u201cI don\u2019t struggle with enduring adversity,\u201d he continues. \u201cI embrace it. The beautiful side to adversity is you will never learn as much as when you get your arse kicked. It\u2019s the best moment to learn. If you\u2019re able to stare it in the face \u2013 rather than shedding tears or closing your eyes \u2013 you can try and solve the problems. And if you have a problem-solving mind, what can stop you? \u201cMy mum and dad instilled this in me. My mum was a [white Belgian] union leader fighting for the rights of the deprived. Justice was crucial to her. And when we talk about justice, we need to remember my dad fought the regime of Mobutu [Sese Seko who ruled Zaire, which became the Democratic Republic of Congo, from 1965 to 1997]. My dad protested in the streets of Kinshasa which saw him lose lots of his fellow students. He had to go to a labour camp for fighting for what he believed in.\u201d The 33-year-old pauses. \u201cSo what right do I have to sit quiet? My world is easy in comparison. I just try to do the right thing. If you draw the comparison with the project at Anderlecht, I feel it\u2019s the right path to follow. I\u2019ve analysed and cross-checked and made sure the plan is entirely achievable. So, from that moment, nothing will change my mind. I won\u2019t compromise.\u201d Six months ago, only days after Kompany had lifted both the Premier League trophy and the FA Cup to complete City\u2019s unique treble-winning season, Anderlecht announced a coup that thrilled their disillusioned supporters. They had just endured a dismal season which meant the Brussels club, the traditional powerhouse of Belgian football, had failed to qualify for Europe for the first time in 56 years. But their embattled owner, Marc Coucke, the sporting director, Michael Verschueren, and technical director, Frank Arnesen, confirmed Kompany\u2019s return to Anderlecht, whose academy he had joined 19 years before. That Kompany had decided to come home, rather than seek another season with a club as lavish as City and a manager as renowned as Guardiola, led to wild celebrations. \u201cWith Vincent\u2019s return we have achieved something that everyone thought was impossible,\u201d Verschueren said. \u201cVincent is the child of the house and the person to give a new impulse to the club. Vincent has purple blood. The fans understand that he is a part of our past but at the same time guarantees our future.\u201d At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, more than a third of the Belgian squad which reached the semi-finals had emerged at Anderlecht. Kompany was joined by Romelu Lukaku, Youri Tielemans, Dries Mertens, Marouane Fellaini, Leander Dendoncker, Michy Batshuayi and Adnan Januzaj. It was just one example of Anderlecht\u2019s traditional supremacy which had seen the club win 34 Belgian league titles and three major European trophies. Last season they finished sixth and this campaign, with Kompany experiencing the setback that seems to mark the start of each new stage of his life, began badly. After nine matches they were 13th out of 16 teams, winning only one game and drawing three. They have since risen to 10th. \u201cWe\u2019ve just gone seven games unbeaten,\u201d Kompany says. \u201cFour wins, three draws \u2013 and one of those should have been another win. There\u2019s some misconception about my role. The classical role of the manager, and the short-term aspect of that, is not what I do. I\u2019m a player as well. But we have set out a vision, and a plan, of how the club could recover its identity and be closer to what the fans want. At the same time, we want to try and compete in the future with the big teams around us, like Ajax and Brugge. \u201cTo help people understand I could compare us to other clubs going through a transition. Manchester United, unfortunately, is a very good example. Glasgow Rangers until they got [Steven] Gerrard. And Milan. Even such a big club has to be careful or else they could end up in limbo if they don\u2019t fully commit to a vision and a plan. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time setting out the parameters of that plan. Now we just have to stay calm and work through the process.\u201d Patience could run out when a billionaire owner has to understand that short-term success cannot be bought and fans do not appreciate that a chaotic mess needs time to be untangled. \u201cThat\u2019s why my role is slightly different,\u201d Kompany says. \u201cPatience is not a virtue in football. But, in reality, it\u2019s needed. It takes patience in terms of governance and results.\u201d The introduction of Frank Vercauteren, the former Anderlecht manager, as head coach in early October marked a turning point. Was this Kompany\u2019s decision? \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a tricky one to answer. We\u2019ve always been consulting as a group and it\u2019s important to have the consent of everyone. Frank has a wealth of experience internationally and nationally. He\u2019s an emblematic figure of the club and he won European titles with us as a player. He played a World Cup semi-final with that great Belgium generation of 1986. So to bring back a person of such authority was really important in terms of protecting our long-term approach.\u201d There was some controversy in Belgium when Kompany was announced, wrongly, as head coach of Anderlecht. \u201cFirst of all I have to finalise my badges and I have a passion for doing this. Secondly, my role is slightly different to how people portray it. I\u2019m still a player, the captain, who has played in a big league and studied for a master\u2019s degree as well. It would be criminal if I didn\u2019t share that knowledge in the Belgian league. The long-term future of Anderlecht will at all times be protected by myself. Right now I am still playing and there is no better place than being on the football pitch. But I am concentrating on helping the club understand how they can realise their full potential.\u201d Kompany is in Manchester to promote his new book which is an entertaining diary of City\u2019s 2018-19 season. The book is crammed with treble glory, with Kompany scoring the screamer against Leicester that in effect sealed the title for City close to the end of his final home game for the club after 11 seasons. But it is striking how Kompany details his own struggles last season. Guardiola never allowed him to feel settled and Kompany always felt under pressure to prove himself. The uncertainty prompted his decision to leave City. \u201cIn hindsight I wouldn\u2019t have had it any different,\u201d Kompany says. \u201cIt got the best out of me. I talk about this pressure at Anderlecht. It doesn\u2019t matter if Belgium is small. We experience a lot of external pressure. But internally the pressure\u2019s nowhere near what it could be. City is the opposite. The external pressure at City \u2013 no matter how big it is \u2013 is nothing. We don\u2019t live with other people\u2019s expectations. But the internal pressure to perform at City is like nothing I\u2019ve experienced before. \u201cI was one of the guys who put more fuel on that fire. If I was in a losing position \u2013 meaning I was injured, on the bench, sometimes not even in the squad \u2013 I would go in the next morning and work harder. If anybody wanted to complain about his personal situation I\u2019d point out the obvious: I\u2019ve achieved probably a lot more at the club and yet I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d In the book he discusses how he needed to boost Riyad Mahrez who, after his \u00a360m transfer from Leicester, struggled to start regularly for City. That situation continues this season. \u201cThe price tag doesn\u2019t give you any advantages at City. This wouldn\u2019t be the case at any other club. Riyad felt unconfident and I reminded him to keep calm. We need to look at the bigger picture \u2013 the fact he can have an impact even in the last minute of the season because of his exceptional talent. You share a similar journey with people who spend a lot of time on the bench. People forget I was on the bench. But I got the goal against Leicester and then, in the last match of the season, Riyad got us back in the game with an assist and a goal against Brighton. He did it when it mattered the most.\u201d We meet on the morning after City have lost at Anfield \u2013 a defeat that leaves them nine points behind Liverpool. Guardiola, with his defence decimated, must have yearned for the presence of Kompany, but did the City talisman himself wish he could have played instead of watching a pulsating match? \u201cNo. I loved watching it. Of course, I would\u2019ve loved to be a part of it but, really, my time is done. \u201cI\u2019m not someone to live with regret. I\u2019m committed to a new path with Anderlecht. But it was a beautiful game. I felt privileged to watch it and, also, take a step back and think: \u2018Wow, I was part of this kind of game. The level is incredible.\u2019\u201d Did he speak to Guardiola afterwards? \u201cNo. I was on the other side [working for Sky Sports] but I could feel his pain.\u201d Kompany compares the experience of playing under Guardiola to going to university. What did he learn most under Pep? \u201cFootball tactics. Space. The utilisation of space and the effect it has on the overall game. Managing space is the biggest thing I\u2019ve learned with Pep.\u201d Kompany is married to a Mancunian and his love for Manchester is obvious. But he grew up in Brussels. Do the divisions in Belgian society seem less bruising now that he is back? \u201cCities like Brussels are always complex. It\u2019s too easy to say everything\u2019s got better or worse. But there\u2019s still a lot to work on. My father becoming the first black mayor [of Brussels\u2019 Ganshoren district] in the history of Belgium is a step forward. But the same divisions you expect in England are maybe more systemic. Every organisation of authority is massively undiversified.\u201d He suffered monkey chants when he played football as a boy and his mother would react with righteous anger, but Kompany is more interested in talking about the underlying racism of white boardrooms. \u201cWhen we debate racism it\u2019s like punching the air.

      "body": "<p>In 1853 Marian Evans declared that she would rather kill herself than return to live in her native Warwickshire. For the past two years the 33-year-old Nuneaton native had been forging an independent life for herself in London. Working as assistant editor at the prestigious Westminster Review while lodging in the Strand, Evans now considered herself a paid-up member of the liberal metropolitan intellectual elite. No longer required to rub shoulders with small-time farmers and ribbon manufacturers, these days Miss Evans was more likely to be found discussing philosophy with Emerson, gossiping about Dickens and attending concerts with her almost-fiance, the sociologist Herbert Spencer.</p> <p>Now, though, Evans was being summoned \u201chome\u201d by her brother Isaac, the de facto head of the family. The young patriarch, who had inherited the family business from their late father, insisted that Marian make herself permanently available to their sister, Chrissie, newly widowed and struggling with too many children and not enough money. The prospect filled Evans with dread. \u201cTo live with [Chrissie] in that hideous neighbourhood amongst ignorant bigots is impossible to me,\u201d she spluttered. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nuneaton and Coventry, where Eliot lived until she was 30, are both firmly lodged at the heart of Brexit Britain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As it turned out Evans didn\u2019t kill herself, nor did she return to the Midlands. Instead, adopting the pseudonym <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeeliot\" title=\"\">George Eliot</a>, she poured her memories of \u201cthat hideous neighbourhood\u201d into a series of glorious and highly profitable novels. Coventry, where she had nursed her ailing father for nearly a decade, became immortalised as \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d, the setting for her greatest novel. Bulkington, an otherwise undistinguished village close to her childhood home, became Raveloe, the village where Silas Marner weaves his linen and shuns his neighbours. St Ogg\u2019s in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/27/eliot-mill-floss-biography-tulliver\" title=\"\">The Mill on the Floss</a> </em>was partly modelled on Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, while Hayslope in <em>Adam Bede</em> is Ellastone, the Staffordshire village where Eliot\u2019s father had lived as a young man.</p> <p>As for the \u201cignorant bigots\u201d, Eliot, whose bicentenary falls on 22 November, turned them into some of the richest characters ever to appear in English literature. There\u2019s Rosamond Vincy, the vain ribbon manufacturer\u2019s daughter, mortified by her mother\u2019s provincial accent and determined to leave the mediocrity that is Middlemarch by ensnaring handsome newcomer Dr Lydgate; Maggie Tulliver longing to escape parochial St Ogg\u2019s for a life of intellectual and creative fulfilment; Dorothea Brooke, dreaming of an expanded existence, far greater than the tightly circumscribed sphere open to her as a country-dwelling gentlewoman of independent means.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9d558fc4adc0a84ffa6140477835297c9fa1ae75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d558fc4adc0a84ffa6140477835297c9fa1ae75/0_0_6000_7393/812.jpg\" alt=\"Marian Evans aka George Eliot.\" width=\"812\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018 George Eliot\u2019s understanding of what it means to be a young woman stuck in the provinces has proved inspirational for generations of clever girls of modest means.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eliot\u2019s understanding of what it means to be a young woman stuck in the unpromising provinces has proved inspirational for generations of clever girls of modest means. Rebecca Mead, author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/12/road-to-middlemarch-george-eliot-review\" title=\"\">My Life in Middlemarch</a></em>, remembers how, as a grammar-school girl in 1980s Weymouth, Eliot\u2019s heroines provided her with the hope of another kind of life. \u201cWeymouth was three expensive hours from London by train, there was no university and only one crappy bookshop. When anyone new arrived from outside, it was just like Lydgate turning up. I was thrilled.\u201d Reading <em>Middlemarch </em>(subtitle: \u201cA Study of Provincial Life\u201d) in the sixth form gave Mead moments of intense identification. \u201cI knew what it felt like to be Dorothea, to long for a life of higher culture and intellectual passion.\u201d Mead says she recognised Rosamond\u2019s cravings too. \u201cShe dares to think that she could do much better than the clumsy local young men who pay court to her. When glamorous Dr Lydgate arrives, Rosamond sees at once that he offers her the best chance of marrying someone more cosmopolitan.\u201d Eliot\u2019s validation of Mead\u2019s inchoate longings for a life beyond Dorset must have worked a kind of affirmatory magic. The 17-year-old\u2019s close reading of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/04/fiction.asbyatt\" title=\"\">Middlemarch</a></em> got her a scholarship to Oxford to read English, from where she went to New York and, in time, a job on the New Yorker.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/09/coventry-george-eliot-home-restoration-city-of-culture\">Fans in fight to restore George Eliot\u2019s Coventry home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently Mead returned with her family to live in London and is in the early stages of writing a book about being confronted with Brexit Britain. This insistence on taking a second look at the place you have come from chimes with Eliot\u2019s own practice. \u201cGeorge Eliot may at first glance seem to validate her characters\u2019 and readers\u2019 desire to move away from the provinces,\u201d says Ruth Livesey, a professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, \u201cbut the point is that she always insists on returning us to those original communities, so that we can think about them in new ways.\u201d Just as with Dorothea, Maggie, or Gwendolen Harleth in Eliot\u2019s last novel, <em>Daniel Deronda</em>, we are asked to reconsider the value of an ordinary life, lived not at the centre of the known world, but at its very edge.</p> <p>At its most basic, this switch of perspective involves jumping from one character\u2019s viewpoint to another. \u201cThe most famous example is when Eliot abruptly stops the plot of <em>Middlemarch</em> to ask \u2018But why always Dorothea?\u2019 before launching into an exploration of what the world looks like from the perspective of Casaubon, the ageing pedant with the ugly white moles,\u201d explains Livesey.

The book, about a poor Calvinist weaver falsely accused of stealing church funds, deals with the harsh realities of immigration, religious fundamentalism, disability, a changing labour market, queer family making, environmental violence and rapacious inner-city development. <em>The Mill on the Floss</em>, meanwhile, continues to resonate powerfully with Nuneaton A-level students. \u201cWhen Tom tells Maggie that she has brought dishonour on the Tulliver family name by being seen unchaperoned with a young man, and that she is now an outcast, it\u2019s a dilemma that speaks very powerfully to pupils of Asian heritage, particularly the girls,\u201d says Vivienne Wood, who taught for years at Nuneaton\u2019s King Edward VI Sixth Form College. \u201cThey understand immediately just what is at stake.\u201d</p> <p>With Eliot\u2019s bicentenary next week, it remains a mystery to those who love her best just why she will have fewer parties, presents, candles and cakes than her near contemporaries, the Bront\u00eb sisters.

      "bodyText": "In 1853 Marian Evans declared that she would rather kill herself than return to live in her native Warwickshire. For the past two years the 33-year-old Nuneaton native had been forging an independent life for herself in London. Working as assistant editor at the prestigious Westminster Review while lodging in the Strand, Evans now considered herself a paid-up member of the liberal metropolitan intellectual elite. No longer required to rub shoulders with small-time farmers and ribbon manufacturers, these days Miss Evans was more likely to be found discussing philosophy with Emerson, gossiping about Dickens and attending concerts with her almost-fiance, the sociologist Herbert Spencer. Now, though, Evans was being summoned \u201chome\u201d by her brother Isaac, the de facto head of the family. The young patriarch, who had inherited the family business from their late father, insisted that Marian make herself permanently available to their sister, Chrissie, newly widowed and struggling with too many children and not enough money. The prospect filled Evans with dread. \u201cTo live with [Chrissie] in that hideous neighbourhood amongst ignorant bigots is impossible to me,\u201d she spluttered. As it turned out Evans didn\u2019t kill herself, nor did she return to the Midlands. Instead, adopting the pseudonym George Eliot, she poured her memories of \u201cthat hideous neighbourhood\u201d into a series of glorious and highly profitable novels. Coventry, where she had nursed her ailing father for nearly a decade, became immortalised as \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d, the setting for her greatest novel. Bulkington, an otherwise undistinguished village close to her childhood home, became Raveloe, the village where Silas Marner weaves his linen and shuns his neighbours. St Ogg\u2019s in The Mill on the Floss was partly modelled on Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, while Hayslope in Adam Bede is Ellastone, the Staffordshire village where Eliot\u2019s father had lived as a young man. As for the \u201cignorant bigots\u201d, Eliot, whose bicentenary falls on 22 November, turned them into some of the richest characters ever to appear in English literature. There\u2019s Rosamond Vincy, the vain ribbon manufacturer\u2019s daughter, mortified by her mother\u2019s provincial accent and determined to leave the mediocrity that is Middlemarch by ensnaring handsome newcomer Dr Lydgate; Maggie Tulliver longing to escape parochial St Ogg\u2019s for a life of intellectual and creative fulfilment; Dorothea Brooke, dreaming of an expanded existence, far greater than the tightly circumscribed sphere open to her as a country-dwelling gentlewoman of independent means. Eliot\u2019s understanding of what it means to be a young woman stuck in the unpromising provinces has proved inspirational for generations of clever girls of modest means. Rebecca Mead, author of My Life in Middlemarch, remembers how, as a grammar-school girl in 1980s Weymouth, Eliot\u2019s heroines provided her with the hope of another kind of life. \u201cWeymouth was three expensive hours from London by train, there was no university and only one crappy bookshop. When anyone new arrived from outside, it was just like Lydgate turning up. I was thrilled.\u201d Reading Middlemarch (subtitle: \u201cA Study of Provincial Life\u201d) in the sixth form gave Mead moments of intense identification. \u201cI knew what it felt like to be Dorothea, to long for a life of higher culture and intellectual passion.\u201d Mead says she recognised Rosamond\u2019s cravings too. \u201cShe dares to think that she could do much better than the clumsy local young men who pay court to her. When glamorous Dr Lydgate arrives, Rosamond sees at once that he offers her the best chance of marrying someone more cosmopolitan.\u201d Eliot\u2019s validation of Mead\u2019s inchoate longings for a life beyond Dorset must have worked a kind of affirmatory magic. The 17-year-old\u2019s close reading of Middlemarch got her a scholarship to Oxford to read English, from where she went to New York and, in time, a job on the New Yorker. Recently Mead returned with her family to live in London and is in the early stages of writing a book about being confronted with Brexit Britain. This insistence on taking a second look at the place you have come from chimes with Eliot\u2019s own practice. \u201cGeorge Eliot may at first glance seem to validate her characters\u2019 and readers\u2019 desire to move away from the provinces,\u201d says Ruth Livesey, a professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, \u201cbut the point is that she always insists on returning us to those original communities, so that we can think about them in new ways.\u201d Just as with Dorothea, Maggie, or Gwendolen Harleth in Eliot\u2019s last novel, Daniel Deronda, we are asked to reconsider the value of an ordinary life, lived not at the centre of the known world, but at its very edge. At its most basic, this switch of perspective involves jumping from one character\u2019s viewpoint to another. \u201cThe most famous example is when Eliot abruptly stops the plot of Middlemarch to ask \u2018But why always Dorothea?\u2019 before launching into an exploration of what the world looks like from the perspective of Casaubon, the ageing pedant with the ugly white moles,\u201d explains Livesey. Casaubon may be creepy, but Eliot insists that he has as much right to his point of view as the lovely young heroine. Scaled up, Eliot\u2019s project of radically decentring the world requires us to consider what it might feel like to belong to a different gender, class or tribe from the one to which we instinctively feel we belong. It is this kind of emotional and intellectual flexibility that we need more than ever. Nuneaton and Coventry, the two urban centres where Eliot lived until she was 30 and where she set nearly all her novels, are both firmly lodged at the heart of Brexit Britain. In 2016, 66% of Nuneaton voters chose to leave the EU; in Coventry the number was 55.6%. The industries that used to flourish in the area and provided employment for so many of Eliot\u2019s minor characters \u2013 food processing, cloth making, even mining \u2013 are long gone. Unemployment in both towns is higher than the national average and the shabby high streets are home to more pound and pawn shops than artisanal cheese stalls. Nonetheless, Nuneaton remains a place of deep value to the London-based political classes. Despite its economic and aesthetic meagreness, its citizens have high aspirations. Traditionally Labour, in 2010 the town was taken for the Conservatives by Marcus Jones, a local man. In the 2015 general election David Cameron was reported as saying that he knew his party had won the whole country when the Nuneaton result came in at 1.53am. Now regarded as a bellwether seat, it is spoken about in the same way as today\u2019s \u201cWorkington Man\u201d by political strategists. It is a glib, useful psychological trick for when you are talking about people on whom you depend but whom you cannot control. It is one way of masking your terror and your resentment. This recent habit of reducing people to types \u2013 Worcester Woman, Mondeo Man, White Van Man, Essex Girl \u2013 would have appalled Eliot.

      "body": "<p>The story told by Robyn Crawford in the pages of A Song For You, an account of her decades-long relationship with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/whitney-houston\" title=\"\">Whitney Houston</a> is tender, moving and painful to read, the history of a friendship that is also a love story. More acutely, it is the story of two women who, for the entirety of Houston\u2019s life, concealed the sexual origins of that relationship, amid intense and often prurient speculation. Meanwhile, Crawford was harangued, marginalised, and allegedly threatened with violence by the singer\u2019s family. \u201cI found comfort in my silence,\u201d says Crawford, whose decision to write the book was in part a rebuke to the tabloidisation of her friend\u2019s legacy. But it\u2019s the silence that lingers. Reading her book, one gets the chilling sense not only of how alien things were in the very recent past, but of a story that shouldn\u2019t be repeated in the future.</p> <p>To break any silence is difficult \u2013 never mind one enforced over decades, at the risk of huge commercial damage to a brand as valuable as Houston\u2019s. Even seven years after the singer\u2019s death, Crawford clearly continues to struggle. In her publisher\u2019s New York office, the 55-year-old is softly spoken and elegant, choosing her words with the care of someone still half stuck in the mindset of shielding her friend.</p> <p>Crawford and Houston were teenagers when they met at a community centre in East Orange, New Jersey, the singer the younger by three years. \u201cThere was an instant connection,\u201d Crawford says. She was a basketball star, home from college; Houston was still in high school. \u201cAnd we clicked,\u201d she says. \u201cShe told me she was a singer and that she went to Mount St Dominic Academy, and I told her I was playing basketball and in college. We were two friends \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like we met at a club. It was something that happened in the flow of a friendship.\u201d</p> <p>By \u201csomething that happened\u201d, Crawford is referring to the years immediately after meeting when the two women were sexually involved. If she is coy about this, it\u2019s with good reason. The warping effect of denial isn\u2019t easily shrugged off and there is an overwhelming sense, both in the book and in person, of someone running a gamut of internal barriers. Both Houston and Crawford had been raised in God-fearing households, at a time when, she says, \u201cyou were either this, or you were that\u201d. Officially, they were just friends, but even privately they resisted acknowledging what was really going on. \u201cWe never talked labels, like lesbian and gay,\u201d Crawford writes. \u201cWe just lived our lives, and I hoped it could go on that way for ever.\u201d</p> <p>The friendship would, in fact, last two decades, but the sexual relationship was short-lived. In 1980, when they met, it was already clear Houston was heading for stardom: her cousin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/19/dionne-warwick-review-royal-albert-hall-london\" title=\"\">Dionne Warwick</a>, was a veteran star; her mother, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396810/\" title=\"\">Cissy</a>, a successful backing singer; and Whitney had caught the eye of record executives in New York. It was also clear that her relationship with Crawford was going to be a problem. At the age of 19, Houston signed her first contract with Arista Records president Clive Davis. In an extraordinary scene in the book, she then went to Crawford\u2019s house, handed her a Bible and told her they had to quit having sex, \u201cbecause it would make our journey even more difficult\u201d. She also told Crawford that, \u201cif they found out \u2013 because her career was taking off \u2013 they\u2019d use it against us\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c3d3fd518226683dcddd7cd3314d00309b00482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c3d3fd518226683dcddd7cd3314d00309b00482/0_0_5251_3489/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whitney Houston and Robyn Crawford with bottle of champagne, on a boat, from the book A Song for You: My Life with Whitney Houston by Robyn Crawford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We were young, and fearless, and free.\u2019 Photograph: courtesy of Robyn Crawford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Robyn Crawford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is all said in a tone of quiet reflection, but in the book the pain is acute. Crawford went along with Houston\u2019s wishes, and continued to in the years that followed. As soon as Houston could afford to, she hired Crawford as her assistant and the women moved into an apartment together in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The singer\u2019s management team was small in those days \u2013 even in the mid-1980s, when Houston\u2019s first two albums became two of the biggest-selling debuts of all time, with some 40m copies sold worldwide (the eponymous Whitney Houston, with its huge hits How Will I Know and Saving All My Love For You; and its follow-up, Whitney, featuring I Wanna Dance With Somebody, So Emotional and Didn\u2019t We Almost Have It All). At that time, Houston had a single manager, Crawford recalls, \u201cand he couldn\u2019t get her clothing out, get it pressed, get up early and send it downstairs like I could. I did all those things.\u201d</p> <p>She was glad to do them, she says. Care-taking came naturally; she\u2019d grown up in a family where her father had violently abused her mother and where, from a young age, Crawford had taken on the role of protector. And she loved Houston, to whom she still refers by her nickname, Nippy. \u201cIt was about being partners on a journey that she knew she was going on,\u201d she says. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t someone who was pushed into show business. Nippy was someone who really chose it. She was very clear-headed about it, and I was very solid. I was made for that role.\u201d</p> <p>For years, Houston and Crawford effectively functioned as a couple, living together, occasionally (and chastely) sharing a bed, and remaining emotionally close. \u201cYou had cats!\u201d I say: if that\u2019s not a lesbian couple, I don\u2019t know what is. Crawford smiles and insists that, \u201cliving together was like [living with] any other roommate\u201d. They would stay up late talking about music and hatching plans. But when Houston started dating Jermaine Jackson in the mid-1980s, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/eddiemurphy\" title=\"\">Eddie Murphy</a>, and rap star <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtxGVt-hp9UEmyAwfPuAC5w\" title=\"\">Bobby Brown</a>, whom she married, Crawford admits it was tremendously difficult. \u201cThe physical part of our friendship was no longer, but the intimacy\u2026 our friendship was intimate on all levels, that\u2019s how deep it was, and I wanted her to call me and say, \u2018Guess what, this is happening [with Jermaine].\u2019 And she wasn\u2019t doing that, and that hurt more than anything. It didn\u2019t feel like she was cheating on me \u2013 it felt more like she was leaving me out.\u201d When the brief relationship with Jackson ended, Crawford was there.</p> <p>This would be the pattern of their lives together for the next 10 years: Crawford as the person to whom Houston would turn as the pressures of fame intensified. \u201cI need someone that I know loves me for me,\u201d Houston once said of Crawford and as the star\u2019s celebrity increased, Crawford became one of the very few people she could trust. It is a strength of her book that it evokes with such clarity a different era of stardom \u2013 one in which singers like Houston, Michael Jackson and Madonna dominated fewer media outlets, and at a higher voltage, than stars in today\u2019s atomised media. It was also a time when mainstream stars had to be even more unimpeachably heterosexual, and Crawford\u2019s visibility \u2013 she was always by Houston\u2019s side \u2013 became the subject of increasingly frenzied speculation. Every time Houston did an interview, she was asked who she was dating; and in 1987, a serious profile in Time magazine made reference to the rumours, much to Houston\u2019s horror. The singer\u2019s lawyer even rang Crawford, once, to ask, \u201cDid you two ever have sexual relations?\u201d (She replied, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have to tell you anything,\u201d a response that infuriated Houston when she found out. \u201cAll you had to do was say no!\u201d she yelled, and hung up on Crawford.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1819c5d23e034e035a3bf3dfa6073633e9efbd09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1819c5d23e034e035a3bf3dfa6073633e9efbd09/0_181_3405_2081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whitney Houston and Robyn Crawford playing table tennis, from the book A Song for You: My Life with Whitney Houston by Robyn Crawford published by Dutton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"611\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If her record company found out, she said, they\u2019d use it against us.\u2019 Photograph: courtesy of Robyn Crawford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Robyn Crawford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a stretch to recast the silence brought on by homophobic bullying as noble, but there is something very moving about the way Crawford came to regard her secret history with Houston: as their only private space in a life dominated by public interest. \u201cIt was a story that was <em>mine</em>,\u201d she says. \u201cShe knew I had it, she knew I held it, she knew I would take care of it. And so I didn\u2019t feel an urgency to just talk. And believe me, people knocked on the door.\u201d</p> <p>People within Houston\u2019s inner circle, meanwhile, became increasingly hostile. When Houston\u2019s mother, Cissy, called their friendship unnatural and \u201cinsisted that I no longer walk next to Whitney in public\u201d, Houston went along with it, while telling Crawford in private, \u201cRobyn, you know I love you immensely.\u201d When Houston married Bobby Brown, he would occasionally yell at Crawford, and Houston would back him up. In 1988, when Crawford suggested to Cissy that the singer needed help for her drug addiction, she was given short shrift. Houston\u2019s father banned Crawford from business meetings and, in 1997, after years of touring with Houston, Crawford was shut out of a 10-date Pacific Rim tour.</p> <p>Eventually she quit, 20 years after she and Houston first met. By the time of the singer\u2019s death in 2012, Crawford was living in rural New Jersey with her wife, Lisa, and two children, and hadn\u2019t spoken to Houston in several years. \u201cBut I was always there for her,\u201d she says. \u201cI kept feeling she was going to come, and I told Lisa, \u2018When Whitney comes to our door, that door has to open.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>It is a distorting effect of fame that minor episodes can assume a much larger prominence than they deserve. Had Houston not been in the spotlight, her teenage romance with Crawford would probably have fizzled out anyway, leaving them free to continue on comfortably as friends. Instead, their relationship became the elephant in the room. In stark media terms, the only reason any of this is a story \u2013 why we\u2019re here today \u2013 is because two women slept together and one became famous. And yet, as Crawford points out, the emotions were real. \u201cThat energy we had, that real love, people could feel it, but they didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"79f60158e1e4df44e9822d6929f6a9c1260beecf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f60158e1e4df44e9822d6929f6a9c1260beecf/0_1289_4405_4069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robyn Crawford, sitting on a bench in her New York publishers\u2019 office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"924\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crawford now: \u2018We never talked labels, like lesbian and gay.

The coroner ruled her death to be accidental drowning, brought on in part by cocaine and heart disease. \u201cI felt like I should do something, but I didn\u2019t know what that was,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cBut the anger was there.\u201d By 2012, she had effectively moved on, going back to her basketball roots to become a personal trainer. \u201cWhitney\u2019s world\u201d, as she puts it, couldn\u2019t have been further away, and even after the singer\u2019s death, Crawford felt the best approach was to lie low. \u201cBut then Krissie happened.\u201d</p> <p>Three years after Houston\u2019s death, her only daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/04/bobbi-kristina-brown-official-cause-of-death-pneumonia-drug-intoxication\" title=\"\">Bobbi Kristina</a>, died from a combination of drowning and drug intoxication at the age of 22; before she died, she spent months in a coma. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really tuned into Whitney,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cThe tone of everything was negative \u2013 you could feel it. I didn\u2019t have Whitney Houston on my resum\u00e9 but at work, sometimes, people would say, \u2018You used to work with Whitney, how was <em>that</em>?\u2019 Like it was a joke. <em>That must\u2019ve been something</em>.\u201d She looks pained. \u201cAnd that was not it. I felt compelled to stand up at that point, not only to lift her legacy, but to honour our friendship, because friends aren\u2019t something that you should just toss away. You are lucky to say you have a friend, and one you have through your life. I tell my kids all the time [when they overuse the word friend]: that\u2019s an associate, that\u2019s a fair-weather friend right there.\u201d</p> <p>Viewed from the outside, the confusing thing about all this is that, for much of the time, the relationship appeared to be starkly uneven. Houston could be loyal: when, in the early days of their friendship, Crawford was employed at a car dealership and couldn\u2019t sell a single car, Houston dropped in and bought one from her, without so much as taking it for a test-drive. Houston opened up the world for Crawford, exposing her to all the glamour, travel and interest that kind of fame can deliver. But the singer could also be capricious and spiteful. Once, while Crawford was on tour with Houston in London, she went on a date with one of her dancers. When Houston found out they\u2019d kissed, she slapped Crawford in the face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"161f723667e9086d90460ea265127724b8e855d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/161f723667e9086d90460ea265127724b8e855d9/130_198_3115_2326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robyn Crawford (second from right) with Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson and a friend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crawford (second from right) with Houston, Michael Jackson and a friend.

I think she slapped my face because she felt that I had done something, and she wanted me to know that I\u2019d earned that slap. But she gave me a hug right after. Because she loved me.\u201d</p> <p>Surely it was because she was jealous? \u201cI would say Whitney was possessive. The jealousy I\u2019ve witnessed was volatile \u2013 that which my mother experienced with my father, and quite frankly, the way I saw Bobby treat Whitney \u2013 that\u2019s jealousy. Hers was possessiveness: <em>you\u2019re mine</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Crawford\u2019s acceptance of Houston\u2019s rotten behaviour can at times be infuriating. For years, Houston was actively homophobic, publicly comparing homosexuality to bestiality, then privately blasting Crawford for not denying the rumours about their relationship strenuously enough \u2013 behaviour Crawford disliked, but went along with. After Crawford quit her job with Houston, she was offered a lucrative marketing job at Arista Records, until the offer was suddenly and inexplicably withdrawn. Months later, Crawford ran into LA Reid, the then head of Arista, who told her it was Houston who had nixed the job, because \u201cshe wasn\u2019t comfortable with me bringing you in\u201d. It reads as a tremendous betrayal, all the more so because, in the book, Crawford recounts how at the time she defended Houston\u2019s behaviour to her wife. \u201cShe\u2019s not in her right mind,\u201d she told Lisa. \u201cIt\u2019s the people around her.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995, in an even more jaw-dropping episode, Crawford learned of a story running in the National Enquirer in which it was alleged that Houston\u2019s father had hired a thug to \u201cbreak her [Crawford\u2019s] kneecaps\u201d. Houston was riding high on recent award wins, including three Grammys, eight American Music Awards and 11 Billboard Awards, and her song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWTaaS7LdU\" title=\"\">I Will Always Love You</a>, the title track from The Bodyguard, spending 14 weeks at number one. Rather than considering her own position, Crawford\u2019s first thought on hearing about the Enquirer story was for Houston. \u201cThey weren\u2019t thinking about how that was making Whitney feel,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t respecting her. It wasn\u2019t like she told them to go do anything to me.\u201d It\u2019s an extraordinary response to an alleged threat of physical violence: that no one was thinking of Houston.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e8b58da99c0f4da6725b095f4d57b179eaf4548c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8b58da99c0f4da6725b095f4d57b179eaf4548c/0_319_3094_3160/979.jpg\" alt=\"Whitney Houston with her mother, Cissy, in 1989\" width=\"979\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Houston with her mother, Cissy, in 1989.

Crawford looks puzzled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, exactly?\u201d</p> <p>I mean that, for all that Whitney needed you, wasn\u2019t everything on her terms? \u201cWe worked side by side. I was there, I knew what my role was. I went through her modelling years with her. I had a driving licence, she didn\u2019t, so I\u2019d drive her. I was watching her rise. Everything that she had told me she was going to do, I could see it happening. So if you\u2019re asking me, from the beginning was there an imbalance, we always had balance. We worked well together. But then the more people came into it, and the bigger she got \u2013 you know, she\u2019s not black enough, they\u2019re always together, what\u2019s going on there, she\u2019s not dating anyone \u2013 all of that got bigger and bigger, and she rose. It was always there. We couldn\u2019t escape it.\u201d</p> <p>She adds, \u201cIf Whitney partnered with you, she didn\u2019t try to do your job, she worked with you as a partner. In the end, it was tragic. But the difference with me is: I said thank you. And I think that\u2019s what the others should say, too.\u201d</p> <p>By the others, she doesn\u2019t only mean the legions of fans; she means those who profited directly from Houston \u2013 the business associates and layers of family who, Crawford contends in the book, bled the singer so dry that she had no option but to keep going on tour, even as her drug abuse left her physically vulnerable. Cocaine had been part of the two women\u2019s lives as teenagers, until Crawford\u2019s mother had found out and yelled at her to quit. It took Crawford a while, but she did. At the time, Houston had vowed to quit, too. With awful poignancy, Houston once told her: \u201cCocaine can\u2019t go where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p> <p>There was nothing Crawford could do but plead with her to stop and report her drug use to her mother. \u201cI can stop, but she can\u2019t,\u201d she said to Cissy, who as far as she knows did nothing. Crawford was equally powerless when it came to Houston\u2019s relationships. After Jermaine Jackson, Houston was largely single until she married Bobby Brown, although famous men often asked her out. Robert de Niro bothered her for a while and she fell for Eddie Murphy, who messed her around and on her wedding day called to say, \u201cDon\u2019t marry Bobby, he\u2019s no good.\u201d This turned out to be true. In Crawford\u2019s account, Houston returned from her honeymoon with a three-inch scar down one side of her face \u2013 the result, Houston told her, of a glass thrown during a fight. According to multiple witnesses, Brown allegedly continued to be violent towards Houston and her drug use accelerated. The couple divorced in 2007.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the physical stuff that Bobby did was when I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cBut you never knew when he would misbehave. He would trash her path and I didn\u2019t respect him for that.\u201d For a long time, she couldn\u2019t understand why Houston was so publicly forgiving towards Brown. \u201cBut now I do,\u201d she says. It was a survival mechanism. \u201cBecause behind closed doors, she knew how he could behave. So if he\u2019s out in the open creating a scene, you want to defuse it. And she didn\u2019t like to embarrass people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50d81d34474b7dc2ce550fda4e777f03805f7790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50d81d34474b7dc2ce550fda4e777f03805f7790/0_308_1423_1337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pop singer Whitney Houston with singer husband Bobby Brown, who is holding their infant daughter Bobbi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"940\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Bobby Brown and their daughter Bobbi Kristina in 1994.

Their romance took off just as Crawford was exiting Houston\u2019s orbit, and Lisa told her she needed to get help. \u201cShe encouraged me to go to therapy,\u201d she says and laughs. \u201c\u2018Either go to therapy, or this ain\u2019t happening\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what she said. And it was clear I needed to help myself.\u201d</p> <p>Long after the two were married and had children, however, Crawford was still in danger of being sucked back in. People would try to talk to her about Houston, or she would read something in a magazine and suddenly, \u201cI would be in that zone of looking out for her and trying to figure it all out. Lisa could see me drift into it. She would say, \u2018You need to focus on you.\u2019 She\u2019d remind me that there I am, going back in.\u201d Crawford refused to participate in Nick Broomfield\u2019s 2017 documentary about Houston, Whitney: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/15/whitney-houston-whitney-can-i-be-me-review-nick-broomfield-documentary\" title=\"\">Can I Be Me</a>, and says she hasn\u2019t seen it.</p> <p>The only thing she thinks about now with regret is a phone message Houston left not long before her death, that Crawford accidentally deleted after a few seconds, before she had a chance to hear it play out. \u201cWhen I heard that tone, her voice was different. The way she said my name: \u201c<em>Robyn</em>.\u201d She says this very softly; it was the only part of the message she heard. At the time, Houston was booked to go on another international tour, which horrified Crawford. \u201cBecause I had heard she had gone to rehab. And the first thing out of my mouth was: \u2018She can\u2019t do that.\u2019 I wish I\u2019d found a way to get to her. But she was waiting for me, and I was waiting for her. Whitney had a lot of pride. She wasn\u2019t a pitiful person.\u201d She adds: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p> <p>Did she know how to grieve for Houston? \u201cThat was rough. I really felt my insides just fall. And I had a lot of emotions. I was angry, the way it happened. The stuff I was hearing; I had spoken to people who were there on the floor\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Part of Crawford\u2019s purpose in writing the book \u2013 apart from to deliver a cautionary tale to her kids about drugs, and to arm them against all the gossip \u2013 was to redeem and celebrate something of the original energy between the two women, when \u201cwe were young, and fearless, and free\u201d. On that day in 1983 when 19-year-old Houston visited Crawford and gave her a Bible, the two women inscribed the book with lines testifying to their feelings for each other. \u201cLove unconditional,\u201d they wrote and signed their names underneath. Crawford felt no shame, she says. \u201cI loved her, and there was nothing I felt was wrong about loving her. And she was loving me for me. I didn\u2019t have to do anything. That\u2019s where friendship is supposed to be. We were connected.\u201d</p> <p>She smiles. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready for everything that came with it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>A Song For You: My Life With Whitney Houston by Robyn Crawford is published by Dutton at \u00a320.

      "bodyText": "The story told by Robyn Crawford in the pages of A Song For You, an account of her decades-long relationship with Whitney Houston is tender, moving and painful to read, the history of a friendship that is also a love story. More acutely, it is the story of two women who, for the entirety of Houston\u2019s life, concealed the sexual origins of that relationship, amid intense and often prurient speculation. Meanwhile, Crawford was harangued, marginalised, and allegedly threatened with violence by the singer\u2019s family. \u201cI found comfort in my silence,\u201d says Crawford, whose decision to write the book was in part a rebuke to the tabloidisation of her friend\u2019s legacy. But it\u2019s the silence that lingers. Reading her book, one gets the chilling sense not only of how alien things were in the very recent past, but of a story that shouldn\u2019t be repeated in the future. To break any silence is difficult \u2013 never mind one enforced over decades, at the risk of huge commercial damage to a brand as valuable as Houston\u2019s. Even seven years after the singer\u2019s death, Crawford clearly continues to struggle. In her publisher\u2019s New York office, the 55-year-old is softly spoken and elegant, choosing her words with the care of someone still half stuck in the mindset of shielding her friend. Crawford and Houston were teenagers when they met at a community centre in East Orange, New Jersey, the singer the younger by three years. \u201cThere was an instant connection,\u201d Crawford says. She was a basketball star, home from college; Houston was still in high school. \u201cAnd we clicked,\u201d she says. \u201cShe told me she was a singer and that she went to Mount St Dominic Academy, and I told her I was playing basketball and in college. We were two friends \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like we met at a club. It was something that happened in the flow of a friendship.\u201d By \u201csomething that happened\u201d, Crawford is referring to the years immediately after meeting when the two women were sexually involved. If she is coy about this, it\u2019s with good reason. The warping effect of denial isn\u2019t easily shrugged off and there is an overwhelming sense, both in the book and in person, of someone running a gamut of internal barriers. Both Houston and Crawford had been raised in God-fearing households, at a time when, she says, \u201cyou were either this, or you were that\u201d. Officially, they were just friends, but even privately they resisted acknowledging what was really going on. \u201cWe never talked labels, like lesbian and gay,\u201d Crawford writes. \u201cWe just lived our lives, and I hoped it could go on that way for ever.\u201d The friendship would, in fact, last two decades, but the sexual relationship was short-lived. In 1980, when they met, it was already clear Houston was heading for stardom: her cousin, Dionne Warwick, was a veteran star; her mother, Cissy, a successful backing singer; and Whitney had caught the eye of record executives in New York. It was also clear that her relationship with Crawford was going to be a problem. At the age of 19, Houston signed her first contract with Arista Records president Clive Davis. In an extraordinary scene in the book, she then went to Crawford\u2019s house, handed her a Bible and told her they had to quit having sex, \u201cbecause it would make our journey even more difficult\u201d. She also told Crawford that, \u201cif they found out \u2013 because her career was taking off \u2013 they\u2019d use it against us\u201d. This is all said in a tone of quiet reflection, but in the book the pain is acute. Crawford went along with Houston\u2019s wishes, and continued to in the years that followed. As soon as Houston could afford to, she hired Crawford as her assistant and the women moved into an apartment together in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The singer\u2019s management team was small in those days \u2013 even in the mid-1980s, when Houston\u2019s first two albums became two of the biggest-selling debuts of all time, with some 40m copies sold worldwide (the eponymous Whitney Houston, with its huge hits How Will I Know and Saving All My Love For You; and its follow-up, Whitney, featuring I Wanna Dance With Somebody, So Emotional and Didn\u2019t We Almost Have It All). At that time, Houston had a single manager, Crawford recalls, \u201cand he couldn\u2019t get her clothing out, get it pressed, get up early and send it downstairs like I could. I did all those things.\u201d She was glad to do them, she says. Care-taking came naturally; she\u2019d grown up in a family where her father had violently abused her mother and where, from a young age, Crawford had taken on the role of protector. And she loved Houston, to whom she still refers by her nickname, Nippy. \u201cIt was about being partners on a journey that she knew she was going on,\u201d she says. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t someone who was pushed into show business. Nippy was someone who really chose it. She was very clear-headed about it, and I was very solid. I was made for that role.\u201d For years, Houston and Crawford effectively functioned as a couple, living together, occasionally (and chastely) sharing a bed, and remaining emotionally close. \u201cYou had cats!\u201d I say: if that\u2019s not a lesbian couple, I don\u2019t know what is. Crawford smiles and insists that, \u201cliving together was like [living with] any other roommate\u201d. They would stay up late talking about music and hatching plans. But when Houston started dating Jermaine Jackson in the mid-1980s, then Eddie Murphy, and rap star Bobby Brown, whom she married, Crawford admits it was tremendously difficult. \u201cThe physical part of our friendship was no longer, but the intimacy\u2026 our friendship was intimate on all levels, that\u2019s how deep it was, and I wanted her to call me and say, \u2018Guess what, this is happening [with Jermaine].\u2019 And she wasn\u2019t doing that, and that hurt more than anything. It didn\u2019t feel like she was cheating on me \u2013 it felt more like she was leaving me out.\u201d When the brief relationship with Jackson ended, Crawford was there. This would be the pattern of their lives together for the next 10 years: Crawford as the person to whom Houston would turn as the pressures of fame intensified. \u201cI need someone that I know loves me for me,\u201d Houston once said of Crawford and as the star\u2019s celebrity increased, Crawford became one of the very few people she could trust. It is a strength of her book that it evokes with such clarity a different era of stardom \u2013 one in which singers like Houston, Michael Jackson and Madonna dominated fewer media outlets, and at a higher voltage, than stars in today\u2019s atomised media. It was also a time when mainstream stars had to be even more unimpeachably heterosexual, and Crawford\u2019s visibility \u2013 she was always by Houston\u2019s side \u2013 became the subject of increasingly frenzied speculation. Every time Houston did an interview, she was asked who she was dating; and in 1987, a serious profile in Time magazine made reference to the rumours, much to Houston\u2019s horror. The singer\u2019s lawyer even rang Crawford, once, to ask, \u201cDid you two ever have sexual relations?\u201d (She replied, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have to tell you anything,\u201d a response that infuriated Houston when she found out. \u201cAll you had to do was say no!\u201d she yelled, and hung up on Crawford.) It\u2019s a stretch to recast the silence brought on by homophobic bullying as noble, but there is something very moving about the way Crawford came to regard her secret history with Houston: as their only private space in a life dominated by public interest. \u201cIt was a story that was mine,\u201d she says. \u201cShe knew I had it, she knew I held it, she knew I would take care of it. And so I didn\u2019t feel an urgency to just talk. And believe me, people knocked on the door.\u201d People within Houston\u2019s inner circle, meanwhile, became increasingly hostile. When Houston\u2019s mother, Cissy, called their friendship unnatural and \u201cinsisted that I no longer walk next to Whitney in public\u201d, Houston went along with it, while telling Crawford in private, \u201cRobyn, you know I love you immensely.\u201d When Houston married Bobby Brown, he would occasionally yell at Crawford, and Houston would back him up. In 1988, when Crawford suggested to Cissy that the singer needed help for her drug addiction, she was given short shrift. Houston\u2019s father banned Crawford from business meetings and, in 1997, after years of touring with Houston, Crawford was shut out of a 10-date Pacific Rim tour. Eventually she quit, 20 years after she and Houston first met. By the time of the singer\u2019s death in 2012, Crawford was living in rural New Jersey with her wife, Lisa, and two children, and hadn\u2019t spoken to Houston in several years. \u201cBut I was always there for her,\u201d she says. \u201cI kept feeling she was going to come, and I told Lisa, \u2018When Whitney comes to our door, that door has to open.\u2019\u201d *** It is a distorting effect of fame that minor episodes can assume a much larger prominence than they deserve. Had Houston not been in the spotlight, her teenage romance with Crawford would probably have fizzled out anyway, leaving them free to continue on comfortably as friends. Instead, their relationship became the elephant in the room. In stark media terms, the only reason any of this is a story \u2013 why we\u2019re here today \u2013 is because two women slept together and one became famous. And yet, as Crawford points out, the emotions were real. \u201cThat energy we had, that real love, people could feel it, but they didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d After Houston\u2019s death, Crawford found herself questioning whether she should finally speak out. \u201cThat was the first time my silence was shaken.\u201d Houston was found face down in the bath in a hotel room in Beverly Hills. The coroner ruled her death to be accidental drowning, brought on in part by cocaine and heart disease. \u201cI felt like I should do something, but I didn\u2019t know what that was,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cBut the anger was there.\u201d By 2012, she had effectively moved on, going back to her basketball roots to become a personal trainer. \u201cWhitney\u2019s world\u201d, as she puts it, couldn\u2019t have been further away, and even after the singer\u2019s death, Crawford felt the best approach was to lie low. \u201cBut then Krissie happened.\u201d Three years after Houston\u2019s death, her only daughter, Bobbi Kristina, died from a combination of drowning and drug intoxication at the age of 22; before she died, she spent months in a coma. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really tuned into Whitney,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cThe tone of everything was negative \u2013 you could feel it. I didn\u2019t have Whitney Houston on my resum\u00e9 but at work, sometimes, people would say, \u2018You used to work with Whitney, how was that?\u2019 Like it was a joke. That must\u2019ve been something.\u201d She looks pained. \u201cAnd that was not it. I felt compelled to stand up at that point, not only to lift her legacy, but to honour our friendship, because friends aren\u2019t something that you should just toss away. You are lucky to say you have a friend, and one you have through your life. I tell my kids all the time [when they overuse the word friend]: that\u2019s an associate, that\u2019s a fair-weather friend right there.\u201d Viewed from the outside, the confusing thing about all this is that, for much of the time, the relationship appeared to be starkly uneven. Houston could be loyal: when, in the early days of their friendship, Crawford was employed at a car dealership and couldn\u2019t sell a single car, Houston dropped in and bought one from her, without so much as taking it for a test-drive. Houston opened up the world for Crawford, exposing her to all the glamour, travel and interest that kind of fame can deliver. But the singer could also be capricious and spiteful. Once, while Crawford was on tour with Houston in London, she went on a date with one of her dancers. When Houston found out they\u2019d kissed, she slapped Crawford in the face. \u201cShe did later tell me that she was feeling vulnerable,\u201d she says. \u201cShe probably was feeling defeated. I think she slapped my face because she felt that I had done something, and she wanted me to know that I\u2019d earned that slap. But she gave me a hug right after. Because she loved me.\u201d Surely it was because she was jealous? \u201cI would say Whitney was possessive. The jealousy I\u2019ve witnessed was volatile \u2013 that which my mother experienced with my father, and quite frankly, the way I saw Bobby treat Whitney \u2013 that\u2019s jealousy. Hers was possessiveness: you\u2019re mine.\u201d Crawford\u2019s acceptance of Houston\u2019s rotten behaviour can at times be infuriating. For years, Houston was actively homophobic, publicly comparing homosexuality to bestiality, then privately blasting Crawford for not denying the rumours about their relationship strenuously enough \u2013 behaviour Crawford disliked, but went along with. After Crawford quit her job with Houston, she was offered a lucrative marketing job at Arista Records, until the offer was suddenly and inexplicably withdrawn. Months later, Crawford ran into LA Reid, the then head of Arista, who told her it was Houston who had nixed the job, because \u201cshe wasn\u2019t comfortable with me bringing you in\u201d. It reads as a tremendous betrayal, all the more so because, in the book, Crawford recounts how at the time she defended Houston\u2019s behaviour to her wife. \u201cShe\u2019s not in her right mind,\u201d she told Lisa. \u201cIt\u2019s the people around her.\u201d In 1995, in an even more jaw-dropping episode, Crawford learned of a story running in the National Enquirer in which it was alleged that Houston\u2019s father had hired a thug to \u201cbreak her [Crawford\u2019s] kneecaps\u201d. Houston was riding high on recent award wins, including three Grammys, eight American Music Awards and 11 Billboard Awards, and her song, I Will Always Love You, the title track from The Bodyguard, spending 14 weeks at number one. Rather than considering her own position, Crawford\u2019s first thought on hearing about the Enquirer story was for Houston. \u201cThey weren\u2019t thinking about how that was making Whitney feel,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t respecting her. It wasn\u2019t like she told them to go do anything to me.\u201d It\u2019s an extraordinary response to an alleged threat of physical violence: that no one was thinking of Houston. Wasn\u2019t there a power imbalance in the relationship, I ask. Crawford looks puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean, exactly?\u201d I mean that, for all that Whitney needed you, wasn\u2019t everything on her terms? \u201cWe worked side by side. I was there, I knew what my role was. I went through her modelling years with her. I had a driving licence, she didn\u2019t, so I\u2019d drive her. I was watching her rise. Everything that she had told me she was going to do, I could see it happening. So if you\u2019re asking me, from the beginning was there an imbalance, we always had balance. We worked well together. But then the more people came into it, and the bigger she got \u2013 you know, she\u2019s not black enough, they\u2019re always together, what\u2019s going on there, she\u2019s not dating anyone \u2013 all of that got bigger and bigger, and she rose. It was always there. We couldn\u2019t escape it.\u201d She adds, \u201cIf Whitney partnered with you, she didn\u2019t try to do your job, she worked with you as a partner. In the end, it was tragic. But the difference with me is: I said thank you. And I think that\u2019s what the others should say, too.\u201d By the others, she doesn\u2019t only mean the legions of fans; she means those who profited directly from Houston \u2013 the business associates and layers of family who, Crawford contends in the book, bled the singer so dry that she had no option but to keep going on tour, even as her drug abuse left her physically vulnerable. Cocaine had been part of the two women\u2019s lives as teenagers, until Crawford\u2019s mother had found out and yelled at her to quit. It took Crawford a while, but she did. At the time, Houston had vowed to quit, too. With awful poignancy, Houston once told her: \u201cCocaine can\u2019t go where we\u2019re going.\u201d There was nothing Crawford could do but plead with her to stop and report her drug use to her mother. \u201cI can stop, but she can\u2019t,\u201d she said to Cissy, who as far as she knows did nothing. Crawford was equally powerless when it came to Houston\u2019s relationships. After Jermaine Jackson, Houston was largely single until she married Bobby Brown, although famous men often asked her out. Robert de Niro bothered her for a while and she fell for Eddie Murphy, who messed her around and on her wedding day called to say, \u201cDon\u2019t marry Bobby, he\u2019s no good.\u201d This turned out to be true. In Crawford\u2019s account, Houston returned from her honeymoon with a three-inch scar down one side of her face \u2013 the result, Houston told her, of a glass thrown during a fight. According to multiple witnesses, Brown allegedly continued to be violent towards Houston and her drug use accelerated. The couple divorced in 2007. \u201cA lot of the physical stuff that Bobby did was when I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cBut you never knew when he would misbehave. He would trash her path and I didn\u2019t respect him for that.\u201d For a long time, she couldn\u2019t understand why Houston was so publicly forgiving towards Brown. \u201cBut now I do,\u201d she says. It was a survival mechanism. \u201cBecause behind closed doors, she knew how he could behave. So if he\u2019s out in the open creating a scene, you want to defuse it. And she didn\u2019t like to embarrass people.\u201d It\u2019s telling that the most touching part of Crawford\u2019s story has nothing to do with Houston; instead, it\u2019s the trajectory of her relationship with Lisa, her wife, an editor whose calm, healthy demeanour throws into definition the sheer dysfunction of the world Crawford was leaving. Their romance took off just as Crawford was exiting Houston\u2019s orbit, and Lisa told her she needed to get help. \u201cShe encouraged me to go to therapy,\u201d she says and laughs. \u201c\u2018Either go to therapy, or this ain\u2019t happening\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what she said. And it was clear I needed to help myself.\u201d Long after the two were married and had children, however, Crawford was still in danger of being sucked back in. People would try to talk to her about Houston, or she would read something in a magazine and suddenly, \u201cI would be in that zone of looking out for her and trying to figure it all out. Lisa could see me drift into it. She would say, \u2018You need to focus on you.\u2019 She\u2019d remind me that there I am, going back in.\u201d Crawford refused to participate in Nick Broomfield\u2019s 2017 documentary about Houston, Whitney: Can I Be Me, and says she hasn\u2019t seen it. The only thing she thinks about now with regret is a phone message Houston left not long before her death, that Crawford accidentally deleted after a few seconds, before she had a chance to hear it play out. \u201cWhen I heard that tone, her voice was different. The way she said my name: \u201cRobyn.\u201d She says this very softly; it was the only part of the message she heard. At the time, Houston was booked to go on another international tour, which horrified Crawford. \u201cBecause I had heard she had gone to rehab. And the first thing out of my mouth was: \u2018She can\u2019t do that.\u2019 I wish I\u2019d found a way to get to her. But she was waiting for me, and I was waiting for her. Whitney had a lot of pride. She wasn\u2019t a pitiful person.\u201d She adds: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d Did she know how to grieve for Houston? \u201cThat was rough. I really felt my insides just fall. And I had a lot of emotions. I was angry, the way it happened. The stuff I was hearing; I had spoken to people who were there on the floor\u2026 \u201d Part of Crawford\u2019s purpose in writing the book \u2013 apart from to deliver a cautionary tale to her kids about drugs, and to arm them against all the gossip \u2013 was to redeem and celebrate something of the original energy between the two women, when \u201cwe were young, and fearless, and free\u201d. On that day in 1983 when 19-year-old Houston visited Crawford and gave her a Bible, the two women inscribed the book with lines testifying to their feelings for each other. \u201cLove unconditional,\u201d they wrote and signed their names underneath. Crawford felt no shame, she says. \u201cI loved her, and there was nothing I felt was wrong about loving her. And she was loving me for me. I didn\u2019t have to do anything. That\u2019s where friendship is supposed to be. We were connected.\u201d She smiles. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready for everything that came with it.\u201d \u2022 A Song For You: My Life With Whitney Houston by Robyn Crawford is published by Dutton at \u00a320.

      "body": "<p>We had artistic differences. And, as the clock ticked down to the big reveal, when we would remove the tarpaulin and present the world with a bewitching snowscape that wouldn\u2019t seem out of place in a John Lewis advert, the differences festered. We pushed back and forth, my wife and I, arguing over what to do.</p> <p>It was December 2016 and we\u2019d been in our house just three days. It was dawning upon us that the decision to participate in a local community art project, when homes in our area transformed their front windows into a \u201cliving advent calendar\u201d, may have been a rash one. We\u2019d seen what other homes had done when it was their reveal date. The bar seemed pretty high.</p> <p>To my mind, our window lacked illumination, and its bleak midwinter scene was, well, just too bleak. With five minutes to spare, we added some stars, more lights and a couple of foam cut-out stags bought from a pound shop. We decked the tree in our front garden with flickering electric tea lights. And then, suddenly, something bordering on the miraculous happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93ed01b200acbcb419c29db91dd773045632549c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93ed01b200acbcb419c29db91dd773045632549c/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Windows 1-6: dove, Christmas trees, peace &amp; love, starlit village, London skyline and polar bears.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 1-6: dove, Christmas trees, peace &amp; love, starlit village, London skyline and polar bears.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the residents of Whitehall Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our small corner of Archway, north London, was turned into something that, true, would not give Oxford Street a run for its money, but still held the gaze, and brought smiles from onlookers. OK, the music system failed to blare out the meticulously chosen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T0cHQb39GY\" title=\"\">Holocene by Bon Iver</a> when the tarpaulin dropped. And the eight bottles of prosecco we\u2019d bought for the 40-strong throng who collected outside our house for the pavement party \u2013 an integral part of such unveilings \u2013 evaporated quickly in the cold night air.</p> <p>But it was wonderful, truly wonderful. We felt connected to our neighbours. We felt that most elusive of things: a sense of community.</p> <p>This Christmas we won\u2019t be taking part in what will be the fifth Whitehall Park <a href=\"https://mentalhealthcollective.org.uk/connected-neighbourhoods/\" title=\"\">Living Advent Calendar</a><em> </em>project. We\u2019d expected that having a two-month-old daughter would keep our hands full. But, in the end, she just wasn\u2019t strong enough, and so the room we were converting for her nursery, like our front window, will remain dark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41e3a17860feec883d65507d0b0edddaa667e5dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41e3a17860feec883d65507d0b0edddaa667e5dd/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Windows 7-12: swans a swimming, space Christmas, nutcracker, pink house, rainbow star and George Michael.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 7-12: swans a swimming, space Christmas, nutcracker, pink house, rainbow star and George Michael.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the residents of Whitehall Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But we\u2019ll go to as many window openings as we can. Because these were the neighbours who carried us when we stumbled, who bought us books of poetry and flowers and sent cards and messages to say we were in their thoughts. They were ballast in choppy waters.</p> <p>At a time when politicians on all sides are conspiring to drive us ever further apart, we need these connections now more than ever. And it was this, the search for community, that convinced Dr Amy Pollard, director of the Mental Health Collective, to start the project.</p> <p>Pollard grew up in a cul-de-sac in Bristol and remembers how the carol singing outside each home was an essential part of her Christmas, which turned neighbours into friends or, in her case, a husband. She wondered if she could feel something similar when she moved with her family to London, and hit on the living advent calendar project, an idea that first gained popularity in Sweden. Pollard\u2019s <a href=\"https://mentalhealthcollective.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mental Health Collective</a> created a website that offers advice on how communities can develop their own calendars. Since then, its work has been promoted by educational charity <a href=\"https://www.edenproject.com/\" title=\"\">the Eden Project</a> and inspired similar projects in Manchester, Walthamstow, Weston-Super-Mare, Norwich and Somerset.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4627ea20f24484f0552daee4956e0932d19d155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4627ea20f24484f0552daee4956e0932d19d155/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Windows 13-18: hand-drawn house, Santa silhouette, Whitehall Park school, loving family, nativity and gogo dancers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 13-18: hand-drawn house, Santa silhouette, Whitehall Park school, loving family, nativity and gogo dancers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the residents of Whitehall Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of community organising in my time but I\u2019ve never done something that has delivered such a strong, consistent and universal reception,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cPeople say it creates a magical, warm feeling. After we had a load of stabbings, people said it made them feel safer, gave them a nice, positive answer to the question: what kind of neighbourhood are we living in?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s noticeable how the project has become a mirror for our times. After the Paris attacks, several homes transformed their windows into Eiffel Towers that melded with the universal peace symbol. One window was transformed into a tribute to George Michael (pictured above with the rest of the 2017 calendar). Many windows display doves.</p> <p>Organising a calendar may seem daunting. Pollard had similar thoughts in 2016, after she had been sectioned as an in-patient in a mother-and-baby unit. She reached out to friends from church who helped her organise the first calendar. \u201cWe divvied it up and did it together. The fact that I could lead the coordination of that project while sectioned with an eight-month-old baby tells you all you need to know about how easy it is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8559fcfd7be69c15c0b5a5d60a29a1804ac1017e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8559fcfd7be69c15c0b5a5d60a29a1804ac1017e/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Windows 19-24: nightmare before, skiiers, crochet stars, bold shepherds, owls and St Andrew\u2019s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 19-24: nightmare before, skiiers, crochet stars, bold shepherds, owls and St Andrew\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the residents of Whitehall Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if a community can\u2019t find 24 participants, it shouldn\u2019t be deterred, Pollard said. \u201cIt would be easy to say, \u2018we have failed if we haven\u2019t got 24 windows.\u2019 That\u2019s not the way to look at it. Take a playful spirit to it, know you can\u2019t fail. Christmas is happening anyway. It\u2019s about taking something that is happening and bringing out the loveliness of it to the fullest extent.\u201d</p> <p>As we discovered, some nerves will be shredded on the big night. \u201cSometimes people get into a flap, worrying whether they\u2019ve got the right shade of glitter, or about the translucency of their snowman,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to the <em>Great British Bake Off</em> \u2013 there\u2019s decoration-related anxiety, but almost always on the night everyone feels really proud.\u201d</p> <p>And, it is to be hoped, more connected, to others and themselves.</p> <p>\u201cOrganising the project was good for my mental health,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cMy confidence had been knocked and I was asking the question: do I bring any value to the world, is there any point to this? Even if it\u2019s only a small contribution, to make a community art project like this, it gave me a sense of being useful, that I was welcome in my community.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "We had artistic differences. And, as the clock ticked down to the big reveal, when we would remove the tarpaulin and present the world with a bewitching snowscape that wouldn\u2019t seem out of place in a John Lewis advert, the differences festered. We pushed back and forth, my wife and I, arguing over what to do. It was December 2016 and we\u2019d been in our house just three days. It was dawning upon us that the decision to participate in a local community art project, when homes in our area transformed their front windows into a \u201cliving advent calendar\u201d, may have been a rash one. We\u2019d seen what other homes had done when it was their reveal date. The bar seemed pretty high. To my mind, our window lacked illumination, and its bleak midwinter scene was, well, just too bleak. With five minutes to spare, we added some stars, more lights and a couple of foam cut-out stags bought from a pound shop. We decked the tree in our front garden with flickering electric tea lights. And then, suddenly, something bordering on the miraculous happened. Our small corner of Archway, north London, was turned into something that, true, would not give Oxford Street a run for its money, but still held the gaze, and brought smiles from onlookers. OK, the music system failed to blare out the meticulously chosen Holocene by Bon Iver when the tarpaulin dropped. And the eight bottles of prosecco we\u2019d bought for the 40-strong throng who collected outside our house for the pavement party \u2013 an integral part of such unveilings \u2013 evaporated quickly in the cold night air. But it was wonderful, truly wonderful. We felt connected to our neighbours. We felt that most elusive of things: a sense of community. This Christmas we won\u2019t be taking part in what will be the fifth Whitehall Park Living Advent Calendar project. We\u2019d expected that having a two-month-old daughter would keep our hands full. But, in the end, she just wasn\u2019t strong enough, and so the room we were converting for her nursery, like our front window, will remain dark. But we\u2019ll go to as many window openings as we can. Because these were the neighbours who carried us when we stumbled, who bought us books of poetry and flowers and sent cards and messages to say we were in their thoughts. They were ballast in choppy waters. At a time when politicians on all sides are conspiring to drive us ever further apart, we need these connections now more than ever. And it was this, the search for community, that convinced Dr Amy Pollard, director of the Mental Health Collective, to start the project. Pollard grew up in a cul-de-sac in Bristol and remembers how the carol singing outside each home was an essential part of her Christmas, which turned neighbours into friends or, in her case, a husband. She wondered if she could feel something similar when she moved with her family to London, and hit on the living advent calendar project, an idea that first gained popularity in Sweden. Pollard\u2019s Mental Health Collective created a website that offers advice on how communities can develop their own calendars. Since then, its work has been promoted by educational charity the Eden Project and inspired similar projects in Manchester, Walthamstow, Weston-Super-Mare, Norwich and Somerset. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of community organising in my time but I\u2019ve never done something that has delivered such a strong, consistent and universal reception,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cPeople say it creates a magical, warm feeling. After we had a load of stabbings, people said it made them feel safer, gave them a nice, positive answer to the question: what kind of neighbourhood are we living in?\u201d It\u2019s noticeable how the project has become a mirror for our times. After the Paris attacks, several homes transformed their windows into Eiffel Towers that melded with the universal peace symbol. One window was transformed into a tribute to George Michael (pictured above with the rest of the 2017 calendar). Many windows display doves. Organising a calendar may seem daunting. Pollard had similar thoughts in 2016, after she had been sectioned as an in-patient in a mother-and-baby unit. She reached out to friends from church who helped her organise the first calendar. \u201cWe divvied it up and did it together. The fact that I could lead the coordination of that project while sectioned with an eight-month-old baby tells you all you need to know about how easy it is.\u201d Even if a community can\u2019t find 24 participants, it shouldn\u2019t be deterred, Pollard said. \u201cIt would be easy to say, \u2018we have failed if we haven\u2019t got 24 windows.\u2019 That\u2019s not the way to look at it. Take a playful spirit to it, know you can\u2019t fail. Christmas is happening anyway. It\u2019s about taking something that is happening and bringing out the loveliness of it to the fullest extent.\u201d As we discovered, some nerves will be shredded on the big night. \u201cSometimes people get into a flap, worrying whether they\u2019ve got the right shade of glitter, or about the translucency of their snowman,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to the Great British Bake Off \u2013 there\u2019s decoration-related anxiety, but almost always on the night everyone feels really proud.\u201d And, it is to be hoped, more connected, to others and themselves. \u201cOrganising the project was good for my mental health,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cMy confidence had been knocked and I was asking the question: do I bring any value to the world, is there any point to this? Even if it\u2019s only a small contribution, to make a community art project like this, it gave me a sense of being useful, that I was welcome in my community.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In his cramped living room in an Accra backstreet, Bernard Essien pulls out a sheet of paper \u2013 a statement signed by his elder brother Emmanuel and addressed to the Ghanaian police. Two weeks before 28-year-old Emmanuel vanished at sea, his handwritten account and accompanying video footage alleged illegal fishing by a trawler he had been working on. If the allegation was proved true, the ship\u2019s captain faced a minimum fine of $1m.</p> <p>Emmanuel Essien was a fishing observer, one of Ghana\u2019s frontline defenders against an overfishing crisis that is among the worst in west Africa. Illegal and destructive practices by foreign-owned trawlers are draining the Ghanaian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/17/illegal-fishing-by-foreign-trawlers-costs-ghana-50-million-dollars-a-year-researchers-say\" title=\"\">economy of an estimated \u00a350m a year</a>. Along its 350-mile coastline, overfishing has driven small pelagic species known as \u201cpeople\u2019s fish\u201d, the staple diet, to the verge of collapse.</p> <p>In 2015, as part of a $55m World Bank project, Ghana placed an observer on every industrial trawler, to collect data and report violations of fisheries law. Around the world, the work of these observers is becoming ever more dangerous. In 2017, a <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsatsea.org/2017/12/04/report-fisheries-abuses-and-related-observer-deaths-in-the-pacific-region/\" title=\"\">report by Human Rights At Sea </a>found six cases of disappearances of observers in the Pacific. It concluded their work was hampered by \u201cinadequate legal protection\u201d and \u201cphysical danger\u201d.</p> <p>Essien\u2019s diligence made him popular with the fisheries commission, according to his brother. His report on the penultimate vessel he worked on, dated 24 June, ended: \u201cI humbly plead with the police to investigate further.\u201d</p> <p>But his disappearance on 5 July from a trawler called Meng Xin 15, and the failure of the authorities to find out what happened, has devastated his family and shocked Ghana\u2019s fishing community.</p> <p>An <em>Observer</em> investigation has found serious allegations of violence, drug-taking and bribery aboard the industrial fleet that trawls this part of west Africa. Interviews with fishermen, observers and sources in the commission suggest criminality is ignored, raising questions over whether the lives of observers are being put at risk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/ghana-map/giv-3902tYkuHSn9skEY/\" data-alt=\"Ghana\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/ghana-map/giv-3902tYkuHSn9skEY/\">Ghana</a> </figure>  <p>Essien\u2019s family are no nearer learning the truth. Bernard, a barber, has lost weight and has been having difficulty sleeping since his brother disappeared. They all looked up to Emmanuel, their main breadwinner. Four months on, his daughter, Faustina, six, asks for him constantly, while his son, Takyi, 12, and his four brothers and two sisters wait for answers.</p> <p>\u201cThe little one keeps asking questions,\u201d said James, 34, Essien\u2019s elder brother. \u201cWe tell her that her father has gone to work and he is not back. My mother keeps calling me, saying: \u2018Have you heard from the police? Tell them to bring back my son.\u2019 We are waiting for the results of the investigation.

We don\u2019t understand how it can take so long.\u201d</p> <p>Essien had been threatened, his family said, for reporting illegality on trawlers and was about to quit.</p> <p>\u201cThere were days he came back and said he was worried,\u201d said Bernard, 24, the youngest brother. \u201cThe job of an observer is to make sure they are obeying the laws. There were times those in charge of the vessel got angry at him for doing that. They told him not to. He told me it was difficult. He wasn\u2019t comfortable. He said it was dangerous work.\u201d</p> <p>In a hotel in Accra, several trawlermen from Tema, 15 miles to the east of the city, spoke on condition of anonymity. Illegal fishing is common, they said, confirming reports of the targeting of small pelagic fish or \u201csaiko\u201d by trawlers, an <a href=\"https://ejfoundation.org/news-media/2018/chinas-hidden-fleet-illegal-practices-in-ghanas-industrial-fishery\" title=\"\">illegal trade revealed by the Environmental Justice Foundation</a> this year. Two of them witnessed observers taking bribes, they said. Some had been beaten by the Chinese crew \u2013 90% of the vessels are estimated to be Chinese-owned.</p> <p>\u201cThe observers are there to report bad behaviour,\u201d one fisherman said. \u201cIt is like being a spy. When we heard about an observer going missing, we were very unhappy. It is very dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>It was not easy, the fishermen agreed, for an observer to simply fall overboard. \u201cIt would be very hard,\u201d one said. \u201cHe is not working on deck like the fishermen.\u201d</p> <p>James agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t believe my brother threw himself off the boat into the sea. There is no way he would do that. I suspect there was a co-ordinated attempt to take him off. He was going to write up a report. Perhaps there was a disagreement.

      "bodyText": "In his cramped living room in an Accra backstreet, Bernard Essien pulls out a sheet of paper \u2013 a statement signed by his elder brother Emmanuel and addressed to the Ghanaian police. Two weeks before 28-year-old Emmanuel vanished at sea, his handwritten account and accompanying video footage alleged illegal fishing by a trawler he had been working on. If the allegation was proved true, the ship\u2019s captain faced a minimum fine of $1m. Emmanuel Essien was a fishing observer, one of Ghana\u2019s frontline defenders against an overfishing crisis that is among the worst in west Africa. Illegal and destructive practices by foreign-owned trawlers are draining the Ghanaian economy of an estimated \u00a350m a year. Along its 350-mile coastline, overfishing has driven small pelagic species known as \u201cpeople\u2019s fish\u201d, the staple diet, to the verge of collapse. In 2015, as part of a $55m World Bank project, Ghana placed an observer on every industrial trawler, to collect data and report violations of fisheries law. Around the world, the work of these observers is becoming ever more dangerous. In 2017, a report by Human Rights At Sea found six cases of disappearances of observers in the Pacific. It concluded their work was hampered by \u201cinadequate legal protection\u201d and \u201cphysical danger\u201d. Essien\u2019s diligence made him popular with the fisheries commission, according to his brother. His report on the penultimate vessel he worked on, dated 24 June, ended: \u201cI humbly plead with the police to investigate further.\u201d But his disappearance on 5 July from a trawler called Meng Xin 15, and the failure of the authorities to find out what happened, has devastated his family and shocked Ghana\u2019s fishing community. An Observer investigation has found serious allegations of violence, drug-taking and bribery aboard the industrial fleet that trawls this part of west Africa. Interviews with fishermen, observers and sources in the commission suggest criminality is ignored, raising questions over whether the lives of observers are being put at risk. Essien\u2019s family are no nearer learning the truth. Bernard, a barber, has lost weight and has been having difficulty sleeping since his brother disappeared. They all looked up to Emmanuel, their main breadwinner. Four months on, his daughter, Faustina, six, asks for him constantly, while his son, Takyi, 12, and his four brothers and two sisters wait for answers. \u201cThe little one keeps asking questions,\u201d said James, 34, Essien\u2019s elder brother. \u201cWe tell her that her father has gone to work and he is not back. My mother keeps calling me, saying: \u2018Have you heard from the police? Tell them to bring back my son.\u2019 We are waiting for the results of the investigation. We are all trying to cope.\u201d An investigation report, which has not been made public, is now with the attorney general. It is taking too long, the family say. Essien was reported missing on 5 July, after failing to return to the cabin he shared with three Chinese crew \u2013 the chief officer, second chief officer and the cook. A police investigation found \u201cno signs of violence or anything incriminating\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the government and the authorities valued the work my brother was doing,\u201d said James. \u201cIf they did, they would attach some seriousness and urgency to the investigation. We know nothing. We don\u2019t understand how it can take so long.\u201d Essien had been threatened, his family said, for reporting illegality on trawlers and was about to quit. \u201cThere were days he came back and said he was worried,\u201d said Bernard, 24, the youngest brother. \u201cThe job of an observer is to make sure they are obeying the laws. There were times those in charge of the vessel got angry at him for doing that. They told him not to. He told me it was difficult. He wasn\u2019t comfortable. He said it was dangerous work.\u201d In a hotel in Accra, several trawlermen from Tema, 15 miles to the east of the city, spoke on condition of anonymity. Illegal fishing is common, they said, confirming reports of the targeting of small pelagic fish or \u201csaiko\u201d by trawlers, an illegal trade revealed by the Environmental Justice Foundation this year. Two of them witnessed observers taking bribes, they said. Some had been beaten by the Chinese crew \u2013 90% of the vessels are estimated to be Chinese-owned. \u201cThe observers are there to report bad behaviour,\u201d one fisherman said. \u201cIt is like being a spy. When we heard about an observer going missing, we were very unhappy. It is very dangerous.\u201d It was not easy, the fishermen agreed, for an observer to simply fall overboard. \u201cIt would be very hard,\u201d one said. \u201cHe is not working on deck like the fishermen.\u201d James agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t believe my brother threw himself off the boat into the sea. There is no way he would do that. I suspect there was a co-ordinated attempt to take him off. He was going to write up a report. Perhaps there was a disagreement. Perhaps the Chinese didn\u2019t like it.\u201d The Meng Xin 15 belongs to a Chinese state-owned enterprise, Dalian Meng Xin Ocean Fisheries, according to an investigation by China Dialogue Ocean, which found the fleet has committed 16 fishing offences in Ghana since 2016. Its special status as an \u201coffshore fishery enterprise of the ministry of agriculture\u201d gives access to subsidies and tax exemption. One former fishing observer said he quit his job after hearing about Essien. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe. When I found out Emmanuel was missing, I thought the same thing could happen to me.\u201d Showing a photo on his phone of a crew member dumping a basket of fish overboard, he said he had to perform his duties covertly. \u201cI have to hide when I am taking pictures, because if they see me, they might hit me.\u201d Observers shared a cabin with Chinese crew who were closer to the management than their Ghanaian counterparts. There were about 20 Ghanaians and six Chinese, including the captain and first officer, he said. The source admitted once taking a bribe of 1,000 cedis (about \u00a3140 or two-thirds of his monthly wage) from a captain, not to report the illegal transhipment of pelagic fish. The dangers of working for the enforcement agencies, offshore but without protection, are recognised. A source at the monitoring, surveillance and control unit of the fisheries commission said observers are warned of \u201chostility\u201d on vessels. The source said: \u201cWe tell them, don\u2019t expose yourselves too much. In the sense that on board the vessel, there\u2019s no policemen. All the boys are there smoking weed. The Chinese are always drinking whiskey. The situation is very hostile.\u201d When they film alleged illegalities, they are threatened \u201cmost of the time\u201d. The source added: \u201cIt is a very dangerous job.\u201d Some 80% to 90% of reports by observers contained incriminating evidence of illegal fishing. Despite such allegations, only 23 trawlers were sanctioned for illegal fishing in 2018 and prosecutions were subject to political interference, according to the commission source. \u201cWe choose the observers \u2026 but politicians call our bosses and tell us: \u2018Don\u2019t prosecute these people.\u2019\u201d The Ghanaian government insisted observers\u2019 reports are investigated and prosecutions continue, but declined to provide any data. Last month, in what was hailed as a sign that Ghana was beginning to take action, a trawler was fined $1m for catching almost 14 tonnes of small pelagic fish in a single day. It was the first such fine under the 2014 fisheries act. Earlier this year, the World Bank highlighted Ghana\u2019s \u201cweak commitment\u201d to reducing the number of industrial trawlers and its \u201cless than agreed\u201d scale of law enforcement, including \u201cpartial prosecution of offences and collection of fines\u201d. Ghana\u2019s executive director of fisheries, Michael Arthur-Dadzie, said its monitoring unit had tried to investigate allegations of bribery and extortion, but officers did not get \u201cmuch needed co-operation\u201d. \u201cThese therefore remains allegations,\u201d he said. He did not know of any observers reporting being threatened for filming or violence from Chinese crew and was also unaware of crews being forced to carry out illegal fishing.

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard is assessing two allegations of electoral fraud after claims the Tories offered peerages to senior Brexit party figures to persuade them to stand down in the general election. The Labour peer Lord Falconer has written to the Metropolitan police commissioner and director of public prosecutions calling for an investigation into what he said were \u201cexceptionally serious allegations\u201d. In a letter to Cressida Dick and Max Hill QC he referred to Nigel Farage\u2019s claim that he and eight other senior figures within the Brexit party were offered peerages and said they should be investigated by police as a matter of urgency order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the election. The Met said: \u201cThe MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] has received two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice in relation to the 2019 general election. The MPS special inquiry team is responsible for investigating all such criminal allegations. Both allegations are currently being assessed. \u201cThe MPS will not be providing comment about individual cases.\u201d Farage has claimed he has repeatedly been offered a seat in the House of Lords in an attempt to persuade him to \u201cgo quietly\u201d. He said that when that failed, people working \u201cdeep inside No 10\u201d had tried to bypass him, going directly to senior Brexit party figures and suggesting eight of them could be made peers if they could persuade him to withdraw more of his candidates. Boris Johnson has acknowledged that there may have been \u201cconversations\u201d between senior Tories and people in the Brexit party but flatly denied there had been any offers of peerages, saying that is \u201cjust not the way we operate\u201d. The Labour chairman, Ian Lavery said: \u201cIf what Nigel Farage suggests is true, that Brexit party members have been approached by senior Conservatives asking to step down with the result being peerages, what state of affairs is our politics in?

Commenting on the letter on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Michael Gove said: \u201cI\u2019ve got great respect for Charlie Falconer but I think that this sounds pretty nonsensical to me.\u201d The row came amid growing pressure on Farage, in the run-up to the close of nominations on Thursday, to stand down Brexit party candidates in all but a few dozen constituencies to avoid splitting the pro-leave vote. The Brexit party leader had already said they would not contest the 317 seats that the Conservatives won in the 2017 election. Suspicions that individual Brexit party candidates were coming under pressure to stand aside were heightened after the prospective candidate for Dudley North announced he would not be running for fear of enabling a Labour victory.. Falconer\u2019s letter also mentions Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP now standing for the Brexit party in Plymouth Sutton and Devonport. She said she was offered a role in the Brexit negotiations if she stepped aside. Pressed on Widdecombe\u2019s claim, Gove said: \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Ann and I don\u2019t know anyone who has spoken to Ann for months now.\u201d Commenting on whether he asked anyone in the Conservative party if the claims were true, Gove said: \u201cI think the prime minister has been very clear that we\u2019re not engaging in pacts, negotiations \u2013 the decision for the Brexit party to stand down was, as I understand it, a unilateral decision that was taken because the leadership of the Brexit party recognised that if they stood in a range of seats they would imperil the chance of a Conservative majority government.\u201d Brexit party MEP Ben Habib rebuffed the Tory denials. \u201cThey\u2019re being economical with the truth for sure,\u201d he told Sky. \u201cAbsolutely.

Every election cycle seems to have a key demographic said to define the race, and 2020 is no different. This is the campaign of the \u201cboo-hoo billionaire\u201d.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a billionaire in the White House and two of the top Democratic rivals for Trump\u2019s job, senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have made ever-widening income inequality central to their campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist,\u201d Sanders said recently, citing the \u201cimmoral level of income and wealth inequality\u201d that has only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/09/trump-tax-cuts-helped-billionaires-pay-less\">deepened </a>under the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>One billionaire bid for the White House has already flamed out. Howard Schultz, Starbuck\u2019s former barista-in-chief, ended his run almost as soon as it had begun chased away by angry crowds who labeled him an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/29/howard-schultz-denies-a-2020-run-as-independent-could-re-elect-trump\">\u201cegotistical billionaire asshole!\u201d</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"148dd061-91b1-493e-b9eb-d3d6b54c1678\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dTS2wZQe7FM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That hasn\u2019t stopped another billionaire, hedge-fund mogul Tom Steyer, running for the Democratic nomination. And now former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, founder of the eponymous media empire, is also making moves to enter the race, fired up by the billionaire bashing. Ironically, Bloomberg (net worth <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#4d4e4bd11417\">$52.3bn</a>) signaled his intention to get in the race by getting his name on the ballot in Alabama, one of the <a href=\"https://www.fcnl.org/updates/top-10-poorest-states-in-the-u-s-1630\">poorest states</a> in the union with a median household income of $48,123.</p> \n<p>Kevin Kruse, professor of history at Princeton University and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/01/09/kruse-and-zelizer-discuss-fault-lines-history-united-states-1974\">Fault Lines: </a>A History of the United States Since 1974, believes there\u2019ll be more to come. \u201cThe Trump candidacy made a lot of them think, \u2018Well, if this guy with his inherited wealth, who went bankrupt all the time, if he can do it, why not me?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The mistake they make is ignoring Trump\u2019s charisma and \u201chuckster showmanship\u201d, said Kruse. \u201cThey think because they have even more money they will have more charisma. That\u2019s not the case, It wasn\u2019t with Schultz, it isn\u2019t with Steyer and it\u2019s not going to be with Bloomberg,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that Mike Bloomberg is going to do well in Alabama is insane.\u201d</p> \n<p>That\u2019s not what the billionaires think. As Warren and Sanders have stepped up their attacks, a host of plutocrats have gone public with their anger at all this billionaire-bashing, and some are already coming out for Bloomberg.</p> \n<p>For them, this is personal.

      "bodyText": "The 1996 US election was all about the \u201csoccer mom\u201d; 2004 belonged to the \u201cNascar dads\u201d; Donald Trump won the White House with a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d. Every election cycle seems to have a key demographic said to define the race, and 2020 is no different. This is the campaign of the \u201cboo-hoo billionaire\u201d. There\u2019s a billionaire in the White House and two of the top Democratic rivals for Trump\u2019s job, senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have made ever-widening income inequality central to their campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist,\u201d Sanders said recently, citing the \u201cimmoral level of income and wealth inequality\u201d that has only deepened under the Trump administration. One billionaire bid for the White House has already flamed out. Howard Schultz, Starbuck\u2019s former barista-in-chief, ended his run almost as soon as it had begun chased away by angry crowds who labeled him an \u201cegotistical billionaire asshole!\u201d That hasn\u2019t stopped another billionaire, hedge-fund mogul Tom Steyer, running for the Democratic nomination. And now former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, founder of the eponymous media empire, is also making moves to enter the race, fired up by the billionaire bashing. Ironically, Bloomberg (net worth $52.3bn) signaled his intention to get in the race by getting his name on the ballot in Alabama, one of the poorest states in the union with a median household income of $48,123. Kevin Kruse, professor of history at Princeton University and co-author of Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974, believes there\u2019ll be more to come. \u201cThe Trump candidacy made a lot of them think, \u2018Well, if this guy with his inherited wealth, who went bankrupt all the time, if he can do it, why not me?\u2019\u201d The mistake they make is ignoring Trump\u2019s charisma and \u201chuckster showmanship\u201d, said Kruse. \u201cThey think because they have even more money they will have more charisma. That\u2019s not the case, It wasn\u2019t with Schultz, it isn\u2019t with Steyer and it\u2019s not going to be with Bloomberg,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that Mike Bloomberg is going to do well in Alabama is insane.\u201d That\u2019s not what the billionaires think. As Warren and Sanders have stepped up their attacks, a host of plutocrats have gone public with their anger at all this billionaire-bashing, and some are already coming out for Bloomberg. For them, this is personal. The \u201cgreat plute freakout of 2019\u201d as Anand Giridharadas, the author of Winner Takes All, a recent study of the deleterious impact of elites, has called it, is literally reducing billionaires to tears. Asked about his views on the 2020 election on CNBC earlier this month, moist-eyed investment giant Leon Cooperman, worth $3.2bn according to Forbes, could barely hold back the tears. \u201cI care. That\u2019s it,\u201d he sobbed, eyes cast down and shuffling papers. Cooperman has clashed with Warren in recent months after she proposed higher taxes on the super wealthy. \u201cI believe in a progressive income tax and the rich paying more. But this is the fucking American dream she is shitting on,\u201d Cooperman told Politico. \u201cThe vilification of billionaires makes no sense to me,\u201d Cooperman told CNBC. He called her policies \u201cidiocy\u201d and said it was \u201cappealing to the lowest common denominator, and basically trying to turn people\u2019s heads around by promising a lot of free stuff\u201d. Warren responded with a tweet, saying: \u201cOne thing I know he cares about \u2013 his fortune. He\u2019s a shareholder in Navient, a student loan company that has cheated borrowers and used abusive, misleading tactics. He even went so far as to ask how I might impact his investment in the last earnings call with Navient.\u201d Her campaign is now selling mugs stamped with Billionaire Tears. Days later, a far perkier Cooperman went on CNBC to celebrate the news that the \u201cterrific\u201d Bloomberg was potentially in the race. \u201cHe\u2019s a unifier, he\u2019s bright, he\u2019s immensely successful, he\u2019s been extremely generous with his resources,\u201d he said. Cooperman was particularly impressed that as New York\u2019s mayor, Bloomberg successful blocked a proposed billionaires tax. \u201cHe resisted, and he explained that if you lose one billionaire, you lose more revenue than you are gonna get from everyone else. So he understands how the system works.\u201d The problem for this caterwauling Croesus and his cohorts is that, in fact, many billionaires know that the system does not work. Over the last few years a bevy of billionaires have warned that the society that created them faces an existential threat in income inequality. The yawning gap between rich and poor is now a \u201cnational emergency\u201d, hedge-fund king Ray Dalio ($18.7bn) wrote in an 8,000-plus-word blogpost on Linkedin back in April. Dalio\u2019s fears have been echoed by JP Morgan boss Jamie Morgan ($1.6bn), Warren Buffett ($87bn) and others but none have matched his devastating and detailed critique. As Dalio points out: The wealth of the top 1% of the population is more than that of the bottom 90% of the population combined Forty per cent of all Americans would struggle to raise $400 in the event of an emergency. There has been little or no real income growth for most people for decades. The childhood poverty rate in the US is now 17.5% and has also not meaningfully improved for decades. The opportunities for people like Dalio (born to a jazz musician in Queens) or Cooperman (the son of a Polish plumber) are disappearing. The rate of economic mobility in the US \u2013 the opportunity to earn your way out of poverty \u2013 is now one of the worst in the developed world. But Dalio\u2019s \u201csolutions\u201d sound less impressive than his critique: more \u201cleadership from the top,\u201d bipartisan cooperation and \u201cclear metrics\u201d. Kruse is not surprised billionaires don\u2019t have the answer. \u201cThe reality is that government isn\u2019t a business,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are fundamentally different enterprises. What you are able to do in business doesn\u2019t pan out in foreign affairs, in domestic policy. Convincing your board of directors is one thing; convincing Congress to pass legislation is entirely different.\u201d But that won\u2019t stop the billionaires from wanting to add 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to their property portfolio \u2013 even if the peasants have gathered with their pitchforks at the gates. \u201cThere is something about the very wealthy, they don\u2019t have enough people telling them that they are full of shit,\u201d said Kruse.",

Whereas the rest of St Aubyn\u2019s circle couldn\u2019t tell me enough about how much they adored \u201cTeddy\u201d, Self all but hung up on me. And now, in Will, we find out why, sort of. Self spends a remarkable amount of time deriding the dress sense (\u201cabsurd\u201d) and character (\u201cidiot\u201d) of \u201cCaius\u201d \u2013 someone who bears a striking resemblance to St Aubyn \u2013 while admitting he was envious of his \u201celusive quality\u201d, AKA extreme poshness. Alas, it was not to be, and Self ends up cast out by Caius for \u201clacking both the necessary suiting and the required attitude\u201d. An alternative reason suggests itself on the previous page, when Caius tells Self that his father had sexually abused him.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s no secret that Naomi Campbell doesn\u2019t like interviews. After 33 years in the business, and a string of tabloid-baiting moments, the model has acquired a reputation for being surly, formidable, downright difficult. Our original meeting is cancelled an hour or so before we are due to meet \u2013 Campbell cites \u201cterrific illness\u201d \u2013 but a promise is made to reschedule, with the possibility that she might be free over the weekend. Or that we might end up speaking by phone. But then the text arrives: we are on, for Sunday at 4pm. Give or take an hour, Campbell keeps to her word. Her publicist and I chat in the lobby of The Dorchester hotel in London, while I mentally prepare for the full force of her legendary froideur.</p> <p>It is almost alarming, then, to find Campbell making jokes in a suite at the hotel, where she is alone, resting an injured leg on the sofa, smoking a cigarette, full of pussycat charm. At 49, she still looks otherworldly: a body, as Bono once put it, handmade by God, and skin so glowing it looks airbrushed. The era-defining cheekbones are framed by a sweep of immaculate hair; in the golden-hour light she looks luminous, dressed in a green chiffon Sacai jumpsuit and tractor sole Chelsea boots. She shows her publicist and me her leg: her knee is swollen like a melon, the result of tumbling on the stairs at an art party earlier in the week. She is worried that she won\u2019t be able to fly if it doesn\u2019t heal soon. \u201cClots are no joke,\u201d she says. \u201c[Doctors] stopped me from flying for six weeks two years ago. I do not want that again.\u201d</p> <p>Inexplicably, she loves being in the air, where she spends an astonishing amount of time. Campbell\u2019s fortnight has already included at least half a dozen flights, with several more in the coming days: New York (where she lives) to Paris to London to Paris to New York to Arizona to Los Angeles, and so on. Earlier this year, a YouTube video of Campbell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2019/jul/16/cleaned-for-take-off-naomi-campbell-inflight-hygiene-routine\" title=\"\">\u201cflight routine\u201d</a>, which includes thoroughly disinfecting every surface and carrying her own seat cover and blanket, went viral, to the delight of a growing army of younger fans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I feel a difference. Someone called it a \u201ccult\u201d: you want me to feel bad, now things are turning the other way?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Propping her leg back up on the velvet seat, she looks me over and then tells her publicist to leave. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine, I don\u2019t need you,\u201d she says, putting out her cigarette. Once we\u2019re alone, she starts by thanking me for my journalism. \u201cI wanted to meet you in person. I\u2019ve watched and read what you\u2019ve done in the past. I like that you\u2019re very honest and seem transparent and straightforward.\u201d It\u2019s a bold move: I can feel any difficult questions being expertly manoeuvred out of the room. \u201cI like what you wrote when you defended me, without me having to speak,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>I can only manage an embarrassed thank you.

Speaking in the same week that her successor Edward Enninful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/07/enninful-fronts-up-to-diversity-debate-with-first-british-vogue-cover\" title=\"\">published his first Vogue</a>, Shulman denied that she had held any unconscious bias, despite the fact that in the course of more than 300 issues and 25 years as editor, only a dozen covers had featured a black person. Two were Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, suggesting that a black star would need to be one of the most famous women on the planet before they were under consideration. Campbell, one of the world\u2019s top five models for more than three decades, featured on only five. In the interview, Shulman described Campbell as aggressive, before arguing that it was offensive to call her racist, \u201cbecause actually my son\u2019s grandfather was one of the civil rights leaders\u201d. Campbell raises an eyebrow at the drama that interview unleashed. \u201cYou really get to see people\u2019s colours,\u201d she laughs. \u201cLiterally.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19373c0afd4aa5dc5a05f8c13f88324231cbd4c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19373c0afd4aa5dc5a05f8c13f88324231cbd4c1/0_1714_5990_3636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell photographed in London Oct 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nina Ricci chemise.

As the TV writer and producer Lena Waithe (Master of None, Dear White People) put it: \u201cPeople of colour are in a very interesting position right now. We\u2019re more than just in vogue. We are the culture.\u201d Campbell would agree. \u201cI feel a difference on many levels now \u2013 but someone I know recently called it a \u2018cult\u2019,\u201d she says, visibly irate. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that way when you had everything, was it? You wouldn\u2019t say that when you were getting everything handed on a plate, and things were coming your way constantly.\u201d She puts out another cigarette. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person where, with my friends \u2013 and I take that word very seriously \u2013 I\u2019m happy for what they get. So to hear this called a \u2018cult\u2019, that was like, \u2018Wait a second: so you want me to feel bad now that things are turning the other way?\u2019\u201d She makes an incredulous face. \u201cNo. We just want balance, end of story. I won\u2019t do an all-black show, for instance, because it would be hypocritical given what I\u2019ve stood for, for so long.\u201d Which is what? \u201cBalanced inclusion.\u201d Campbell says she was offered \u201ctons of money\u201d to do an exclusively black show recently, but turned it down. \u201cI can see clearly when brands want diversity because they get it and think it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2013 and the ones who just think it will look bad if they don\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb1eddad9e4b1ab70e489da592d10ca56783b0c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb1eddad9e4b1ab70e489da592d10ca56783b0c5/0_371_2341_1404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Model Naomi Campbell with fashion stylist Edward Enninful, receiving his OBE at Buckingham Palace, in London, October 27, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Edward Enninful, receiving his OBE in 2016.

If I wasn\u2019t there, there would be no one, and we have to have presence.\u201d Would it be fair to say that she campaigns more for diversity now because she is more comfortable in her skin? \u201cIt\u2019s not that I feel comfortable. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been speaking about it more \u2013 I think I\u2019ve just been <em>doing</em> more. Everybody knows Africa is not new to me and I\u2019ve been working on projects there since 1994.\u201d</p> <p>She talks at length about being \u201ca global changemaker\u201d in a programme pushing French luxury company the Kering Group and others to invest in fashion colleges in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. \u201cSo many companies call themselves a global operation and they\u2019re not. They\u2019re not, because they\u2019ve missed out a continent of 54 countries with extremely educated people, who deserve to be able to learn the same skills and have the opportunities we do.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell is of Chinese-Jamaican heritage and was raised by her grandmother and aunts in south London, while her mother toured Europe as a professional dancer. Despite this, she says she is happiest when in Africa. \u201cI feel at peace on the continent,\u201d she says, regal and beatific. \u201cA very real inner peace.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65085f03d3fd2c6c8157352baaf85d3100c03109\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65085f03d3fd2c6c8157352baaf85d3100c03109/0_347_5776_6457/895.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell photographed in London Oct 2019\" width=\"895\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thom Browne NY suit, chemise and boots.

On the one hand, she founded Fashion For Relief in 2005, a charity catwalk show and high-profile auction that rallies the industry to cough up for her causes; she has raised more than $15m to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and the ebola epidemic across west Africa. On the other, she has been convicted of assault four times: for throwing a phone at her assistant, another at her housekeeper, for kicking a police officer and for hitting a paparazzo with her handbag. She was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/05/naomi-campbell-war-crimes-trial-blood-diamonds\" title=\"\">made to take the witness stand</a> in the infamous \u201cblood diamonds\u201d trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor. Part of the prosecution\u2019s case rested on a dinner at Nelson Mandela\u2019s home, after which Taylor gifted Campbell what she told the court she thought were \u201cdirty rocks\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"592e03b1f5128d598a101d95a06ceecad6cae716\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/592e03b1f5128d598a101d95a06ceecad6cae716/423_194_1260_2785/452.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell walks the runway at the Fashion for Relief show during London Fashion Week September 2019\" width=\"452\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the Fashion For Relief catwalk in September. Photograph: WireImage</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, she inspires fierce loyalty. Younger models, such as Adut Akech and Anok Yai, routinely cite her as a mentor and protective role model. Her close friends, such as the photographer Steven Meisel, and designers Marc Jacobs and Kim Jones, say they can count on her for unconditional support. She was mentored and adored by Mandela and couturier Azzedine Ala\u00efa, who named her their honorary granddaughter and daughter, respectively. Yet she has also been ambushed by criticism in her television interviews, most notably by Oprah, Tyra Banks and Barbara Walters, who, respectively, have chided her for being \u201ca petulant diva\u201d, \u201ca bully\u201d and \u201ca bitch\u201d. To her credit, Campbell responded each time with measured grace, sticking to a script that she stands by years later: that she isn\u2019t perfect, that she isn\u2019t proud of everything she has done, and remains a work-in-progress. As she emphasises again now, eyes coolly narrowed: \u201cI will not be held hostage to my past.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the same line she delivered, quietly seething, in a recent video statement on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK31LlyXHUjTr1kGQiqn3xA\" title=\"\">Being Naomi, her YouTube channel</a> (308K subscribers), responding to what she describes as a character assassination by the Mail On Sunday this August. On learning that Campbell would be receiving the British Fashion Council\u2019s prestigious icon award in December, the paper went to town on her alleged history of keeping \u201cvery rum chums\u201d, linking her to disgraced sexual predators Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein, both of whom she has been photographed with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d0d76e2fffeaecbcd7736b339ae9a4efe6c1644\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d0d76e2fffeaecbcd7736b339ae9a4efe6c1644/0_557_5916_5128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell photographed in London Oct 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"867\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nina Ricci chemise.

Are you going to single me out, when there are hundreds of people pictured with the same people, who you don\u2019t care to mention?\u201d Campbell rolls her eyes. \u201cDo me a fucking favour. I won\u2019t sit there and roll over and take that shit. We all know what that\u2019s about\u2026 I\u2019ve seen how they treat Raheem Sterling, how they speak about Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams. I don\u2019t know how Meghan Markle deals with this and I\u2019m really glad she\u2019s taken action to defend herself.\u201d The Duchess of Sussex is currently suing the Mail On Sunday for infringement of her privacy; in 2004, Campbell successfully won her own privacy case against the Daily Mirror, when the then editor Piers Morgan published pictures of her attending Narcotics Anonymous. She says she hasn\u2019t met Markle yet, \u201cand I don\u2019t have plans to\u201d, but \u201cwhen I heard [she was taking legal action], I was like \u2018Bravo. Good for her.\u2019\u201d Campbell never uses the word \u201cracism\u201d, but it is an elephantine presence in the room.</p> <p>Thirty-three years is a remarkable stint in any industry, and in modelling much more so. But Campbell says she is looking forward to turning 50 next year and has already planned her party. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of being 50. I\u2019m looking forward to a good old dance, too. I want to make sure I dance the night away, surrounded by people I love and who have been with me through thick and thin. I just want us to be in a beautiful place I have chosen.\u201d She smiles. \u201cNow it\u2019s about working out the logistics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b57ef5a324624593d3e6ce1afc6d57f5dba609db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b57ef5a324624593d3e6ce1afc6d57f5dba609db/569_280_4023_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supermodels (from left) Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington in 1991\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford and Christy Turlington in 1991.

There were others: Yves Saint Laurent, who threatened to pull advertising unless French Vogue gave her a cover. She rose through the ranks at a time when \u201cdesigners and models worked together, had dinner together and with each other. All the designers I loved, Azzedine and Gianni and Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen and Vivienne [Westwood] all loved each other and enjoyed each other\u2019s company. I chose right \u2013 I chose creativity first. I didn\u2019t choose them for money and I learnt so much. Being Papa [Ala\u00efa]\u2019s daughter was an incredible experience \u2013 he taught me about art and furniture and so much about his craft. It was unique.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd11d2f207337a3d7c9e721f117a5e2a08a681f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd11d2f207337a3d7c9e721f117a5e2a08a681f8/1651_365_2259_6065/372.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell photographed in London Oct 2019\" width=\"372\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thom Browne New York jeans, blouson and shirt. Sacai boots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Campbell Addy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But her rise also came at a time when the predatory excesses of powerful men was the industry norm, and one wonders how much she might have seen or known over the years. John Casablancas, the late founder of Elite Model Management who signed \u201cthe supers\u201d (Evangelista, Cindy Crawford and Campbell) was notorious for sleeping with his teenage models. He moved in social circles with Epstein and Donald Trump, who founded his own modelling agency, ran beauty pageants and has admitted using both <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/a-timeline-of-donald-trumps-creepiness-while-he-owned-miss-universe-191860/\" title=\"\">to pick up women</a>. Even before #MeToo, the three men had faced allegations of exploiting vulnerable young girls.</p> <p>How does Campbell think the fashion industry has dealt with sexual abuse since then? \u201cOf course I have empathy and concern for those it did happen to and I feel for their trauma, psychologically how it affects them,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cBut it never happened to me.\u201d (We catch up later on the phone, and when I ask her more about how the industry enabled the abuse of beautiful women, Campbell grows frustrated. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any of that shit, because thank God for my armour, my being called a bad bitch \u2013 I was lucky it never happened to me. I was protected by my angels Azzedine Ala\u00efa, Gianni [Versace] and Yves Saint Laurent.\u201d)</p> <p>Campbell was represented by Elite from 1987 to 1993 and was reportedly dismissed by Casablancas for being rude and impossible. She denies this. \u201cI actually have to tell you something: I was only with Elite for a very small period. And [Casablancas] didn\u2019t fire me \u2013 I left. But I will say that when I was with him, I didn\u2019t see him with Trump. I didn\u2019t witness <em>that</em> behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it is fair to say that when it comes to her friends, including Michael Jackson, to whom she dedicated a recent post on Instagram, Campbell\u2019s real blind spot is fierce, unwavering loyalty. \u201cYou come for someone that I love and care about, I\u2019m defending them,\u201d she says. Loyalty and discretion come up a lot. It\u2019s why, she says, she\u2019s on good terms with all her exes \u201cexcept one\u201d; the candidates include U2\u2019s Adam Clayton, Robert De Niro, and multi-millionaire buisnessmen Flavio Briatore, Vladislav Doronin and Rihanna\u2019s current boyfriend, Toyota heir Hassan Jameel.</p> <p>At the beginning of the year, she was rumoured to have been seeing Liam Payne, former One Directioner and Cheryl Tweedy\u2019s ex. Is she in love at the moment? \u201cYes,\u201d she says coyly. How does that feel? \u201cFucking hectic!\u201d She doesn\u2019t like talking about her personal life, she reminds me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s actually not someone that you know, but my heart\u2026 my heart is happy. I love a lot of people for different reasons. And the other thing that\u2019s taken me a while to understand in my growing up is that you have to accept and love yourself first, and not be validated by someone else.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell can drift in and out of self-help vernacular, from poised motivational speaker to south London realness. She\u2019s been in the Narcotics Anonymous programme and therapy for years, which seems to have done her enormous good. \u201cI want to stay in the light,\u201d she explains. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in darkness. I don\u2019t have depression, but mental health is something that I care about a lot and it makes me happy to know that [the UK] is taking mental health seriously now. I think it\u2019s great what [Princes] William and Harry have done in bringing that to the forefront. In the 90s, saying you had a shrink \u2013 people would look at you like you\u2019re nuts. They are such old cliches but, whatever career you do, you need to have someone you can talk to. It\u2019s healthy. Recovery is healthy. That was my first fight and I stand by it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5/480_117_2160_1542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elite modeling agency founder John Casablancas w. model Naomi Campbell at the Red Zone night club in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Elite model agency founder John Casablancas in 1990.

Is she aware of how beautiful she is and the reaction she gets? \u201cNo. I mean, people say: \u2018Oh, you bring light or a presence, blah blah\u2019, but that\u2019s their point of view. It\u2019s not easy to be\u2026\u201d She skips over saying \u201cbeautiful\u201d and instead says: \u201cIt\u2019s harder for a woman to be strong and put on a pedestal. I want to be approachable! I mean yes, it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d She cackles. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a curse.\u201d</p> <p>I tell her that at the launch of Vogue Arabia in Qatar a couple of years ago, I watched her glide through the room. Lauryn Hill performed a rare set at the party, and while Campbell was at the front, singing along to Ready or Not and filming it on her phone, dozens of people were simply taking pictures of her. \u201cHaha, Lauryn is a real one. An original. You know, afterwards we asked her if she would do Fashion For Relief in Cannes and she came and did 12 songs.\u201d Hill is famous for not turning up to her own gigs, so there\u2019s an appealing irony in the fact that she and Campbell, two perennially late stars, showed up for each other. \u201cWe\u2019re all growing here, trying to get it right this time round,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cNo one is perfect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c98c6715704245781ae83ec4318515a8b149e1e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c98c6715704245781ae83ec4318515a8b149e1e1/0_0_5943_7390/804.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell photographed in London Oct 2019\" width=\"804\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chemise by Thom Browne NY.

Does she worry about staying relevant? \u201cI hear that word a lot.

It belongs to me, and I can be me, and not have to worry about how it\u2019s edited.\u201d There is a lot more in the pipeline, including two books, which she promises aren\u2019t memoirs, but won\u2019t reveal more.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to write a story just to write a story,\u201d she says, smiling, switching smoothly back to humanitarian, Miss World mode. \u201cI want it to be for young women, to inspire them, or help them in some way. I\u2019m blessed at the opportunities I still have \u2013 but how many times was I called a bitch, because I stood up for myself back in the day? Finally it\u2019s balanced out.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s no secret that Naomi Campbell doesn\u2019t like interviews. After 33 years in the business, and a string of tabloid-baiting moments, the model has acquired a reputation for being surly, formidable, downright difficult. Our original meeting is cancelled an hour or so before we are due to meet \u2013 Campbell cites \u201cterrific illness\u201d \u2013 but a promise is made to reschedule, with the possibility that she might be free over the weekend. Or that we might end up speaking by phone. But then the text arrives: we are on, for Sunday at 4pm. Give or take an hour, Campbell keeps to her word. Her publicist and I chat in the lobby of The Dorchester hotel in London, while I mentally prepare for the full force of her legendary froideur. It is almost alarming, then, to find Campbell making jokes in a suite at the hotel, where she is alone, resting an injured leg on the sofa, smoking a cigarette, full of pussycat charm. At 49, she still looks otherworldly: a body, as Bono once put it, handmade by God, and skin so glowing it looks airbrushed. The era-defining cheekbones are framed by a sweep of immaculate hair; in the golden-hour light she looks luminous, dressed in a green chiffon Sacai jumpsuit and tractor sole Chelsea boots. She shows her publicist and me her leg: her knee is swollen like a melon, the result of tumbling on the stairs at an art party earlier in the week. She is worried that she won\u2019t be able to fly if it doesn\u2019t heal soon. \u201cClots are no joke,\u201d she says. \u201c[Doctors] stopped me from flying for six weeks two years ago. I do not want that again.\u201d Inexplicably, she loves being in the air, where she spends an astonishing amount of time. Campbell\u2019s fortnight has already included at least half a dozen flights, with several more in the coming days: New York (where she lives) to Paris to London to Paris to New York to Arizona to Los Angeles, and so on. Earlier this year, a YouTube video of Campbell\u2019s \u201cflight routine\u201d, which includes thoroughly disinfecting every surface and carrying her own seat cover and blanket, went viral, to the delight of a growing army of younger fans. Propping her leg back up on the velvet seat, she looks me over and then tells her publicist to leave. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine, I don\u2019t need you,\u201d she says, putting out her cigarette. Once we\u2019re alone, she starts by thanking me for my journalism. \u201cI wanted to meet you in person. I\u2019ve watched and read what you\u2019ve done in the past. I like that you\u2019re very honest and seem transparent and straightforward.\u201d It\u2019s a bold move: I can feel any difficult questions being expertly manoeuvred out of the room. \u201cI like what you wrote when you defended me, without me having to speak,\u201d she adds. I can only manage an embarrassed thank you. Campbell is referring to a column I wrote two years ago, in response to an interview with the former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman. Speaking in the same week that her successor Edward Enninful published his first Vogue, Shulman denied that she had held any unconscious bias, despite the fact that in the course of more than 300 issues and 25 years as editor, only a dozen covers had featured a black person. Two were Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, suggesting that a black star would need to be one of the most famous women on the planet before they were under consideration. Campbell, one of the world\u2019s top five models for more than three decades, featured on only five. In the interview, Shulman described Campbell as aggressive, before arguing that it was offensive to call her racist, \u201cbecause actually my son\u2019s grandfather was one of the civil rights leaders\u201d. Campbell raises an eyebrow at the drama that interview unleashed. \u201cYou really get to see people\u2019s colours,\u201d she laughs. \u201cLiterally.\u201d Enninful\u2019s appointment at Vogue, and his subsequent hiring of Campbell as a contributing editor, is part of a sea change in the mainstream. As the TV writer and producer Lena Waithe (Master of None, Dear White People) put it: \u201cPeople of colour are in a very interesting position right now. We\u2019re more than just in vogue. We are the culture.\u201d Campbell would agree. \u201cI feel a difference on many levels now \u2013 but someone I know recently called it a \u2018cult\u2019,\u201d she says, visibly irate. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that way when you had everything, was it? You wouldn\u2019t say that when you were getting everything handed on a plate, and things were coming your way constantly.\u201d She puts out another cigarette. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person where, with my friends \u2013 and I take that word very seriously \u2013 I\u2019m happy for what they get. So to hear this called a \u2018cult\u2019, that was like, \u2018Wait a second: so you want me to feel bad now that things are turning the other way?\u2019\u201d She makes an incredulous face. \u201cNo. We just want balance, end of story. I won\u2019t do an all-black show, for instance, because it would be hypocritical given what I\u2019ve stood for, for so long.\u201d Which is what? \u201cBalanced inclusion.\u201d Campbell says she was offered \u201ctons of money\u201d to do an exclusively black show recently, but turned it down. \u201cI can see clearly when brands want diversity because they get it and think it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2013 and the ones who just think it will look bad if they don\u2019t.\u201d She tells me her shoot for this magazine marks the first time she has ever worked with a black photographer \u201con a mainstream publication\u201d, including the Vogues and other glossies. She wanted to be shot by 26-year-old Campbell Addy, she says, because she is continually excited by the new. \u201cI embrace young people and their creativity, it\u2019s fun for me. I\u2019m happy for all the new talent and proud to be here right now, witnessing all this music and culture and the lifestyle, and the way it moves in fashion. Gianni [Versace] always said it would mix like this, and it finally did.\u201d In the past, Campbell was pitted against rivals such as Tyra Banks, and made to feel as if the slice of the pie available to a black model was so small that only one could succeed. \u201cSome people think I wanted it to be that way,\u201d she says. Her cat-like eyes blaze. \u201cI did not want it that way. If I wasn\u2019t there, there would be no one, and we have to have presence.\u201d Would it be fair to say that she campaigns more for diversity now because she is more comfortable in her skin? \u201cIt\u2019s not that I feel comfortable. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been speaking about it more \u2013 I think I\u2019ve just been doing more. Everybody knows Africa is not new to me and I\u2019ve been working on projects there since 1994.\u201d She talks at length about being \u201ca global changemaker\u201d in a programme pushing French luxury company the Kering Group and others to invest in fashion colleges in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. \u201cSo many companies call themselves a global operation and they\u2019re not. They\u2019re not, because they\u2019ve missed out a continent of 54 countries with extremely educated people, who deserve to be able to learn the same skills and have the opportunities we do.\u201d Campbell is of Chinese-Jamaican heritage and was raised by her grandmother and aunts in south London, while her mother toured Europe as a professional dancer. Despite this, she says she is happiest when in Africa. \u201cI feel at peace on the continent,\u201d she says, regal and beatific. \u201cA very real inner peace.\u201d She is a complex, fascinating mix of a character, at times seeming to play up to her own legend as both fabulous and flawed. On the one hand, she founded Fashion For Relief in 2005, a charity catwalk show and high-profile auction that rallies the industry to cough up for her causes; she has raised more than $15m to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and the ebola epidemic across west Africa. On the other, she has been convicted of assault four times: for throwing a phone at her assistant, another at her housekeeper, for kicking a police officer and for hitting a paparazzo with her handbag. She was also made to take the witness stand in the infamous \u201cblood diamonds\u201d trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor. Part of the prosecution\u2019s case rested on a dinner at Nelson Mandela\u2019s home, after which Taylor gifted Campbell what she told the court she thought were \u201cdirty rocks\u201d. At the same time, she inspires fierce loyalty. Younger models, such as Adut Akech and Anok Yai, routinely cite her as a mentor and protective role model. Her close friends, such as the photographer Steven Meisel, and designers Marc Jacobs and Kim Jones, say they can count on her for unconditional support. She was mentored and adored by Mandela and couturier Azzedine Ala\u00efa, who named her their honorary granddaughter and daughter, respectively. Yet she has also been ambushed by criticism in her television interviews, most notably by Oprah, Tyra Banks and Barbara Walters, who, respectively, have chided her for being \u201ca petulant diva\u201d, \u201ca bully\u201d and \u201ca bitch\u201d. To her credit, Campbell responded each time with measured grace, sticking to a script that she stands by years later: that she isn\u2019t perfect, that she isn\u2019t proud of everything she has done, and remains a work-in-progress. As she emphasises again now, eyes coolly narrowed: \u201cI will not be held hostage to my past.\u201d It\u2019s the same line she delivered, quietly seething, in a recent video statement on Being Naomi, her YouTube channel (308K subscribers), responding to what she describes as a character assassination by the Mail On Sunday this August. On learning that Campbell would be receiving the British Fashion Council\u2019s prestigious icon award in December, the paper went to town on her alleged history of keeping \u201cvery rum chums\u201d, linking her to disgraced sexual predators Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein, both of whom she has been photographed with. It felt like a snide and unfair reach, I say. \u201cThank you!\u201d says Campbell. \u201cI\u2019ve met thousands of people at events and been photographed with them \u2013 there are pictures of me with everyone. Are you going to single me out, when there are hundreds of people pictured with the same people, who you don\u2019t care to mention?\u201d Campbell rolls her eyes. \u201cDo me a fucking favour. I won\u2019t sit there and roll over and take that shit. We all know what that\u2019s about\u2026 I\u2019ve seen how they treat Raheem Sterling, how they speak about Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams. I don\u2019t know how Meghan Markle deals with this and I\u2019m really glad she\u2019s taken action to defend herself.\u201d The Duchess of Sussex is currently suing the Mail On Sunday for infringement of her privacy; in 2004, Campbell successfully won her own privacy case against the Daily Mirror, when the then editor Piers Morgan published pictures of her attending Narcotics Anonymous. She says she hasn\u2019t met Markle yet, \u201cand I don\u2019t have plans to\u201d, but \u201cwhen I heard [she was taking legal action], I was like \u2018Bravo. Good for her.\u2019\u201d Campbell never uses the word \u201cracism\u201d, but it is an elephantine presence in the room. Thirty-three years is a remarkable stint in any industry, and in modelling much more so. But Campbell says she is looking forward to turning 50 next year and has already planned her party. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of being 50. I\u2019m looking forward to a good old dance, too. I want to make sure I dance the night away, surrounded by people I love and who have been with me through thick and thin. I just want us to be in a beautiful place I have chosen.\u201d She smiles. \u201cNow it\u2019s about working out the logistics.\u201d She is likely to invite old friends, who she credits for helping her along the way, like Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista, who told designers Dolce &amp; Gabbana they wouldn\u2019t work for them unless they hired Naomi, too. There were others: Yves Saint Laurent, who threatened to pull advertising unless French Vogue gave her a cover. She rose through the ranks at a time when \u201cdesigners and models worked together, had dinner together and with each other. All the designers I loved, Azzedine and Gianni and Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen and Vivienne [Westwood] all loved each other and enjoyed each other\u2019s company. I chose right \u2013 I chose creativity first. I didn\u2019t choose them for money and I learnt so much. Being Papa [Ala\u00efa]\u2019s daughter was an incredible experience \u2013 he taught me about art and furniture and so much about his craft. It was unique.\u201d But her rise also came at a time when the predatory excesses of powerful men was the industry norm, and one wonders how much she might have seen or known over the years. John Casablancas, the late founder of Elite Model Management who signed \u201cthe supers\u201d (Evangelista, Cindy Crawford and Campbell) was notorious for sleeping with his teenage models. He moved in social circles with Epstein and Donald Trump, who founded his own modelling agency, ran beauty pageants and has admitted using both to pick up women. Even before #MeToo, the three men had faced allegations of exploiting vulnerable young girls. How does Campbell think the fashion industry has dealt with sexual abuse since then? \u201cOf course I have empathy and concern for those it did happen to and I feel for their trauma, psychologically how it affects them,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cBut it never happened to me.\u201d (We catch up later on the phone, and when I ask her more about how the industry enabled the abuse of beautiful women, Campbell grows frustrated. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any of that shit, because thank God for my armour, my being called a bad bitch \u2013 I was lucky it never happened to me. I was protected by my angels Azzedine Ala\u00efa, Gianni [Versace] and Yves Saint Laurent.\u201d) Campbell was represented by Elite from 1987 to 1993 and was reportedly dismissed by Casablancas for being rude and impossible. She denies this. \u201cI actually have to tell you something: I was only with Elite for a very small period. And [Casablancas] didn\u2019t fire me \u2013 I left. But I will say that when I was with him, I didn\u2019t see him with Trump. I didn\u2019t witness that behaviour.\u201d Perhaps it is fair to say that when it comes to her friends, including Michael Jackson, to whom she dedicated a recent post on Instagram, Campbell\u2019s real blind spot is fierce, unwavering loyalty. \u201cYou come for someone that I love and care about, I\u2019m defending them,\u201d she says. Loyalty and discretion come up a lot. It\u2019s why, she says, she\u2019s on good terms with all her exes \u201cexcept one\u201d; the candidates include U2\u2019s Adam Clayton, Robert De Niro, and multi-millionaire buisnessmen Flavio Briatore, Vladislav Doronin and Rihanna\u2019s current boyfriend, Toyota heir Hassan Jameel. At the beginning of the year, she was rumoured to have been seeing Liam Payne, former One Directioner and Cheryl Tweedy\u2019s ex. Is she in love at the moment? \u201cYes,\u201d she says coyly. How does that feel? \u201cFucking hectic!\u201d She doesn\u2019t like talking about her personal life, she reminds me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s actually not someone that you know, but my heart\u2026 my heart is happy. I love a lot of people for different reasons. And the other thing that\u2019s taken me a while to understand in my growing up is that you have to accept and love yourself first, and not be validated by someone else.\u201d Campbell can drift in and out of self-help vernacular, from poised motivational speaker to south London realness. She\u2019s been in the Narcotics Anonymous programme and therapy for years, which seems to have done her enormous good. \u201cI want to stay in the light,\u201d she explains. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in darkness. I don\u2019t have depression, but mental health is something that I care about a lot and it makes me happy to know that [the UK] is taking mental health seriously now. I think it\u2019s great what [Princes] William and Harry have done in bringing that to the forefront. In the 90s, saying you had a shrink \u2013 people would look at you like you\u2019re nuts. They are such old cliches but, whatever career you do, you need to have someone you can talk to. It\u2019s healthy. Recovery is healthy. That was my first fight and I stand by it.\u201d She has mellowed in recent years, and says people would be surprised to know that \u201cI don\u2019t really react any more\u201d, and that she is vulnerable, \u201cbut only in my [shoots] and with the people, my friends, I feel safe with.\u201d Nonetheless, she still sets off a distinctive, electric ripple in every room she enters. Is she aware of how beautiful she is and the reaction she gets? \u201cNo. I mean, people say: \u2018Oh, you bring light or a presence, blah blah\u2019, but that\u2019s their point of view. It\u2019s not easy to be\u2026\u201d She skips over saying \u201cbeautiful\u201d and instead says: \u201cIt\u2019s harder for a woman to be strong and put on a pedestal. I want to be approachable! I mean yes, it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d She cackles. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a curse.\u201d I tell her that at the launch of Vogue Arabia in Qatar a couple of years ago, I watched her glide through the room. Lauryn Hill performed a rare set at the party, and while Campbell was at the front, singing along to Ready or Not and filming it on her phone, dozens of people were simply taking pictures of her. \u201cHaha, Lauryn is a real one. An original. You know, afterwards we asked her if she would do Fashion For Relief in Cannes and she came and did 12 songs.\u201d Hill is famous for not turning up to her own gigs, so there\u2019s an appealing irony in the fact that she and Campbell, two perennially late stars, showed up for each other. \u201cWe\u2019re all growing here, trying to get it right this time round,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cNo one is perfect.\u201d She munches on her second shortbread biscuit. Does she worry about staying relevant? \u201cI hear that word a lot. People talk about it a lot.\u201d She looks unimpressed. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to stay relevant, I\u2019m not trying to keep up with anyone or compete.\u201d Her pivot to vlogging and an energetic Instagram presence are, \u201cbecause I like the fact that I can express myself and have control of my content. It belongs to me, and I can be me, and not have to worry about how it\u2019s edited.\u201d There is a lot more in the pipeline, including two books, which she promises aren\u2019t memoirs, but won\u2019t reveal more. \u201cI don\u2019t want to write a story just to write a story,\u201d she says, smiling, switching smoothly back to humanitarian, Miss World mode. \u201cI want it to be for young women, to inspire them, or help them in some way. I\u2019m blessed at the opportunities I still have \u2013 but how many times was I called a bitch, because I stood up for myself back in the day? Finally it\u2019s balanced out. But it\u2019s not changed me. This is the way I\u2019ve always been.\u201d Styling: Jenke-Ahmed Tailly. Styling assistants: Nafissatou Niang and Preeti Bhambri. Hair: Lorenzo Barcella.

      "bodyText": "Three more former altar boys have claimed they were sexually abused by two priests in the Vatican, as the child abuse scandal that has rocked the Catholic church zeroed in for a second time on its headquarters. The allegations of abuse in the Vatican\u2019s youth seminary, to be set out in an Italian TV show on Sunday, date back to the 1980s and 90s when the boys were aged between 10 and 14. The accusations come two months after the Vatican said it would seek to indict Father Gabriele Martinelli, 28, for allegedly abusing several altar boys in 2012 when he trained at the St Pius X youth seminary. That move was prompted by the Italian show Le Iene\u2019s first investigation into the school in 2017. The Vatican said in September that an indictment was also being sought against a former rector at the youth seminary, Father Enrico Radice, who was accused of aiding and abetting the alleged crimes. The Catholic church has faced thousands of child sexual abuse allegations from around the world but Le Iene\u2019s investigation in 2017 was the first time claims of paedophilia within the Vatican\u2019s walls were exposed. \u201cWe decided to keep digging as we had the feeling that the previous cases were not isolated,\u201d said Gaetano Pecoraro, one of the two authors of the investigation. \u201cThere were more victims and more priests involved in sexual abuse within the Vatican.\u201d In the latest investigation, three former altar boys who served at papal masses claimed they were sexual abused by two priests, one a teacher. In the programme, seen by the Guardian, one of the victims alleges that one of the priests, who was managing the school\u2019s communal showers, tried to remove his bathrobe. \u201cHe wanted to undress me,\u201d the victim alleges. \u201cI tried to wriggle away.

Also scoring 81% was Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label NV, the most expensive of the champagne Best Buys in the test at \u00a335 a bottle. It was described as \u201cfresh, fruity and slightly malty\u201d, and experts said it would have festive drinkers \u201cgoing back for more\u201d. This year\u2019s most affordable Best Buy champagne was Waitrose Brut NV, marginally in third place overall with a score of 80%. Judges noted its aroma of \u201cbuttery baked goods\u201d. The Guardian wine writer Fiona Beckett said: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised to find an own-label champagne doing so well; they\u2019re generally great quality and no one should feel self-conscious about buying them. They don\u2019t have the same promotional overheads and are bought in huge volume which keeps down the price. These days champagne is often as cheap or cheaper than English sparkling wine.\u201d The cheapest champagne tasted this year was from Lidl. Its Comte de Senneval Brut NV scored 77%, and was singled out for its \u201cbeautiful touch of apple strudel\u201d. However, some tasters admitted they found it lacking in flavour. Lidl said its shoppers \u201cnever have to compromise\u201d on anything in their baskets, from everyday basics to champagne. Waitrose said it was \u201cthrilled\u201d to be \u201crubbing shoulders\u201d with famous bubbly brands. The panel also tasted 12 sparkling whites from Italy, Spain, France and England, all priced at \u00a312 or less. The highest scoring overall was Tesco Finest Prosecco Brut, at \u00a38 a bottle, attracting a Best Buy award and a score of 76%. It was declared a \u201cclean, classic prosecco\u201d with \u201cfruity and floral notes\u201d. Italian prosecco remains the best-selling sparkling wine in the UK. British shoppers bought 117m bottles in 2018, compared with fewer than 24m bottles of champagne, according to recent figures from the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. For those keen to serve an English bubbly this year, Aldi\u2019s Angel and Four Masterstroke (\u00a310) scored 70%. Made in Gloucestershire, the English fizz delivers a \u201cdistinct aroma of elderflower\u201d, and most of the panel enjoyed its zesty sweetness, though one was deterred by a \u201csulphuric nose and sour flavours\u201d.",

Small saplings of birch have invaded the cleared ground, but many more trees are being pushed into the soil by hand.</p> <p>The bracken and rhododendron that had overrun the hillside took heavy machinery three months to rip out. \u201cWhen you disturb the soil, it becomes a wood very quickly,\u201d says Milbank.</p> <p>\u201cBut the Forestry Commission forced us to put in Scots pine as well. The entire area could be birch without spending a penny, but you have to be seen to be doing something to justify the [planting grants].\u201d</p> <p>This former sheep and cattle farm, <a href=\"http://www.doddingtonnorthforest.com/\">Doddington North</a>, is being converted into England\u2019s largest private new woodland in 30 years, with 680,000 trees being planted over the 350 hectares. Moving down the hill, Milbank points and says: \u201cThe reason we were able to raise the investment is that \u2013 sitka spruce.\u201d</p> <p>The commercial timber tree will occupy 40% of the land, with native broadleaf trees such as birch, alder, aspen and oak on about a third and the rest managed as open grassland. Milbank, whose company Pennine Forestry is running the project, hopes it will encourage more wildlife, such as the red squirrels that live in an adjoining wood, and the kestrels that already fly overhead searching for the shrews that dart between tussocks.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/02/do-it-now-uk-must-set-zero-carbon-target-for-2050-say-official-advisers\">UK needs 1.5bn more trees</a>, according to the government\u2019s official climate change advisers, to suck up carbon dioxide and help restore wildlife. But the question of how they will be delivered \u2013 private or public, commercial or wild \u2013 remains open, despite the pioneering effort at Doddington North, which should be completed this winter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ace5fce0fb8499151b4a25f9fdf255fd31a141d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ace5fce0fb8499151b4a25f9fdf255fd31a141d/0_0_4582_3055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doddington North Moor forestation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Trayte reckons he has planted more than 2m trees in his 12-year career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James Trayte, who leads the team of planters, has done more than most.

What brings me back now is the money.\u201d</p> <p>Milbank says: \u201cMost local people have been incredibly supportive of the project, but not everyone. They thought we were taking away good agricultural land to put in trees.\u201d But, if the national tree target is to be met, he says: \u201cThere will have to be some land that comes out of agricultural production and goes into forestry.\u201d Much of the timber \u2013 and the carbon it contains \u2013 gets locked up in new buildings, he points out.</p> <p>All the saplings planted are UK grown, but global heating is already exerting an influence. \u201cWe take them from nurseries in the south of England, as that will be the climate we have here in the north in the future,\u201d Milbank says. Very few plastic guards are used, though that has meant killing deer that would destroy the saplings and putting up fences. \u201cIt will be lovely to have deer back in here in 10 years\u201d, when the trees are established, he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e722aa706351d066f53cd32a5b15095f2348294d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e722aa706351d066f53cd32a5b15095f2348294d/0_0_4582_3055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Planting a sapling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Planting a sapling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Milbank is clear that management is essential to create and maintain woodland, such as removing some trees to let light through the canopy, a task that large wild herbivores would have done in the past. He thinks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/21/rewild-quarter-uk-fight-climate-crisis-campaigners-urge\">rewilding 25% of the nation</a>, as proposed by Rewilding Britain, is unrealistic: \u201cI can\u2019t see land just being left \u2013 we are too small an island, with 66 million people.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca Wrigley, at Rewilding Britain, says: \u201cWe are not suggesting people are taken off the land across the country and that everything is fully rewilded.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis whole area wants to be a wood,\u201d says Edward Milbank, sweeping his arm across the former hill farm in Northumberland. Small saplings of birch have invaded the cleared ground, but many more trees are being pushed into the soil by hand. The bracken and rhododendron that had overrun the hillside took heavy machinery three months to rip out. \u201cWhen you disturb the soil, it becomes a wood very quickly,\u201d says Milbank. \u201cBut the Forestry Commission forced us to put in Scots pine as well. The entire area could be birch without spending a penny, but you have to be seen to be doing something to justify the [planting grants].\u201d This former sheep and cattle farm, Doddington North, is being converted into England\u2019s largest private new woodland in 30 years, with 680,000 trees being planted over the 350 hectares. Moving down the hill, Milbank points and says: \u201cThe reason we were able to raise the investment is that \u2013 sitka spruce.\u201d The commercial timber tree will occupy 40% of the land, with native broadleaf trees such as birch, alder, aspen and oak on about a third and the rest managed as open grassland. Milbank, whose company Pennine Forestry is running the project, hopes it will encourage more wildlife, such as the red squirrels that live in an adjoining wood, and the kestrels that already fly overhead searching for the shrews that dart between tussocks. The UK needs 1.5bn more trees, according to the government\u2019s official climate change advisers, to suck up carbon dioxide and help restore wildlife. But the question of how they will be delivered \u2013 private or public, commercial or wild \u2013 remains open, despite the pioneering effort at Doddington North, which should be completed this winter. James Trayte, who leads the team of planters, has done more than most. He reckons he has planted more than 2m trees in his 12-year career. Out since dawn, he has planted about 2,000 so far today, plucking the two-year old sitka saplings from bags around his waist, then prodding them into the hole he makes with a deft twist of the planting spade. \u201cIt was pure love at the start, getting paid to walk around on the hillsides, battling the weather.\u201d After 12 winter seasons, the best time to plant trees, he is more blunt about the motivation. \u201cIt\u2019s a brutal job and my elbow is going. What brings me back now is the money.\u201d Milbank says: \u201cMost local people have been incredibly supportive of the project, but not everyone. They thought we were taking away good agricultural land to put in trees.\u201d But, if the national tree target is to be met, he says: \u201cThere will have to be some land that comes out of agricultural production and goes into forestry.\u201d Much of the timber \u2013 and the carbon it contains \u2013 gets locked up in new buildings, he points out. All the saplings planted are UK grown, but global heating is already exerting an influence. \u201cWe take them from nurseries in the south of England, as that will be the climate we have here in the north in the future,\u201d Milbank says. Very few plastic guards are used, though that has meant killing deer that would destroy the saplings and putting up fences. \u201cIt will be lovely to have deer back in here in 10 years\u201d, when the trees are established, he says. Milbank is clear that management is essential to create and maintain woodland, such as removing some trees to let light through the canopy, a task that large wild herbivores would have done in the past. He thinks rewilding 25% of the nation, as proposed by Rewilding Britain, is unrealistic: \u201cI can\u2019t see land just being left \u2013 we are too small an island, with 66 million people.\u201d Rebecca Wrigley, at Rewilding Britain, says: \u201cWe are not suggesting people are taken off the land across the country and that everything is fully rewilded. We\u2019d like to see a mosaic, maximising rewilding but also production where that is necessary. Rewilding has to work for people and nature, economy and ecology.\u201d But she thinks management is a forestry mindset and often not necessary: \u201cWoodlands have been doing OK for millions of years without human management, though obviously you need fully functional ecosystems.\u201d The government is not far off track in delivering the 11m trees over five years in England that it promised to fund in 2017: 3.6m were planted in the last two seasons, about 2,300 hectares. But, overall, planting in England fell in 2019. There was a jump in UK figures, thanks to Scottish planting, but only to 13,400 ha. That is well below the 20,000 ha target set for 2020 by the government advisers, the Committee on Climate Change.

      "body": "<p>For such an unpredictable and frequently adventurous film-maker, it\u2019s interesting how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/13/by-the-grace-of-god-francois-ozon-catholic-church-abuse-scandal\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Ozon</a> seemed to slip into the slightly lesser-valued European auteur establishment: a respected name who routinely pops up in major festivals, gets good reviews and wins the odd prize or two, yet rarely inspires the ardent director-worship reserved for the likes of Haneke or Almod\u00f3var.</p> <p>Despite alternating like no one else between handsome French classicism and queer, sinuous genre kink, Ozon, now 52, occasionally seems at risk of being taken for granted. His latest, the strong, stirring Catholic church abuse drama<strong> By the Grace of God</strong>, practically asks to be underestimated, offering viewers familiar-seeming procedural trappings before the wallop of its emotional inquiry hits. (It\u2019s still in cinemas, though also <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-by-the-grace-of-god\" title=\"\">available to stream</a> via Curzon Home Cinema.)</p> <p>Mubi, however, is offering its subscribers a reminder of when Ozon\u2019s cinema seemed newer and more transgressive. Its Fran\u00e7ois Ozon: Loving Provocation <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">mini-retrospective</a> is primarily focused on his early years, when his balance of sensual daring and elegant form briefly marked him as an enfant terrible. His wildly surreal psychosexual debut feature <em>Sitcom</em> \u2013 sadly unavailable to stream from any UK outlet \u2013 isn\u2019t part of it, but things kick off nicely with his next film, the jaggedly thrilling and rarely discussed <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/criminal-lovers\" title=\"\">Criminal Lovers</a></strong>. Now 20 years old, it\u2019s Ozon\u2019s most brutal film, bearing the imprint of such 90s provocateurs as Larry Clark and Tarantino. It shares the latter\u2019s B-movie fixation in its study of teens committing murder and facing Grimm brothers-like consequences, though there\u2019s a cool, visceral strain of poetry running throughout.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZJG81yiego\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tZJG81yiego?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZJG81yiego\">Watch the trailer for By the Grace of God.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Things get a little more polished with Ozon\u2019s next film, and the next in Mubi\u2019s selection: <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/water-drops-on-burning-rocks\" title=\"\">Water Drops on Burning Rocks</a></strong>, adapted from an unproduced Rainer Werner Fassbinder play, is a polysexual tangle of hearts and libidos, beginning with a middle-aged businessman\u2019s seduction of an ostensibly straight 20-year-old, and growing more cruelly complex and grimly funny through each of its four acts.</p> <p>It\u2019s a slinky, nasty pleasure, but you couldn\u2019t have anticipated that just a few months later Ozon would make the leap to <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/under-the-sand\" title=\"\">Under the Sand</a></strong>, Mubi\u2019s next pick, which remains his masterpiece, and one of the new century\u2019s essential films. Charlotte Rampling\u2019s career-reviving performance as an English professor sinking into denial and delusion following her husband\u2019s disappearance is as fine-grained and incrementally devastating as screen acting gets, but Ozon\u2019s balance of calm technical control and bleeding-below-the-surface humanity takes equal credit for the film\u2019s eerie staying power. Mubi\u2019s selection then skips ahead a few years to 2004\u2019s told-in-reverse marriage story <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/5x2\" title=\"\">5x2</a></strong>, another of his \u201cmature\u201d efforts, and one that still plays rather well as an elegant narrative experiment, even if the unfolding relationship at its centre never quite reaches the heart.</p> <p>If you\u2019re looking to fill in more Ozon gaps, other streaming services will provide when it comes to most of his features.

      "bodyText": "For such an unpredictable and frequently adventurous film-maker, it\u2019s interesting how Fran\u00e7ois Ozon seemed to slip into the slightly lesser-valued European auteur establishment: a respected name who routinely pops up in major festivals, gets good reviews and wins the odd prize or two, yet rarely inspires the ardent director-worship reserved for the likes of Haneke or Almod\u00f3var. Despite alternating like no one else between handsome French classicism and queer, sinuous genre kink, Ozon, now 52, occasionally seems at risk of being taken for granted. His latest, the strong, stirring Catholic church abuse drama By the Grace of God, practically asks to be underestimated, offering viewers familiar-seeming procedural trappings before the wallop of its emotional inquiry hits. (It\u2019s still in cinemas, though also available to stream via Curzon Home Cinema.) Mubi, however, is offering its subscribers a reminder of when Ozon\u2019s cinema seemed newer and more transgressive. Its Fran\u00e7ois Ozon: Loving Provocation mini-retrospective is primarily focused on his early years, when his balance of sensual daring and elegant form briefly marked him as an enfant terrible. His wildly surreal psychosexual debut feature Sitcom \u2013 sadly unavailable to stream from any UK outlet \u2013 isn\u2019t part of it, but things kick off nicely with his next film, the jaggedly thrilling and rarely discussed Criminal Lovers. Now 20 years old, it\u2019s Ozon\u2019s most brutal film, bearing the imprint of such 90s provocateurs as Larry Clark and Tarantino. It shares the latter\u2019s B-movie fixation in its study of teens committing murder and facing Grimm brothers-like consequences, though there\u2019s a cool, visceral strain of poetry running throughout. Things get a little more polished with Ozon\u2019s next film, and the next in Mubi\u2019s selection: Water Drops on Burning Rocks, adapted from an unproduced Rainer Werner Fassbinder play, is a polysexual tangle of hearts and libidos, beginning with a middle-aged businessman\u2019s seduction of an ostensibly straight 20-year-old, and growing more cruelly complex and grimly funny through each of its four acts. It\u2019s a slinky, nasty pleasure, but you couldn\u2019t have anticipated that just a few months later Ozon would make the leap to Under the Sand, Mubi\u2019s next pick, which remains his masterpiece, and one of the new century\u2019s essential films. Charlotte Rampling\u2019s career-reviving performance as an English professor sinking into denial and delusion following her husband\u2019s disappearance is as fine-grained and incrementally devastating as screen acting gets, but Ozon\u2019s balance of calm technical control and bleeding-below-the-surface humanity takes equal credit for the film\u2019s eerie staying power. Mubi\u2019s selection then skips ahead a few years to 2004\u2019s told-in-reverse marriage story 5x2, another of his \u201cmature\u201d efforts, and one that still plays rather well as an elegant narrative experiment, even if the unfolding relationship at its centre never quite reaches the heart. If you\u2019re looking to fill in more Ozon gaps, other streaming services will provide when it comes to most of his features. (His wonderful short films, available on DVD, haven\u2019t hit the UK streaming menu yet.) Among the most fun: the Deneuve-starring double shot of high-camp period rompery in 8 Women and Potiche (both available on iTunes); the crafty, shape-shifting storytelling games of In the House (on Amazon); and the delicious bad taste of last year\u2019s loopy erotic noir L\u2019Amant double (Amazon again). Or return to the disquieting Charlotte Rampling realm with the illusory mystery Swimming Pool (iTunes), or the half-buried but winningly bittersweet melodrama Le Refuge (via Chili), the summery, Rohmer-esque breeze of which is all the more welcome in grey November. There\u2019s an Ozon for any season. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week Earthquake Bird (Netflix, 15) With all the viscous gloss you\u2019d expect given Ridley Scott\u2019s presence as producer, this westerners-adrift-in-Japan mystery is sleekly atmospheric and well acted by Alicia Vikander and Riley Keough) \u2013 though as a thriller it\u2019s a bit low-voltage. The Dead Don\u2019t Die (Universal, 15) Jim Jarmusch\u2019s slacker zom-com largely struck out with the critics, but if you approach it in the throwaway spirit with which it was made \u2013 and maybe a drink or two \u2013 there\u2019s silly, all-star fun to be had. The Lion King (Disney, PG) Yes, it made a billion at the global box office, but now that Disney\u2019s dead-eyed, \u201clive-action\u201d CGI remake of its swinging safari hit is available to view at home, is there any reason not to simply watch the more vibrant original instead? Werewolf (Eureka!, 15) It prowled under the radar in cinemas, but Polish director Adrian Panek\u2019s bold, teeth-bared fusion of horror film and Holocaust drama merits attention. The allegorical tightrope it walks is a tricky one, but accomplished with power and style. The African Queen (Eureka!, PG) If you pick up only one Hollywoodised African adventure this week, make it John Huston\u2019s still-sparky, humidly colourful 1951 odd-couple romance starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, here given a 4K restoration and generously tricked-out packaging.",

This book also addresses the major questions regarding human responsibility and possibilities for change. We live at what is probably the zenith of coral reef evolution in hundreds of millions of years in terms of their diversity and productivity, but human action might bring this all to an end within a few generations: \u201cIt is an extraordinary position that I still grapple with daily to understand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccc45607e007aa4cce24763180aa3bf72d837ab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccc45607e007aa4cce24763180aa3bf72d837ab8/252_1574_1275_764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A golden age of coral reef science \u2026 Callum Roberts and his wife, Julie Hawkins, in 1988.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A golden age of coral reef science \u2026 Callum Roberts and his wife, Julie Hawkins, in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coral reefs are, arguably, life\u2019s greatest miracle. Hugely productive ecosystems in nutrient-poor waters, they harbour a quarter of all marine diversity in less than 0.1% of the oceans\u2019 extent. On a healthy reef, top predators such as sharks are abundant, while life lower down the food chain appears to be scarce \u2013 a seeming inversion of the \u201cpyramid\u201d we\u2019re familiar with on land, where a vast savannah supports a herd of wildebeest, but only a few lions or leopards. (The solution to the apparent paradox is that life at the lower trophic levels on reefs provides abundant resources for predators but turns over very fast.)</p> <p>Despite their intense vibrancy, reefs are also vulnerable, both to direct human impacts such as overfishing, pollution and insensitive development, and to indirect impacts of the large-scale combustion of fossil fuels, which result in global heating and changes to ocean chemistry. In the past four decades, three pulses of heat have devastated many reefs around the world, including, in 2016 and 2017, the Great Barrier Reef. The risk to their future is unlike anything they have experienced in millions of years.</p> <p>There is already a rich literature, and to a lesser extent a filmography, on the threats they face and what, if anything, can best protect them. Among the highlights are John \u201cCharlie\u201d Veron\u2019s sober and devastating <em>A Reef in Time</em>, the gripping documentary film <em>Chasing Coral</em>, and <em>Coral Whisperers</em>, Irus Braverman\u2019s fluent account of 100 or so interviews with leading scientists and conservation managers. Journalists continue to document how the destruction of reefs impacts on the mental health of researchers, who report \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/13/climate-crisis-mental-health-environmental-anguish\" title=\"\">ecological grief</a>\u201d. Roberts is a humorous, determined expert, who has spent more than three decades trying to come to terms with such issues. As his book begins, he is a fresh-faced student assisting in some of the first detailed studies of coral reefs on the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Working in harsh conditions, blundering into embarrassing situations and sometimes exposing himself to danger, he is carried forward by \u201cthunderclaps of wonder\u201d. A few years later, and now a respected marine biologist, he is assessing the aftermath of the huge releases of oil into the Persian Gulf by Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces as they fled from Kuwait in the first Gulf war. Remarkably, some of the reefs here \u2013 among the most northern in the world \u2013 survive, having escaped the tide of pollution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"939c144f874b6d65692a5579c3a55654b0820142\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/939c144f874b6d65692a5579c3a55654b0820142/99_1245_1624_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Caribbean nassau grouper, from Reef Life by Callum Roberts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Now is the time for action, not mourning.\u2019 A Caribbean nassau grouper, from Reef Life by Callum Roberts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further adventures, from the Caribbean to the Maldives and far beyond, follow. In 2013, Roberts is in Australia supporting scientists and environmentalists who are trying to slow and even reverse the impact on the Great Barrier Reef of the development of new port facilities for the export of coal. By this time, scientists are warning that even a relatively small increase in the global average temperature, let alone the 2\u00ba Celsius or more that now looks probable, is likely to have a devastating impact on most of the world\u2019s reefs. Roberts finds himself deployed as part of what turns out to be an effective campaign to change minds regarding the proposed coastal development; by 2015 the opposition Labor Party come to power with a promise to protect the reef. It is poignant to read this in 2019, long after Australian voters have returned a government that does not appear to believe that the climate crisis should be a cause for concern.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know a single coral expert who is not haunted by doubt,\u201d Roberts writes. \u201cIt is already possible to glimpse the most dystopian of futures.\u201d But, he stresses, there are \u201chopeful strands\u201d. It has been found, for example that some corals can survive in hotter and more acidic waters than was previously thought. Further acclimation and adaptation may be possible in some instances. Genetic engineering to make more heat-resistant corals may be feasible, though controversial. But above all, according to Roberts, there is a role for well-managed marine parks. \u201cMost coral reef damage of the last couple of decades has been from manageable stresses like pollution, overfishing and development rather than climate change.\u201d Where these pressures are reduced, corals and the endless forms of life they support have a fighting chance.</p> <p>In a moving penultimate chapter, he describes a visit to Palmyra Atoll in the Pacific, the world\u2019s most isolated reef, and currently among its most intact. Palmyra is part of a huge US conservation zone called the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. Roberts, with his irrepressible warmth and passion, concludes: \u201cNow is the time for action, not mourning. There is everything to play for.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Reef Life: An Underwater Memoir by Callum Roberts is published by Profile (\u00a316.99) To order a copy go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/reef-life-9781788162159.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a> or call 020-3176 3837.

We live at what is probably the zenith of coral reef evolution in hundreds of millions of years in terms of their diversity and productivity, but human action might bring this all to an end within a few generations: \u201cIt is an extraordinary position that I still grapple with daily to understand.\u201d Coral reefs are, arguably, life\u2019s greatest miracle. Hugely productive ecosystems in nutrient-poor waters, they harbour a quarter of all marine diversity in less than 0.1% of the oceans\u2019 extent. On a healthy reef, top predators such as sharks are abundant, while life lower down the food chain appears to be scarce \u2013 a seeming inversion of the \u201cpyramid\u201d we\u2019re familiar with on land, where a vast savannah supports a herd of wildebeest, but only a few lions or leopards. (The solution to the apparent paradox is that life at the lower trophic levels on reefs provides abundant resources for predators but turns over very fast.) Despite their intense vibrancy, reefs are also vulnerable, both to direct human impacts such as overfishing, pollution and insensitive development, and to indirect impacts of the large-scale combustion of fossil fuels, which result in global heating and changes to ocean chemistry. In the past four decades, three pulses of heat have devastated many reefs around the world, including, in 2016 and 2017, the Great Barrier Reef. The risk to their future is unlike anything they have experienced in millions of years. There is already a rich literature, and to a lesser extent a filmography, on the threats they face and what, if anything, can best protect them. Among the highlights are John \u201cCharlie\u201d Veron\u2019s sober and devastating A Reef in Time, the gripping documentary film Chasing Coral, and Coral Whisperers, Irus Braverman\u2019s fluent account of 100 or so interviews with leading scientists and conservation managers. Journalists continue to document how the destruction of reefs impacts on the mental health of researchers, who report \u201cecological grief\u201d. Roberts is a humorous, determined expert, who has spent more than three decades trying to come to terms with such issues. As his book begins, he is a fresh-faced student assisting in some of the first detailed studies of coral reefs on the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Working in harsh conditions, blundering into embarrassing situations and sometimes exposing himself to danger, he is carried forward by \u201cthunderclaps of wonder\u201d. A few years later, and now a respected marine biologist, he is assessing the aftermath of the huge releases of oil into the Persian Gulf by Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces as they fled from Kuwait in the first Gulf war. Remarkably, some of the reefs here \u2013 among the most northern in the world \u2013 survive, having escaped the tide of pollution. Further adventures, from the Caribbean to the Maldives and far beyond, follow. In 2013, Roberts is in Australia supporting scientists and environmentalists who are trying to slow and even reverse the impact on the Great Barrier Reef of the development of new port facilities for the export of coal. By this time, scientists are warning that even a relatively small increase in the global average temperature, let alone the 2\u00ba Celsius or more that now looks probable, is likely to have a devastating impact on most of the world\u2019s reefs. Roberts finds himself deployed as part of what turns out to be an effective campaign to change minds regarding the proposed coastal development; by 2015 the opposition Labor Party come to power with a promise to protect the reef. It is poignant to read this in 2019, long after Australian voters have returned a government that does not appear to believe that the climate crisis should be a cause for concern. \u201cI don\u2019t know a single coral expert who is not haunted by doubt,\u201d Roberts writes. \u201cIt is already possible to glimpse the most dystopian of futures.\u201d But, he stresses, there are \u201chopeful strands\u201d. It has been found, for example that some corals can survive in hotter and more acidic waters than was previously thought. Further acclimation and adaptation may be possible in some instances. Genetic engineering to make more heat-resistant corals may be feasible, though controversial. But above all, according to Roberts, there is a role for well-managed marine parks. \u201cMost coral reef damage of the last couple of decades has been from manageable stresses like pollution, overfishing and development rather than climate change.\u201d Where these pressures are reduced, corals and the endless forms of life they support have a fighting chance. In a moving penultimate chapter, he describes a visit to Palmyra Atoll in the Pacific, the world\u2019s most isolated reef, and currently among its most intact. Palmyra is part of a huge US conservation zone called the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. Roberts, with his irrepressible warmth and passion, concludes: \u201cNow is the time for action, not mourning. There is everything to play for.\u201d \u2022 Reef Life: An Underwater Memoir by Callum Roberts is published by Profile (\u00a316.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

The volume is a collection of mini-biographies of \u201cgutsy\u201d women, and its intended mood, I surmise, is upbeat and inspirational. The subjects range from the learned 17th-century Mexican nun Sor Juana de la Cruz to the bracingly named Cherokee politician Wilma Mankiller. But behind the celebratory gloss the real \u201ctake-home\u201d, to use the requisite Ted Talk phrase, is this: toughen up. The fight is on.</p> <p>\u201cMy view,\u201d Hillary says, \u201cis that we are going to continue to progress \u2013 there is too much energy behind that, and women are not going to easily surrender to the pressures they are now facing. But we have to be aware that it doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It happens because women and men continue to point out the unfairness and oppression and absurdity of trying to put women out of the public arena.\u201d</p> <p>We are speaking during a mother-daughter book tour, the morning after an event at the Southbank Centre in London with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/01/civilisations-mary-beard-review\" title=\"\">Mary Beard</a>, herself one of the book\u2019s \u201cgutsy women\u201d.

Take Mary Edwards Walker, the only woman in her class at Syracuse Medical College in the 1850s. She was determined to enlist in the Union army as a field surgeon; that wasn\u2019t allowed, so she volunteered and essentially did the job anyway until she was commissioned as the army\u2019s first female surgeon. She was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1865 \u2013 the only woman to have been given it, ever. Throughout all of this, she insisted on wearing trousers \u2013 she was even married in trousers and a dress coat.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the war,\u201d says Hillary, taking up the story, \u201cshe became a strong proponent of the dress reform movement. She was arrested for wearing pants, numerous times. She would just be adamant about it. Now we can wear pants. But if you\u2019re a woman in Japan you\u2019re not supposed to wear glasses and you\u2019re supposed to wear high heels \u2013 so it\u2019s always one step forward, pushback, move forward again, in the arc of women\u2019s history. We are still fighting these rearguard actions.\u201d Chelsea continues the tale: Edwards Walker was stripped of her medal in 1917, when it was abruptly decided that she lacked the field experience to have received it. \u201cShe was buried with it. \u2018Out of my cold dead hands it shall not be pried\u2019 was not a metaphor for her, it was her actual practice.\u201d (Her reference is to a slogan adopted by pro-gun organisations in the US \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll give you my gun when you pry it from my cold dead hands\u201d.)</p> <p>The story of Edwards Walker is amazing. But, to me at least, it also carries an undertow of melancholy at how hard her life must have been. In some of the other stories told by the Clintons, women, or even very small girls, have not chosen gutsiness, but had it thrust upon them. For example <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/14/civil-rights-ruby-bridges-school-segregation\" title=\"\">Ruby Bridges Hall</a>, who in 1960, at the age of six, was escorted by a phalanx of FBI4 agents into a previously race-segregated school. There is a famous picture of this: a tiny black schoolgirl surrounded by enormous white men. Out of shot, according to the Clintons\u2019 book, was a crowd of jeering white supremacists, with banners emblazoned with: \u201cAll I want for Christmas is a clean white school.\u201d She was the only black child there. The staff, bar one, refused to teach her. She received lessons in a room on her own. Heroic, but one can only surmise at what personal cost.</p> <p>Or take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/26/vera-rubin-pioneering-astronomer-dark-matter-died-aged-88\" title=\"\">Vera Rubin</a>, \u201clargely seen within her own field as being one of the Nobel prize\u2019s inexplicable misses, because she really articulated and made the case for dark matter,\u201d as Chelsea put it at the Southbank event. She was barred from taking her PhD at Princeton because women were not admitted into the astronomy programme there until 1975. Or Aly Raisman, the US gymnast who was one of those courageous enough to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/23/aly-raisman-olympic-committee-larry-nassar-abuse-case\" title=\"\">tell the truth</a> about the team doctor, Larry Nassar, who had abused hundreds of girls \u2013 \u201cit could have gone totally unrecorded, and he would have never ended up in prison had she not stepped forward\u201d, says Chelsea.</p> <p>As I read <em>The Book of Gutsy Women</em>, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that, in its tone and style, it reminded me of something. It\u2019s true that in the wake of the extraordinary success of books such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/24/elena-favilli-francessca-cavallo-interview-rebel-girls-2\" title=\"\">Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls</a></em>, there has been a wave of volumes aiming to reclaim inspirational women for the historical record. Some are good (such as Cathy Newman\u2019s witty, sharp<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/22/bloody-brilliant-women-cathy-newman-review\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/22/bloody-brilliant-women-cathy-newman-review\" title=\"\">Bloody Brilliant Women</a></em>), some of them are rather more off-the-peg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"700c0c2176af42946a387b26379f1253d6f97870\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/700c0c2176af42946a387b26379f1253d6f97870/0_101_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aly Raisman Simone Biles 2016 Rio Olympics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aly Raisman, right, with team mate Simone Biles at the 2016 Rio Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t that, though. Eventually it struck me: in its rather earnest style, <em>The Book of Gutsy Women</em> reminded me of saints\u2019 biographies \u2013 hagiographies in the literal sense. The virtues of, say, St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux\u2019s silent suffering in the convent laundry have been replaced with those of resilience, persistence and \u201cgutsiness\u201d. But even so, you could think of it as a <em>Book of Martyrs</em> for the modern feminist. It is full of sentences such as this one, from a biography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/25/highereducationprofile.academicexperts\" title=\"\">Temple Grandin</a>, a reformer of livestock living conditions. \u201cDespite the challenges she faced, Temple never doubted her mission, her training, or her unique qualifications.\u201d Or this, about Alice Min Soo Chun, who designed a remarkable inflatable solar lamp, which has been of enormous benefit to those around the world without access to electric lighting. \u201cAlice couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how to bring relief, safety and security to disaster areas, along with hope, wonder and awe.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe all of this is true. Or maybe these valorous women have also been afflicted with the shame, self-hatred and anxiety that are surely part of the human condition \u2013 at least for most of us. Sometimes, the parade of gutsiness in the Clintons\u2019 book left me thinking wistfully about the ungutsy women \u2013 the quiet, introverted women, the silently decent women. The women whose talents never found a way to be expressed, through poverty, or lack of education, or racism, or just temperament. I thought, too, of the women who have led essentially blameless but unexceptional lives \u2013 that is, most of us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It can be exhausting, but\u00a0take heart, because a lot of women have been speaking out for a\u00a0very long time</p> <footer> <cite>Hillary Clinton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Beard and I had a brief email exchange before the Southbank event about our respective interviews. \u201cTo be honest I\u2019m a bit terrified,\u201d wrote gutsy Beard. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m terrified too,\u201d I replied, albeit with no special reputation for gutsiness to uphold.

They think that they are the all-powerful, strong men who should be ruling.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that this is happening and we have to come to grips with it. And for people in your country or mine who refuse to see it or are in denial about it, this authoritarian streak in leadership in the west, they will rue the day. Because authoritarians have to restrict freedom and the easiest targets are marginalised people and then women.\u201d</p> <p>Women are the victims, too, in strongly patriarchal religious societies, she adds. \u201cWhy do women need to be demeaned and degraded? Why do they need to be oppressed and marginalised \u2013 because in any authoritarian mindset, and we\u2019d need a psychologist sitting here to help us understand it \u2013 women are the targets.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true in fundamentalist societies. So whether that\u2019s Christian fundamentalists, ultra-Orthodox Judaism, Islamic fundamentalism, Hindu fundamentalism, it is all about control, and controlling women is viewed as the sine qua non. It is shocking to me.\u201d</p> <p>In her book <em>Women and Power: A Manifesto</em>, Beard concludes that it is the very structures of power, rather than women themselves, that need to be adjusted. Hillary agrees. But patriarchy and capitalism are so deeply interwoven that it would take a more deep-seated change to achieve this than her politics would accommodate, I suspect.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s clear, without the merest shadow of doubt, that she would have made an infinitely better president than the current occupier. \u201cLook, it was devastating,\u201d she says of the 2016 election. \u201cAnd we are still facing some of the same problems that we didn\u2019t know we had to confront back in 2016.\u201d She is speaking, again, of Russian influence . \u201cThat\u2019s why the failure to release this Russia report in the UK is so damaging and so inexplicable and so shaming.\u201d She adds, \u201cI feel a little Cassandra-like.\u201d</p> <p>On one level \u2013 if you had a bleak cast of mind \u2013 you could read <em>The Book of Gutsy Women</em> as a lament for the toll exacted from women who attempt to make small fixes in a broken, irredeemably patriarchal system. But this is certainly an unintended and maybe, in the end, not an especially helpful way to see the book. It is, as they suggest, a spine-stiffener. A reminder that our foremothers fought tooth and nail to improve the world for the women and men who followed. A reminder that the fight is never easy. And that the struggle does require guts. As Chelsea tells me, \u201cThe other side is relying on being the last man standing, and trying to exhaust us with the constant derision and demeaning. And we cannot give into exhaustion. Because that\u2019s how they win.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Book of Gutsy Women: Favourite Stories of Courage and Resilience, is published by Simon and Schuster.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 November 2019 to correct the spelling of the names Wilma Mankiller and Sor Juana de la Cruz.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If there is a prevailing message in Hillary and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s The Book of Gutsy Women \u2013 albeit perhaps not precisely the one they meant \u2013 it is that making change for women and girls is painful, tough, and requires almost inhuman reserves of personal grit. The volume is a collection of mini-biographies of \u201cgutsy\u201d women, and its intended mood, I surmise, is upbeat and inspirational. The subjects range from the learned 17th-century Mexican nun Sor Juana de la Cruz to the bracingly named Cherokee politician Wilma Mankiller. But behind the celebratory gloss the real \u201ctake-home\u201d, to use the requisite Ted Talk phrase, is this: toughen up. The fight is on. \u201cMy view,\u201d Hillary says, \u201cis that we are going to continue to progress \u2013 there is too much energy behind that, and women are not going to easily surrender to the pressures they are now facing. But we have to be aware that it doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It happens because women and men continue to point out the unfairness and oppression and absurdity of trying to put women out of the public arena.\u201d We are speaking during a mother-daughter book tour, the morning after an event at the Southbank Centre in London with Mary Beard, herself one of the book\u2019s \u201cgutsy women\u201d. In person, the Clintons are professionally graceful and solicitous. Hillary is a warmer figure than she sometimes appears on screen, with a deep and mischievous chortle. Chelsea is poised, diplomatic, and sometimes quite funny \u2013 as well as, I imagine, armoured and defended in ways that are unimaginable to most, having grown up an only child in the White House, a teenager when her father was impeached, and the victim of vitriolic attacks from girlhood. Hillary radiates that particular lustrous quality \u2013 not exactly charm, but a certain aura \u2013 that successful politicians always seem to be able to produce. Both of them speak in military metaphors constantly. Don\u2019t retreat! Hold your ground! To the barricades! At the time of our interview, there were rustlings about the possibility of Hillary making a late entry into the presidential race. I offer her the (surely irresistible) opportunity of announcing her candidacy through the Guardian\u2019s literary section. \u201cThat would be deeply charming!\u201d she agrees, unleashing her chortle. \u201cI would have been a good president, so obviously that lives in the back of my head. I\u2019m going to do everything I possibly can to make sure we retire the current incumbent.\u201d The stories told in the book open up the lives of some fascinating people. Take Mary Edwards Walker, the only woman in her class at Syracuse Medical College in the 1850s. She was determined to enlist in the Union army as a field surgeon; that wasn\u2019t allowed, so she volunteered and essentially did the job anyway until she was commissioned as the army\u2019s first female surgeon. She was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1865 \u2013 the only woman to have been given it, ever.

She was arrested for wearing pants, numerous times. She would just be adamant about it. Now we can wear pants. But if you\u2019re a woman in Japan you\u2019re not supposed to wear glasses and you\u2019re supposed to wear high heels \u2013 so it\u2019s always one step forward, pushback, move forward again, in the arc of women\u2019s history. We are still fighting these rearguard actions.\u201d Chelsea continues the tale: Edwards Walker was stripped of her medal in 1917, when it was abruptly decided that she lacked the field experience to have received it. \u201cShe was buried with it. \u2018Out of my cold dead hands it shall not be pried\u2019 was not a metaphor for her, it was her actual practice.\u201d (Her reference is to a slogan adopted by pro-gun organisations in the US \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll give you my gun when you pry it from my cold dead hands\u201d.)

In some of the other stories told by the Clintons, women, or even very small girls, have not chosen gutsiness, but had it thrust upon them.

Out of shot, according to the Clintons\u2019 book, was a crowd of jeering white supremacists, with banners emblazoned with: \u201cAll I want for Christmas is a clean white school.\u201d She was the only black child there. The staff, bar one, refused to teach her. She received lessons in a room on her own. Heroic, but one can only surmise at what personal cost. Or take Vera Rubin, \u201clargely seen within her own field as being one of the Nobel prize\u2019s inexplicable misses, because she really articulated and made the case for dark matter,\u201d as Chelsea put it at the Southbank event. She was barred from taking her PhD at Princeton because women were not admitted into the astronomy programme there until 1975. Or Aly Raisman, the US gymnast who was one of those courageous enough to tell the truth about the team doctor, Larry Nassar, who had abused hundreds of girls \u2013 \u201cit could have gone totally unrecorded, and he would have never ended up in prison had she not stepped forward\u201d, says Chelsea. As I read The Book of Gutsy Women, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that, in its tone and style, it reminded me of something. It\u2019s true that in the wake of the extraordinary success of books such as Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, there has been a wave of volumes aiming to reclaim inspirational women for the historical record. Some are good (such as Cathy Newman\u2019s witty, sharp Bloody Brilliant Women), some of them are rather more off-the-peg. It wasn\u2019t that, though. Eventually it struck me: in its rather earnest style, The Book of Gutsy Women reminded me of saints\u2019 biographies \u2013 hagiographies in the literal sense. The virtues of, say, St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux\u2019s silent suffering in the convent laundry have been replaced with those of resilience, persistence and \u201cgutsiness\u201d.

But patriarchy and capitalism are so deeply interwoven that it would take a more deep-seated change to achieve this than her politics would accommodate, I suspect. Nevertheless, it\u2019s clear, without the merest shadow of doubt, that she would have made an infinitely better president than the current occupier. \u201cLook, it was devastating,\u201d she says of the 2016 election. \u201cAnd we are still facing some of the same problems that we didn\u2019t know we had to confront back in 2016.\u201d She is speaking, again, of Russian influence . \u201cThat\u2019s why the failure to release this Russia report in the UK is so damaging and so inexplicable and so shaming.\u201d She adds, \u201cI feel a little Cassandra-like.\u201d On one level \u2013 if you had a bleak cast of mind \u2013 you could read The Book of Gutsy Women as a lament for the toll exacted from women who attempt to make small fixes in a broken, irredeemably patriarchal system. But this is certainly an unintended and maybe, in the end, not an especially helpful way to see the book. It is, as they suggest, a spine-stiffener. A reminder that our foremothers fought tooth and nail to improve the world for the women and men who followed. A reminder that the fight is never easy. And that the struggle does require guts. As Chelsea tells me, \u201cThe other side is relying on being the last man standing, and trying to exhaust us with the constant derision and demeaning. And we cannot give into exhaustion. Because that\u2019s how they win.\u201d \u2022 The Book of Gutsy Women: Favourite Stories of Courage and Resilience, is published by Simon and Schuster. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 November 2019 to correct the spelling of the names Wilma Mankiller and Sor Juana de la Cruz.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Bilbao</strong></h2> <p>Until recently, secondhand meant second-best for a country that remembered making do in tougher times, and only students and the city-dwelling vintage vanguard went to flea markets for fun. Now, old stuff is being viewed with a fresh eye. Bilbao is ahead of the curve \u2013 championing, repurposing and rendering cool the unique, pre-loved, quirky, crafted and durable.</p> <p>The gritty San Francisco <em>barrio</em> is a vintage showcase, from the upcycled decor of bars to hipster-run shops. \u201cProviding second opportunities\u201d is the mantra at <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/laZapade2demayo/\" title=\"\">La Zapa de 2 de Mayo</a></strong>, where restored machines are used to repair shoes and custom-make new ones from leather or recycled bottle material. Independent vintage shops abound, though the best bet for finding them open is to go on the first Saturday of the month, when the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bilbaoturismo.net/BilbaoTurismo/en/markets-and-shopping/2-de-mayo-flea-market?fecha=20160101\" title=\"\">Rastro 2 de Mayo</a></strong> flea market is on and loads of vendors gather to sell everything from vinyl to luggage and jackets, knick-knacks and art in an ebullient atmosphere, along with stuff that\u2019s harder to take home, such as 1950s furniture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"840ab99836727ab60222efc364efcb8b3f8f8f4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/840ab99836727ab60222efc364efcb8b3f8f8f4b/697_593_2567_1540/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dos de Mayo market in Bilbao\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dos de Mayo market, Bilbao</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are two big vintage markets on Sundays in the industrial warehouse district of Zorrotzaurre. The <strong><a href=\"https://espacioopen.com/en/\" title=\"\">Open Your Ganbara</a></strong> flea market fills the Antigua F\u00e1brica de Galletas biscuit factory building. Celebrating the 3Rs \u2013 <em>reduce</em>,<em> reutiliza</em>, <em>recicla</em> \u2013 it is an excellent source of eclectic treasures, especially vintage lamps, toys and household stuff. Nearby, <strong><a href=\"https://www.zawp.org/agenda/mercado/\" title=\"\">Zawp Bilbao</a></strong> is great for vintage clothes, vegetarian food and people-watching. Here, too, on the last Sunday of the month, <strong>MuMe</strong> is a secondhand market selling all things music-related, from guitars and vinyl to collectibles, against a soundscape of live performances. In the city centre, <strong>Plaza Nueva</strong>, known for its tapas bars, has a Sunday market (9am-2pm) specialising in secondhand books.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Bilbao, <strong><a href=\"https://www.arizonavintage.com/\" title=\"\">Arizona Vintage Clothing</a></strong> is an easy option for Fila, Adidas, Hilfiger, jeans and vegan Navajo bomber jackets; <strong><a href=\"https://koopera.org/\" title=\"\">Koopera</a></strong> has three shops selling cheap stuff for good causes; while <strong><a href=\"https://www.flamingosbilbao.com/\" title=\"\">Flamingos Bilbao</a></strong> sells clothes by the kilo (in three categories \u20ac13, \u20ac24 and \u20ac39). For something special, <strong><a href=\"https://silviamarques.com/\" title=\"\">Silvia Marqu\u00e9s</a></strong>, close to Athletic Bilbao\u2019s San Mam\u00e9s stadium, might have turbans, hats, wedding dresses, bags or jewels in the fabulous and unique yet affordable category \u2013 if you can get past all the antique restored dolls.<br><strong>Where to stay</strong> <a href=\"http://www.caravan-cinema.com/en/\" title=\"\">Caravan Cinema</a> (doubles from \u20ac75 room-only) in Casco Viejo encapsulates the vintage theme, with each of its five rooms and two apartments a celebration of a famous film director and furnished with handpicked 1950s pieces.<br><strong>Sorrel Downer</strong></p> <h2><strong>Berlin</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96a9ee86c1686509941bb0bf06401bab6c0a54dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a9ee86c1686509941bb0bf06401bab6c0a54dd/0_85_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the city\u2019s way of life \u2026 Berlin\u2019s Boxhagener Square flea market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of the city\u2019s way of life \u2026 Berlin\u2019s Boxhagener Square flea market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reiner Elsen/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBerlin is poor but sexy.\u201d The words of former Berlin mayor Klaus Wowereit perhaps help explain why the capital is so good for vintage. Purchasing power in this city has been, until very recently, lower than elsewhere in Europe and the culture of exchange and reuse has always been strong. This, along with the city\u2019s liberalism and constant influx of youthful creativity, ensures Berlin has a good variety of low- to-high-end vintage and secondhand shopping.</p> <p>A good starting point for a rummage is <strong><a href=\"https://www.humana-second-hand.de/mode/first-class.html\" title=\"\">Humana</a></strong>. Years would be needed to work through the colour-coded chaos of the Brobdingnagian shop at the corner of Frankfurter Tor, in the Friedrichshain district, but there are 16 smaller branches around the city and they sell homewares, too. For a slightly more upmarket experience, <strong><a href=\"https://picknweight.de/\" title=\"\">PicknWeight</a></strong><strong> </strong>sells clothes by the kilo, with scales dotted around the store for customers to keep track of their spending. </p> <p>The best places for quality designer garments are the high-end vintage stores in the Mitte neighbourhood. At <strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sommerladen_vintage_berlin/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Sommerladen</a></strong> prices can be as low as \u20ac10 for a classic designer sportswear T-shirt; and the beautiful <strong><a href=\"http://www.garments-vintage.de/garments.html\" title=\"\">Garments</a> </strong>shop, a few doors down, has lots of accessories (as well as clothes), such Pucci costume jewellery for under \u00a390. Around the corner are <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pineapplefactoryshop/\" title=\"\">Pineapple Factory</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.dasneueschwarz.de/\" title=\"\">Das Neue Schwar</a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.dasneueschwarz.de/\" title=\"\">z</a></strong> (\u201cThe New Black\u201d!), offering exquisitely selected pieces, with particular outfits displayed on the walls. It would be possible to spend a few hundred euros on a rare archive piece here but still feel you\u2019ve bagged a bargain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b8b7af8a438545ba0f2bab6bf7e37ff398a106f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8b7af8a438545ba0f2bab6bf7e37ff398a106f/0_13_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The rooftop of Klunkerkranich Bar in Berlin\u2019s hip Neuk\u00f6lln district.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The rooftop of Klunkerkranich Bar in Berlin\u2019s hip Neuk\u00f6lln district.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gonzales Photo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More affordable options include <strong><a href=\"http://www.paulsboutiqueberlin.de/\" title=\"\">Paul\u2019s Boutiqu</a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.paulsboutiqueberlin.de/\" title=\"\">e</a></strong>, a short walk away, which specialises in streetwear, with a huge collection of trainers, T-shirts, denim and accessories across two neighbouring stores. A third store, <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RepeaterBerlin/\" title=\"\">Repeater</a></strong>, in Neuk\u00f6lln, leans towards womenswear, with a 1970s hippy vibe. This district is a vintage hotspot, with shops like <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/singblackbird\" title=\"\">Sing Blackbird</a></strong> and the canalside <strong><a href=\"https://flowmarkt.de/nowkoelln/\" title=\"\">Neuk\u00f6lln</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://flowmarkt.de/nowkoelln/\" title=\"\"> Flowmarkt</a></strong> every other Sunday (until 1 December, restarts in late March). </p> <p>Flea markets are an integral part of Berlin life: from the touristy<strong> <a href=\"http://www.flohmarktimmauerpark.de/\" title=\"\">Mauerpark</a></strong> with its riotous Bearpit Karaoke to <strong><a href=\"http://www.antikbuchmarkt.de/\" title=\"\">rare books and antiques</a></strong> in a splendid setting by the River Spree, opposite the Bode Museum on Museum Island. Markets at <strong>Boxhagener Platz</strong> in Friedrichshain and <strong>Marheinekeplatz</strong> in Kreuzberg offer mixes of clothes, homewares and bric-a-brac, and a trip to the pretty <strong>Arkonoplatz</strong> in Prenzlauer Berg promises superb furniture. When temperatures drop, the vast, roofed <strong><a href=\"https://www.arena.berlin/en/\" title=\"\">Treptow Arena</a></strong> has tonnes of tat to wade through on Saturdays and Sundays, and <strong><a href=\"https://www.ohnefragetoll.de/\" title=\"\">OFT</a></strong> in Mitte has a cornucopia of clothes, furniture and bric-a-brac. And, if you\u2019re down to your last cent, look out for the <em>zum geschenken</em> (gift) boxes left out on the street by residents for passersby to take their pick. You may be poor, but you can still be sexy.<br><strong>Where to stay</strong> <a href=\"https://www.michelbergerhotel.com\" title=\"\">Michelberger Hotel</a> (doubles from \u20ac116 room-only), a converted factory in party-central Friedrichshain, has unique retro-style rooms.<br><strong>Celia Topping</strong></p> <h2><strong>Naples</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b3f9c653c3b04842d6e05261473325dc0e1b24d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b3f9c653c3b04842d6e05261473325dc0e1b24d/0_60_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bric-a-brac stall in central Naples.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bric-a-brac stall in central Naples.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Krzysztof Dydynski/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Buried by volcanic ash that erupted from Vesuvius in AD79, the former Roman town of Herculaneum, south-east of Naples, mainly attracts tourists to its archaeological ruins. But since the 1950s, vintage enthusiasts, costume designers and retailers have also flocked to the nearby shops and stalls of the suburb of Ercolano, at the western foot of the volcano. Via Pugliano, otherwise known as the <strong>Mercato di Resina</strong>, is known by insiders as Europe\u2019s original vintage source, its rows of houses spill secondhand treasure on to the streets at giveaway prices.</p> <p>The genesis of \u201cvintage\u201d in Italy can be traced back to just after the second world war, when Americans would send used clothes to Europe as part of the relief effort to support those in need. The <em>pezze Americane</em> \u2013 American rags \u2013 arrived in eagerly anticipated half-ton bales to the port of Ercolano, with many believing money or jewellery might be found in the mix. But as fast as the bales were opened, the items in them ended up on the black market, with the residents of Corso Resina and Via Pugliano garnering a reputation for sorting and upcycling the loot.</p> <p>In central Naples, vintage \u201cking\u201d Antonio Esposito has been selling a bright collection of men\u2019s clothing from his tiny modernist-inspired store <strong>Per Voi Giovani</strong> (Via Carbonara 78, no website) since the 1970s. He remembers scouring the markets by the railway with his friends as a teenager for blue Levis jeans and US Navy jackets. They sorted through piles of clothes laid out on bedsheets and bartered with the sellers who brought the best of Resina to Naples. \u201cWe wanted to impress the foreign girls arriving on holiday,\u201d says Esposito. \u201cWe could look sharp for very little money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21ecb1540e4c5b9c4835831e4580655fffe5d6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21ecb1540e4c5b9c4835831e4580655fffe5d6fb/0_139_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Afforable jackets and more in Pop 21.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afforable jackets and more in Pop 21.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also in the city, <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/popventuno/?rf=1638804623065423\" title=\"\">Pop 21</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/I-Love-Vintage/832972583515929\" title=\"\">I Love Vintage</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/caravan25/\" title=\"\">Caravan</a></strong> cater for a student crowd on Via Mezzocannone, the artery that runs between the two main universities.

The co-owners, Gigi Cirella and Alessandro de Gais, are passionate fashionistas who relish picking out clothes they think will suit you.

Bicycle services pick up home food scraps for composting, and there are secondhand shops \u2013 from charity outlets to trendy vintage boutiques \u2013 all over town. Underlying the newer trends is the port city\u2019s love of antiques and <em>brocante</em> \u2013 a term that covers anything from household tat to serious vintage pieces. The <a href=\"http://www.bordeaux.fr/p64037/marches-de-bordeaux#brocantes-et-bouquinistes\" title=\"\">mayor\u2019s office</a> runs an official list of markets, including the two key brocante areas, Saint-Michel and Chartrons. Vintage and secondhand clothes can be found in both but lots of smaller shops have opened recently, and often have the best stuff.</p> <p>Those serious about their threads should Google <em>friperies</em> and <em>d\u00e9p\u00f4ts-vente</em>. Hotspots include <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/freepshow.friperie/\" title=\"\">Freep\u2019Show</a></strong><strong> </strong>in the city centre, where prices range from \u20ac15 to \u20ac50 for vintage gear including jackets, flowered silk shirts, maxi skirts, sharp trousers, shoes, boots and sunglasses. The cheaper <strong>Emma\u00fcs </strong>charity shop is at the <a href=\"https://www.bordeaux-tourism.co.uk/Discover-Bordeaux/Must-See/Darwin-Ecosysteme\" title=\"\">Darwin Eco</a><a href=\"https://www.bordeaux-tourism.co.uk/Discover-Bordeaux/Must-See/Darwin-Ecosysteme\" title=\"\">syst\u00e8me</a> on the right bank of the Garonne (Tuesday to Saturday 1pm to 6pm), a former barracks repurposed as a \u201cgreen economy hub\u201d. On an average day, Emma\u00fcs offers a range of fairly basic items (trousers from \u20ac2), toddler toys (ditto) and furniture and electrical goods (prices vary widely). But a nice bit of hippie chic or a smart tie is not unknown either. A good place to gloat over finds is Darwin\u2019s large indoor-outdoor organic brasserie-cum-general store, <strong><a href=\"https://magasingeneral.camp/\" title=\"\">Magasin G\u00e9n\u00e9ral</a></strong>, open daily for lunch, dinner, drinks and snacks (mains from \u20ac12).</p> <p>Back over the river, the Chartrons neighbourhood was the heart of the city\u2019s wine-broking trade from the 17th to 19th centuries. Now it is thronged with restaurants, bakeries and Bikram yoga studios. In short, the smart stuff is here in places such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.villagenotredame.com/fr/\" title=\"\">Village Notre Dame</a></strong>, a sprawling indoor antiques gallery selling anything from 18th-century mirrors to antique sapphire pendants, plus rather expensive paintings, ceramics, furniture, rugs and other trimmings. At the more affordable end are items such as a 1950s fantasy ruby-style ring (\u20ac300) or delicate enamelled Austrian-made glassware (\u20ac280).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7a6e076c1dab7cc4a7200145ddcd77f070cfb05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7a6e076c1dab7cc4a7200145ddcd77f070cfb05/0_79_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage jeans at Freep\u2019show, Bordeaux\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vintage jeans at Freep\u2019show, Bordeaux</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: &quot;PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the main Chartrons artery, rue Notre-Dame, coffee, lunch, cocktails and dinner options are plentiful. One of the current favourites is a wine bar that looks like a <em>brocante</em>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.laconserverie-bordeaux.com/\" title=\"\">La Conserverie</a></strong>, which offers regional specialities, such as cassoulet and confit duck from \u20ac14.</p> <p>Saint-Michel is huge, and has an open-air market every Sunday (7am-2pm), and a series of shops in the <strong><a href=\"https://www.leshangars.com/\" title=\"\">Hangars</a> </strong>open every day bar Wednesday. The price ranges and options are vast, and bargaining is vital, but a recent Sunday morning netted vinyl and CDs from \u20ac5, copper pans and Le Creuset pots from \u20ac20 and handmade jewellery from \u20ac12. Sundays play out to the sound of church bells and a healthy buzz of general chat. St-Mich is in the city\u2019s North African quarter, also home to Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish communities \u2013 but on market days barriers break down and even shoppers from posher parts haggle over finds and mourn losses. The glasses of wine that start to replace coffee quite early in the day might help. Even if you don\u2019t brocante, don\u2019t miss it.</p> <p>For lunch bargains, <strong><a href=\"http://www.lepassagesaintmichel.com/en_GB/\" title=\"\">Brasserie du Passage Saint-Michel</a></strong> is open every day for lunch and dinner, with fixed-price menus from \u20ac15.90.

Local sellers and small-time dealers set up tables in church squares and fields to sell what they can. Poring over a box of forgotten toy cars, I discovered a Corgi Diecast Renault 16 Tour de France camera car complete with giant film camera, cameraman and driver, resplendent in flat cap and shades. It was stamped \u201cMade in Great Britain 1967\u201d, the year British world champion Tommy Simpson left us. It\u2019s a reminder of the Tour de France\u2019s previous popularity in the UK, as well as its timeless style. For me, a lifelong fan of Le Tour, France and all things pedal-powered, the car has little monetary value \u2013 I paid \u20ac4 \u2013 but I love it.<br><em><strong>Tom Kevill Davies, owner of the <a href=\"http://www.thehungrycyclist.com/lodge\">The Hungry Cyclist Lodge</a>, Burgundy</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Puffin Books model</strong><br>I bought Fat Puffin a few years ago at the flea market in Todmorden, which runs every Thursday. He\u2019s a four-feet-tall, rotund model, probably made from fibreglass, and was used to promote Puffin Books in the 1970s. He has a damaged bill, but still looks cheerful. The message on his chest, \u201cFat Puffin loves you,\u201d sparked a childhood memory about the Puffin Book Club, and he now lives in the corner of my kitchen awaiting restoration.

Totally reliant on the rhythms of the land and a calendar of feasts, fasts and rules set down by its Orthodox church, with jars of neat pickles packed in their cellars, and homes filled with homemade furniture, often \u201cprimitive\u201d, and decorated with folk art patterns. I\u2019ve travelled through Romania many times, especially Transylvania and the north, and have furnished my home in Hastings with humble pieces from this ancient idyll. One of my favourites is a late-19th-century primitive dresser, which stands by the front door, a broom propped up beside it. Its naive lattice-like fretwork acts as a plate retainer on each shelf. Probably homemade, it has its original black paint and a couple of bent nails bashed into its lower double doors to act as fasteners. Crude yet totally charming, it was actually found in a henhouse in Warwick, with bits of straw clinging to its nether regions \u2013 which just added to its history. It reminds me of a land that time forgot, a land that still exists in Romania today.<br><em><strong>Alastair Hendy, owner, <a href=\"http://www.aghendy.com/\">AG Hendy &amp; Co Home Store</a>, Hastings</strong></em></p> <p>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "Bilbao Until recently, secondhand meant second-best for a country that remembered making do in tougher times, and only students and the city-dwelling vintage vanguard went to flea markets for fun. Now, old stuff is being viewed with a fresh eye. Bilbao is ahead of the curve \u2013 championing, repurposing and rendering cool the unique, pre-loved, quirky, crafted and durable. The gritty San Francisco barrio is a vintage showcase, from the upcycled decor of bars to hipster-run shops. \u201cProviding second opportunities\u201d is the mantra at La Zapa de 2 de Mayo, where restored machines are used to repair shoes and custom-make new ones from leather or recycled bottle material. Independent vintage shops abound, though the best bet for finding them open is to go on the first Saturday of the month, when the Rastro 2 de Mayo flea market is on and loads of vendors gather to sell everything from vinyl to luggage and jackets, knick-knacks and art in an ebullient atmosphere, along with stuff that\u2019s harder to take home, such as 1950s furniture. There are two big vintage markets on Sundays in the industrial warehouse district of Zorrotzaurre. The Open Your Ganbara flea market fills the Antigua F\u00e1brica de Galletas biscuit factory building. Celebrating the 3Rs \u2013 reduce, reutiliza, recicla \u2013 it is an excellent source of eclectic treasures, especially vintage lamps, toys and household stuff. Nearby, Zawp Bilbao is great for vintage clothes, vegetarian food and people-watching. Here, too, on the last Sunday of the month, MuMe is a secondhand market selling all things music-related, from guitars and vinyl to collectibles, against a soundscape of live performances. In the city centre, Plaza Nueva, known for its tapas bars, has a Sunday market (9am-2pm) specialising in secondhand books. Elsewhere in Bilbao, Arizona Vintage Clothing is an easy option for Fila, Adidas, Hilfiger, jeans and vegan Navajo bomber jackets; Koopera has three shops selling cheap stuff for good causes; while Flamingos Bilbao sells clothes by the kilo (in three categories \u20ac13, \u20ac24 and \u20ac39). For something special, Silvia Marqu\u00e9s, close to Athletic Bilbao\u2019s San Mam\u00e9s stadium, might have turbans, hats, wedding dresses, bags or jewels in the fabulous and unique yet affordable category \u2013 if you can get past all the antique restored dolls. Where to stay Caravan Cinema (doubles from \u20ac75 room-only) in Casco Viejo encapsulates the vintage theme, with each of its five rooms and two apartments a celebration of a famous film director and furnished with handpicked 1950s pieces. Sorrel Downer Berlin \u201cBerlin is poor but sexy.\u201d The words of former Berlin mayor Klaus Wowereit perhaps help explain why the capital is so good for vintage. Purchasing power in this city has been, until very recently, lower than elsewhere in Europe and the culture of exchange and reuse has always been strong. This, along with the city\u2019s liberalism and constant influx of youthful creativity, ensures Berlin has a good variety of low- to-high-end vintage and secondhand shopping. A good starting point for a rummage is Humana. Years would be needed to work through the colour-coded chaos of the Brobdingnagian shop at the corner of Frankfurter Tor, in the Friedrichshain district, but there are 16 smaller branches around the city and they sell homewares, too. For a slightly more upmarket experience, PicknWeight sells clothes by the kilo, with scales dotted around the store for customers to keep track of their spending. The best places for quality designer garments are the high-end vintage stores in the Mitte neighbourhood. At Sommerladen prices can be as low as \u20ac10 for a classic designer sportswear T-shirt; and the beautiful Garments shop, a few doors down, has lots of accessories (as well as clothes), such Pucci costume jewellery for under \u00a390. Around the corner are Pineapple Factory and Das Neue Schwarz (\u201cThe New Black\u201d!), offering exquisitely selected pieces, with particular outfits displayed on the walls. It would be possible to spend a few hundred euros on a rare archive piece here but still feel you\u2019ve bagged a bargain. More affordable options include Paul\u2019s Boutique, a short walk away, which specialises in streetwear, with a huge collection of trainers, T-shirts, denim and accessories across two neighbouring stores. A third store, Repeater, in Neuk\u00f6lln, leans towards womenswear, with a 1970s hippy vibe. This district is a vintage hotspot, with shops like Sing Blackbird and the canalside Neuk\u00f6lln Flowmarkt every other Sunday (until 1 December, restarts in late March). Flea markets are an integral part of Berlin life: from the touristy Mauerpark with its riotous Bearpit Karaoke to rare books and antiques in a splendid setting by the River Spree, opposite the Bode Museum on Museum Island. Markets at Boxhagener Platz in Friedrichshain and Marheinekeplatz in Kreuzberg offer mixes of clothes, homewares and bric-a-brac, and a trip to the pretty Arkonoplatz in Prenzlauer Berg promises superb furniture. When temperatures drop, the vast, roofed Treptow Arena has tonnes of tat to wade through on Saturdays and Sundays, and OFT in Mitte has a cornucopia of clothes, furniture and bric-a-brac. And, if you\u2019re down to your last cent, look out for the zum geschenken (gift) boxes left out on the street by residents for passersby to take their pick. You may be poor, but you can still be sexy. Where to stay Michelberger Hotel (doubles from \u20ac116 room-only), a converted factory in party-central Friedrichshain, has unique retro-style rooms. Celia Topping Naples Buried by volcanic ash that erupted from Vesuvius in AD79, the former Roman town of Herculaneum, south-east of Naples, mainly attracts tourists to its archaeological ruins. But since the 1950s, vintage enthusiasts, costume designers and retailers have also flocked to the nearby shops and stalls of the suburb of Ercolano, at the western foot of the volcano. Via Pugliano, otherwise known as the Mercato di Resina, is known by insiders as Europe\u2019s original vintage source, its rows of houses spill secondhand treasure on to the streets at giveaway prices. The genesis of \u201cvintage\u201d in Italy can be traced back to just after the second world war, when Americans would send used clothes to Europe as part of the relief effort to support those in need. The pezze Americane \u2013 American rags \u2013 arrived in eagerly anticipated half-ton bales to the port of Ercolano, with many believing money or jewellery might be found in the mix. But as fast as the bales were opened, the items in them ended up on the black market, with the residents of Corso Resina and Via Pugliano garnering a reputation for sorting and upcycling the loot. In central Naples, vintage \u201cking\u201d Antonio Esposito has been selling a bright collection of men\u2019s clothing from his tiny modernist-inspired store Per Voi Giovani (Via Carbonara 78, no website) since the 1970s. He remembers scouring the markets by the railway with his friends as a teenager for blue Levis jeans and US Navy jackets. They sorted through piles of clothes laid out on bedsheets and bartered with the sellers who brought the best of Resina to Naples. \u201cWe wanted to impress the foreign girls arriving on holiday,\u201d says Esposito. \u201cWe could look sharp for very little money.\u201d Also in the city, Pop 21, I Love Vintage and Caravan cater for a student crowd on Via Mezzocannone, the artery that runs between the two main universities. In the same area, Moda e Costume specialises in 1950s and 60s dresses, and Oggetti e Stampe D\u2019Epoca is a cavern of prints, lights and antique knick-knacks. Those who don\u2019t have the time to venture to Resina or the patience to sift through shops crammed with clothes might prefer Retrophilia, also on Via Mezzocannone. The co-owners, Gigi Cirella and Alessandro de Gais, are passionate fashionistas who relish picking out clothes they think will suit you. They have even been known to order in espressos from the nearby bar as you try things on \u2013 a gesture that is as Neapolitan as the tradition of vintage itself. Where to stay The Church (doubles from \u20ac50) is a B&amp;B on the top floor of a palace, with with reclaimed and repurposed furniture in its large, light rooms. Sophia Seymour Bordeaux In Bordeaux recycling and upcycling pervade all aspects of life. Bicycle services pick up home food scraps for composting, and there are secondhand shops \u2013 from charity outlets to trendy vintage boutiques \u2013 all over town. Underlying the newer trends is the port city\u2019s love of antiques and brocante \u2013 a term that covers anything from household tat to serious vintage pieces. The mayor\u2019s office runs an official list of markets, including the two key brocante areas, Saint-Michel and Chartrons. Vintage and secondhand clothes can be found in both but lots of smaller shops have opened recently, and often have the best stuff. Those serious about their threads should Google friperies and d\u00e9p\u00f4ts-vente. Hotspots include Freep\u2019Show in the city centre, where prices range from \u20ac15 to \u20ac50 for vintage gear including jackets, flowered silk shirts, maxi skirts, sharp trousers, shoes, boots and sunglasses. The cheaper Emma\u00fcs charity shop is at the Darwin Ecosyst\u00e8me on the right bank of the Garonne (Tuesday to Saturday 1pm to 6pm), a former barracks repurposed as a \u201cgreen economy hub\u201d. On an average day, Emma\u00fcs offers a range of fairly basic items (trousers from \u20ac2), toddler toys (ditto) and furniture and electrical goods (prices vary widely). But a nice bit of hippie chic or a smart tie is not unknown either. A good place to gloat over finds is Darwin\u2019s large indoor-outdoor organic brasserie-cum-general store, Magasin G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, open daily for lunch, dinner, drinks and snacks (mains from \u20ac12). Back over the river, the Chartrons neighbourhood was the heart of the city\u2019s wine-broking trade from the 17th to 19th centuries. Now it is thronged with restaurants, bakeries and Bikram yoga studios. In short, the smart stuff is here in places such as Village Notre Dame, a sprawling indoor antiques gallery selling anything from 18th-century mirrors to antique sapphire pendants, plus rather expensive paintings, ceramics, furniture, rugs and other trimmings. At the more affordable end are items such as a 1950s fantasy ruby-style ring (\u20ac300) or delicate enamelled Austrian-made glassware (\u20ac280). On the main Chartrons artery, rue Notre-Dame, coffee, lunch, cocktails and dinner options are plentiful. One of the current favourites is a wine bar that looks like a brocante, La Conserverie, which offers regional specialities, such as cassoulet and confit duck from \u20ac14. Saint-Michel is huge, and has an open-air market every Sunday (7am-2pm), and a series of shops in the Hangars open every day bar Wednesday. The price ranges and options are vast, and bargaining is vital, but a recent Sunday morning netted vinyl and CDs from \u20ac5, copper pans and Le Creuset pots from \u20ac20 and handmade jewellery from \u20ac12. Sundays play out to the sound of church bells and a healthy buzz of general chat. St-Mich is in the city\u2019s North African quarter, also home to Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish communities \u2013 but on market days barriers break down and even shoppers from posher parts haggle over finds and mourn losses. The glasses of wine that start to replace coffee quite early in the day might help. Even if you don\u2019t brocante, don\u2019t miss it. For lunch bargains, Brasserie du Passage Saint-Michel is open every day for lunch and dinner, with fixed-price menus from \u20ac15.90. For other comestibles, the Capucins food market, just minutes away, bulges with goodies of every description, and has lots of cheap-and-chic places to eat, such as Bistro Poulette, which serves moules-frites. Where to stay One of the more eco-friendly, urban-chic options is Seeko\u2019o design hotel (doubles from \u20ac99 room-only) close to Chartrons and the river. Sophie Kevany Vienna For centuries a focal point for art, music, history and culture, it\u2019s less well known that Vienna is also a treasure chest for vintage shoppers. Start any retro adventure at the Naschmarkt, the food market that has been running since the 18th century, but which since the 1970s has held a flea market every Saturday morning, with stalls selling clothes, furniture, art, jewellery, old vinyl, books, cameras, tableware and ceramics. It\u2019s the perfect place to browse \u2013 and then snack on specialities, such as Kaiserschmarrn (shredded pancakes) or Palatschinken (rolled crepes). A short walk away is stylist Arian Alexander Commone\u2019s secondhand clothes shop. What makes shopping here so special is that he loves helping customers create a look from his collection of vintage couture. There is something for every budget, from lesser-known designers to big-ticket items from Chanel, Prada, Moschino and Valentino. Flo Vintage, in the arty Freihausviertel district on the other side of the Naschmarkt, often supplies costumes for theatre, films and TV from a classic collection spanning a century of design up to the 1980s. Featuring everything from pearl-embroided flapper dresses to Armani blazers, it\u2019s become a place of pilgrimage for fashion-lovers, including (according to its website) Helmut Lang, Karl Lagerfeld, Kate Moss and Stella McCartney. At the other end of the scale, Burggasse 24, in the buzzy seventh district, is a laid-back retro concept shop and exhibition space that sells more affordable items in light, bright, uncluttered rooms. Clothes are arranged neatly by gender and colour \u2013 women\u2019s on the ground floor, men\u2019s upstairs \u2013 and there\u2019s a comfy cafe as well. A bus ride away in the sixth district, Polyklamott focuses on loud T-shirts and sweatshirts, parkas and bombers from the 1960s to 90s, as well as new pieces by young local designers. It also sells small retro items, such as sunglasses, purses and badges for \u20ac5 from a 24-hour vending machine.

Una, professional photographer, founder and editor of blog Vienna InsiderLooking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips Helsinki Finns are die-hard environmentalists, so secondhand isn\u2019t a trend but a way of life. Add to this the Finnish disdain for online shopping and you have a city full of Nordic treasures you\u2019d never encounter further south. If you think you don\u2019t need a pair of limited-edition Moomin salt-and-pepper shakers (\u20ac16) or vintage Marimekko fabric (from \u20ac20 a metre), the Hietalahti flea market in central Helsinki\u2019s Hietalahti Square will prove you wrong. The smaller but still hopping Hakaniemi market to the north, in front of the Hakaniemi market hall, is also chock-full of fun, only-in-Finland finds, such as Arabia ceramics, vintage Finland travel posters and Iittala glass. At the smaller, indoor fleas, such as Helsinki flea market in the ritzy T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 neighbourhood, locals drop off items to sell on account. These can be hit-and-miss but when you hit, it\u2019s often one of a kind. Helsinki\u2019s vintage shops are, like the city itself, tiny. The Kallio neighbourhood has the highest concentration of stores. Frida Marina and Hoochie Mama Jane are standouts for (mostly) women\u2019s clothes and accessories. A quick stroll south is record shop Black &amp; White, which has a world-class collection of new and used vinyl. For more upscale shopping, Penny Lane clothing shop, in T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6, looks unpromising from the outside but is actually several storeys high. Also in T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6, resale shops, including Relove, are the insider\u2019s secret of secondhand Finland. Locals hire space to sell their stuff, so every rack is an adventure. Relove has a back room for used designer wares, a charming coffee shop and Finn-centric pop-ups in the front. Brand Second Hand in nearby Kamppi also mixes secondhand, thrift and new, but offers a street vibe \u2013 and more for men, from inexpensive designer T-shirts (\u20ac15 and up) to, say, a vintage Gucci leather jacket (\u20ac650). Extreme bargains can be found at the UFF (12 branches) and Fida (eight branches) charity shops that dot the city and which are stuffed with finds from furniture to glassware to clothes. The skiwear sections, especially, have some real steals. Where to stay The Glo Hotel Art (doubles from \u20ac143 B&amp;B), an art nouveau building with a boho vibe in the centre of Helsinki\u2019s Design District, will get you in the retro mood. Diana Holquist My favourite finds \u2013 by dealers and collectors 1967 Corgi Toys Tour de France camera car Every Sunday from late spring to early autumn, vide-greniers (boot sales) can be found in the villages of rural Burgundy. Local sellers and small-time dealers set up tables in church squares and fields to sell what they can. Poring over a box of forgotten toy cars, I discovered a Corgi Diecast Renault 16 Tour de France camera car complete with giant film camera, cameraman and driver, resplendent in flat cap and shades. It was stamped \u201cMade in Great Britain 1967\u201d, the year British world champion Tommy Simpson left us. It\u2019s a reminder of the Tour de France\u2019s previous popularity in the UK, as well as its timeless style. For me, a lifelong fan of Le Tour, France and all things pedal-powered, the car has little monetary value \u2013 I paid \u20ac4 \u2013 but I love it. Tom Kevill Davies, owner of the The Hungry Cyclist Lodge, Burgundy Puffin Books model I bought Fat Puffin a few years ago at the flea market in Todmorden, which runs every Thursday. He\u2019s a four-feet-tall, rotund model, probably made from fibreglass, and was used to promote Puffin Books in the 1970s. He has a damaged bill, but still looks cheerful. The message on his chest, \u201cFat Puffin loves you,\u201d sparked a childhood memory about the Puffin Book Club, and he now lives in the corner of my kitchen awaiting restoration. I have a pitch in Hebden Bridge Antiques Centre in West Yorkshire, but I won\u2019t be parting with the puffin. Claire Tuddenham, vintage dealer, Calderdale, West Yorkshire Romanian folk art dresser Pastoral scenes, feudal lands, and families semi-subsistent, almost medieval in fact, surviving by their home-grown means \u2013 that\u2019s Romania. Totally reliant on the rhythms of the land and a calendar of feasts, fasts and rules set down by its Orthodox church, with jars of neat pickles packed in their cellars, and homes filled with homemade furniture, often \u201cprimitive\u201d, and decorated with folk art patterns. I\u2019ve travelled through Romania many times, especially Transylvania and the north, and have furnished my home in Hastings with humble pieces from this ancient idyll. One of my favourites is a late-19th-century primitive dresser, which stands by the front door, a broom propped up beside it. Its naive lattice-like fretwork acts as a plate retainer on each shelf. Probably homemade, it has its original black paint and a couple of bent nails bashed into its lower double doors to act as fasteners. Crude yet totally charming, it was actually found in a henhouse in Warwick, with bits of straw clinging to its nether regions \u2013 which just added to its history. It reminds me of a land that time forgot, a land that still exists in Romania today. Alastair Hendy, owner, AG Hendy &amp; Co Home Store, Hastings Looking for a holiday with a difference?

She mentions that a lot, too.)</p> <p>Wearing her customary white blazer and standing on a wooden bench, Gabbard spoke slowly and deliberately. Gabbard believes that the US has spent too much money meddling in other country\u2019s affairs, and is a fervent anti-interventionist.

But I don\u2019t know whether she can get the stars aligned enough to make it happen,\u201d Dunwoody said.

This time he will vote for Gabbard.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of the few that makes sense. But there\u2019s no media coverage. She got some press coverage when Hillary said she was a spy, but the game is so fixed.\u201d</p> <p>It was a common complaint on Saturday that the media has not given enough attention to Gabbard\u2019s campaign. But given her current position in the race \u2013 she\u2019s polling ninth nationally, with 1% support \u2013 a share of the vote that has barely moved in six months \u2013 it is difficult to argue she deserves to be treated like a frontrunner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f286cc154bc9752443aeb4b674d848b703c2c13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f286cc154bc9752443aeb4b674d848b703c2c13/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tulsi Gabbard waves to supporters in North Charleston, South Carolina, on 5 October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tulsi Gabbard waves to supporters in North Charleston, South Carolina, on 5 October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Blanco/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In any case, Gabbard has experienced a surge in press coverage recently. As Dunwoody said, the boost came from a strange source: a number of media organizations reported that Clinton had accused Gabbard of being groomed by Russia ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020</a>.</p> <p>Clinton did not actually say that \u2013 in an interview on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hillary-clinton/id1479487160?i=1000453830324\">the Campaign HQ podcast</a> Clinton said Gabbard was being groomed by Republicans for a potential third-party run \u2013 and Gabbard\u2019s campaign presumably knows this, but she has continued to fundraise on the back of the nonexistent accusation.</p> <p>Gabbard has repeatedly denied she will run as an independent, but rumors persist. What is clear, however, is that of the Democratic candidates, Gabbard certainly has an unusual coalition. <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-tulsi-gabbards-base/\">FiveThirtyEight found</a> that her base is \u201coverwhelmingly male\u201d, mostly white and unusually conservative. Gabbard, seemingly, has set out to cultivate this, making regular appearances on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> and even giving <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/07/exclusive-tulsi-gabbard-hillary-clinton-foreign-policy-establishment-smears-dissenting-voices/#disqus_thread\">an exclusive interview</a> to the rightwing online news organization <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/breitbart\">Breitbart</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian didn\u2019t meet any \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right\">alt-right</a>\u201d Gabbard fans, but there were certainly some conservative-leaning supporters among the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a weird one because I\u2019m not rabid anti-Trump,\u201d said Tom Gill, a 57-year-old consultant from Albany, New Hampshire.

      "bodyText": "Tulsi Gabbard arrived late for her own campaign event at the Salt Hill Pub in Lebanon, New Hampshire. It meant she had to weave her way through the crowd of 200 people \u2013 her biggest audience yet in the state. It gave Gabbard an opportunity to see the eclectic mix of supporters her curious 2020 presidential campaign has managed to assemble: a mostly male grab-bag of veterans, anti-war activists, ex-Bernie Sanders supporters, ex-Jill Stein votersand at least one Donald Trump fan. There was a bearded man wearing a multicolored wool hat, who was carrying a big stick that he kept banging on the floor. An ex-navy seaman was there, bantering with Gabbard about her service in the army. A longtime Sanders-supporting carpenter pushed his way to the front as Gabbard passed, and declared that on shaking the candidate\u2019s hand he had sensed \u201ca real force of being\u201d. At the back of the crowd an old man waved a sign that said: \u201cFree Julian Assange. Stop the torture.\u201d It was an interesting time to attend a Gabbard event. The 39-year-old congresswoman, currently in her third term in the House, is coming off the back of a mild political storm after she was linked with being a Russian plant in the Democratic race, and many of her supporters were convinced of a Democratic-party-cum-mainstream-media conspiracy to depress her chances. \u201cAloha!\u201d Gabbard began \u2013 she is from Hawaii, something she mentions a lot \u2013 while her staff handed out campaign leaflets which had a picture of Gabbard and the words \u201cA soldier\u2019s heart\u201d. (Gabbard is a major in the national guard and has served tours of Kuwait and Iraq. She mentions that a lot, too.) Wearing her customary white blazer and standing on a wooden bench, Gabbard spoke slowly and deliberately. Gabbard believes that the US has spent too much money meddling in other country\u2019s affairs, and is a fervent anti-interventionist. Her belief in scaling back the military shapes her politics and is the basis of her campaign pitch. Her pitch was well-received. \u201cI like the fact that she is active in the military, but also not a warmonger,\u201d said Emily Cummings, who lives in Vermont, across the New Hampshire border. Cummings, 31, is a big Sanders supporter, but if Gabbard is still in the race by the time the primary comes round \u2013 Vermont votes in March, three weeks after New Hampshire\u2019s 11 February primary vote for the Democratic party\u2019s White House nominee, she might plump for the congresswoman. \u201cThe fact that she wants to reallocate money from the military back to our country, which is really, really important to me \u2013 we spend a ridiculous amount of money on weapons \u2013 that is one of the biggest reasons I support her, is taking money away from that machine,\u201d Cummings said. Gabbard says that the money saved by changing the US military\u2019s role could be used to fund better healthcare (Gabbard believes in universal healthcare, but stops short of banning private healthcare, like some of her rivals), and tackling the climate crisis (Gabbard was an early supporter of the Green New Deal championed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives, but has since backed away from it). That appealed to Kevin Dunwoody \u2013 the man who had felt a distinct surge of energy when he clasped Gabbard\u2019s hand. \u201cWe need a change in a big way. But I don\u2019t know whether she can get the stars aligned enough to make it happen,\u201d Dunwoody said. He supported Sanders in the Democratic primary, but voted for the Green party candidate, Jill Stein, in 2016. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to vote for Hillary [Clinton],\u201d Dunwoody said. This time he will vote for Gabbard. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the few that makes sense. But there\u2019s no media coverage. She got some press coverage when Hillary said she was a spy, but the game is so fixed.\u201d It was a common complaint on Saturday that the media has not given enough attention to Gabbard\u2019s campaign. But given her current position in the race \u2013 she\u2019s polling ninth nationally, with 1% support \u2013 a share of the vote that has barely moved in six months \u2013 it is difficult to argue she deserves to be treated like a frontrunner. In any case, Gabbard has experienced a surge in press coverage recently. As Dunwoody said, the boost came from a strange source: a number of media organizations reported that Clinton had accused Gabbard of being groomed by Russia ahead of 2020. Clinton did not actually say that \u2013 in an interview on the Campaign HQ podcast Clinton said Gabbard was being groomed by Republicans for a potential third-party run \u2013 and Gabbard\u2019s campaign presumably knows this, but she has continued to fundraise on the back of the nonexistent accusation. Gabbard has repeatedly denied she will run as an independent, but rumors persist. What is clear, however, is that of the Democratic candidates, Gabbard certainly has an unusual coalition. FiveThirtyEight found that her base is \u201coverwhelmingly male\u201d, mostly white and unusually conservative. Gabbard, seemingly, has set out to cultivate this, making regular appearances on Fox News and even giving an exclusive interview to the rightwing online news organization Breitbart. The Guardian didn\u2019t meet any \u201calt-right\u201d Gabbard fans, but there were certainly some conservative-leaning supporters among the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m a weird one because I\u2019m not rabid anti-Trump,\u201d said Tom Gill, a 57-year-old consultant from Albany, New Hampshire. Gill didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016, but is considering doing so in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s done some good stuff and he\u2019s getting slammed in the media for the most part. And Tulsi\u2019s getting slammed in the media also.\u201d Gill listed prison reform, \u201ccalming relations with Korea\u201d and pulling out of Syria as some of Trump\u2019s achievements. \u201cActually he\u2019s very much like Tulsi,\u201d Gill said of Trump. \u201cStop the wars, stop wasting lives, stop wasting money. It\u2019s the root of many of the problems.\u201d There is no suggestion Gabbard\u2019s campaign is working with Russia. But there is something a little strange going on with Russia\u2019s treatment of her candidacy. In October an analysis by the Alliance for Securing Democracy found that Gabbard was receiving unusual exposure from the Kremlin-backed RT news organization, while, according to the New York Times, Twitter hashtags favoring Gabbard have been amplified by fake accounts. Gabbard is presumably aware of this \u2013 which made her response particularly intriguing when one attendee, a young boy called Cory, asked her what she would do to \u201cmake sure Russia does not interfere in our elections\u201d. \u201cThe greatest threat to our democracy right now is the fact that we have 14 states in our country that have no paper ballots, they have no record of the votes that are cast, due to electronic systems,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much for a bad actor, whether it be another country or some individual rogue person, to go and hack into these systems, manipulate the number of votes that are cast for one candidate or another and completely change the outcome of the election.\u201d Russia interfered in the 2016 Clinton-Trump election in numerous ways, Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation found. Russia spent millions of dollars creating fake social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, using the accounts to post anti-Clinton and pro-Trump content. Russia used similar tactics to try to suppress voting among minority groups. What Russia did not do is hack into polling booths or electoral rolls.

True, the usual factors were all in place. The 2008 financial crash and the recession that followed had been more acutely felt in wealthier regions such as Catalonia, which became even more reluctant to share its tax revenues with the poorer parts of the country.</p> <p>And heightened separatist sentiment had been used by politicians on both sides to further their own agendas. For Artur Mas, from 2010 to 2015 president of the government of Catalonia,it was an opportunity to prop up his declining electoral fortunes by breaking with the traditional, middle-of-the-road approach of his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, and to embrace separatism. For Mariano Rajoy, prime minister of Spain from 2011 to 2018, and his centre-right Partido Popular (People\u2019s party), this in turn provided a means to clamp down on separatism (via an earlier supreme court decision in 2010), further crushing Catalonia\u2019s hopes for more self-rule.</p> <p>But, as I learned, neither events nor facile arguments about Spain being the latest victim of a global far-right populist zeitgeist are enough to explain the conundrums of current Catalan and Spanish politics. Or the results of this week\u2019s general election, which saw the far-right Vox become the third largest party inparliament.</p> <p>For one thing, Spain has not been that much of an exception when it comes to far-right ideas being represented in parliament. Few international pundits take note of the fact, but Vox, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/spain-far-right-vox-party-wins-seats-in-andalucia-for-first-time-since-franco\">rose to prominence in the 2018 Andalusian regional elections</a>, was established by a splinter group of the centre-right People\u2019s party, hence was already very much part of mainstream politics in Spain. Similarly, Vox\u2019s latest gains cannot be explained as evidence of an unprecedented surge in xenophobic feeling. Spanish people remain much more tolerant towards immigrants than most of their European counterparts.</p> <p>Key to Vox\u2019s increasing appeal is the Catalan crisis (if we leave aside one-off factors such as the government\u2019s exhumation of Franco\u2019s body). During the election campaign Vox promised a crackdown on the Catalan secession movement, characterising the protests in Barcelona as evidence of a \u201cpermanent coup\u201d. But here, too, the reality is much more nuanced than any morally charged black-and-white narrative of separatists versus unionists would have us believe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What unites the demonstrators and strikers is anger at what they perceive to be a corrupt political elite</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To begin with, the unrest triggered by the supreme court\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-separatist-leaders-given-lengthy-prison-sentences\">sentencing last month</a> of Catalonia\u2019s separatist leaders can only be partially explained with reference to demands for national self-determination. Because independence means different things to different people.<a href=\"http://upceo.ceo.gencat.cat/wsceop/7188/Abstract%20in%20English%20-942.pdf\"> The latest barometer from the Catalan Centre for Opinion Studies</a> shows that only 34.5% of the population believes that Catalonia should be an independent state while 24.5% believe it should be a state within a federal Spain, as opposed to 27% who prefer the continuation of the status quo \u2013 a fact confirmed in the general elections with 43% of the voters rooting for independentist parties as opposed to 40% who opted for non-independentist parties.</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly, for a significant number of Catalans, the demonstrations are not about Catalonia\u2019s future status at all.</p> <p>The protesters have little sympathy for secessionist leaders such as Quim Torra or Carles Puigdemont \u2013 as the dismal performance of their Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) at the ballot box also revealed. What unites the participants of demonstrations and strikes is anger at, and a certain disdain for, what they perceive to be a corrupt political elite. In that respect, they are more a continuation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/15/spain-15-m-movement-activism\">the anti-austerity </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/15/spain-15-m-movement-activism\">indignados</a>,</em> who occupied the Puerta del Sol Square in Madrid back in 2011, than anything else.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean that the current crisis is artificial or indeed temporary. On the contrary, the latest wave of protests, mobilised by <a href=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2019/10/16/actualidad/1571247648_863041.html\">the Defen</a><a href=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2019/10/16/actualidad/1571247648_863041.html\">ce Committees of the Republic (CDR) and/or the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic</a>, was much more organised and aggressive than before, sending shockwaves through the rest of Spain and around the world. What is more, the protesters weren\u2019t only the \u201cleft behind\u201d, the \u201csomewheres\u201d and the \u201cback rows\u201d \u2013 the darlings of the dominant media narrative about such incidents \u2013 but included the \u201cwell-off\u201d, the \u201canywheres\u201d and \u201cfront rows\u201d. Many were white-collar workers or university students, \u201cpart-time\u201d protesters dividing their time between work or university and the street demonstrations. This is corroborated by <a href=\"https://policynetwork.org/publications/papers/pathways-and-legacies-of-the-secessionist-push-in-catalonia/\">survey data</a> that show that support for secession is highest among those who have a household net income of \u20ac2,000-\u20ac3,000 per month, followed by those who make more than \u20ac3,000 (averages for Catalonia). In other words, Catalan separatism is a middle- or upper-middle class phenomenon, not a balloon of discontent that time\u2019s pinprick will burst.</p> <p>No one is more aware of this than Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, who insistently played the economy card in the run-up to the elections. \u201cThe economic crisis will find us without national unity and without legal security,\u201d said Abascal in a televised debate on 4 November. He finished by quoting Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, one of the ideologues of the fascist Falangist movement: \u201cOnly the rich can afford not to have a country.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, Abascal\u2019s ideal country, a muscular centralised Spain, is not the country most Catalans want, preferring an independent Catalonia or an autonomous region within Spain with more control of its fiscal powers. And neither seems willing to accept the other\u2019s fantasy, as the election results, which divided evenly between left and right, showed.</p> <p>The danger Spain faces in the aftermath of the general election is that the holders of one fantasy try to usurp the other. There were already signs of it before the elections when the Madrid branches of the People\u2019s party and Ciudadanos (Citizens) declared that <a href=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2019/11/08/actualidad/1573203972_379098.html\">they might support Vox\u2019s initiative to outlaw independentist parties</a>. Whether they actually choose to follow this harsher path rather than engaging in a dialogue with the separatists \u2013 the policy the newly forged left coalition between PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party) and Podemos will follow \u2013 remains to be seen.</p> <p>The one certain thing is there will be much less room for manoeuvre in a country locked into a situation where Catalan and Spanish nationalisms feed off each other.</p> <p>In the meantime, the academic who comes to Barcelona to see nationalism in action faces ever more ambiguity and complexity. I\u2019ve already learned the most important lesson though as I walk the tightrope between competing Catalan, Basque and Castilian nationalisms: simplistic solutions and conventional wisdom give you the wrong answers.</p> <p>\u2022 Umut \u00d6zk\u0131r\u0131ml\u0131 is a visiting professor at IBEI (Institut Barcelona d\u2019Estudis Internacionals) and CIDOB (Barcelona Centre for International Affairs)</p>",

Or the results of this week\u2019s general election, which saw the far-right Vox become the third largest party inparliament. For one thing, Spain has not been that much of an exception when it comes to far-right ideas being represented in parliament. Few international pundits take note of the fact, but Vox, which rose to prominence in the 2018 Andalusian regional elections, was established by a splinter group of the centre-right People\u2019s party, hence was already very much part of mainstream politics in Spain. Similarly, Vox\u2019s latest gains cannot be explained as evidence of an unprecedented surge in xenophobic feeling. Spanish people remain much more tolerant towards immigrants than most of their European counterparts. Key to Vox\u2019s increasing appeal is the Catalan crisis (if we leave aside one-off factors such as the government\u2019s exhumation of Franco\u2019s body). During the election campaign Vox promised a crackdown on the Catalan secession movement, characterising the protests in Barcelona as evidence of a \u201cpermanent coup\u201d. But here, too, the reality is much more nuanced than any morally charged black-and-white narrative of separatists versus unionists would have us believe. To begin with, the unrest triggered by the supreme court\u2019s sentencing last month of Catalonia\u2019s separatist leaders can only be partially explained with reference to demands for national self-determination. Because independence means different things to different people. The latest barometer from the Catalan Centre for Opinion Studies shows that only 34.5% of the population believes that Catalonia should be an independent state while 24.5% believe it should be a state within a federal Spain, as opposed to 27% who prefer the continuation of the status quo \u2013 a fact confirmed in the general elections with 43% of the voters rooting for independentist parties as opposed to 40% who opted for non-independentist parties. Perhaps more importantly, for a significant number of Catalans, the demonstrations are not about Catalonia\u2019s future status at all. The protesters have little sympathy for secessionist leaders such as Quim Torra or Carles Puigdemont \u2013 as the dismal performance of their Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) at the ballot box also revealed. What unites the participants of demonstrations and strikes is anger at, and a certain disdain for, what they perceive to be a corrupt political elite. In that respect, they are more a continuation of the anti-austerity indignados, who occupied the Puerta del Sol Square in Madrid back in 2011, than anything else. This doesn\u2019t mean that the current crisis is artificial or indeed temporary. On the contrary, the latest wave of protests, mobilised by the Defence Committees of the Republic (CDR) and/or the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, was much more organised and aggressive than before, sending shockwaves through the rest of Spain and around the world. What is more, the protesters weren\u2019t only the \u201cleft behind\u201d, the \u201csomewheres\u201d and the \u201cback rows\u201d \u2013 the darlings of the dominant media narrative about such incidents \u2013 but included the \u201cwell-off\u201d, the \u201canywheres\u201d and \u201cfront rows\u201d. Many were white-collar workers or university students, \u201cpart-time\u201d protesters dividing their time between work or university and the street demonstrations. This is corroborated by survey data that show that support for secession is highest among those who have a household net income of \u20ac2,000-\u20ac3,000 per month, followed by those who make more than \u20ac3,000 (averages for Catalonia). In other words, Catalan separatism is a middle- or upper-middle class phenomenon, not a balloon of discontent that time\u2019s pinprick will burst. No one is more aware of this than Santiago Abascal, the leader of Vox, who insistently played the economy card in the run-up to the elections. \u201cThe economic crisis will find us without national unity and without legal security,\u201d said Abascal in a televised debate on 4 November. He finished by quoting Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, one of the ideologues of the fascist Falangist movement: \u201cOnly the rich can afford not to have a country.\u201d Of course, Abascal\u2019s ideal country, a muscular centralised Spain, is not the country most Catalans want, preferring an independent Catalonia or an autonomous region within Spain with more control of its fiscal powers. And neither seems willing to accept the other\u2019s fantasy, as the election results, which divided evenly between left and right, showed. The danger Spain faces in the aftermath of the general election is that the holders of one fantasy try to usurp the other. There were already signs of it before the elections when the Madrid branches of the People\u2019s party and Ciudadanos (Citizens) declared that they might support Vox\u2019s initiative to outlaw independentist parties. Whether they actually choose to follow this harsher path rather than engaging in a dialogue with the separatists \u2013 the policy the newly forged left coalition between PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party) and Podemos will follow \u2013 remains to be seen. The one certain thing is there will be much less room for manoeuvre in a country locked into a situation where Catalan and Spanish nationalisms feed off each other. In the meantime, the academic who comes to Barcelona to see nationalism in action faces ever more ambiguity and complexity. I\u2019ve already learned the most important lesson though as I walk the tightrope between competing Catalan, Basque and Castilian nationalisms: simplistic solutions and conventional wisdom give you the wrong answers. \u2022 Umut \u00d6zk\u0131r\u0131ml\u0131 is a visiting professor at IBEI (Institut Barcelona d\u2019Estudis Internacionals) and CIDOB (Barcelona Centre for International Affairs)",

      "body": "<p>When Tony Cross\u2019s father was the first buyer at a McCarthy &amp; Stone retirement development in Folkestone, Kent, he thought he was getting a bargain. The sales rep offered him an \u201cearly bird\u201d discount, knocking \u00a33,000 off the cost of a one-bed flat, selling it to him for \u00a3161,950 in 2007. But since inheriting it four years ago, Cross has been unable to find a buyer, and is considering selling it to a \u201cbuy it now\u201d company \u2013 for just \u00a328,000.</p> <p>How could a relatively newly-built apartment in good condition, with more than 100 years remaining on the lease, collapse in value so spectacularly? The average apartment in Folkestone has gone up in price from \u00a3137,000 to \u00a3162,000 since 2007 \u2013 so why is the McCarthy &amp; Stone flat potentially going for less than the <a href=\"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-68352151.html\" title=\"\">price of a garage</a> in the seaside town?</p> <p>McCarthy &amp; Stone is the biggest builder of retirement flats in Britain, with 1,200 developments across the country, and sales of about \u00a3700m a year, but has faced repeated accusations of poor resale values.</p> <p>Perhaps even more shocking is the council tax bill on Cross\u2019s one-bed flat, which has spiralled to \u00a33,000 this year and is heading to \u00a34,500 next year \u2013 or more than the tax on a multimillion-pound mansion in Mayfair.</p> <p>When Cross first inherited the flat in 2015, the estate agents put it on the market for \u00a3143,000. But there wasn\u2019t a sniff of interest. It was reduced to \u00a3135,000, then \u00a3120,000. Cross changed agents seven times. The valuation kept falling \u2013 to \u00a399,000, then \u00a389,000, then \u00a369,000, then \u00a359,000. But even at this price, he can\u2019t find a buyer.</p> <p>Why not? Cross blames what he describes as the \u201cpunitive\u201d service charge on the one-bed flat. Last year the charge was \u00a3562 every month \u2013 equal to \u00a36,744 a year, although this year it dropped back to \u00a3519 a month. On top of that, the ground rent is a further \u00a3415 a year. In other words, a retired person could be paying nearly all their state pension in service and ground rent charges.</p> <p>\u201cThe feedback from the selling agents is that the high cost of service charges puts people off buying,\u201d says Cross.</p> <p>While the flat has been on the market, Cross has been liable for the service charge, ground rent and council tax, shelling out \u00a318,000 so far. \u201cI\u2019m going to go bankrupt at this rate,\u201d he says. \u201cIn total it\u2019s costing me \u00a3900 a month to keep. I\u2019ve got my own home to pay for, and you can\u2019t run two houses on a normal wage. It\u2019s been one huge money pit. One of the buy-it-now companies has offered me as little as \u00a315,000 for it. The stress has been so much, and to be honest it\u2019s made me so stroppy and moody, it\u2019s cost me my relationship too.\u201d</p> <p>Cross says that when he researched Land Registry figures, he found that other flats in the development had been sold for \u00a399,000 when new. \u201cSo much for the early bird discount,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Cross is not alone in finding that retirement flats can be a poor investment. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41200686\" title=\"\">Figures prepared for the BBC</a> in 2017 by the Elderly Accommodation Counsel, a charity, found that about half of new-build retirement homes sold during a 10-year period were later resold at a loss. But more recent research from the EAC showed that retirement flats built since 2009 have <a href=\"http://www.eac.org.uk/eac-news/item-eac-new-report-into-retirement-3ff7e.aspx\" title=\"\">increased their value upon resale</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s no comfort for many who bought in Cross\u2019s development, Laurel Court. A flat bought in April 2010 for \u00a3150,000 sold for \u00a375,000 last year. Another purchased for \u00a3151,000 in November 2009 sold for \u00a3105,000 in April this year. A two-bed flat in the block is currently listed on Rightmove at \u00a345,000, and is the cheapest property for sale in the whole of Folkestone. The agent says it is in \u201cimpeccable condition\u201d but warns that service charges apply. When Guardian Money checked this week, there were 18 listings on Rightmove of flats in Laurel Court, many with \u201creduced\u201d stickers.</p> <p>Of the other flats going cheap in Folkestone, many are in Pleydell Court \u2013 another McCarthy &amp; Stone development. The most recent sale there was for \u00a380,000, a \u00a315,000 fall from the price it sold for 11 years earlier.</p> <p>One problem is the very limited range of people allowed to buy. Like most retirement developments, it only permits couples aged over 55 or single people aged over 60. What\u2019s more, mainstream mortgage firms won\u2019t lend against these types of retirement properties.</p> <p>\u201cThey are really lovely, immaculate flats, with a lovely communal lounge,\u201d said one Folkestone estate agent contacted by Guardian Money. \u201cBut people are just very wary about the service charges, which on the two-bedders are around \u00a37,500 a year.\u201d</p> <p>Council tax has turned into a nightmare for Cross. He showed Guardian Money his latest bill from Folkestone and Hythe council. Although the one-bed flat is only a band B property \u2013 one band above the lowest valuation \u2013 this year\u2019s bill is \u00a32,969.44. Next year it will rise to nearly \u00a34,500.</p> <p>Cross has been caught by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/james-brokenshire-provides-stronger-powers-for-councils-to-tackle-empty-homes\" title=\"\">empty homes premium</a>, an initiative designed to bring longstanding empty homes back into use. It allows councils in England to double the council tax on properties empty for two years, and triple it if they have been empty for five.</p> <p>As Cross\u2019s home has sat on the market since 2015, the local council has applied the doubling in tax, and can triple it next year. Cross says the flat was initially left empty after his father had to go into special care before he died. He says he can\u2019t be the only person in a situation to have inherited a retirement flat and not left it empty out of choice but because they can\u2019t find a buyer. Even if he let it out, he says he has been advised the rent would be about \u00a3600 a month at most, leaving him with an ongoing loss every month.</p> <p>When Cross does find a buyer, there is a final sting in the tail \u2013 he will have to give the freeholder a 2% share of the proceeds. He says he has also been asked for \u00a3324 for a \u201cseller\u2019s pack\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"021d909e868a76e8bbaa542b1c60f9836c8779ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/021d909e868a76e8bbaa542b1c60f9836c8779ea/0_360_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laurel Court in Folkestone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laurel Court flats attract praise \u2013 but some have proved hard to sell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When McCarthy &amp; Stone built the development, it sold the flats as leasehold and retained the freehold. But shortly after it sold the freehold to a company called Fairhold, a British Virgin Islands-based group, which collects the ground rent. Cross pays the service charge to FirstPort, a property management company controlled by two private equity funds.</p> <p>Initially Cross says the service charge was high but not outlandish. It was around \u00a3350 a month at first, he says, and includes a 24-hour warden, pull-cords in the flat to seek assistance, cleaning, and the communal lounge. But the shift upwards to more than \u00a3500 a month appears to have made it too high for potential buyers to swallow.</p> <p>He says he is deeply frustrated by some of the charges levied, asking why the alarm system was replaced on a building just 12 years old, at a cost to each flat of about \u00a31,000. </p> <p>In a statement, FirstPort said: \u201cLaurel Court is an assisted living development with enhanced communal facilities such as a restaurant, dining room, function room, restaurant kitchen, staff room, sleepover room, and two lifts. This does mean that it requires a more comprehensive level of servicing and the service charge is higher than it would be on a non-assisted living development.</p> <p>\u201cWe clearly explain our charges to customers and share budgets with them before the final bill is agreed so that we are completely transparent and there are no surprise costs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe know our customers have the peace of mind that day-to-day home maintenance tasks are taken care of, like mowing the lawn, as well as the bigger jobs, like refurbishing the lifts. Having an estates manager and other on-site staff available 24/7 in an assisted living development offers safety and security that is really valued by our residents and their families. Our customers tell us that the quality of life and the sense of community and companionship that comes from living in a communal, managed development has enhanced their lives greatly.\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy &amp; Stone said that since 2010 it has run its own management service on new sites and no longer sells the freeholds to other parties.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of our managed properties increase in value on resale. To help improve this further, we launched a new in-house resales operation in 2017 to support our customers and their families when they come to sell their property. We urge anyone seeking to resell their property to use our in-house service.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe value of retirement housing is not just financial. Retirement communities help to reduce the burden of maintenance, increase safety and security for the elderly and reduce loneliness. Nine out of 10 of our customers say moving to one of our properties improves their quality of life.\u201d</p> <p>However, Cross says McCarthy &amp; Stone rejected him when he asked to market his property through its resale service.</p> <p><em>Names have been changed</em></p>",

I moved from Brighton more than a year ago after my ex moved here with our daughter. I have a decent CV with lots of experience and qualifications in areas like accountancy and graphic design but they don\u2019t seem to be in demand here. This year I\u2019ve had three jobs: a maternity cover PA role which ended when she returned early; an admin assistant job that went from temp to permanent but I was let go when their budget was cut; and cleaning bird mess off the warships in the dockyards. I apply for lots of jobs but am often told I\u2019m overqualified and so they don\u2019t take me on.</p> <p>From Christmas to May this year I was on universal credit and it was a nightmare. I received \u00a3406 a month towards rent but my accommodation at the time was \u00a3750 as I was living in a two-bedroom flat so my daughter could come and stay. I was left out of pocket. I hoped I wouldn\u2019t be out of work for too long but in the end I had to move into a cheaper place. Now I\u2019m stuck in a shared house, which isn\u2019t exactly a great environment for my daughter. The situation is far from ideal. But at \u00a3450 including bills, at least the rent here is more affordable.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seriously struggled to live during the past year. I\u2019ve sold a lot of items such as my MacBook, iPhone, games console and TV just to afford my rent. After a year of struggling, I\u2019ve decided to pursue a career in teaching.

      "bodyText": "Name: Jason Cordingley Age: 38 Income: Occasional part -time casual work plus rent support Occupation: Student I\u2019ve lived all over the country but the only place I\u2019ve really struggled to find work is Plymouth. I moved from Brighton more than a year ago after my ex moved here with our daughter. I have a decent CV with lots of experience and qualifications in areas like accountancy and graphic design but they don\u2019t seem to be in demand here. This year I\u2019ve had three jobs: a maternity cover PA role which ended when she returned early; an admin assistant job that went from temp to permanent but I was let go when their budget was cut; and cleaning bird mess off the warships in the dockyards. I apply for lots of jobs but am often told I\u2019m overqualified and so they don\u2019t take me on. From Christmas to May this year I was on universal credit and it was a nightmare. I received \u00a3406 a month towards rent but my accommodation at the time was \u00a3750 as I was living in a two-bedroom flat so my daughter could come and stay. I was left out of pocket. I hoped I wouldn\u2019t be out of work for too long but in the end I had to move into a cheaper place. Now I\u2019m stuck in a shared house, which isn\u2019t exactly a great environment for my daughter. The situation is far from ideal. But at \u00a3450 including bills, at least the rent here is more affordable. I\u2019ve seriously struggled to live during the past year. I\u2019ve sold a lot of items such as my MacBook, iPhone, games console and TV just to afford my rent. After a year of struggling, I\u2019ve decided to pursue a career in teaching. I\u2019d been thinking about it for years but didn\u2019t like the idea of studying for up to five years while also trying to support my daughter. I\u2019d been told that if the course is less than 16 hours a week you can still claim benefits, so I started my teaching course, told the job centre, and was then told that rule used to exist when it was jobseeker\u2019s allowance, but not now it\u2019s universal credit.

And the price of (some) Dyson cordless vacuum cleaners will drop to their lowest ever level.</p> <p>But how real are these Black Friday deals? Let\u2019s take a look firstly at Amazon Fire tablets. This week (all prices correct Thursday 14 November) Amazon was selling the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fire-7-Tablet---Black---16-GB/dp/B07JQRYR5M/ref=sxin_1_ac_d_rm?ac_md=0-0-ZmlyZSA3IHRhYmxldA%3D%3D-ac_d_rm&amp;crid=2REQMCWGUVCK7&amp;keywords=fire%2B7%2Btablet&amp;pd_rd_i=B07JQRYR5M&amp;pd_rd_r=88319b40-d169-450d-b4d0-94550dfdc589&amp;pd_rd_w=8NzqR&amp;pd_rd_wg=bhP1G&amp;pf_rd_p=c110aab5-da3d-4c52-b106-9534482a4cc5&amp;pf_rd_r=MX8693JTP268BEV3D8C9&amp;qid=1573745298&amp;sprefix=fire%2B7%2Btablet%2Caps%2C134&amp;th=1\">All-new Fire 7 tablet\u201d with 16</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fire-7-Tablet---Black---16-GB/dp/B07JQRYR5M/ref=sxin_1_ac_d_rm?ac_md=0-0-ZmlyZSA3IHRhYmxldA%3D%3D-ac_d_rm&amp;crid=2REQMCWGUVCK7&amp;keywords=fire%2B7%2Btablet&amp;pd_rd_i=B07JQRYR5M&amp;pd_rd_r=88319b40-d169-450d-b4d0-94550dfdc589&amp;pd_rd_w=8NzqR&amp;pd_rd_wg=bhP1G&amp;pf_rd_p=c110aab5-da3d-4c52-b106-9534482a4cc5&amp;pf_rd_r=MX8693JTP268BEV3D8C9&amp;qid=1573745298&amp;sprefix=fire%2B7%2Btablet%2Caps%2C134&amp;th=1\">GB storage</a> for \u00a349.99.</p> <p>Now what\u2019s the chances that on Amazon\u2019s site it will be, say, \u00a334.99 come Black Friday? Ermm \u2026 very, very high. How do I know this? No, not because Amazon have sent the press an embargoed list of their deals. Rather, it\u2019s because Amazon dropped the price of these Fire tablets on its website in mid-October to \u00a334.99, then put them back up again to \u00a349.99. It\u2019s going to be fairly obvious that Amazon can now knock \u00a315 off the price again \u2013 or maybe a bit more.</p> <p>The Fire tablets are actually pretty good, by all accounts. At about \u00a335 they are tremendous value compared with an iPad. Just don\u2019t imagine you\u2019re being cute and pouncing on a never-before-seen bargain. You\u2019ve just been lined up for it.</p> <p>One trick is to look at websites such as <a href=\"https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/All-new-Tablet-display-Special-Offers/product/B07JQRYR5M\">CamelCamelCamel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.idealo.co.uk/compare/6604217/amazon-fire-7-16gb-2019.html\">Idealo</a> \u2013 just paste in an item that\u2019s currently on sale at Amazon, and they give a price history, noting if and when it was at a lower price. Both sites show me that the Fire 7 16 GB tablet was at the lower \u00a334.99 price in both October and August.</p> <p>On Friday, Argos jumped in with its \u201cbonanza\u201d of \u201cbrilliant bargains\u201d Black Friday offers. What has it listed as one of its top deals? Yes, the Fire tablet, although it\u2019s the smaller storage 8GB version which isn\u2019t even pushed on the main Amazon site any longer. Argos is slashing the price from \u00a349.99 to \u00a329.99. I think you can fairly safely assume it won\u2019t be heading back to \u00a349.99 any time soon.</p> <p>How about those Le Creuset pans at John Lewis? Right now, the John Lewis site is selling a set of <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/le-creuset-3-ply-stainless-steel-pan-set-4-pieces/p751524\">four Le Creuset stainless steel pans </a>for \u00a3399. Jeepers, you\u2019ve got to be well-off to pay that. But John Lewis slashed the price of many of their Le Creusets last year, and can be expected to so the same again this year. Maybe, just maybe, hardly anyone ever pays the full price for these sorts of items. Take a look at the price history for the \u201csignature\u201d cast-iron 20cm Le Creuset casserole dish on Amazon. It\u2019s been at \u00a3185 for much of November, is currently \u00a3138, and was \u00a3120 in late June and about that price last Black Friday.</p> <p>The Google Home Mini looks like a yo-yo, and its price behaves the same way. Last Black Friday, Google dropped the price to \u00a329 from \u00a349. It went back up in price for a period after Black Friday, but for much of this year has been retailing at \u00a329. I\u2019ll take a wild guess that Google will cut the price again over the next week or two to \u00a325 or even \u00a320. But you won\u2019t need to rush \u2013 you can be pretty sure that the deal will become the standard price pretty soon.</p> <p>Many of the tech items \u201cslashed in price\u201d on Black Friday are simply last year\u2019s models or where tech fashion has moved on. Sales of in-ear wireless headphones are booming \u2013 so the ones with cables have got to be shifted, pronto, with big price cuts.

Thus a programme with no special effects and middling set and location expenses \u2013 it\u2019s about the tribulations of a hit breakfast-news TV show \u2013 has ended up costing Apple somewhere between $12m and $15m per episode.

This contributed to Big Little Lies itself also becoming as expensive as the last season of Game of Thrones.

It is safe to say it will be rather more lavish than that.

Although Amazon\u2019s Rings is a prequel rather than another straight dramatisation of the novel, anything less globally impactful than the Oscar-winning movies will be deemed a failure. All this is a result of a clear diktat issued by Jeff Bezos in 2017: get me the new Game of Thrones.

Then, it was proof that Netflix was destroying long-held notions of what TV could cost. Now, the fictionalised Liz II is just one soldier in a billion-dollar streaming war: shows as expensive as The Crown are ten a penny. Last week saw the US unveiling of Disney+, which will offer three new Marvel series and, in The Mandalorian, a luxurious TV addition to the Star Wars universe. Such shows embody a principle that runs right through this revolution in production budgets: they have been commissioned for streaming platforms where TV originals have to integrate seamlessly into a back catalogue of blockbuster movies. Netflix\u2019s other big new rival is Apple TV+, which debuted worldwide earlier this month. Its two big openers, The Morning Show and See, are both thought to cost around the same as the final season of Game of Thrones.

Thus a programme with no special effects and middling set and location expenses \u2013 it\u2019s about the tribulations of a hit breakfast-news TV show \u2013 has ended up costing Apple somewhere between $12m and $15m per episode. It has already had a knock-on effect, too: when Nicole Kidman came to renegotiate her pay packet for season two of HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies, the news about her Lies colleague Witherspoon\u2019s cushy new gig helped Kidman bump herself up from $350,000 per episode to a reported $1m. This contributed to Big Little Lies itself also becoming as expensive as the last season of Game of Thrones. The Morning Show might not have been universally well reviewed, but it has caused another recalibration of how much money you need to play the modern TV game. Talent 5/5 Effects 0/5 Locations 1/5 Estimated total $250m The Lord of the Rings Amazon are said to have paid the estate of JRR Tolkien $250m just for the rights to make its upcoming Rings series, starring Joseph Mawle, so it would be pretty expensive even if it were just one long overhead shot of someone slowly turning over the pages of the book. It is safe to say it will be rather more lavish than that. Having not quite nailed it with major expenditures such as Jack Ryan (an estimated $8m an episode) or The Tick ($5m an episode, somehow), Amazon is pressing the nuclear button this time around with a mooted $1bn production budget. Scale is the thing here, with sets due to be built from scratch, filming to take place in New Zealand and a $3bn-grossing film trilogy to be measured against. Although Amazon\u2019s Rings is a prequel rather than another straight dramatisation of the novel, anything less globally impactful than the Oscar-winning movies will be deemed a failure. All this is a result of a clear diktat issued by Jeff Bezos in 2017: get me the new Game of Thrones. In the new streaming war, that is the treasure everyone\u2019s seeking.

I\u2019ve spent the past year researching and writing the first-ever <a href=\"https://app.box.com/s/ird3qtcp92ukcfm7jsahhvng4qosvpli/file/554524155527\">continental report</a> of the routine, blatant discrimination suffered by African girls.</p> <p>The fact that girls and women are treated as inferior citizens is hardly news, except that this report reveals the extent to which gender discrimination is frequently state-sanctioned \u2013 embedded into the laws, policies and practices of many African nations. We\u2019re talking about legal, institutional discrimination with its roots in a deeply gendered and patriarchal society. We are also talking about the denial of respect for the dignity of the African girl.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"044010762a6718bac1d8a5e4fc8948b61c06f72a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/044010762a6718bac1d8a5e4fc8948b61c06f72a/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Violet Odala\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Violet Odala</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dr Violet Odala</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Millions of African girls face exclusion, exploitation and subjugation on a daily basis. In school, at home, out shopping, in hospitals and courts, online and offline, girls are valued and respected far less than boys. During my research I have come across numerous shocking examples, such as teenagers in Tanzania who were kicked out of school \u2013 legally \u2013 because they were pregnant.</p> <p>And an HIV-positive man in Malawi, locally known as a \u2018hyena\u2019 (responsible for taking young girls through a rite of passage to prepare them for married life by having unprotected sex with them) who slept with more than 100 women and girls and escaped a charge of \u201cdefilement\u201d for a variety of unacceptable reasons.</p> <p>Then there was the foreign charity volunteer in Kenya who recruited young girls, subjected them to pornography and sexual violence, and took them to his tourist friends. He was only charged for \u201cdefiling\u201d and committing indecent acts against them, and not under the relevant trafficking legislation.</p> <p>Again in Kenya, in a recent \u201cdefilement\u201d case, the courts exonerated an accused man who claimed in defence that he reasonably believed that a 13 year-old girl was over the age of 18 and that she was enjoying the relationship, and behaved like an adult.</p> <p>In Malawi, in a similar case, a convicted male nurse was discharged after spending one month in prison because the court considered the girl was not injured, and the accused had learnt his lesson by losing his job and being imprisoned.</p> <p>Then there were cases in Ethiopia where underage girls have been forced by \u201ctraditional justice\u201d to marry men who kidnapped, raped and got them pregnant.</p> <p>I found that in many countries, the law discriminates against girls and fails to uphold their rights.</p> <p>Laws and justice systems frequently perpetuate deeply ingrained political, social and cultural beliefs and practices designed to subjugate girls. The invisibility of girls in laws and policies has inevitably resulted in a lopsided legal pendulum tipped in favour of boys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62c80cb282c16d0af06e5d9598e974f201601ef8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62c80cb282c16d0af06e5d9598e974f201601ef8/0_266_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girls from Borana tribe carrying water to their village in Ethiopia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girls from Borana tribe carrying water to their village in Ethiopia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: hadynyah/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ironically, some international human rights instruments may have had the unintended consequence of further marginalising girls. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is child blind and the Convention on the Rights of the Child is gender blind. These treaties tend to talk in terms of \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d as distinct entities. International law seldom mentions girls as a specific group, and their rights are rarely explicitly addressed. As a result, when governments do enact legislation based on these international standards, girls can slip through the net.</p> <p>There are exceptions of course, especially at the regional level. The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights on the Rights of Women, better known as the Maputo Protocol, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC) expand legal protection to various specific aspects of girls\u2019 rights.</p> <p>Today, after nearly 30 years of the ACRWC, gender discrimination is still embedded in the laws of many African countries \u2013 even those which are party to international agreements.</p> <p>Even where laws and policies aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of girls do exist, they are frequently poorly implemented or even ignored.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I love my job, but it can be pretty depressing. I\u2019ve spent the past year researching and writing the first-ever continental report of the routine, blatant discrimination suffered by African girls. The fact that girls and women are treated as inferior citizens is hardly news, except that this report reveals the extent to which gender discrimination is frequently state-sanctioned \u2013 embedded into the laws, policies and practices of many African nations. We\u2019re talking about legal, institutional discrimination with its roots in a deeply gendered and patriarchal society. We are also talking about the denial of respect for the dignity of the African girl. Millions of African girls face exclusion, exploitation and subjugation on a daily basis. In school, at home, out shopping, in hospitals and courts, online and offline, girls are valued and respected far less than boys. During my research I have come across numerous shocking examples, such as teenagers in Tanzania who were kicked out of school \u2013 legally \u2013 because they were pregnant. And an HIV-positive man in Malawi, locally known as a \u2018hyena\u2019 (responsible for taking young girls through a rite of passage to prepare them for married life by having unprotected sex with them) who slept with more than 100 women and girls and escaped a charge of \u201cdefilement\u201d for a variety of unacceptable reasons. Then there was the foreign charity volunteer in Kenya who recruited young girls, subjected them to pornography and sexual violence, and took them to his tourist friends. He was only charged for \u201cdefiling\u201d and committing indecent acts against them, and not under the relevant trafficking legislation. Again in Kenya, in a recent \u201cdefilement\u201d case, the courts exonerated an accused man who claimed in defence that he reasonably believed that a 13 year-old girl was over the age of 18 and that she was enjoying the relationship, and behaved like an adult. In Malawi, in a similar case, a convicted male nurse was discharged after spending one month in prison because the court considered the girl was not injured, and the accused had learnt his lesson by losing his job and being imprisoned. Then there were cases in Ethiopia where underage girls have been forced by \u201ctraditional justice\u201d to marry men who kidnapped, raped and got them pregnant. I found that in many countries, the law discriminates against girls and fails to uphold their rights. Laws and justice systems frequently perpetuate deeply ingrained political, social and cultural beliefs and practices designed to subjugate girls. The invisibility of girls in laws and policies has inevitably resulted in a lopsided legal pendulum tipped in favour of boys. Ironically, some international human rights instruments may have had the unintended consequence of further marginalising girls. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is child blind and the Convention on the Rights of the Child is gender blind. These treaties tend to talk in terms of \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d as distinct entities. International law seldom mentions girls as a specific group, and their rights are rarely explicitly addressed. As a result, when governments do enact legislation based on these international standards, girls can slip through the net. There are exceptions of course, especially at the regional level. The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights on the Rights of Women, better known as the Maputo Protocol, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC) expand legal protection to various specific aspects of girls\u2019 rights. Today, after nearly 30 years of the ACRWC, gender discrimination is still embedded in the laws of many African countries \u2013 even those which are party to international agreements. Even where laws and policies aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of girls do exist, they are frequently poorly implemented or even ignored.",

It inspired a change in how I cook, and I\u2019ve tried to eliminate my food waste ever since.</p> <p>Fortunately, the rind and zest of an orange have more practical uses than I can count on my fingers and toes. Here are a few worth trying: make a frugal but tasty marmalade such as the one below; dry the rinds to make scented firelighters; infuse peelings in boiling water with other sweet-smelling ingredients such as rosemary to make an aromatic tea.

It inspired a change in how I cook, and I\u2019ve tried to eliminate my food waste ever since. Fortunately, the rind and zest of an orange have more practical uses than I can count on my fingers and toes. Here are a few worth trying: make a frugal but tasty marmalade such as the one below; dry the rinds to make scented firelighters; infuse peelings in boiling water with other sweet-smelling ingredients such as rosemary to make an aromatic tea.

      "body": "<p>I was in primary school the first time it happened. The boy who sat at the desk to my right \u2013 the one who used to pinch my arm whenever the teacher\u2019s back was turned \u2013 finished talking about his father\u2019s war experience of heat and flies and deserts while driving tanks across Egypt, and looked at me smugly as if to say, \u201cBeat that.\u201d It was my turn to describe my father\u2019s contribution to the war effort. I stated clearly that my father served in the RAF. On the piano at home stood a photograph of a young man in RAF uniform, with an enigmatic smile, head tilted at a slightly rakish and daredevil angle, holding a pipe in his hand. In my eyes he was the epitome of wartime British heroism.</p> <p>Before I could describe the photograph, I was interrupted by the teacher who told me to sit and listen carefully. I sat. The entire class was stunned. Silenced by her anger, they stared at me, the culprit, as the teacher issued a warning about the dire consequences of telling lies. She insisted that there were no \u201ccoloured\u201d people in Britain during the war, that no coloured people served in any of the armed services, and certainly not in the RAF, the most elite branch of the British military.</p> <p>Speaking in the slow and deliberate tone of voice that she adopted when she would brook no opposition, she declared that coloured people were not British, but immigrants who arrived on these shores after the war had been fought and won. We all shifted back in our seats, and I cowered in shock and humiliation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"944a4d6eff820af8c72a31fa1a758498be98b234\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/944a4d6eff820af8c72a31fa1a758498be98b234/0_0_1200_1710/702.jpg\" alt=\"Hazel Carby's parents\" width=\"702\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carby\u2019s parents, Iris and Carl. Photograph: courtesy of Hazel Carby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: COURTESY OF HAZEL CARBY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like other members of their generation, my parents processed their experiences of war through storytelling, and so constantly relived it. It was natural for <em>my</em> generation to recycle these memories, but here, for the first time, I learned they were dangerous.</p> <p>This was my first introduction to British history. I had previously absorbed the fact that I was a \u201cnigger\u201d, a \u201cwog\u201d, \u201ccoloured\u201d and \u201chalf-caste\u201d. Now I learned that I was not considered British.</p> <p>I was ostracised when I hesitantly explained where I came from. Early on, it became clear that staking a claim to Britishness risked a violent response. Eventually I was forced to fall silent.</p> <p>My Welsh mother, Iris, was 19 when the second world war was declared in September 1939. My Jamaican father, Carl, had just turned 18. The war brought them together and left an indelible imprint on the adults they became. Iris worked in the Air Ministry and Carl was an airman in the RAF \u2013 serving his whole time in England and settling in the country after the war was over.</p> <p>I was born in Devon in January 1948; in June of the same year, 492 passengers from Jamaica, carrying British passports, disembarked at Tilbury with the intention of joining the labour force that was to rebuild the devastated metropolitan heart of empire. Most of the passengers on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Empire Windrush</a> were returning servicemen, but their service to Britain during the war was quickly forgotten, their claims to being as British as anyone else denied. Outside of my immediate family, it seemed as if the ship was remembered only as the first of many ships that carried racial problems into the country.</p> <p>As soon as he left the RAF after the war, my father was regarded as one of these problems \u2013 as were my brother and I. My mother, meanwhile, was called a traitor to her race and a slut, because no respectable white woman would associate with, let alone marry, a Jamaican.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every time I was asked where I was from, I was being asked to provide a reason for my being, which I did not have</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After my school experiences, any demands to explain where I came from disconcerted me. My parents taught me to hold my head erect, to look directly at adults who addressed me, to smile with my eyes not just my teeth, to speak clearly, and to be conspicuously open, transparent and honest. My dad said that if I did not follow this advice I would be regarded as \u201cshifty\u201d, duplicitous and unworthy of attention. But I was unprepared for intense cross-examination about where I was from. I did not understand, until I was a teenager, that my father was coaching me in the art of being a \u201cgood\u201d black girl, acceptable to white people.</p> <p>The fact that I was born in England rendered me paradoxical. Adults and children alike considered the possibility of my Englishness derisory, deliberately perverse and misleading. Classmates would imitate the words of their parents: \u201cAnyone can see that she is the wrong colour to be from around here, no matter what she says!\u201d </p> <p>Far more fearsome than leaving classmates dissatisfied was irritating a teacher, or any adult, who asked what I came to think of as The Question. Muttering about being born in England condemned me to utter disapproval and the exasperated demand: \u201cBut where did you come from before that?\u201d </p> <p>Every time I was asked where I was from, I was being asked to provide a reason for my being, which I did not have. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1f7bbafebd06252f9c1fad1f4238ea0376337db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f7bbafebd06252f9c1fad1f4238ea0376337db/0_15_737_785/469.jpg\" alt=\"Hazel Carby's father in his RAF uniform, smoking a pipe\" width=\"469\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In my eyes, he was the epitome of wartime British heroism.\u2019 Photograph: courtesy of Hazel Carby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: COURTESY OF HAZEL CARBY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was cautious as I sought a way through this cultural maze, but when all the answers I could invent were rejected, I reluctantly had to acknowledge that I was being rebuffed for what I was. My chin sank into my chest, I mumbled and looked sideways out of the corner of my eyes. I became the uncooperative black girl my father did not wish me to be.</p> <p>The demands that I account for my racial self as a child were contemptible. I stumbled for many years before I learned the difficult lesson that I was not accountable to those who questioned my right to belong. The Question can still rattle my world because there is no answer that can satisfy racist conjectures about the shades of brown in skin.</p> <p>I have lived in the US since the 1980s, but even today, I find it hard to make myself legible to someone who asks The Question. If I fail to be satisfyingly \u201cread\u201d, the questioner is now in the awkward position of having to ask again, patiently repeating themselves in a louder and more forceful tone of voice, as if I was hard of hearing:</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d</p> <p>Meaning, of course, are you black or white?</p> <p>\u2022 Imperial Intimacies by Hazel Carby is published by Verso at \u00a320.

      "bodyText": "I was in primary school the first time it happened. The boy who sat at the desk to my right \u2013 the one who used to pinch my arm whenever the teacher\u2019s back was turned \u2013 finished talking about his father\u2019s war experience of heat and flies and deserts while driving tanks across Egypt, and looked at me smugly as if to say, \u201cBeat that.\u201d It was my turn to describe my father\u2019s contribution to the war effort. I stated clearly that my father served in the RAF. On the piano at home stood a photograph of a young man in RAF uniform, with an enigmatic smile, head tilted at a slightly rakish and daredevil angle, holding a pipe in his hand. In my eyes he was the epitome of wartime British heroism. Before I could describe the photograph, I was interrupted by the teacher who told me to sit and listen carefully. I sat. The entire class was stunned. Silenced by her anger, they stared at me, the culprit, as the teacher issued a warning about the dire consequences of telling lies. She insisted that there were no \u201ccoloured\u201d people in Britain during the war, that no coloured people served in any of the armed services, and certainly not in the RAF, the most elite branch of the British military. Speaking in the slow and deliberate tone of voice that she adopted when she would brook no opposition, she declared that coloured people were not British, but immigrants who arrived on these shores after the war had been fought and won. We all shifted back in our seats, and I cowered in shock and humiliation. Like other members of their generation, my parents processed their experiences of war through storytelling, and so constantly relived it. It was natural for my generation to recycle these memories, but here, for the first time, I learned they were dangerous. This was my first introduction to British history. I had previously absorbed the fact that I was a \u201cnigger\u201d, a \u201cwog\u201d, \u201ccoloured\u201d and \u201chalf-caste\u201d. Now I learned that I was not considered British. I was ostracised when I hesitantly explained where I came from. Early on, it became clear that staking a claim to Britishness risked a violent response. Eventually I was forced to fall silent. My Welsh mother, Iris, was 19 when the second world war was declared in September 1939. My Jamaican father, Carl, had just turned 18. The war brought them together and left an indelible imprint on the adults they became. Iris worked in the Air Ministry and Carl was an airman in the RAF \u2013 serving his whole time in England and settling in the country after the war was over. I was born in Devon in January 1948; in June of the same year, 492 passengers from Jamaica, carrying British passports, disembarked at Tilbury with the intention of joining the labour force that was to rebuild the devastated metropolitan heart of empire. Most of the passengers on the Empire Windrush were returning servicemen, but their service to Britain during the war was quickly forgotten, their claims to being as British as anyone else denied. Outside of my immediate family, it seemed as if the ship was remembered only as the first of many ships that carried racial problems into the country. As soon as he left the RAF after the war, my father was regarded as one of these problems \u2013 as were my brother and I. My mother, meanwhile, was called a traitor to her race and a slut, because no respectable white woman would associate with, let alone marry, a Jamaican. After my school experiences, any demands to explain where I came from disconcerted me. My parents taught me to hold my head erect, to look directly at adults who addressed me, to smile with my eyes not just my teeth, to speak clearly, and to be conspicuously open, transparent and honest. My dad said that if I did not follow this advice I would be regarded as \u201cshifty\u201d, duplicitous and unworthy of attention. But I was unprepared for intense cross-examination about where I was from. I did not understand, until I was a teenager, that my father was coaching me in the art of being a \u201cgood\u201d black girl, acceptable to white people. The fact that I was born in England rendered me paradoxical. Adults and children alike considered the possibility of my Englishness derisory, deliberately perverse and misleading. Classmates would imitate the words of their parents: \u201cAnyone can see that she is the wrong colour to be from around here, no matter what she says!\u201d Far more fearsome than leaving classmates dissatisfied was irritating a teacher, or any adult, who asked what I came to think of as The Question. Muttering about being born in England condemned me to utter disapproval and the exasperated demand: \u201cBut where did you come from before that?\u201d Every time I was asked where I was from, I was being asked to provide a reason for my being, which I did not have. I was cautious as I sought a way through this cultural maze, but when all the answers I could invent were rejected, I reluctantly had to acknowledge that I was being rebuffed for what I was. My chin sank into my chest, I mumbled and looked sideways out of the corner of my eyes. I became the uncooperative black girl my father did not wish me to be. The demands that I account for my racial self as a child were contemptible. I stumbled for many years before I learned the difficult lesson that I was not accountable to those who questioned my right to belong. The Question can still rattle my world because there is no answer that can satisfy racist conjectures about the shades of brown in skin. I have lived in the US since the 1980s, but even today, I find it hard to make myself legible to someone who asks The Question. If I fail to be satisfyingly \u201cread\u201d, the questioner is now in the awkward position of having to ask again, patiently repeating themselves in a louder and more forceful tone of voice, as if I was hard of hearing: \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Meaning, of course, are you black or white? \u2022 Imperial Intimacies by Hazel Carby is published by Verso at \u00a320.

The party\u2019s leader, Jo Swinson, will make a trip to Hampstead in north London on Saturday to plant a tree and set out proposals for what she described as the largest tree-planting programme in UK history. The UK is one of the least forested countries in Europe, with just 10% of England covered by woodland, compared with 31% of France and 37% of Spain. According to figures published in June, tree-planting in England fell well short of targets in the previous year. Only 1,420 hectares (3,507 acres) of trees were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government\u2019s target of 5,000 hectares. The Committee on Climate Change has said the UK would need to plant 1.5bn trees, equivalent to an area of 30,000 hectares every year, if it was to meet its net-zero carbon target. The Lib Dem initiative is part of the party\u2019s plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and to halve emissions by 2030 compared with today. At its autumn conference, Labour set out plans to work towards a net-zero carbon economy by 2030, two decades before the government\u2019s legally binding 2050 target. Swinson said the party would take bold action to reduce carbon emissions as quickly as possible. \u201cOur plan includes the largest tree-planting programme in UK history, which will green our towns and countryside to absorb damaging emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will help us reach net-zero emissions, and will nurture biodiversity, combat air pollution and improve public spaces. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Conservative party doesn\u2019t take climate change seriously. Only the Liberal Democrats have a radical plan to make a real impact in the fight against climate change and build a brighter future for our planet.\u201d The Lib Dems have pledged to spend \u00a36bn over the next parliament to increase tree-planting levels and to help fund the restoration of other natural carbon sinks, such as peatlands. The party plans to plant trees across the country, including in towns and cities, as well as supporting large afforestation initiatives such as the Northern Forest. Last year the government pledged \u00a35.7m to kickstart the creation of a northern forest that would stretch from Liverpool to Hull. The plans, led by the Woodland Trust, include the planting of 50m trees along a 120-mile stretch of land running next to the M62.",

Not only did people eat more in the fall compared spring (on average an extra 86 calories per day), but they also did less physical exercise when the temperature fell. As a result, body weight also peaked in winter months, though the researchers added: \u201cGreater seasonal variation was observed in subjects who were male, middle-aged, non-white, and less educated.\u201d Similar results were found in Brazil and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306456501000730\">the Netherlands</a>.</p> <p>As I researched this, studies about humans mingled with studies about animals in my search results, and I couldn\u2019t help but click.

Each year, the temperature rises along with the average hours of daylight and the cats\u2019 food intake drops. Then the temperature falls, there are fewer minutes of sun each day and the cats eat an extra 10g per day.</p> <p>Still, when I Google the words \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cwinter weight gain\u201d, I\u2019m inundated with articles telling me what to do about something I\u2019ve just learned is probably deep in my evolutionary makeup.

      "bodyText": "I have spent this morning checking my fridge as frequently as a spurned lover checking their phone. I am similarly disappointed at what I find. Condiments and beer are not going to satisfy my hunger. At first, I don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m not due for my period, not feeling particularly emotional \u2026 but I am cold. (My landlord keeps the radiators miserably low.) And it turns out temperature has a big role in affecting our appetites. According to Dr Andrew Higginson from the University of Exeter, this is an evolutionary response: \u201cStoring fat is an insurance against the risk of failing to find food, which for pre-industrial humans was most likely in winter.\u201d A study in Massachusetts tested this theory in 2006 when 593 research participants were followed for a one-year period. Not only did people eat more in the fall compared spring (on average an extra 86 calories per day), but they also did less physical exercise when the temperature fell. As a result, body weight also peaked in winter months, though the researchers added: \u201cGreater seasonal variation was observed in subjects who were male, middle-aged, non-white, and less educated.\u201d Similar results were found in Brazil and the Netherlands. As I researched this, studies about humans mingled with studies about animals in my search results, and I couldn\u2019t help but click. The chart for domesticated cats (whose lives were followed for three years) is incredibly similar to the chart for people. Each year, the temperature rises along with the average hours of daylight and the cats\u2019 food intake drops. Then the temperature falls, there are fewer minutes of sun each day and the cats eat an extra 10g per day. Still, when I Google the words \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cwinter weight gain\u201d, I\u2019m inundated with articles telling me what to do about something I\u2019ve just learned is probably deep in my evolutionary makeup. Meh. I\u2019m just going to keep my fridge stocked till summer gets here.",

A student who burst into the room said he had seen the gunman and classmates were stunned into silence, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy worst nightmare actually came true,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is it. I\u2019m gonna die,\u201d she recalled thinking.</p> \n<p>Rosie Rodriguez, a freshman, was walking up the library stairs when she heard noises that she said \u201csounded like balloons\u201d popping. She realized they were gunshots when she saw other students running.</p> \n<p>She ran across the street to a home, where a person she didn\u2019t know gave shelter to her and about 10 other students.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just heard a lot of kids crying. We were scared,\u201d Rodriguez said.</p> \n<p>People who knew the suspect described him as a quiet, smart kid who they would never have expected would violently snap. A nextdoor neighbor said he kept to himself but was never threatening. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t expect anything like that from him,\u201d said Ryan McCracken.</p> \n<p>Police continue to search for clues. On Thursday evening, authorities revealed that the bio on an Instagram account believed to have belonged to the suspect, and reviewed after the shooting, read: \u201cSaugus, have fun at school tomorrow.\u201d The bio has since been changed, but it was unclear when or by whom.</p> \n<h2>\u2018When will we come together?\u2019</h2> \n<p>In<strong> </strong>a Thursday afternoon press conference that felt painfully familiar, local leaders mourned another senseless tragedy amid a continuing scourge of school shootings. They pledged that Santa Clarita would band together to recover.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a very tragic day for our community,\u201d the local assembly member Christy Smith told reporters, thanking law enforcement, who responded to the incident within minutes. \u201cWe are very close-knit. We will come together and survive but we can\u2019t afford another day like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAcross the nation I frequently hear \u2018no more, no more\u2019,\u201d added Robert Lewis, the captain of the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff\u2019s station. \u201cWhen are we as Santa Clarita and other communities going to come together?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3f687f431914ce6494a6997eeb14e17e5c4aab2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3f687f431914ce6494a6997eeb14e17e5c4aab2/0_0_2887_1922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"First responders at Saugus high school, where at least two students were killed on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">First responders at Saugus high school, where at least two students were killed on Thursday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Monterrosa/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At a family reunification center at a park next to the school, some students sat at picnic benches inside a community garden and talked to law enforcement as loud helicopters hovered above. Parents held their children as they walked to their cars.</p> \n<p>April Dooley, a former choir teacher at Saugus high, said the school had extensively prepared for this kind of tragedy, but she still never imagined it would happen in her own community.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in total shock. It\u2019s unbelievable. Saugus high is such a quiet and sweet community \u2013 extremely benevolent,\u201d said Dooley, 60, who retired in December. She heard that one wounded victim ended up in the choir room where she used to teach, and said she felt a lot of pain for the teacher who replaced her, who was in her first year on the job: \u201cShe\u2019s still figuring out how to be a teacher, and now she\u2019s figuring out how to deal with an active shooter. How can one do that? It seems impossible for anyone \u2026 I\u2019m so proud of her.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dooley said that, as a teacher, she often thought about what she would do if a shooter threatened her class: \u201cWe are their defense. Our job is to keep them safe \u2026 We are in a choir room, there are things to defend ourselves, a piano we can hide behind. We were all very prepared.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae479a374695981589e9202146c37b1c0c3b9737\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae479a374695981589e9202146c37b1c0c3b9737/0_0_4800_3117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers are dropped off at a makeshift memorial not far from the school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flowers are dropped off at a makeshift memorial not far from the school.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dooley said she drove over as soon as she heard the news to offer any support she could: \u201cI\u2019m sad I wasn\u2019t there to take care of my babies.\u201d She added that she wanted to see the government take action on background checks.</p> \n<p>Scott Wilk, a state senator who lives a mile away from the school, said he was still processing the news. His children previously attended Saugus high, and he learned this morning that a friend\u2019s daughter had been shot but was expected to survive.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is just indescribable. This has got to stop,\u201d he said, noting that it felt as if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/08/residents-react-thousand-oaks-california-shooting\">Thousand Oaks mass shooting</a>, which killed 12 in the region last year, had been quickly forgotten: \u201cIt seemed like that was a one-day story, and it was gone. We have become so desensitized to this, like it\u2019s the new normal. It can\u2019t be the new normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wilk said he wanted to see stronger investments in mental health resources for youth: \u201cOur most precious resources are our children.\u201d He noted that when he recently visited a fourth-grade class, one of the students talked to him about wanting better security.</p> \n<p>Condolences poured in from across the country, with many Democratic lawmakers pointing to the tragedy to once again argue US lawmakers should pass stricter gun control legislation.</p> \n<p>The California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris said she was heartbroken and was praying for Santa Clarita. \u201cOur children and communities are being terrorized. We can\u2019t accept this,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4e6a24b9c5ac8099024671faad6a066f23f31499\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e6a24b9c5ac8099024671faad6a066f23f31499/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students reunite with their families after the shooting at Saugus high school.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students reunite with their families after the shooting at Saugus high school.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Reingewirtz/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAnother sad example of a school shooting &amp; why students across the country live in fear of gun violence,\u201d wrote the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, also a presidential hopeful.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m heartsick for the victims of this horrifying shooting and their families,\u201d said the Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.</p> \n<p>Back at the reunification center, Kris Hough, a field representative in Wilk\u2019s office who had showed up to help, said she wanted more than \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019 or any of that, because that\u2019s not what we need,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need this to stop. How many more of these do we have to see before it stops?\u201d</p> \n<p>Hough noted that it was such a small community that many law enforcement officials tasked with responding to the tragedy had loved ones at the school: \u201cWe all think every time one of these things happen that it\u2019s not going to happen in my safe little bubble here. It\u2019s scary to know it can happen to you just as easy as anyone else.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added, \u201cWe have all sat in front of our TVs watching in horror as these things happen.

The teen stood by himself, did not appear to interact with anyone and then walked to the center of the quad, Villanueva said. \u201cAs far as we know the actual targets were at random,\u201d the sheriff said. Villanueva said the conclusion that the attack was planned was based on the shooter bringing the weapon, handling it with enough expertise and counting the rounds fired. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a spur-of-the-moment act,\u201d he said. The origin of the gun was being investigated. Doctors said Friday morning that two girls, ages 14 and 15, who were both shot in the torso, were doing well and should be released from the hospital over the weekend. A 14-year-old boy was treated and released from another hospital, authorities said. The names of the injured students were not released. Shauna Orandi, 16, told the Guardian on Thursday she was in her Spanish class when she heard four gunshots that she initially mistook for musical instruments. A student who burst into the room said he had seen the gunman and classmates were stunned into silence, she said. \u201cMy worst nightmare actually came true,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is it. I\u2019m gonna die,\u201d she recalled thinking. Rosie Rodriguez, a freshman, was walking up the library stairs when she heard noises that she said \u201csounded like balloons\u201d popping. She realized they were gunshots when she saw other students running. She ran across the street to a home, where a person she didn\u2019t know gave shelter to her and about 10 other students. \u201cI just heard a lot of kids crying. We were scared,\u201d Rodriguez said. People who knew the suspect described him as a quiet, smart kid who they would never have expected would violently snap. A nextdoor neighbor said he kept to himself but was never threatening. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t expect anything like that from him,\u201d said Ryan McCracken. Police continue to search for clues. On Thursday evening, authorities revealed that the bio on an Instagram account believed to have belonged to the suspect, and reviewed after the shooting, read: \u201cSaugus, have fun at school tomorrow.\u201d The bio has since been changed, but it was unclear when or by whom. \u2018When will we come together?\u2019 In a Thursday afternoon press conference that felt painfully familiar, local leaders mourned another senseless tragedy amid a continuing scourge of school shootings. They pledged that Santa Clarita would band together to recover. \u201cThis is a very tragic day for our community,\u201d the local assembly member Christy Smith told reporters, thanking law enforcement, who responded to the incident within minutes. \u201cWe are very close-knit. We will come together and survive but we can\u2019t afford another day like this.\u201d \u201cAcross the nation I frequently hear \u2018no more, no more\u2019,\u201d added Robert Lewis, the captain of the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff\u2019s station. \u201cWhen are we as Santa Clarita and other communities going to come together?\u201d At a family reunification center at a park next to the school, some students sat at picnic benches inside a community garden and talked to law enforcement as loud helicopters hovered above. Parents held their children as they walked to their cars. April Dooley, a former choir teacher at Saugus high, said the school had extensively prepared for this kind of tragedy, but she still never imagined it would happen in her own community. \u201cI\u2019m in total shock. It\u2019s unbelievable. Saugus high is such a quiet and sweet community \u2013 extremely benevolent,\u201d said Dooley, 60, who retired in December. She heard that one wounded victim ended up in the choir room where she used to teach, and said she felt a lot of pain for the teacher who replaced her, who was in her first year on the job: \u201cShe\u2019s still figuring out how to be a teacher, and now she\u2019s figuring out how to deal with an active shooter. How can one do that? It seems impossible for anyone \u2026 I\u2019m so proud of her.\u201d Dooley said that, as a teacher, she often thought about what she would do if a shooter threatened her class: \u201cWe are their defense. Our job is to keep them safe \u2026 We are in a choir room, there are things to defend ourselves, a piano we can hide behind. We were all very prepared.\u201d Dooley said she drove over as soon as she heard the news to offer any support she could: \u201cI\u2019m sad I wasn\u2019t there to take care of my babies.\u201d She added that she wanted to see the government take action on background checks. Scott Wilk, a state senator who lives a mile away from the school, said he was still processing the news. His children previously attended Saugus high, and he learned this morning that a friend\u2019s daughter had been shot but was expected to survive. \u201cIt is just indescribable. This has got to stop,\u201d he said, noting that it felt as if the Thousand Oaks mass shooting, which killed 12 in the region last year, had been quickly forgotten: \u201cIt seemed like that was a one-day story, and it was gone. We have become so desensitized to this, like it\u2019s the new normal. It can\u2019t be the new normal.\u201d Wilk said he wanted to see stronger investments in mental health resources for youth: \u201cOur most precious resources are our children.\u201d He noted that when he recently visited a fourth-grade class, one of the students talked to him about wanting better security. Condolences poured in from across the country, with many Democratic lawmakers pointing to the tragedy to once again argue US lawmakers should pass stricter gun control legislation. The California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris said she was heartbroken and was praying for Santa Clarita. \u201cOur children and communities are being terrorized. We can\u2019t accept this,\u201d she said. \u201cAnother sad example of a school shooting &amp; why students across the country live in fear of gun violence,\u201d wrote the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, also a presidential hopeful. \u201cI\u2019m heartsick for the victims of this horrifying shooting and their families,\u201d said the Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. Back at the reunification center, Kris Hough, a field representative in Wilk\u2019s office who had showed up to help, said she wanted more than \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019 or any of that, because that\u2019s not what we need,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need this to stop. How many more of these do we have to see before it stops?\u201d Hough noted that it was such a small community that many law enforcement officials tasked with responding to the tragedy had loved ones at the school: \u201cWe all think every time one of these things happen that it\u2019s not going to happen in my safe little bubble here. It\u2019s scary to know it can happen to you just as easy as anyone else.\u201d She added, \u201cWe have all sat in front of our TVs watching in horror as these things happen. Now it\u2019s our turn.\u201d Agencies contributed reporting",

California and 22 other states will sue the Environmental Protection Agency over the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to block tougher tailpipe emissions standards. The execution of Rodney Reed has been stayed by court of appeals, just days before it was set to be carried out on 20 November. Twitter announced Friday its new ban on political advertising will also limit micro-targeting, further putting pressure on Facebook. Prison guards who were tasked with guarding Jeffrey Epstein on the night of his death have been offered a plea deal, the Associated Press reports, but have declined the offer. Donald Trump intervened in three military justice cases on Friday, issuing pardons in at least two of them. More \u201cdamning\u201d details emerged on Friday from the deposition of David Holmes, the Ukraine embassy staffer who reportedly overheard Trump asking Gordon Sondland about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine. Breaking news, Rudy Giuliani \u201cf---s everything up\u201d every time he gets involved, Sondland said, according to the Holmes deposition. Barack Obama and Georgia politician Stacey Abrams spoke to a group of Democratic Donors at the Democracy Alliance meeting on Friday. Obama sought to assuage fears that the Democratic primary field is too crowded, noting that he had a \u201cvery robust\u201d primary as well. \u201cWe have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service\u201d, he said. The former president also advised Democrats to stay \u201crooted in reality\u201d according to journalists tweeting from the event, noting that \u201cDemocrats are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain left leaning Twitter feeds, or the activist wing of our party\u201d. More details emerged on Friday from the deposition of David Holmes, the Ukraine embassy staffer who reportedly overheard Trump asking Gordon Sondland about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine. The transcripts, which are being called \u201cdamning\u201d, include Holmes saying he overheard Sondland tell Trump that Ukrainian president Zelensky will do \u201canything you ask him to\u201d. Also a quote that may have you questioning what stage of the simulation we are now in: Read a PDF of the full transcript here. Donald Trump intervened in three military justice cases on Friday, issuing pardons in at least two of them. Some Pentagon officials have expressed concerns that the president\u2019s actions will undermine the military justice system, according to the Washington Post. From the report: The service members involved were notified by Trump over the phone, said the U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, who faced a murder trial scheduled to begin next year, took the phone call and was informed he would receive a full pardon, said his lawyer, Phillip Stackhouse. In additon to Golsteyn, the other cases involve former Special Warfare Operator Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL convicted of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State militant and former Army 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, who was convicted of second-degree murder in 2013 for ordering his soldiers to open fire on three men in Afghanistan. Golsteyn had gone from being decorated with a Silver Star for his service in Afghanistan to facing years of investigation and a court-martial in the 2010 death of a suspected bomb maker in Afghanistan, according to the Washington Post. Prison guards who were tasked with guarding Jeffrey Epstein on the night of his death have been offered a plea deal, the Associated Press reports, but have declined the offer. The fact that the guards have been offered a plea deal signals the Justice Department is considering criminal charges in connection with the wealthy financier\u2019s death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York in August. The city\u2019s medical examiner ruled Epstein\u2019s death a suicide. From the AP: The guards on Epstein\u2019s unit are suspected of failing to check on him every half hour, as required, and of fabricating log entries to show they had. As part of the proposed plea deal, prosecutors wanted the guards to admit they falsified the prison records, according to the people familiar with the matter. Twitter announced Friday its new ban on political advertising will also limit micro-targeting, further putting pressure on Facebook. The new rules, which go into effect on 22 November, come after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said n 30 October the company would ban all political advertising due to a belief that \u201cpolitical message reach should be earned, not bought\u201d. Meanwhile, Facebook has faced significant criticism over its political ads policies in recent months, including an aggressive questioning of chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in Congress by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Read Julia Carrie Wong\u2019s full report here. The execution of Rodney Reed has been stayed by court of appeals, just days before it was set to be carried out on 20 November. The Texas man, who is African American, was convicted by an all-white jury in 1998 of the murder of 19-year-old Stacey Stites. He claims he was wrongly convicted and his family has spent years trying to get the case overturned. His execution is now stayed \u201cpending further order\u201d of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is the latest legislator to speak out against the epidemic of vaping among young people in the US. On Friday she tweeted she is urging the FDA to support stronger actions to prevent kids from getting addicted. \u201cThe dramatic increase in the use of e-cigarettes by our young people is threatening the progress we have made to reduce overall tobacco use\u201d, she said. \u201cTeachers have talked with me about the growing epidemic of vaping in high schools and middle schools in Maine\u201d. California and 22 other states will sue the Environmental Protection Agency over the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to block tougher tailpipe emissions standards, the Hill reports. In September, Trump announced he would revoke the waiver California has relied on to force automakers to produce more environmentally-friendly cars for decades. California attorney general Xavier Becerra said he and others would challenge the change, joining together in a lawsuit to argue argue that EPA lacks the authority to revoke the waiver, calling it \u201cunprecedented in the multi-decade history of waiver requests\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: California will not back down when it comes to protecting our people, our health, and our environment from preventable pollution\u201d, Becerra said. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s Clean Car Standards are achievable. They not only work, many other states around the country have chosen to adopt them. The Trump Administration, on the other hand, has chosen to side with polluters\u201d. Hello, Kari Paul on the West Coast taking over the blog for the next few hours. Stay tuned for more news. That\u2019s it from me after a very historic day (and week) in Washington. My west coast colleague Kari Paul will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, testified at the second public impeachment hearing. The longtime diplomat\u2019s account of being ousted from her post amid a smear campaign prompted a disparaging tweet from Trump, which Democrats said amounted to witness intimidation. (The president and his allies denied that charge.) Yovanovitch told the House intelligence committee that the smear campaign against her, as well as state department leaders\u2019 failure to defend her, has had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the diplomatic community. David Holmes, the Ukraine embassy staffer who reportedly overheard Trump asking Gordon Sondland about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine, arrived for his closed-door testimony in the impeachment inquiry. Federal prosecutors are reportedly investigating whether Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, sought to profit off his connections to Ukrainian energy projects. In non-impeachment news: Roger Stone, a former adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, was found guilty on all seven counts in his criminal trial. Kari will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Representative Mark Meadows, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, pushed back against Democratic accusations that the president engaged in witness intimidation by smearing the reputation of Maria Yovanovitch. The North Carolina Republican, who spoke to reporters after the hearing even though he is not a member of the House intelligence committee, called Trump\u2019s attack on the former US ambassador to Ukraine \u201ca characterization of her resume.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that Yovanovitch has been consistently praised by her fellow diplomats and has 33 years of experience in foreign service. Addressing reporters after the conclusion of the impeachment hearing with Maria Yovanovitch, Adam Schiff applauded the longtime diplomat as an \u201cincredible public servant.\u201d The committee chairman also argued Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony proved the former US ambassador to Ukraine was pushed out in part because of her efforts to root out Ukrainian corruption, despite claims from Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani. Asked about Trump\u2019s tweets smearing Yovanovitch\u2019s reputation, Schiff said they fit a \u201cpattern\u201d of the president attempting to obstruct investigations into his administration. \u201cThis is a part of a pattern to intimidate witnesses,\u201d Schiff told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s also a part of pattern of obstruction.\u201d Some people who watched Maria Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony from the public seating section of the hearing room actually stood to applaud the longtime diplomat as she exited. After more than six hours, the House intelligence committee\u2019s second public hearing in the impeachment inquiry has concluded. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, used his closing statement to mark the end of \u201ctoday\u2019s show trial.\u201d The California Republican added, \u201cThis is embarrassing.\u201d Chairman Adam Schiff applauded the career of today\u2019s witness, Maria Yovanovitch, in his closing statement. The California Democrat also argued that the ouster of Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, marked only the beginning of Trump allies\u2019 corrupt acts in Ukraine. Republicans on the committee attempted to object to Schiff\u2019s comments as he was gaveling the hearing to an end, but some of those gathered in the hearing room drowned out their complaints with apparent applause for Yovanovitch. Jeff Flake, a former Republican senator who chose not to seek reelection after repeated criticisms from Trump, just sent a tweet expressing gratitude for foreign service officers amid the president\u2019s attacks on Marie Yovanovitch. David Holmes, a staffer at the US embassy in Kyiv, has arrived on Capitol Hill to sit for a closed-door interview with the House intelligence committee after the conclusion of the impeachment hearing with Maria Yovanovitch. Holmes is reportedly one of the embassy staffers who overheard Trump asking about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine during a phone call with Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU. Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, testified on Wednesday that a staffer informed him of that call after the diplomat spoke to impeachment investigators behind closed doors. Speaking to reporters at the White House after delivering remarks on healthcare, Trump denied that his tweet smearing the reputation of Maria Yovanovitch amounted to witness intimidation. \u201cI don\u2019t think so at all,\u201d Trump said of the witness intimidation allegations. \u201cI have the right to speak; I have freedom of speech, just like other people do.\u201d He called the impeachment inquiry \u201ca disgrace\u201d and \u201can embarrassment to our nation.\u201d The president claimed Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, was more guilty of witness tampering. \u201cTampering is when a guy like shifty Schiff doesn\u2019t let us have lawyers,\u201d Trump said, referring to longstanding congressional procedure not to allow agency lawyers to be present for staffers\u2019 depositions. Representative Jim Jordan will be the last Republican to question Maria Yovanovitch, and then four more of the committee\u2019s Democratic members will be given the chance to speak. Chairman Adam Schiff and ranking member Devin Nunes will be allowed to deliver closing statements before the witness will be dismissed. The House intelligence committee managed to keep their five-minute recess in the impeachment hearing to about 10 minutes, so that\u2019s an improvement from Wednesday. Maria Yovanovitch and the committee members have returned, and Republican representative Jim Jordan, one of Trump\u2019s closest allies, has started his five minutes of questioning. Adam Schiff has called for a five-minute recess in the impeachment hearing, which will turn into a twenty-minute break if Wednesday\u2019s proceedings are any indication. Despite Trump\u2019s attack on Maria Yovanovitch, Republicans on the House intelligence committee have largely gone out of their way to applaud the decades of public service by the longtime diplomat. Trump is currently speaking about healthcare at the White House, but most television networks, including Fox News, are sticking with live coverage of the impeachment hearing. The president was also speaking at the White House as the @realdDonaldTrump Twitter account was simultaneously resharing messages from Republicans defending him against the impeachment inquiry. Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat of Illinois, mocked his Republican colleagues for suggesting Maria Yovanovitch\u2019s career had not suffered from her removal as US ambassador to Ukraine because she is now teaching at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Hallmark movie! You ended up at Georgetown!\u201d Quigley said sarcastically, prompting laughter. Yovanovitch told the committee that Georgetown is a \u201cwonderful place\u201d but acknowledged she would have preferred to spend more time in her role at the Ukrainian embassy. \u201cIt not the end of a Hallmark movie,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of a really bad reality-TV show ... brought to you by someone who knows a lot about that.\u201d Taking questions moment ago from Democratic representative Terri Sewell, Maria Yovanovitch said that the smear campaign against her seems to have had a \u201cchilling effect not only on the embassy in Kyiv but throughout the state department.\u201d The longtime diplomat also wondered why Trump or his allies would have felt it necessary to smear her name in recalling her. \u201cThere\u2019s a question as to why the kind of campaign to get me out of Ukraine happened because all the president has to do is say he wants a different ambassador.\u201d Yovanovitch added: \u201cIn my line of work ... all we have is our reputation, and so this has been a very painful period.\u201d Representative Mike Turner, a Republican of Ohio, attempted to cut off Maria Yovanovitch as the longtime diplomat was trying to answer his questions about the Trump administration\u2019s Ukraine policy. Yovanovitch was attempting to offer more context to her answer about Gordon Sondland\u2019s unusual portfolio as US ambassador to the EU, and chairman Adam Schiff was encouraging Turner to allow the former ambassador the opportunity to speak. Indicating his diminishing time, Turner pointed to Yovanovitch and said, \u201cNot on my time, you\u2019re done.\u201d The longtime diplomat raised her eyebrows in response. When given the chance to elaborate, Yovanovitch said, \u201cIt is unusual to name the US Ambassador to the EU to be responsible for all aspects of Ukraine.\u201d Asked by Democratic representative Terri Sewell whether she was a \u201cnever Trumper,\u201d Maria Yovanovitch said she was not and noted her decades of foreign service experience working for both Republican and Democratic presidents. The longtime diplomat added that she believed the smear campaign against her could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on morale at the state department. The White House has just issued a statement denying that Trump\u2019s tweet smearing the reputation of Maria Yovanovitch as she testified in the impeachment inquiry amounted to witness intimidation. \u201cThe tweet was not witness intimidation, it was simply the President\u2019s opinion, which he is entitled to,\u201d said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. She went on to slam the inquiry as a whole: \u201cThere is less due process in this hearing than any such event in the history of our country. It\u2019s a true disgrace.\u201d The hearing has moved on to rounds of five-minute questioning from each member of the House intelligence committee, and Devin Nunes yielded to Elise Stefanik (which is allowed during this portion of the hearing). Stefanik, the only Republican woman on the House intelligence committee, used her time to resuscitate corruption allegations against the Bidens, which have been thoroughly debunked. Maria Yovanovitch just delivered a memorable quote in response to Republican counsel Steve Castor\u2019s line of questioning that will likely be replayed many times on cable news. Castro was dubiously trying to argue that a senior Ukrainian official\u2019s Twitter criticisms of Trump indicated that the country was \u201cout to get him.\u201d \u201cSometimes that happens on social media,\u201d Yovanovitch replied, prompting laughter from those gathered in the hearing room. Steny Hoyer, the Democratic House majority leader, called on \u201cevery member of Congress\u201d to criticize Trump for his \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d after the president smeared the reputation of Maria Yovanovitch as the longtime diplomat testified in the impeachment hearing. As Maria Yovanovitch continues her testimony at the public impeachment hearing, a report has emerged that federal prosecutors are probing Rudy Giulaini\u2019s ties to Ukrainian energy projects. The Wall Street Journal reports: Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating whether Rudy Giuliani stood to personally profit from a Ukrainian natural-gas business pushed by two associates who also aided his efforts there to launch investigations that could benefit President Trump, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, pitched their new company, and plans for a Poland-to-Ukraine pipeline carrying U.S. natural gas, in meetings with Ukrainian officials and energy executives this year, saying the project had the support of the Trump administration, according to people briefed on the meetings. In many of the same meetings, the two men also pushed for assistance on investigations into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and alleged interference by Ukraine in the 2016 U.S. election, some of the people said. If prosecutors find that Giuliani did attempt to personally profit off Ukrainian energy interests, it would be particularly ironic given that the president\u2019s personal lawyer has trumpeted claims that Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement with an energy company was indicative of corruption. A staffer in House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office shared a tweet outlining the procedures approved by the House for public impeachment hearings, noting that every Republican on the intelligence committee received it. The staffer called Devin Nunes\u2019 illegitimate attempt to yield time to another Republican committee member a \u201cpure, disingenuous stunt.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s tweet disparaging Maria Yovanovitch as the longtime diplomat testified at the impeachment hearing, Nancy Pelosi said she had not yet seen the tweet but noted that \u201cwitness intimidation is a crime.\u201d The House speaker also mocked the president when asked if the tweet was appropriate. \u201cAppropriate and president in the same sentence? Come on. Why would we start making that judgment now?\u201d Pelosi said. Republicans on the intelligence committee began their questioning of Maria Yovanovitch by attempting to violate the House resolution outlining procedures in the impeachment inquiry. According to the resolution, only the ranking member or the minority counsel may speak for the initial 45 minutes of Republican questioning. The ranking member, Devin Nunes, instead tried to yield to representative Elise Stefanik, the only Republican woman on the panel -- marking a clear violation of the resolution. The second public impeachment hearing, featuring testimony from former US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch, has now resumed. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, and the GOP counsel will now be allowed to pose questions to the longtime diplomat. But the hour-long recess to allow committee members to vote may be beneficial to Democrats\u2019 arguments in the impeachment inquiry. Trump has reacted to the conviction of his former associate Roger Stone, blaming the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on a \u201cdouble standard.\u201d The president argued some of his political enemies, including Hillary Clinton and special counsel Robert Mueller, were much more worthy of jail time than Stone. Now that Roger Stone\u2019s trial has concluded, sections of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report related to the former Trump associate\u2019s actions during the 2016 campaign may be unredacted. Roger Stone, who previously served as an adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, was facing seven charges and was found guilty on all of them. The AP has more: Stone was convicted Friday. He was charged in a seven-count indictment that alleged he lied to lawmakers about WikiLeaks, tampered with witnesses and obstructed a House intelligence committee probe. His trial highlighted how Trump campaign associates were eager to gather information about emails hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton that were released by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Prosecutors say Stone lied to Congress about his conversations about WikiLeaks with New York radio host Randy Credico and conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi. He\u2019s also accused of trying to intimidate Credico and threatening to take his dog. Former Trump associate Roger Stone has been found guilty on all counts, including lying to the same House committee currently holding impeachment hearings. Stone becomes the latest member of the president\u2019s circle to be convicted -- joining the likes of Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen and Michael Flynn. Representative Justin Amash, a former Republican who left the party due to his criticisms of Trump, predicted that witness tampering would be included in the articles of impeachment after the president sent a disparaging tweet about Maria Yovanovitch as she testified. House Republicans criticized Democrats\u2019 questioning of Maria Yovanovitch, with one congressman claiming Adam Schiff and the Democratic counsel were trying to make the longtime diplomat \u201ccry for the cameras\u201d about her removal as US ambassador to Ukraine. Another of Trump\u2019s congressional allies dismissed allegations that the president engaged in witness intimidation as a \u201cDemocrat narrative\u201d and said he respected Yovanovitch in her \u201cprevious position and certainly in her nice job at Georgetown right now.\u201d Yovanovitch is currently teaching at Georgetown University after Trump recalled the diplomat from Kyiv early, a decision that she testified had \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cdevastated\u201d her. Despite the White House\u2019s claim that the president would not be tuning in, Trump has just sent another tweet reacting to today\u2019s impeachment hearing, defending the many vacancies at the state department. In her opening statement, Maria Yovanovitch warned that the state department\u2019s many vacancies were jeopardizing America\u2019s reputation on the world stage. \u201cMoreover, the attacks are leading to a crisis in the State Department as the policy process is visibly unravelling, leadership vacancies go unfilled, and senior and midlevel officers ponder an uncertain future and head for the doors,\u201d the longtime diplomat said. \u201cThe crisis has moved from the impact on individuals to an impact on the institution. The State Department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage. This is not a time to undercut our diplomats.\u201d Representative Eric Swalwell, one of the Democratic members of the House intelligence committee, said that Trump\u2019s attack on Maria Yovanovitch \u201cwill be considered\u201d for one of the articles of impeachment. One of Swalwell\u2019s fellow Democrats on the panel, Andre Carson, similarly said the committee would \u201clook into\u201d whether Trump engaged in witness intimidation. Asked about Trump\u2019s tweet smearing the reputation of Maria Yovanovitch, Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, said, \u201cI don\u2019t comment on committee business.\u201d This is the same Devin Nunes that was forced to recuse himself from the panel\u2019s Russia investigation in 2017 after he told reporters that Trump transition officials had been caught up in American spy agencies\u2019 surveillance of foreign officials. That announcement prompted an ethics investigation over concerns that Nunes \u201cmay have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information.\u201d He was later cleared of wrongdoing. Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican member of the House intelligence committee who has criticized Adam Schiff\u2019s handling of the impeachment hearings, voiced disapproval of Trump\u2019s tweet smearing Maria Yovanovitch\u2019s reputation as the longtime diplomat testified. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris weighed in on Trump\u2019s tweet smearing Maria Yovanovitch\u2019s reputation as the longtime diplomat testified, accusing the president of witness intimidation. Fox News anchors described the testimony of Maria Yovanovitch as a \u201cturning point\u201d in the impeachment inquiry against Trump. Anchor Bret Baier predicted that Trump\u2019s tweet smearing Yovanovitch\u2019s reputation as the longtime diplomat testified would lead to a new article of impeachment against the president. Host Chris Wallace insisted it was impossible for any viewer of the hearing not to be affected by Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony. Chairman Adam Schiff called for a brief recess in the impeachment hearing to allow House intelligence committee members to cast votes. Republicans present in the hearing room to hear the testimony of Maria Yovanovitch seemed to imply they thought the recess was a strategic move on Schiff\u2019s part to pause before the GOP members of the committee can question the longtime diplomat. That must be a first. Maria Yovanovitch is testifying about Trump and, with a quiet day on his schedule, the president seems to be listening. He responded with a tweet that began: \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad.\u201d Blaming her for the conflict in Somalia appears a stretch, even for him. Chairman Adam Schiff interrupted the hearing to point out the tweet. \u201cAs we sit here, the president is attacking you on Twitter,\u201d he said, asking the former ambassador to respond. Looking bemused, Yovanovitch said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have such powers\u201d, adding that she and her colleagues made things better, not worse. Schiff rejoined: \u201cThe president is attacking you in real time... Some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d Such a moment was probably inevitable in the reality TV-Twitter presidency. After reading Trump\u2019s tweet attacking the reputation of Maria Yovanovitch, Adam Schiff asked the longtime diplomat whether she thought the tweet was meant to intimidate her as she testified at the impeachment hearing. Yovanovitch responded, \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.\u201d Schiff ominously replied, \u201cI want to let you know, ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, has just read Trump\u2019s tweet disparaging Maria Yovanovitch as the longtime diplomat testifies in the impeachment hearing. Reacting to Trump\u2019s claim that \u201ceverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d Yovanovitch joked, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have such powers.\u201d Yovanovitch went on to assert that, through their work, she and her fellow diplomats had \u201cdemonstrably made things better, both for the US and for the countries I\u2019ve served in.\u201d Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch delivered a stinging rebuke to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. She described a \u201ccrisis\u201d in the state department \u201cas the policy process is visibly unravelling, leadership vacancies go unfilled, and senior and midlevel officers ponder an uncertain future and head for the doors\u201d. Yovanovitch added: \u201cThe state department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage. This is not a time to undercut our diplomats.\u201d Such sentiments have been aired frequently during the tenures of both Rex Tillerson and Pompeo, but never on such a prominent stage for all the world to hear. It looks like the Democrats on the House intelligence committee intend to incorporate Trump\u2019s disparaging tweet about Maria Yovanovitch into today\u2019s impeachment hearing. Ironically, Trump\u2019s tweet came shortly after the White House issued a statement claiming the president would not watch the hearing beyond the opening statement of Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the intelligence committee. Maria Yovanovitch said she was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cdevastated\u201d when she read the White House memo on Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, in which he called the longtime diplomat \u201cbad news.\u201d \u201cA person who saw me actually reading the transcript said the color drained from my face,\u201d Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators. Asked about Trump\u2019s comment to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Yovanovitch was \u201cgoing to go through some things,\u201d Yovanovitch said it \u201cfelt like a vague threat.\u201d Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, 35, is becoming a \u201cbreak-out star\u201d of the impeachment inquiry hearings, at least in rightwing media circles. After Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Matthew Dowd, chief political analyst for ABC News, tweeted: \u201cElise Stefanik is a perfect example why just electing someone because they are a woman or a millennial doesn\u2019t necessarily get you the leaders we need.\u201d He apologised following an online backlash. The fracas was gleefully highlighted by Fox News, where Stefanik appeared as an interviewee. Early today, along with colleague Jim Jordan, she tried to interrupt chairman Adam Schiff but was swatted away. She tweeted in response: \u201cAdam Schiff #RegimeofSecrecy continues. He is making up the rules as he goes along and not only interrupts and limits Republican questions. But also our important parliamentary questions.\u201d We can expect to hear more from her. Trump has sent off a two-part tweet questioning the professional reputation of Maria Yovanovitch as the former US ambassador to Ukraine publicly testifies in the impeachment inquiry. Yovanovitch, a longtime diplomat, has served in several \u201chardship posts,\u201d including Somalia as the country was suffering a civil war. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cShe started off in Somalia, how did that go?\u201d In reality, Yovanovitch has been widely lauded by her fellow diplomats as a model civil servant, and even deputy secretary of state John Sullivan told her she had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d when he dismissed her from Kyiv. In her opening statement, Maria Yovanovitch also criticized the current leadership of the state department for not defending its staffers amid attacks. \u201cAt the closed deposition, I expressed grave concerns about the degradation of the Foreign Service over the past few years and the failure of State Department leadership to push back as foreign and corrupt interests apparently hijacked our Ukraine policy,\u201d Yovanovitch said. \u201cThe State Department is being hollowed out from within at a competitive and complex time on the world stage. This is not a time to undercut our diplomats. It is the responsibility of the Department\u2019s leaders to stand up for the institution and the individuals who make that institution the most effective diplomatic force in the world.\u201d Yovanovitch did not mention Mike Pompeo by name, but the longtime diplomat\u2019s testimony was clearly aimed at the secretary of state and will likely spark more questions about his leadership at the department. Maria Yovanovitch closed her opening statement by offering a robust defense of foreign service officers and their commitment to the United States. \u201cWe are professionals, public servants who by vocation and training pursue the policies of the President, regardless of who holds that office or what party they affiliate with,\u201d Yovanovitch said. \u201cWe handle American Citizen Services, facilitate trade and commerce, work security issues, represent the U.S., and report to and advise Washington, to mention just a few of our functions. And we make a difference every day.\u201d In her opening statement, Maria Yovanovitch criticized the Americans willing to partner with corrupt Ukrainians to orchestrate her ouster, in an apparent reference to Rudy Giuliani. \u201cHow could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?\u201d Yovanovitch asked. \u201cSuch conduct undermines the U.S., exposes our friends, and widens the playing field for autocrats like President Putin.\u201d The former US ambassador to Ukraine also denied that she had circulated a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list in connection to Ukrainian corruption or that she instructed staffers to ignore Trump\u2019s wishes, as some far-right websites alleged. Yovanovitch went on to specifically address Giuliani\u2019s efforts to have her removed. \u201cI do not understand Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me, nor can I offer an opinion on whether he believed the allegations he spread about me,\u201d Yovanovitch said. \u201cWhat I can say is that Mr. Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, has been sworn in and is now delivering her opening statement to the House intelligence committee. Yovanovitch opened her statement by recounting her family\u2019s history of fleeing the Soviet Union and her own career serving in several \u201chardship\u201d posts as a diplomat. The White House said in a statement that Trump was only briefly watching today\u2019s public impeachment hearing and would then return to work. \u201cThe President will be watching Congressman Nunes\u2019 opening statement, but the rest of the day he will be working hard for the American people,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, Trump\u2019s press secretary. However, the White House made a similar statement on Wednesday before Trump went on to repeatedly retweet messages from Republicans about the hearing. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, used his opening statement to criticize the impeachment inquiry and accuse his Democratic colleagues of scheming to remove Trump from office. The California Republican said Democrats were engaging in \u201cday-long TV spectacles\u201d to \u201cfulfill their Watergate fantasies,\u201d even though many members of the House Democratic caucus only came around to supporting an impeachment inquiry after the September revelation of the whistleblower complaint on the Ukraine call. Nunes also read the full transcript of Trump\u2019s first call with the Ukrainian president, which was released just as the hearing began. Nunes\u2019 reading of the transcript minutes late indicates that the document\u2019s release may have been coordinated with Republicans on the House intelligence committee. Echoing Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi applauded the long diplomatic career of Maria Yovanovitch moments before the former US ambassador to Ukraine was set to start testifying in the second public impeachment hearing. Trump was also tweeting minutes before the hearing began, accusing Pelosi of ignoring other priorities as the impeachment inquiry advances. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, is using his opening statement to applaud Maria Yovanovitch\u2019s efforts to crack down on Ukrainian corruption. \u201cIn her time in Kyiv, Ambassador Yovanovitch was tough on corruption, too tough on corruption for some, and her principled stance made her enemies,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAs George Kent told this committee on Wednesday, \u2018you can\u2019t promote principled anti-corruption action without pissing-off corrupt people.\u2019\u201d However, Schiff noted that Yovanovitch\u2019s anti-corruption efforts also angered some of Trump\u2019s allies, including Rudy Giuliani, as they sought investigations into the Democrats. \u201cGetting rid of Ambassador Yovanovitch helped set stage for an irregular channel that could pursue the two investigations that mattered so much to the President, the 2016 conspiracy theory, and most important, an investigation into the 2020 political opponent he apparently feared most, Joe Biden,\u201d Schiff said. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, has gaveled in the second public hearing of the impeachment inquiry against Trump. Schiff and the top Republican on the panel, Devin Nunes, will be allowed to make opening statements before turning things over to today\u2019s witness, Maria Yovanovitch. The former US ambassador to Ukraine will also be given the chance to make an opening statement before taking questions from committee lawyers and members. Moments before the second public impeachment hearing was set to begin, the White House released a transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. According to the transcript, the call was rather unremarkable, with Trump simply offering his congratulations to the newly elected president and promising to send a US representative to his inauguration. About 10 minutes before the next impeachment hearing was set to begin, Trump sent a tweet slamming the inquiry and calling Nancy Pelosi\u2019s San Francisco district a \u201cdisgusting Slum.\u201d It has been a frequent Republican talking point that the impeachment inquiry has prevented Democrats from getting other legislative work done. However, Pelosi said yesterday that believed a deal on the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was \u201cimminent.\u201d Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify in today\u2019s public impeachment hearing. Yovanovitch first testified in the impeachment inquiry on Oct. 11 behind closed doors. According to her opening statement, the diplomat told impeachment investigators that she was removed from her post in Kyiv because of \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d The line to get into the House hearing room where Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, will soon testify already stretches down the hallway. Republicans on the House intelligence committee have set up their exhibits for today\u2019s impeachment hearing, and they have added a new sign since Wednesday. It features a quote from Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister claiming he never saw a link between US military aid and investigations into the Democrats. After the first public impeachment hearing, some commentators complained that Bill Taylor and George Kent\u2019s appearance featured few explosive moments, even though Taylor testified about a previously unknown call in which Trump asked about \u201cthe investigations\u201d in Ukraine. However, it appears that past impeachment hearings have been similarly subdued. The front page of the Washington Post after the first Watergate hearings in 1973 described the event as \u201cnot exactly high drama.\u201d As Capitol Hill prepares for the second public impeachment hearing, the ratings have come in for the first hearing, and they are ... lackluster. Axios reports: Day One\u2019s 13 million live TV viewers fell well shy of James Comey\u2019s testimony in June 2017 (19.5m); the Christine Blasey Ford/Brett Kavanaugh hearing from September 2018 (20m); and the Michael Cohen hearing in February (16m). However, as Axios notes, this dip in viewership may be because the impeachment hearings are expected to play out over several days, so Americans might be waiting to tune in. Good morning, live blog readers! And welcome to Day Two. The second public hearing in the House impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump begins at 9am ET with the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch is a career diplomat who was recalled from her post in May, even though she was widely respected by her fellow state department employees. (For more on Yovanovitch\u2019s long government career, read Julian Borger\u2019s excellent profile of her from last month.) Yovanovitch testified to impeachment investigators last month that when she was recalled in May, even deputy secretary of state John Sullivan told her she had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d. The diplomat, as well as some her colleagues, contend she was the victim of a smear campaign by Rudy Giuliani. The president\u2019s personal lawyer was reportedly dissatisfied that Yovanovitch was becoming a barrier in his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, Joe Biden. In the White House memo on Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, the commander-in-chief is quoted as calling Yovanovitch \u201cbad news\u201d and predicting she was \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d. Today, the longtime civil servant will have a chance to share her side of the story with the public.",

      "bodyText": "Forty-degree heat and catastrophic conditions in Western Australia and lightning strikes in Queensland could intensify fires over the weekend as Australia enters its second week of sustained bushfires. On Saturday, conditions in New South Wales had eased slightly but firefighters said the more than 100,000 hectare Gospers Mountain blaze in the Hawkesbury was unlikely to be contained before weather conditions worsen. Firefighters had backburned through Friday night to try and get a handle on the huge fire near Sydney\u2019s northwestern outskirts. NSW Rural Fire Service inspector Ben Shepherd said the fire, which has been downgraded to a \u201cwatch and act\u201d alert, \u201chas now burnt out more than 100,000 hectares and it has destroyed six homes\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had reports that one further home may have been lost yesterday.\u201d The bushfire crisis is now set to intensify on both Australian coasts, with forecasters warning \u201cthere is not much end in sight\u201d to a horrific fire season that has not even hit summer. Catastrophic conditions are forecast on Sunday in four regions of WA: east Pilbara coast, west Pilbara coast, east Pilbara inland and Ashburton Inland. The catastrophic rating was introduced in 2009 and is the equivalent of the conditions for Victoria\u2019s Black Saturday bushfires. On Tuesday last week, Sydney experienced catastrophic conditions for the first time. In Queensland on Saturday, the Pechey/Ravensbourne fire in the Darling Downs region flared to an emergency level, driven by hot and dry wind gusts. The fast-moving fire reached Ravensbourne by 2.30pm AEST, and burned over a large area between Purtill Road and north of Mount Jockey Road. People were being told to immediately flee that blaze from Saturday morning onwards. Fire crews, assisted by heavy machinery, are also beefing up containment lines elsewhere in the state. People are being told to be prepared to leave from the paths of other major fires at Barney View and Palen Creek, where a bushfire with multiple fronts is burning in an inaccessible area of Mount Barney National Park near the Queensland and NSW border. An unpredictable fire is burning at Tarome, in the Scenic Rim region, moving from the Cunningham Highway towards Ryan Road, Hinrichsen Road, Simmonds Road and Tarome Road. That blaze is likely to impact Ryan Road, Hinrichsen Road and Simmonds Road, in the vicinity of the Bluff. Further north, fire crews will continue to work on containment lines at the Kinkuna Waters and Woodgate/Walkers Point Road fire south of Bundaberg, with the help of waterbombing aircraft and heavy machinery. People are being told to be ready to leave that area because the fire could get worse quickly. Conditions are expected to worsen on Sunday, when the Darling Downs and Granite Belt region will rise to an extreme fire danger. Severe isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop, which, instead of bringing respite, could create dry lightning strikes that start more fires. \u201cWith those winds, particularly as they increase on Sunday, we are likely to see an increase in the fire dangers,\u201d said the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Jess Gardner. Bushfires have destroyed 16 homes in Queensland over the past week. In WA, a cauldron of hot air developed on Saturday and is expected to sit over the state for days. On Saturday, Marble Bar was expected to reach 45C, Port Hedland 43C, Meekatharra 42C, Kalgoorlie 41C, Perth 38C and Broome 36C. On Sunday, conditions will worsen for many regions, with Kalgoorlie forecast to rise to 44C \u2013 which would break the city hottest temperature record, set in 1923. Marble Bar is forecast to rise to 46C, Port Hedland and Meekatharra steady at 43C and 42C, Broome will rise to 38C and Perth will drop to 29C. The hot air will then sweep through the rest of the country, worsening fire conditions in NSW and Queensland by mid-week. \u201cUnfortunately, we are in for the long haul and there is not much end in sight,\u201d Gardner told AAP. In WA, extreme fire danger was forecast on Saturday for the east Pilbara inland, Gascoyne inland and south interior. In Queensland, severe fire danger was forecast on Saturday for the Darling Downs and Granite Belt, rising to extreme on Sunday. And in NSW, Tuesday and Wednesday will be fire weather days, with \u201cthe weather conditions again deteriorating\u201d, according to the bureau. A man suspected of starting a blaze which reached emergency level, at Guyra Road in Ebor, east of Armidale, was arrested on Friday.",

Excited to see the son who had just helped Palace finish third in the old First Division and reached the FA Cup final the previous season, Edwin Bright, who moved to Britain in the 1950s, had ignored Marie for the best part of 15 minutes before asking: \u201cMark, who is this beautiful girl you have with you? Is she your wife?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou might not believe this, Eddie,\u201d came the response. \u201cI\u2019m your oldest daughter, Marie.\u201d</p> <p>Bright, almost 30 years on, says: \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and tell you I was devastated. I was just disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>That was the last time he saw his father before Edwin\u2019s death in 1997, although by then Bright had made his peace. The previous year he visited his father\u2019s homeland to track down some of the family he never got the chance to meet and stayed with his uncle. He was taken to Kunta Kinteh Island \u2013 previously known as James Island \u2013 the last piece of African soil seen by thousands of slaves it is estimated were transported to the Americas between 1500 and 1800.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eb91f30b3ba21575c4ee2af755283fb2c37d9ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eb91f30b3ba21575c4ee2af755283fb2c37d9ec/0_97_1904_1142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Bright with Ian Wright after the 1990 FA Cup final between Crystal Palace and Manchester United ended 3-3 after extra time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Bright with Ian Wright after the 1990 FA Cup final between Crystal Palace and Manchester United ended 3-3 after extra time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe guy who took me round explained the triangular slave trade to me: taking people from west Africa to America before dropping them off and then picking up goods before heading to England and then back to Africa,\u201d Bright says. \u201cI found out that my family were originally from Sierra Leone but they had moved to the Gambia for safety reasons. It turns out my auntie married into the oldest slave trade family in the country, so I went to visit where she used to live.\u201d</p> <p>Bright, who had successful spells at Sheffield Wednesday and Charlton, had the idea of writing a book during his final season as a player and put down 15,000 words before linking up with a ghost writer, Kevin Brennan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cyrille Regis, Ugo Ehiogu, Jlloyd Samuel, Dalian Atkinson: they all died too early.

This was my chance to tell my story how I wanted it to be told.\u201d</p> <p>Bright hopes it can provide inspiration for anyone growing up in similar circumstances to those he experienced. \u201cYou have to be lucky because a lot of bad things happen to people in care.

It\u2019s not meant to be a slur on Spurs or anything like that but we were there on the opening of that stadium and of about 70 people, there was the mayor [Sadiq Khan], me and another Asian guy and that was it. But I remember looking around our boardroom a few weeks later and I was the only black person.\u201d</p> <p>Although Bright\u2019s book is full of racist incidents he suffered, he says there were several he did not include to protect the perpetrators. Similarly, when a Twitter user sent him an abusive message during the early days of the social media site, he contacted the person before being bombarded with apologies when he asked what he should do with the evidence saved on his computer. \u201cIt was staggering really,\u201d Bright says. \u201cIf I\u2019d been a vindicative person I could have ruined his life.\u201d</p> <p>After a number of high-profile incidents culminated in Raheem Sterling\u2019s accusation that some sections of the media were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/09/raheem-sterling-newspapers-fuelling-racism-alleged-abuse-chelsea\" title=\"\">fuelling racism\u201d</a>, Bright rewrote a section of his book which claimed today\u2019s players do not have to deal with the vitriol aimed at his generation.</p> <p>\u201cThey came back to say: \u2018Can Mark have another look at this because it looks a little bit outdated.\u2019 In football, we had come a long way but I feel like we have now gone backwards.

People like Garth Crooks did it in his day and people like Ian, Les Ferdinand and myself did it for the next generation. You all had to do our bit to try to stop racism. It\u2019s a long process of education. In my day we used to get it all the time but the thought of complaining never crossed your mind. If I had come out after a match and said to the papers: \u2018I thought it was disgraceful what happened to me, they were monkey chanting at me,\u2019 some people would have seen it and said: \u2018Look, we play Palace next week, let\u2019s fucking give it to him. Look at how soft he is.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Bright feels any hopes of progress must come from the top. \u201cWhen a club or country persistently abuse black players, take them out of the Euros or the World Cup and stop sending them the funding: then they would do something about it.\u201d</p> <p><em>My Story: From Foster Care to Footballer by Mark Bright, is published by Constable </em><em>in hardback, \u00a320.</em></p>",

Like so many of the stories in his book, Bright\u2019s account of meeting his father for the first time in more than 20 years is told with brutal honesty. He was at his peak at Palace when he and his younger sister Marie decided to visit their father in Lancashire during the summer of 1991. \u201cOn our way up there my sister said: \u2018I\u2019m not sure about this \u2013 just going to knock on his door,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I said: \u2018We\u2019ve come so far \u2013 I want to see what he looks like \u2026\u2019\u201d Less than an hour later, Bright and his sister were heading back in silence. Excited to see the son who had just helped Palace finish third in the old First Division and reached the FA Cup final the previous season, Edwin Bright, who moved to Britain in the 1950s, had ignored Marie for the best part of 15 minutes before asking: \u201cMark, who is this beautiful girl you have with you? Is she your wife?\u201d \u201cYou might not believe this, Eddie,\u201d came the response. \u201cI\u2019m your oldest daughter, Marie.\u201d Bright, almost 30 years on, says: \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and tell you I was devastated. I was just disappointed.\u201d That was the last time he saw his father before Edwin\u2019s death in 1997, although by then Bright had made his peace. The previous year he visited his father\u2019s homeland to track down some of the family he never got the chance to meet and stayed with his uncle. He was taken to Kunta Kinteh Island \u2013 previously known as James Island \u2013 the last piece of African soil seen by thousands of slaves it is estimated were transported to the Americas between 1500 and 1800. \u201cThe guy who took me round explained the triangular slave trade to me: taking people from west Africa to America before dropping them off and then picking up goods before heading to England and then back to Africa,\u201d Bright says. \u201cI found out that my family were originally from Sierra Leone but they had moved to the Gambia for safety reasons. It turns out my auntie married into the oldest slave trade family in the country, so I went to visit where she used to live.\u201d Bright, who had successful spells at Sheffield Wednesday and Charlton, had the idea of writing a book during his final season as a player and put down 15,000 words before linking up with a ghost writer, Kevin Brennan. \u201cI\u2019ve got a 19-year-old son and I wanted him to know about his dad\u2019s journey. You can\u2019t force someone to listen to you, can you? So I thought I\u2019d do a book for him but it\u2019s also to have something that lasts forever. Cyrille Regis, Ugo Ehiogu, Jlloyd Samuel, Dalian Atkinson, Ray Wilkins: they\u2019re all ex-players who died too early. This was my chance to tell my story how I wanted it to be told.\u201d Bright hopes it can provide inspiration for anyone growing up in similar circumstances to those he experienced. \u201cYou have to be lucky because a lot of bad things happen to people in care. We feel lucky, my brother and me. If you\u2019re sitting in care now and you are wondering what the future holds \u2026 the book says to you: \u2018You can achieve, make the unbelievable believable.\u2019\u201d Bright is reluctant to see himself as a pioneer, despite his starring role alongside Wright in Palace\u2019s multicultural side under Steve Coppell. \u201cI didn\u2019t start off thinking: \u2018I want to represent a load of people.\u2019 I started off saying: \u2018I want to play football.\u2019 That was it. But you play a part. All you can do is try to inspire other people, whether that\u2019s a black kid or a white kid.\u201d His close friendship with the Palace owner, Steve Parish, and role as the club\u2019s director of under-23 development have given Bright unparalleled insight into what it takes to run a Premier League club, and he acknowledges there is plenty of need for progress. \u201cI go into boardrooms with Steve and hardly ever see anyone black. It\u2019s not meant to be a slur on Spurs or anything like that but we were there on the opening of that stadium and of about 70 people, there was the mayor [Sadiq Khan], me and another Asian guy and that was it. But I remember looking around our boardroom a few weeks later and I was the only black person.\u201d Although Bright\u2019s book is full of racist incidents he suffered, he says there were several he did not include to protect the perpetrators. Similarly, when a Twitter user sent him an abusive message during the early days of the social media site, he contacted the person before being bombarded with apologies when he asked what he should do with the evidence saved on his computer. \u201cIt was staggering really,\u201d Bright says. \u201cIf I\u2019d been a vindicative person I could have ruined his life.\u201d After a number of high-profile incidents culminated in Raheem Sterling\u2019s accusation that some sections of the media were \u201cfuelling racism\u201d, Bright rewrote a section of his book which claimed today\u2019s players do not have to deal with the vitriol aimed at his generation. \u201cThey came back to say: \u2018Can Mark have another look at this because it looks a little bit outdated.\u2019 In football, we had come a long way but I feel like we have now gone backwards. The game getting called off in the FA Cup at Haringey \u2013 a few days before that we were all commenting about Bulgaria saying how disgusting it was. We\u2019ve still got a problem in this country. \u201cRaheem Sterling is the modern\u2011day gamechanger. He got the baton. People like Garth Crooks did it in his day and people like Ian, Les Ferdinand and myself did it for the next generation. You all had to do our bit to try to stop racism. It\u2019s a long process of education. In my day we used to get it all the time but the thought of complaining never crossed your mind. If I had come out after a match and said to the papers: \u2018I thought it was disgraceful what happened to me, they were monkey chanting at me,\u2019 some people would have seen it and said: \u2018Look, we play Palace next week, let\u2019s fucking give it to him. Look at how soft he is.\u2019\u201d Bright feels any hopes of progress must come from the top. \u201cWhen a club or country persistently abuse black players, take them out of the Euros or the World Cup and stop sending them the funding: then they would do something about it.\u201d My Story: From Foster Care to Footballer by Mark Bright, is published by Constable in hardback, \u00a320.",
