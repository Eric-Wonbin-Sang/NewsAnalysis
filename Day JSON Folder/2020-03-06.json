      "bodyText": "Gregor Townsend was Fabien Galthi\u00e9\u2019s half-back partner when the France head coach signed off his playing career in 2004 with a farewell outing for the French Barbarians. The former Scotland fly-half had returned to France towards the end of his career for a season with Montpellier, his third stint in the Top 14 after spells with Brive and Castres. \u201cWe were playing against Australia and it wasn\u2019t the most professional of buildups,\u201d he said as he recalled their unlikely take on the Auld Alliance. On Sunday they will be reacquainted for the first time as coaches of their respective countries, with Scotland the latest hurdle for Les Bleus in their quest for a first Six Nations title \u2013 and possible grand slam \u2013 in 10 years. \u201cFabian is a lovely guy off the field but on it was he was always a real competitor and I am sure he coaches that way too,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cHe has obviously made a big impact on this French team.\u201d As a keen observer of French rugby, the Scotland head coach can sense revolution in the air, with former captain and scrum-half Galthi\u00e9 successfully bedding in young players who won back-to-back titles together in the Under-20 World Championship. It is not just a change of personnel, though. \u201cThere is probably a revolution in terms of their game philosophy,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThey have built that on their defence and they are kicking the ball more than they have before, the most of any team in the championship. It is very different to what we are used to from a French team.\u201d Like everyone else, Townsend cannot help but be impressed by the half-back pairing of Antoine Dupont and Romaine Ntamack, the poster boys of this nouveau France who have taken their club partnership with Toulouse into the Test arena. \u201cDupont is world-class, arguably the best nine in the world,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can see the influence he has in attack and defence; he is exceptional. We are very aware we can\u2019t let him have any half yard of space around the ruck. \u201cNtamack is a fantastic rugby player who played really well against us last year and has a very good understanding with his club-mate. They are an excellent team, there\u2019s no two ways about it, with very good individuals.\u201d Damian Penaud takes over from Teddy Thomas on the right wing at Murrayfield, having recovered from a thigh injury which kept him out of France\u2019s first three Tests. There is one further change up front, with Jefferson Poirot replacing the injured Cyril Baille at loosehead. Townsend has shaken up his own side with a change in each row of the pack. Fraser Brown, who started the first two games of the Championship, returns at hooker for Stuart McInally and will lead the side out on the occasion of his 50th cap. The \u201cconsistency and experience\u201d of Grant Gilchrist is preferred at lock over his Edinburgh teammate Ben Toolis, who drops out of the 23 with the fit-again Exeter lock Sam Skinner returning on the bench. Nick Haining, who was sent back to Edinburgh after a promising debut against Ireland in Dublin last month, takes over at No 8 from Magnus Bradbury, who also drops to the bench. \u201cNick\u2019s work-rate has gone up in attack and defence, and the more he plays, the better he looks,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cFrance have kicked a lot in the first two games so you have a picture of how you expect them to play, and Nick started off as a back-line player so is very comfortable in the back-field.

Weir\u2019s return means the South Africa-born Glasgow wing Kyle Steyn \u2013 who can also cover centre \u2013 could make his Test debut off the bench. While Townsend acknowledged that France are probably ahead of schedule under Galthi\u00e9 as they build towards a home World Cup in 2023, only one of the current squad \u2013 Ga\u00ebl Fickou in 2014 \u2013 has tasted victory at Murrayfield. Scotland have prevailed in their past three Edinburgh encounters, including a World Cup warm-up last summer, and there is a quiet confidence that the grand slam chasers will not have it all their own way on Sunday. \u201cWe know how good we will have to play to beat this French team but we have prepared very well and we are up for the challenge,\u201d Townsend added. \u201cWe have got to be patient and accurate for the whole 80 minutes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has said Eric Dier will start at Burnley on Saturday because the player has put his high-profile altercation with a Tottenham fan behind him and is in the right frame of mind. The Spurs manager believes his player has \u201cnothing to be afraid of, nothing to be ashamed of\u201d following the incident on Wednesday in the emotional aftermath of the FA Cup penalty shootout defeat at home to Norwich. Dier clambered into the stands to seek out the abusive supporter who had become embroiled in an argument with one of his younger brothers. The Football Association has still to decide whether to bring a misconduct charge against Dier, who did not reach the fan so there was no physical confrontation. \u201cWhat about Eric being in the right frame of mind to play?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cOf course. The only thing that matters is, first of all, that nothing really big happened. And, secondly, he played so, so well in the last two matches. Of course he is going to play. \u201cI did not consider giving him the weekend off. I would never do that. The player played so well. Nothing happened, nothing to be afraid of, nothing to be ashamed of. The football world is behind [him] and understands completely the circumstances. Nothing. Of course he\u2019s right to play.\u201d The out-of-character decision to chase the supporter could see Dier banned by the FA, which would be bad timing as he has just returned to the starting XI as a centre-half \u2013 the role he has come to consider his best. Dier, who made his name as a defensive midfielder, played well as part of a back three in last Sunday\u2019s 3-2 home defeat against Wolves and then as one of two central defenders in a back four against Norwich. Dier appears to be generating a little momentum after what has been a difficult season during which he started only four games in the opening months under Mauricio Pochettino, who departed in late November to be replaced by Mourinho. \u201cI found a sad player, a player without confidence, and then I was trying to give him that confidence back,\u201d said Mourinho, who restored him to the team in defensive midfield before, on the player\u2019s promptings, eventually giving him a try at centre-half. \u201cNow we have the feeling that maybe his best position [is there],\u201d Mourinho added.

Before that match Warren Gatland targeted Kyle Sinckler by describing him as an \u201cemotional timebomb\u201d and while the England prop starred for the first hour of the match he seemed to lose his composure thereafter amid repeated efforts from Jones to get under his skin. Afterwards Gatland could not help but gloat while Billy Vunipola conceded Wales\u2019s wind-up tactics had worked as England let a 10-3 half-time lead slip.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any unnecessary effort that goes into it,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s England v Wales so there is always hype around the fixture. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to get away from the echo of what\u2019s said and what should be done. Don\u2019t forget we know quite a lot about each other. There are quite a few guys playing in England and guys who have played with each other on Lions tours.\u201d</p> <p>England, however, have been bracing themselves for Wales\u2019 attempts to get under their skin. \u201cWe have definitely had a few discussions,\u201d the fly-half George Ford said. \u201cIt is a balance. You don\u2019t want to make too much of a big deal about it because you end up speaking about the opposition too much \u2013 but you have to anticipate it and be aware of it so it doesn\u2019t come as a shock at the weekend. We have discussed what potentially could happen and the plan of what we would do to look after individuals and look after the team. You don\u2019t want to get to a game without thinking about it, talking about it as a team and then you think: \u2018Jesus, what is going on here\u2019 and then before you know it five or 10 minutes of the game has gone, momentum has shifted and you are in that sort of a game again.\u201d</p> <p>After last year\u2019s defeat, Eddie Jones leapt to Sinckler\u2019s defence and has since highlighted his development, going on to become one of England\u2019s key performers at the World Cup. Indeed, the final might have panned out differently had Sinckler not been forced off in the opening minutes with a head injury. \u201cHe\u2019s come a long way,\u201d added Ford. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a pretty feisty character and still is. He needs to be. That\u2019s part of him and what makes him such a great player. But he\u2019s able to control it now. He knows where the line is and where he needs to be in terms of that line. Teams haven\u2019t even tried it in this Six Nations or in the World Cup, that\u2019s testament to how he\u2019s matured as a player.\u201d</p>",

Afterwards Gatland could not help but gloat while Billy Vunipola conceded Wales\u2019s wind-up tactics had worked as England let a 10-3 half-time lead slip. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any unnecessary effort that goes into it,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s England v Wales so there is always hype around the fixture. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to get away from the echo of what\u2019s said and what should be done. Don\u2019t forget we know quite a lot about each other. There are quite a few guys playing in England and guys who have played with each other on Lions tours.\u201d England, however, have been bracing themselves for Wales\u2019 attempts to get under their skin. \u201cWe have definitely had a few discussions,\u201d the fly-half George Ford said. \u201cIt is a balance. You don\u2019t want to make too much of a big deal about it because you end up speaking about the opposition too much \u2013 but you have to anticipate it and be aware of it so it doesn\u2019t come as a shock at the weekend. We have discussed what potentially could happen and the plan of what we would do to look after individuals and look after the team. You don\u2019t want to get to a game without thinking about it, talking about it as a team and then you think: \u2018Jesus, what is going on here\u2019 and then before you know it five or 10 minutes of the game has gone, momentum has shifted and you are in that sort of a game again.\u201d After last year\u2019s defeat, Eddie Jones leapt to Sinckler\u2019s defence and has since highlighted his development, going on to become one of England\u2019s key performers at the World Cup. Indeed, the final might have panned out differently had Sinckler not been forced off in the opening minutes with a head injury. \u201cHe\u2019s come a long way,\u201d added Ford. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a pretty feisty character and still is. He needs to be. That\u2019s part of him and what makes him such a great player. But he\u2019s able to control it now. He knows where the line is and where he needs to be in terms of that line. Teams haven\u2019t even tried it in this Six Nations or in the World Cup, that\u2019s testament to how he\u2019s matured as a player.\u201d",

He reportedly came close to publishing a memoir in 2003, reaching a deal with Penguin before changing his mind.

      "bodyText": "Hachette has dropped plans to publish a memoir by Woody Allen, the Oscar-winning film director who has been accused of sexually abusing his daughter. \u201cWe take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly,\u201d the publishing company said in a statement. The decision to kill Allen\u2019s book deal came on the heels of a staff walkout at Hachette\u2019s New York office and calls of solidarity from staffers at Little, Brown and Grand Central Publishing, both imprints of Hachette. Dylan Farrow on Friday welcomed news of the cancellation and thanked staff members at the three publishing groups for standing with her and her brother, Ronan Farrow, a journalist whose work has documented alleged sexual abuse by powerful men and fuelled the #MeToo movement and whose work has been published by Hachette. This week, Hachette announced publication of Allen\u2019s memoir, Apropos of Nothing, scheduled for April. That prompted blowback from both Dylan and Ronan, who quickly condemned the news on social media. \u201cThe biggest complaint,\u201d a Hachette staff member speaking on condition of anonymity told Refinery 29, \u201cis that we feel strongly about everyone\u2019s right to tell their own story, but we don\u2019t agree with giving Woody Allen a platform with which to tell it that includes distribution, marketing, publicity. \u201cI think we feel he does not deserve a platform, that by publishing him we are in some way validating his story.\u201d Senior figures at Hachette, including Ronan Farrow\u2019s editor, voiced their support. The employee added: \u201cA few people who I would say work with the parties involved met up and discussed and talked person to person and passed out papers. We had a town hall meeting with our CEO and our publisher. After we were able to raise our questions with them in a public forum, we grabbed our things and walked out.\u201d The employee did not think the company would change course but on Friday, it did. Hachette \u201cwill return all rights to the author\u201d, its statement said. \u201cThe decision to cancel Mr Allen\u2019s book was a difficult one. At HBG we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books. Hachette said it was committed to \u201cmaking sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard\u201d but also \u201coffering a stimulating, supportive and open work environment for all our staff\u201d. Allen, 84, denies the accusations by his daughter Dylan Farrow, which were the subject of two investigations. The director was never charged. Allen rose to fame as a stand-up comedian and comic writer and has made films for more than 50 years. He reportedly came close to publishing a memoir in 2003, reaching a deal with Penguin before changing his mind. Hachette said it made its deal with Allen last year. Hachette published Ronan Farrow\u2019s Catch and Kill, an account of his work on #MeToo stories including the case against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape in New York last month. In a statement in response to news of his father\u2019s deal, Farrow said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d his publisher had \u201cconcealed the decision from me and its own employees while we were working on Catch and Kill \u2013 a book about how powerful men, including Woody Allen, avoid accountability for sexual abuse\u201d. This year, Macmillan will publish a debut novel by Dylan Farrow. In her own statement on the decision to publish her father\u2019s memoir, she said it was \u201cdeeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men.\u201d On Friday, Hachette concluded: \u201cOver the past few days, HBG leadership had extensive conversations with our staff and others. \u201cAfter listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG.\u201d Mario Koran contributed reporting",

The official account for Blue Note Records tweeted \u201ca titan\u201d has now been lost and that the \u201camount of beauty\u201d Tyner gave to the world is \u201csimply staggering\u201d. Tributes have also arrives from Red Hot Chili Peppers founding member Flea who referred to Tyner as \u201ca stunner of a pianist\u201d and guitarist Charles Johnson, who played with him once, calling him \u201can amazing force of nature and also a great person\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>My mother, Mary Tandon, who has died aged 82, undertook many roles as a lawyer, writer and campaigner. Her life was punctuated by flights from her home because of political violence \u2013 and fresh starts in new countries. </p> <p>She was born in Malacca, British Malaya (now Malaysia). While Mary was at a tender age, she and her mother, Fong Ah Soo, were the sole survivors of a Japanese bombing raid in which the family home and the rest of her extended family were killed. </p> <p>Her mother remarried and, with the guidance and encouragement of her stepfather, Gabriel Chelvam, Mary did well at school. At the age of 20 she boarded a ship for a three-month voyage to London, where she studied at Lincoln\u2019s Inn.</p> <p>In 1962 she both qualified as a barrister and married Yashpal Tandon, a Ugandan politics student at the London School of Economics. I was born, and they moved to the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where Mary practised as a lawyer.</p> <p>Sitting as a magistrate, she brought compassion into the court room, issuing warnings to juvenile delinquents rather than fines or prison sentences, and in 1965 was appointed a high court judge. Meanwhile Yash helped to write the constitution of the newly independent country and became an adviser to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/12/guardianobituaries.hearafrica05\" title=\"\">President Milton Obote</a>. </p> <p>In 1970 my brother, Vivek, was born, and the following year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Idi Amin</a> seized power. Mary organised our family\u2019s escape across the border to Kenya. Books, piano and worldly possessions were left behind. In 1972 we moved for a year to London, where Mary worked as a legal clerk and to support Ugandan refugees. The following year we moved to Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, and Mary taught law at the university. </p> <p>When Tanzanian troops ousted Amin in 1978-79, Yash joined the new political leadership of Uganda and our family returned to Kampala. The sojourn was brief. When a military coup ensued after just 68 days, Mary again packed up our belongings in haste and fled to Kenya. </p> <p>Finally, in the late 1980s, Mary accepted a new job as legal draftsperson in the newly independent Zimbabwe, where Yash became a consultant and writer. Harare offered 23 years of calm and security. </p> <p>Mary nurtured African orchids, fruit trees, vegetables, dogs and ducks.

      "bodyText": "My mother, Mary Tandon, who has died aged 82, undertook many roles as a lawyer, writer and campaigner. Her life was punctuated by flights from her home because of political violence \u2013 and fresh starts in new countries. She was born in Malacca, British Malaya (now Malaysia). While Mary was at a tender age, she and her mother, Fong Ah Soo, were the sole survivors of a Japanese bombing raid in which the family home and the rest of her extended family were killed. Her mother remarried and, with the guidance and encouragement of her stepfather, Gabriel Chelvam, Mary did well at school. At the age of 20 she boarded a ship for a three-month voyage to London, where she studied at Lincoln\u2019s Inn. In 1962 she both qualified as a barrister and married Yashpal Tandon, a Ugandan politics student at the London School of Economics. I was born, and they moved to the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where Mary practised as a lawyer. Sitting as a magistrate, she brought compassion into the court room, issuing warnings to juvenile delinquents rather than fines or prison sentences, and in 1965 was appointed a high court judge. Meanwhile Yash helped to write the constitution of the newly independent country and became an adviser to President Milton Obote. In 1970 my brother, Vivek, was born, and the following year Idi Amin seized power. Mary organised our family\u2019s escape across the border to Kenya. Books, piano and worldly possessions were left behind. In 1972 we moved for a year to London, where Mary worked as a legal clerk and to support Ugandan refugees. The following year we moved to Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, and Mary taught law at the university. When Tanzanian troops ousted Amin in 1978-79, Yash joined the new political leadership of Uganda and our family returned to Kampala. The sojourn was brief. When a military coup ensued after just 68 days, Mary again packed up our belongings in haste and fled to Kenya. Finally, in the late 1980s, Mary accepted a new job as legal draftsperson in the newly independent Zimbabwe, where Yash became a consultant and writer. Harare offered 23 years of calm and security. Mary nurtured African orchids, fruit trees, vegetables, dogs and ducks. She co-created the Women\u2019s Action Group, was a co-founder of the Zimbabwe Women\u2019s Writers Association, published poetry and prose, and simplified texts for women on their legal rights. But times changed under the Mugabe regime. In 2002-03, concerned for their safety, Mary and Yash moved again, this time to Geneva. In 2009, they retired to Oxford to be closer to Vivek and his family. Mary is survived by Yash, Vivek and me, and her grandchildren, Yasmin, Sanjay, Ayesha, Aiyana and Kushal.",

      "body": "<p>At Liverpool in 1990 and Manchester United in 2013 an era of dominance became a spiralling freefall. After Kenny Dalglish claimed an 18th title for the Merseyside club, a 30-year drought followed. Sir Alex Ferguson led United to a 20th crown and the wait for a 21st will stretch into an eighth season. Both plunges occurred after the manager stepped away \u2013 Ferguson in May 2013, Dalglish in February 1991.</p> \n<p>When Pep Guardiola one day departs as Manchester City manager, the history of their two fiercest rivals may resonate for those charged with replacing him.</p> \n<p>Guardiola\u2019s contract expires in June 2021 and the club\u2019s two-year Champions League ban has renewed attention on his future. The coach insisted he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/21/pep-guardiola-open-to-extending-his-manchester-city-stay-beyond-2021\" title=\"\">open to renewing his contract</a> but so far he has never stayed at a club longer than his four years at the Camp Nou. The ban may be retained, reduced or scrapped but whatever happens City\u2019s Guardiola endgame may be played out sooner rather than later. The appointment of a successor will be the most important strategic call of Sheikh Mansour\u2019s ownership since Guardiola was hired in the summer of 2016.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/mar/06/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last Sunday Guardiola claimed his sixth major trophy with City by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/01/aston-villa-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">winning the Carabao Cup</a>. He is comfortably the most successful manager in their history. And yet a high-ranking executive insists the Catalan is not the most important person at City. The declaration spoke to a long-term strategy overseen by Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chairman, and executed by the sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano. Their task is to ensure that whether Guardiola or AN Other manager is in charge, City\u2019s underlying philosophy is maintained: in broad terms this is to play stylish football while accumulating silverware.</p> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s Boot Room provided them with highly successful managerial solutions in the past, and Mubarak, Begiristain and Soriano have in place an equivalent of sorts: the eight-club City Football Group, of which Manchester City are the flagship. In addition to offering Mansour a global reach, the CFG is a finishing school for prospective managers to take charge of its various teams.</p> \n<p>Patrick Vieira moved from leading City\u2019s reserve side to become New York City FC manager in 2016. Nick Cushing departed as City Women\u2019s head coach to become NYCFC assistant manager this February, and Erick Mombaerts stepped down from Yokohama F Marinos in January 2019 and took over at another CFG club, Melbourne City FC later in the year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b7d2486a70f408a643ca21d0d2a3c39beddfe88\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b7d2486a70f408a643ca21d0d2a3c39beddfe88/0_190_4200_2519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Liverpool Boot Room pictured during the 1983-84 treble-winning season: (from left to right) Ronnie Moran, Roy Evans and manager Joe Fagan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Liverpool boot room pictured during the 1983-84 treble-winning season: (from left to right) Ronnie Moran, Roy Evans and manager Joe Fagan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liverpool FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The profile of the job, though, plus the pressure of following Guardiola, means if a homegrown replacement is desired to take over then rather than searching within, Mubarak, Soriano and Begiristain may look to lure back Vieira, who has been in charge of Nice since 2018, or Mikel Arteta, who was Guardiola\u2019s assistant until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/20/mikel-arteta-effective-mouthpiece-arsenal\" title=\"\">leaving to lead Arsenal in December</a>.</p> \n<p>Among contenders with no links to the club are Mauricio Pochettino, who got the better of Guardiola as Tottenham manager in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/17/manchester-city-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">epic Champions League quarter-final</a>, and RB Leipzig\u2019s Julian Nagelsmann. They appear to be similar spirits in footballing terms.</p> \n<p>\u201cCity is one of the better examples in England of how a club can be run,\u201d says the club\u2019s former midfielder Dietmar Hamann. \u201cThey\u2019ve promoted a lot of people from within; people who\u2019ve been there 10-15 years ago in lower positions \u2013 they are in top positions now from when I was there [2006-09].</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve created a spirit where everybody wants to be part of that journey. When a club is not run well, when there are too many people talking about who should be brought in, too many people talking about maybe even team selection, what do you do then? You attract the wrong type. And as a player you get a feeling when you speak to people at a club. You think: \u2018Either something is growing or I go here because I get an awful lot of money and if it doesn\u2019t work out, I will be off after 12 months.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a481f1b2-5307-4ce7-8d6e-ca13cf868a19\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To find a successful heir to Guardiola, Mubarak and City would have to be pioneers. A dynasty in the Premier League era is yet to be achieved. Ferguson\u2019s feat was a generational success at United in the 1990s and 2000s but there was no smooth transition of dominance to an heir, as first David Moyes, then Louis van Gaal and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho failed to seriously compete for the title.</p> \n<p>Ferguson\u2019s departure occurred concurrently with that of the chief executive David Gill and was compounded by the removal of key coaching staff \u2013 Mike Phelan and Rene Meulensteen \u2013 by Moyes. The culture imbued by Ferguson across a 26-and-a-half-year reign vanished, and a vacuum of leadership and direction prevailed.</p> \n<p>When Dalglish left, Liverpool believed all of this remained intact. A proud lineage that began with Bill Shankly\u2019s arrival as manager in 1959 and ran through Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Dalglish, appeared safe when Graeme Souness became a fifth permanent No 1 in 32 years. Souness, a former captain who played under Paisley and Fagan and with Dalglish, was steeped in the club. With Roy Evans and Ronnie Moran on the coaching staff there was firm representation of the club\u2019s vaunted Boot Room.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Ferguson left and all hell broke loose. They\u2019ve spent close to a billion quid and are probably further behind than they\u2019ve ever been</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dietmar Hamann</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet the club became rudderless. Souness would later admit regret at not refreshing an ageing squad. John Barnes, a pre-eminent force in Liverpool\u2019s last championship win and also integral to the 1987-88 triumph, says: \u201cIn terms of the training, methods, the philosophy, these came from Bill Shankly and Kenny had continued that. When you\u2019re talking about a dynasty or an identity that\u2019s hard to maintain. We maintained that from Bill Shankly all the way to the beginning of the Premier League [in 1992] but things had started to change \u2013 from training, to the attitude of players.\u201d</p> \n<p>Evans, who took over from Souness, says: \u201cContinuity was a big part of our success because you were not getting major changes. When you\u2019re changing managers for someone who hasn\u2019t been at the club, normally it takes a while for them to blend in, though not too much with J\u00fcrgen Klopp at Liverpool.</p> \n<p>\u201cJ\u00fcrgen seems to be one of those who gets Liverpool and the way they want to play. When you\u2019re changing managers all the time it must be difficult for any club. We had continuity in my time but [vitally] we had mostly the same ideas.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hamann, who has a Master of Sports Directorship from Manchester Metropolitan University, also played with distinction for Liverpool and believes they have recovered their ground. \u201cLiverpool is a brilliant example [too]. They\u2019ve got Michael Edwards [sporting director], then Klopp. On the other hand, if you go down the road to Manchester United, you have a situation where Ferguson left and all hell broke loose. They\u2019ve spent close to a billion quid and are probably further behind than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hamann cites another of his former clubs, Bayern Munich, as an example that might lend itself to the appointment by City of an outsider such as Pochettino. Hamann says Bayern\u2019s approach is predicated on a variant of the \u201cfamily and friends\u201d model at City. Its version is to look outside for star coaches \u2013 as with Guardiola (2013-16), Carlo Ancelotti (2016\u201117), and Van Gaal (2009-11) \u2013 who walk into an operation teeming with former players in on- and off-field roles.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"157821913afe22465f5762939bff5ce69ea8d7e7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/157821913afe22465f5762939bff5ce69ea8d7e7/0_179_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s departure from Manchester United was followed by that of Mike Phelan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s departure from Manchester United was followed by that of Mike Phelan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Werner Kern was Bayern\u2019s assistant manager from 1970-77 and also took charge of the reserves, returning in 1998 to oversee the youth academy before retirement in 2012. \u201cWhen I started it was the era of [Franz] Beckenbauer and [Gerd] M\u00fcller,\u201d Kern says of two Bayern greats who would manage the first and second XIs, respectively. \u201cThey remained in love with the club for a very long time. This is an important part \u2013 that we all [who are involved] love this club.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow there is Oliver Kahn [former Bayern goalkeeper] who will be the successor of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge [another club great] as chairman in 2022. Currently, Rummenigge is working with him for two years so he can learn.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/mar/03/david-squires-on-manchester-city-league-cup-final-watford-liverpool-arsenal-invincibles\">David Squires on \u2026 Manchester City's big week and minor wins elsewhere</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As at City, those who take strategic decisions adhere to club ethos. \u201cNot understanding the culture of Bayern Munich is absolutely impossible,\u201d Kern says. \u201cTradition plays a very important role, since the times of Beckenbauer and M\u00fcller.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout Ferguson, Manchester United would not have been the same.

A manager will be sought with the ability to continue Guardiola\u2019s unparalleled success, the personality to allow deference to club philosophy and the courage to follow a genius.</p> \n<p>As at Liverpool when Dalglish left, Barnes states that even with structures in place an appointment can backfire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He says: \u201cLet\u2019s talk from a J\u00fcrgen Klopp point of view.

      "bodyText": "At Liverpool in 1990 and Manchester United in 2013 an era of dominance became a spiralling freefall. After Kenny Dalglish claimed an 18th title for the Merseyside club, a 30-year drought followed. Sir Alex Ferguson led United to a 20th crown and the wait for a 21st will stretch into an eighth season. Both plunges occurred after the manager stepped away \u2013 Ferguson in May 2013, Dalglish in February 1991. When Pep Guardiola one day departs as Manchester City manager, the history of their two fiercest rivals may resonate for those charged with replacing him. Guardiola\u2019s contract expires in June 2021 and the club\u2019s two-year Champions League ban has renewed attention on his future. The coach insisted he was open to renewing his contract but so far he has never stayed at a club longer than his four years at the Camp Nou. The ban may be retained, reduced or scrapped but whatever happens City\u2019s Guardiola endgame may be played out sooner rather than later. The appointment of a successor will be the most important strategic call of Sheikh Mansour\u2019s ownership since Guardiola was hired in the summer of 2016. Last Sunday Guardiola claimed his sixth major trophy with City by winning the Carabao Cup. He is comfortably the most successful manager in their history. And yet a high-ranking executive insists the Catalan is not the most important person at City. The declaration spoke to a long-term strategy overseen by Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chairman, and executed by the sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano. Their task is to ensure that whether Guardiola or AN Other manager is in charge, City\u2019s underlying philosophy is maintained: in broad terms this is to play stylish football while accumulating silverware. Liverpool\u2019s Boot Room provided them with highly successful managerial solutions in the past, and Mubarak, Begiristain and Soriano have in place an equivalent of sorts: the eight-club City Football Group, of which Manchester City are the flagship. In addition to offering Mansour a global reach, the CFG is a finishing school for prospective managers to take charge of its various teams. Patrick Vieira moved from leading City\u2019s reserve side to become New York City FC manager in 2016. Nick Cushing departed as City Women\u2019s head coach to become NYCFC assistant manager this February, and Erick Mombaerts stepped down from Yokohama F Marinos in January 2019 and took over at another CFG club, Melbourne City FC later in the year. The profile of the job, though, plus the pressure of following Guardiola, means if a homegrown replacement is desired to take over then rather than searching within, Mubarak, Soriano and Begiristain may look to lure back Vieira, who has been in charge of Nice since 2018, or Mikel Arteta, who was Guardiola\u2019s assistant until leaving to lead Arsenal in December. Among contenders with no links to the club are Mauricio Pochettino, who got the better of Guardiola as Tottenham manager in an epic Champions League quarter-final, and RB Leipzig\u2019s Julian Nagelsmann. They appear to be similar spirits in footballing terms. \u201cCity is one of the better examples in England of how a club can be run,\u201d says the club\u2019s former midfielder Dietmar Hamann. \u201cThey\u2019ve promoted a lot of people from within; people who\u2019ve been there 10-15 years ago in lower positions \u2013 they are in top positions now from when I was there [2006-09]. \u201cThey\u2019ve created a spirit where everybody wants to be part of that journey. When a club is not run well, when there are too many people talking about who should be brought in, too many people talking about maybe even team selection, what do you do then? You attract the wrong type. And as a player you get a feeling when you speak to people at a club. You think: \u2018Either something is growing or I go here because I get an awful lot of money and if it doesn\u2019t work out, I will be off after 12 months.\u2019\u201d To find a successful heir to Guardiola, Mubarak and City would have to be pioneers. A dynasty in the Premier League era is yet to be achieved. Ferguson\u2019s feat was a generational success at United in the 1990s and 2000s but there was no smooth transition of dominance to an heir, as first David Moyes, then Louis van Gaal and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho failed to seriously compete for the title. Ferguson\u2019s departure occurred concurrently with that of the chief executive David Gill and was compounded by the removal of key coaching staff \u2013 Mike Phelan and Rene Meulensteen \u2013 by Moyes. The culture imbued by Ferguson across a 26-and-a-half-year reign vanished, and a vacuum of leadership and direction prevailed. When Dalglish left, Liverpool believed all of this remained intact. A proud lineage that began with Bill Shankly\u2019s arrival as manager in 1959 and ran through Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Dalglish, appeared safe when Graeme Souness became a fifth permanent No 1 in 32 years. Souness, a former captain who played under Paisley and Fagan and with Dalglish, was steeped in the club. With Roy Evans and Ronnie Moran on the coaching staff there was firm representation of the club\u2019s vaunted Boot Room. Yet the club became rudderless. Souness would later admit regret at not refreshing an ageing squad. John Barnes, a pre-eminent force in Liverpool\u2019s last championship win and also integral to the 1987-88 triumph, says: \u201cIn terms of the training, methods, the philosophy, these came from Bill Shankly and Kenny had continued that. When you\u2019re talking about a dynasty or an identity that\u2019s hard to maintain. We maintained that from Bill Shankly all the way to the beginning of the Premier League [in 1992] but things had started to change \u2013 from training, to the attitude of players.\u201d Evans, who took over from Souness, says: \u201cContinuity was a big part of our success because you were not getting major changes. When you\u2019re changing managers for someone who hasn\u2019t been at the club, normally it takes a while for them to blend in, though not too much with J\u00fcrgen Klopp at Liverpool. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen seems to be one of those who gets Liverpool and the way they want to play. When you\u2019re changing managers all the time it must be difficult for any club. We had continuity in my time but [vitally] we had mostly the same ideas.\u201d Hamann, who has a Master of Sports Directorship from Manchester Metropolitan University, also played with distinction for Liverpool and believes they have recovered their ground. \u201cLiverpool is a brilliant example [too]. They\u2019ve got Michael Edwards [sporting director], then Klopp. On the other hand, if you go down the road to Manchester United, you have a situation where Ferguson left and all hell broke loose. They\u2019ve spent close to a billion quid and are probably further behind than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Hamann cites another of his former clubs, Bayern Munich, as an example that might lend itself to the appointment by City of an outsider such as Pochettino. Hamann says Bayern\u2019s approach is predicated on a variant of the \u201cfamily and friends\u201d model at City. Its version is to look outside for star coaches \u2013 as with Guardiola (2013-16), Carlo Ancelotti (2016\u201117), and Van Gaal (2009-11) \u2013 who walk into an operation teeming with former players in on- and off-field roles. Werner Kern was Bayern\u2019s assistant manager from 1970-77 and also took charge of the reserves, returning in 1998 to oversee the youth academy before retirement in 2012. \u201cWhen I started it was the era of [Franz] Beckenbauer and [Gerd] M\u00fcller,\u201d Kern says of two Bayern greats who would manage the first and second XIs, respectively. \u201cThey remained in love with the club for a very long time. This is an important part \u2013 that we all [who are involved] love this club. \u201cNow there is Oliver Kahn [former Bayern goalkeeper] who will be the successor of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge [another club great] as chairman in 2022. Currently, Rummenigge is working with him for two years so he can learn.\u201d As at City, those who take strategic decisions adhere to club ethos. \u201cNot understanding the culture of Bayern Munich is absolutely impossible,\u201d Kern says. \u201cTradition plays a very important role, since the times of Beckenbauer and M\u00fcller. \u201cWithout Ferguson, Manchester United would not have been the same. Success depends always on big personalities, and we had fantastic personalities a Bayern, and we will have in the future.\u201d Here Kern hints at the complexity of replacing Guardiola. A manager will be sought with the ability to continue Guardiola\u2019s unparalleled success, the personality to allow deference to club philosophy and the courage to follow a genius. As at Liverpool when Dalglish left, Barnes states that even with structures in place an appointment can backfire. He says: \u201cLet\u2019s talk from a J\u00fcrgen Klopp point of view. He will leave a legacy if he [departs] in two years\u2019 time \u2013 having won the Premier League, and taking Liverpool back to the top. But that was only for a three- or four-year period. A new manager coming in, he isn\u2019t necessarily going to do things the J\u00fcrgen Klopp way. \u201cHe may want to change it. It\u2019s difficult now for clubs to keep an identity \u2013 Manchester City is the same with Pep Guardiola. If he leaves and somebody else comes [who they believe is right], he could say: \u2018We don\u2019t want to play this way, we are going to have different philosophies and different mentality.\u2019\u201d",

The homeless charity Crisis, together with the Liberal Democrats, are asking for immediate guidance on how to help rough sleepers who are likely to have pre-existing health conditions that make them vulnerable to the illness. Advice is also needed on how the self-isolation protocol could work for people who live on the streets and how they can regularly wash their hands, they suggest. Matthew Downie, director of policy and external affairs for Crisis, said: \u201cPeople sleeping rough are particularly vulnerable because they are more likely to have a range of existing health conditions and face specific challenges in that they may be unable to regularly wash their hands, nor can they self-isolate if they feel unwell. \u201cThis guidance must set out what measures government is taking to ensure rough sleepers get appropriate health checks, what accommodation will be provided so that people can self-isolate and advice for the public on how best they can support people who are homeless during the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran has written jointly to the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to seek clarity and urge the government to act.

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government reported that last year 4,677 people slept outside across the country but council data from freedom of information requests showed almost 25,000 people slept rough in 2019. In the US, health care officials and charity workers who support homeless people on the west coast are already raising similar concerns that coronavirus could seriously affect communities of rough sleepers. They have highlighted that they typically have poor access to doctors and a high prevalence of underlying respiratory problems. Previously there has been a rapid spread of diseases such as typhus and tuberculosis among the homeless in LA because of the likelihood of large numbers of people sleeping close together. So far there have been no outbreaks of the virus in homeless shelters or encampments in the US.",

In a significant policy change, NHS bosses want England\u2019s 7,000 GP surgeries to start conducting as many remote consultations as soon as possible, replacing patient visits with phone, video, online or text contact. They want to reduce the risk of someone infected with Covid-19 turning up at a surgery and free GPs to deal with the extra workload created by the virus. In a pre-emptive move some surgeries, especially in London, have already begun texting patients to tell them not to come in for pre-booked appointments from Monday and that appointments will be conducted by phone instead. The approach could affect many of the 340m appointments a year with GPs and other practice staff, only 1% of which are currently carried out by video, such as Skype. The change could last for several months as experts believe the virus may not peak until April or May, and could last until June or July. The move is likely to prove controversial because it will mean that many patients are unable to have a physical examination as part of their consultation, risking some symptoms going undetected. The Royal College of GPs made clear that patients who still want to see a GP should be able to do so. NHS England has started asking health technology firms such as PushDoctor, Babylon, Docly and Visiba to help surgeries put in place the equipment needed for a massive expansion in remote consultations. Many NHS hospital trusts have also started exploring how they could hold outpatient appointments by telephone or digitally as a way of coping with extra pressure they will come under if Britain\u2019s outbreak becomes a pandemic, as senior doctors fear. In a letter to GPs on Thursday to update them on its plans to counter Covid-19, NHS England told them to use phone or video consultations to assess people who may have contracted the virus as a way of protecting themselves. \u201cTo mitigate any risk that potentially infected patients book appointments online and attend the practice when they should be receiving advice to self-isolate or go through testing, all practices are now being advised to change face-to-face appointments booked online to triage appointments via telephone or video,\u201d wrote Dr Nikita Kanani, a GP and the NHS\u2019s medical director for primary care.

The travel industry has already been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. The contagion proved the last straw for the Exeter-based airline Flybe, which collapsed into administration on Thursday. On Wednesday, the German airline Lufthansa grounded 150 planes amid low demand. Officials from the Department for International Development hope the \u00a346m pledged will help in the development of the eight possible coronavirus vaccines being worked on by scientists. A rapid diagnostic test could also be used by low-income countries around the world that are not currently able to diagnose the virus at all. No one was has been allowed to leave the Grand Princess cruise ship, which was stuck off the coast of San Francisco, with guests being confined to their rooms pending test results. Meals were delivered to passengers\u2019 cabins and they were given free internet access and extra films to watch on the onboard televisions, Princess Cruises said. Last week, a passenger on its sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined in Japan, became the first UK citizen to die from the virus.",

      "bodyText": "One last thing: despite a late mini-recovery, Wall Street has closed in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down about 253 points or 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost about 52 points, or 1.7%, to close near 2,972. So, a poor day. But thanks to strong gains on Monday and Wednesday, the Dow finished the week up 1.8%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%. Goodnight! (Again) Time for a recap, after another turbulent week. Fears of a global recession triggered by Covid-19 have sent stock markets slumping again today. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has tumbled by 3.6% in another wave of selling; it shed 242 points to close at 6462, the weakest since July 2016. Wall Street is being pummelled too, as the number of coronavirus cases in America continues to rise. The main indices are at their lowest levels since last summer; Dow: down 566 points or 2.3% at 25,521 S&amp;P 500: down 92 points or 3% at 2,903 Nasdaq: down 293 points or 3.3% at 8,445 The scramble into safe-haven bonds has driven US and UK government bond yields to record lows. Oil has plunged after Opec and Russia failed to agree production cuts, to address falling demand due to the virus outbreak. German airline Lufthansa has halved capacity, as analysts warned that Norwegian airlines is suffering too. The US economy has created 273,000 jobs last month - more than forecast. Panicky investors took little notice. Goodnight, and have a lovely weekend! GW and JJ The UK government has asked supermarkets to increase availability of home delivery services to help people in self-isolation with coronavirus get access to food and other essentials. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: Top supermarket executives held a call with George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs on Friday afternoon. The teleconference came after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed he had been in touch with supermarkets and he was \u201cconfident\u201d food supplies would not run out. However, several supermarket executives told the Guardian that until Friday there had been no communication from the government about managing potential shortages during the outbreak. Ben Chu of the Independent has written about how rising anxiety about the economic impact of the global Covid-19 outbreak has driven the yield (or interest rate) on government debt to record lows: The recent dip is certainly driven by fears about the threat of a pandemic. Traders expect the Bank of England to be forced to cut interest rates relatively soon to try to help support the UK economy in the face of this shock. Reductions in the official short-term Bank interest rate tend to reduce traded UK government bond yields. Also, with stock markets tanking, there\u2019s generalised fear about holding riskier assets. Tom di Galoma, managing director of Treasurys trading at Seaport Global Securities, says stocks are falling because: \u201cThe COVID-19 infection rate is multiplying and more states in the U.S. are imposing emergency orders\u201d. Stocks are sliding as the number of coronavirus cases in the US keeps rising, with 33 now reported in New York state. Today\u2019s sell-off is threatening to push the S&amp;P 500 to a fresh five-month closing low. The broad index of US stocks is currently down 2.6%, or 78 points, at 2,947. It was briefly lower last week, but closed lower since mid-October 2019. Oil producers, banks and tech stocks are the worst-performing sectors, with miners trudging lose behind. Nearly half of companies have mentioned Coronavirus in their recent financial reports, spots Michael McDonough of Bloomberg (and very few, if any, were positive mentions, I bet) The firm behind toilet roll brand Andrex says it is taking steps to ensure supplies are available, after stock-piling and panic buying this week: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has shed over 12.5% of its value in the last fortnight, after today\u2019s selloff sent the index below last week\u2019s lows: A little context: This week had started with some optimism that the coronavirus outbreak might be contained, and that government and central banks might steer their economics through the weeds. Those hopes have fizzled in the last couple of days, though, as cases of Covid-19 have jumped in the US, the UK and Europe. Most stocks have suffered, but there are some serious casualties in London, as Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell explains:. Investor fears that appetite would wane for spring and summer holidays resulted in TUI\u2019s shares falling by 37% in value over the past two weeks. The sharp decline in its valuation cost the travel company its place in the FTSE 100 with the result of quarterly reshuffle demoting the business to the FTSE 250 index. \u201cOutsourcing group Capita lost 47% of its value over the past week after its restructuring was costing more and taking longer than expected. \u201cCineworld failed to convince the market that it was in good health. The postponement of the latest James Bond film, together with growing concerns about its very large amount of debt linked to two major acquisitions, led investors to worry about the state of the business. Its shares fell nearly 30% over the week.\u201d After tumbling again today, European stock markets have closed at their lowest point since August 2019. The Stoxx 600 has closed 3.7%, as the nervous recovery earlier this week was wiped out in heavy selling yesterday and today. Energy stock were the worst hit, after today\u2019s oil output cut deal collapsed. How bad is it today? Well, well-known Wall Street trader Peter Tuchman has captured the mood on another grizzly day: Every sector of the Dow is falling today, as investors ignore Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Covid-19 will \u201cgo away\u201d. My colleague Joanna Walters explains: \u201cYou have to be calm,\u201d Trump said at the White House this morning before departing to tour the tornado damage in Tennessee and shortly after signing an $8.3bn emergency spending bill to deal with the virus. \u201cIt will go away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have very low numbers [of confirmed cases] compared to many countries throughout the world. Our numbers are lower than almost anyone \u2026 deaths, is it 11?\u201d It is. Investors, though, fear that total could rise sharply - triggering today\u2019s selloff: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index has ended the day at its lowest closing level since the summer of 2016. The FTSE 100 index has closed down 242 points, or 3.6%, at 6462. That\u2019s its lowest close since the end of June 2016 (when the Brexit vote knocked the pound, making UK stocks more attractive) Fears are growing that the coronavirus crisis will force some European companies to default on their bonds. The FT explains: A measure of strain in European credit markets leapt to its highest level in four years on Friday, suggesting that investors are bracing for a wave of defaults despite a vertiginous plunge in government bond yields. The iTraxx Crossover index, which measures the perceived risk of defaults by European companies with low credit ratings, surged above 380 basis points on Friday \u2014 a 100bp rise in just three days \u2014 to its highest since the summer of 2016. Sky News are reporting that Facebook is closing its London offices and telling staff to work from home after an employee was diagnosed with COVID-19. The employee who was diagnosed with the virus was normally based in Singapore, butvisited the London offices between 24-26 February. The slump in demand caused by Covid-19 has forced Icelandair to cancel around 80 flights in March and April, it says. That\u2019s roughly 2% of its flight schedule for the two months. Eek! The oil price is sliding even lower, amid confirmation that the Opec+ group have failed to agree production cuts (as feared). Brent crude is now down 8.8%, a really sharp plunge, at just $45.61, down from over $50 last night. Nearly every stock on the Dow is falling again today. JP Morgan is leading the selloff, after announcing that chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is recovering from emergency heart surgery. Exxon Mobile are down 3.6% as hopes of an Opec-Russia oil supply cut deal fade. Shares in Lufthansa\u2019s rivals have jumped. British Airways owner International Airlines Group is now leading the (seven) FTSE 100 risers, up by 1.8%. Air France-KLM has now gained 5.5%, while Ryanair has pared some of its losses. Germany\u2019s flag-carrier airline, Lufthansa, is planning to cut as many as half of its flights in the coming weeks. In a message to the Frankfurt stock exchange Lufthansa said that it had seen a \u201cdrastic falls in bookings\u201d. It had already cut about 25% of its capacity, before the latest measures. It is quite something. Oil prices are really under pressure as it appears that an Opec deal with Russia is not going to be forthcoming. Brent crude futures are now down by 5.6% today, hitting lows of $46.70 \u2013 having hit $71 on 8 July. That\u2019s down by a third in under two months! West Texas Intermediate crude futures have lost 5.9%, breaking below $43 per barrel. It was above $60 per barrel at the start of the year. It has been quite a day on the bond markets: every time you check it appears that yields on widely traded debt are plumbing new lows, as surging demand for safe havens pushes up prices. The UK 10-year gilt yield fell as low as 0.206% in afternoon trading, having started the day at 0.33%. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury fell to 0.66%, only three days after it first broke the 1% mark for the first time. And in Germany 10-year and 30-year Bunds fell further into record negative-yielding territory, at 0.746% and 0.335% respectively. That means that investors are effectively paying to lend to the German government (although at least holders will still get back their principal when the bonds expire \u2013 something that is clearly valued at times like these). Larry Kudlow, the director of Donald Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, is trying to reassure markets on US television. Kudlow may not have an absolutely stellar record on predictions, but there is some evidence that the US economy was not doing too badly before the outbreak \u2013 not least the strong US jobs data from today. It was \u201canother month of impressive jobs growth\u201d, said the Guardian\u2019s US business editor Dominic Rushe, in his report: The underlying pace could help once the outbreak has bottomed out, according to the respected Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz: By my reckoning the FTSE 100 is on course for the worst daily performance since 24 August 2015. London\u2019s blue-chip stocks fell by 4.67% on that day, when fears abounded over the Chinese economy. Before that we have to look back to 2011 for a comparable fall. As expected the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by 2.9% at the opening bell. The Nasdaq lost 3%, as did the Dow Jones industrial average \u2013 776 points in old money. The FTSE 100 has now lost 3.7% for the day. The new intra-day low of 6,444 points is the lowest level since July 2016, when the fall in sterling made UK-listed companies relatively cheaper. The new low came after new figures showing an accelerating spread of coronavirus in the UK. *This post has been edited. It is the lowest level since July 2016, not 2017 as previously stated. The number of global coronavirus cases has reached 100,052, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. It came as two British Airways employees tested positive for the disease. More updates here: Some coronavirus reactions (even if the markets aren\u2019t really moving in response to it). Robert Alster, head of investment services at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: Coronavirus poses a threat to the nascent recovery in manufacturing, and the vital service sector. Before Covid-19 spread, the US economy was already showing symptoms of slowing, with weakening employment data likely to offer waning support to consumption growth. Disruption the virus has caused elsewhere in the world may cancel out the better momentum facilitated by progress on trade, but what matters more is the domestic impact on US consumption. James Ingram, an investment manager at MB Capital, said: In the midst of all of the reporting on Coronavirus this was potentially going to be the most easily missed non-farm payroll announcement in recent history. We had a strong healthy start to the year with January\u2019s number being revised upwards from 225,000 to 273,000 and today\u2019s number for February coming in much stronger than expected also at 273,000. Couple this with the panicked rate cut of 0.5% by the US Fed and it places the economy and the stock market in a great position. My only fear is a weaker [reading] may have had a larger impact and created the urgency for the US to consider further stimulus, which would have buoyed the market and helped calm fears about the risk Coronavirus could have on ebbing away business revenues over the near future. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: There is so much panic in the markets \u2013 in fact, the only time we have seen something similar to this was during the financial crisis. However, it is important to keep in mind that we have a serious discount available on the equity markets and it is about time to start preparing your shopping list. The US employment data show an economy running pretty hot. It would have been looking very promising for President Donald Trump going into a November election \u2013 before the coronavirus put paid to that. In other circumstances the US Federal Reserve\u2019s 0.5 percentage point emergency interest rate on Tuesday could well have been a rise. Wall Street futures have barely moved after the release, despite a massive beat. S&amp;P 500 futures are still down by 3.1%. The US economy created 273,000 jobs in February, blowing away economists\u2019 estimates, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis \u2013 even if the data were overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak. Remember, economists had expected 175,000 new jobs, compared to the earlier January reading of 225,000. S&amp;P 500 futures prices are down by 3.2% so far today. It would take an almighty surprise for the non-farm payrolls to make even a small dent in that ahead of the Wall Street opening bell. US airlines are due to get battered, with United Airlines down by 7% in pre-market trading (having lost 13% yesterday). Delta Air Lines is expected to lose 4%. And bank shares also look like they\u2019re due to fall steeply. The coronavirus outbreak is dominating market sentiment at the moment to the extent that traders are apparently barely watching the US non-farm payrolls data for February. The snapshot of how the US economy is faring \u2013 most notably in terms of how many jobs were created during the month \u2013 is usually seen as one of the key economic data points for the world\u2019s largest economy. Economists don\u2019t appear to believe there will be any major effect from the coronavirus outbreak visible yet. On average they estimate that 175,000 jobs were added, down from 225,000 in January but still a strong number. But this was all before the coronavirus outbreak really threatened the US. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, went as far as to say: This afternoon\u2019s US payrolls report looks set to be one of the most meaningless report in the last 12 years. Here are the numbers from the past year, in any case. Nissan has revealed that it has spent \u00a3400m in its Sunderland plant as it prepares to build its new Qashqai SUV. It came as the Japanese carmaker today launched a new \u00a352m metal press line to make body panels for the cars. The Sunderland plant \u2013 Britain\u2019s largest \u2013 became emblematic of the possible effects of the 2016 Brexit vote on the car industry. However, it has faced difficulties, most notably the withdrawal of a previous decision to build the X-Trail SUV there \u2013 a major loss of investment. It also stopped making premium Infiniti cars there. Nissan said that the \u00a3400m invested for Qashqai came on top of the \u00a3100m invested for the launch of new Juke. It said that was part of an overall \u00a31bn planned investment into the plant by Nissan over five years. Here\u2019s some lunchtime reading (at least for those joining us from the UK and western Europe): Huawei row: A group of eight Conservative rebel MPs, including four former cabinet ministers, have put down an amendment calling on the government to eliminate all Huawei technology from the UK\u2019s mobile phone networks by the end of 2022. Caffeine fix: UK consumers will spend more than \u00a34bn getting their caffeine fix from high street coffee shops this year, to hit an all-time high. Not building bridges: The national infrastructure strategy to invest \u00a3100bn in boosting the economy and tackling the climate crisis is expected to be delayed until after the budget. And some longer reports from earlier: Fraud alert: Coronavirus scams have tricked the UK public out of \u00a3800,000, according to the police. Jagged performance: Jaguar Land Rover suffered an 85% slump in sales in China last month as the coronavirus kept buyers indoors and most dealerships shut. The FTSE 100 has lost 3.1%, after hitting lows of 6,466 points \u2013 a whisker away from levels not seen since 2016 (when sterling\u2019s EU referendum plunge boosted UK shares). S&amp;P 500 futures are down by 2.2%, suggesting more pain is in store for Wall Street. Anglo American shares have dropped by 8.4% after a majority-owned subsidiary of the FTSE 100 miner said it would be unable to honour its contracts. Anglo American Platinum declared force majeure as it will be unable to process any materials for 80 days after a smelting plant was hit by an explosion. It cut its 2020 production outlook. It looks like it could be a white-knuckle ride for oil markets today as Russia and Opec bargain over who will shoulder the biggest burden in cutting crude production. Some interesting context: the increasing heft of the US oil industry has made Opec\u2019s plans much trickier. The US does not take part in the Opec negotiations. Shares in budget airline Norwegian have slumped by 25% on Friday as the coronavirus outbreak causes a big drop in demand. An analyst note from Pareto Securities raised concerns over whether Norwegian had enough cash to survive the disruption, which has caused the sector the world over to struggle. The airline may have to issue new shares to shore up its finances, Pareto said. Norwegian scrapped its earnings guidance yesterday and has cancelled flights. The global airline sector\u2019s market capitalisation has dropped by $40.6bn \u2013 a quarter of its value \u2013 in the last month alone, said Russ Mould, investment director at stocks platform AJ Bell. He said: Even before Covid-19 the industry had started to struggle, weighed down by its own optimistic capacity expansion and increased price competition. Flybe\u2019s collapse in the UK is just the latest in a long list of recent failures that also includes Thomas Cook and Monarch, as well as Denmark\u2019s Primera, Cyprus\u2019 Cobalt, France\u2019s XL Airways and Aigle, Iceland\u2019s Wow Air and Slovenia\u2019s Adria. Alitalia and Air India remain in terrible trouble. Ouch \u2013 Brent crude futures prices have now dropped by 4.6% to hit the lowest level since July 2017, at $47.02 per barrel. The oil-producing cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), has decided to cut production to push up prices, but Reuters reports that Russia is not playing ball, citing a \u201chigh-level Russian source\u201d. Russia is not part of the group, and it isn\u2019t intending to back a cut. That could derail the whole agreement, keeping up the oversupply. S&amp;P 500 futures indicate that US stock markets are going to drop by about 2.6% when they open. On foreign exchange markets, the US dollar is on its way to its worst week since 2016 thanks to expectations of more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The euro gained 0.7% on Friday against the US dollar, breaking through the $1.13 mark. Sterling gained 0.3% against the greenback to hover around $1.30 for the first time in almost a fortnight. The Japanese yen also benefited from the search for safe havens, gaining 1% against the dollar. Collapsing US bond yields and the promise of lowest interest rates from the Fed make the dollar much less attractive. Kit Juckes, chief global foreign exchange strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is looking ahead to the US non-farm payrolls later, which could add another element to the pot for investors trying to work out what\u2019s going on. The last non-farms reading showed that the US economy created 225,000 jobs during January. The February reading is expected to be relatively strong. Juckes said: Today\u2019s headline act is supposed to be the US jobs report. Consensus expects a 175k gain. Our economists forecast a 178k gain. The market is only going to care if we get a shocking number and even then, it\u2019s only prematurely weak data that the capacity to shock. Fraudsters have immediately latched on to coronavirus, with fake \u2018Center for Disease Control\u2019 emails and other scams already tricking the UK public out of \u00a3800,000, according to the police. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) this morning issued an urgent scam warning after identifying 21 cases of fraud involving coronavirus in February. Ten of the frauds involved desperate buyers of face masks, with one person paying \u00a315,000 for masks that were never delivered. Other frauds involve emails and texts purporting to be from research organisation\u2019s affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The NFIB said: They claim to be able to provide the recipient with a list of coronavirus infected people in their area. In order to access this information, the victim needs to click on a link, which leads to a malicious website, or is asked to make a payment in bitcoin. Individuals can report fraud or cybercrime to Action Fraud any time of the day or night using its online reporting tool at actionfraud.police.uk European banking shares have fallen by 4% to hit their lowest point since 2009 \u2013 when the sector was still feeling the effects of the global financial crisis. That\u2019s according to the Stoxx Europe 600 banks index. Oil prices are also taking a hammering this morning, with investors doubting whether Opec production cuts will be enough to sustain prices \u2013 given the big fall in demand caused by coronavirus disruption. The price of Brent crude futures (the North Sea oil benchmark) has fallen by 2.7% today to lows of $48.54 per barrel. If it falls below $48.40 it will be the lowest since summer 2017. West Texas Intermediate futures prices \u2013 North America\u2019s benchmark \u2013 have also lost 2.4%. The Guardian\u2019s Jillian Ambrose reported on the production cuts last night: The world\u2019s largest oil-producing nations plan to avert an oil market crash by cutting millions of barrels from their daily production, but traders fear the economic impact of Covid-19 could still drive global market prices to multi-year lows. Read more here: Back on markets\u2019 coronavirus reaction, the pivot out of riskier equities appears to be gaining pace. Losses on the Euro Stoxx 600 index are now 3.4%. The FTSE 100 has lost 3.1% \u2013 take a look at all of the fallers who have lost more than 5%. The City regulator has just published proposals to make big companies on the London Stock Exchange report their climate-related risks. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will require all commercial companies with a premium listing to either make climate-related disclosures in line with standards from the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) or explain why not. While the \u201ccomply or explain\u201d approach means some companies could refuse to outline their exposures to climate-related risks, it could increase scrutiny on companies such as fossil fuel producers. The FCA will consider consulting on extending this rule to a wider scope of companies, it said, in one of the last actions by outgoing chief executive Andrew Bailey. Bailey, who will take up the reins at the Bank of England in 10 days\u2019 time, said: Climate change presents a serious and wide-ranging threat to global economic prospects, society more broadly and our natural environment. The changes we propose will help to provide the transparency the market needs to be able to assess how well companies are adjusting to the risks of climate change. Improved disclosures will support better asset pricing and enable investors to make more informed choices about where to allocate their capital \u2013 which will ultimately support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Demand for gold \u2013 traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset alongside government debt \u2013 has also increased. The spot price for the yellow metal has risen by 0.9% today to hit a high of $1,687 per troy ounce. That\u2019s only a dollar below the $1,688 level hit on 24 February, which was the highest since the start of 2013. Here\u2019s the latest on efforts to stop the coronavirus spread around the world. Globally the number of confirmed cases is approaching 100,000, with more than 3,000 deaths. The Vatican City has reported its first case. An adviser to Iran\u2019s foreign minister has died of the disease. Iran has been the worst affected country outside of China. The Chinese province of Hubei has reported no new cases outside of its capital, Wuhan, for the first time since the outbreak began. You can follow all the updates on the global spread of the virus on the main coronavirus live blog: Yields are dropping as I type: the US 10-year just hit 0.695% and the UK 10-year 0.246%. And more record lows for the 10-year bond yields in the UK and the US. The US 10-year Treasury just hit 0.742% and the 10-year gilt hit 0.249%. Investors appear to be going all in on further interest rate cuts \u2013 which would make the returns offered by staid-but-stable bonds look more attractive. Whether they should be quite this attractive is, however, another matter. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: The bond market is scaring the raccoons out of the air ducts like crazy right now. Investors seeking shelter and betting on aggressive policy cuts have driven the hottest bond rally in years, if not ever. There could be further to run lower for yields, but the more investors rush to bonds to greater the risk of a snap back causing even more damage. The FTSE 100 has slipped a little more in the first 90 minutes on the London Stock Exchange: it\u2019s now down by 2.2%, with publishing and events company Informa the worst performer. At 6,560 points it\u2019s only 100 points above the lows hit at the end of last week. The mid-cap FTSE 250 (with a bigger domestic focus) has lost 2.7%. It\u2019s much the same across Europe. Germany\u2019s Dax is down by 2.3% and France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 2.5%. JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is recovering from emergency heart surgery, with his two deputies taking over his duties as he recuperates, the US bank has announced. The lender publicly released an internal memo confirming that the 63-year-old executive, who has led the US\u2019s biggest bank by assets for more than a decade, experienced a tear in his heart\u2019s main artery, which was caught early and treated successfully. The Guardian\u2019s Joanna Partridge has the full report here: British house prices rose by 2.8% in the year to February, slower than January but still stronger than before the general election in December, according to Halifax. The bank said that demand has remained steady, with house prices increasing by 0.3% in February \u2013 althoug it warned that the coronavirus outbreak could weigh on sentiment. Russell Galley, Halifax managing director, said: Much like we saw in January, the increases seen in February reflect the continued improvement of key market indicators. The sustained level of buyer and seller activity is strong compared to recent years, with positive employment conditions and a competitive mortgage market continuing to support demand. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, a forecaster, said: A stream of recent firmer data and surveys suggest that the housing market has changed up a gear after a lacklustre 2019 (with particular softness around the third quarter). Certainly there is compelling evidence that the housing market got a leg-up from increased optimism and reduced uncertainties following December\u2019s decisive election as well as greater near-term clarity on Brexit with the UK having left the EU on 31 January with a deal. Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s profits will be hit by the coronavirus outbreak, after an 85% fall in sales in China, its Indian owner Tata Motors has said. Britain\u2019s largest carmaker has already cut back production this month \u2013 although it insisted (in very strong terms) that factory shutdowns were not related to coronavirus. But those shutdowns will give it some leeway to respond to slower demand. China provides JLR with about a third of its profits, and overall earnings margins will be down by 1% at least, Tata said. Its statement said: The coronavirus has significantly impacted China sales with February retails down around 85% vs the prior year. The spread of the virus to other markets such as South Korea, Japan, and Italy will also impact sales in those markets. JLR said it has ensured the supply of most parts for the next two weeks, after flying in parts such as key fobs in suitcases to get around shortages. But it warned that things could change \u2013 particularly given the spread of the disease in other key countries for automotive suppliers. In the event of specific parts shortages, Jaguar Land Rover would ordinarily be able to still build cars and retrofit missing parts when available, however, we cannot rule out the risk that a shortage of a critical component could impact production at some point. From Bond to bonds: UK government debt has not been left out of the global rush for safe havens. The yield on the 10-year gilt fell to 0.28% \u2013 down from about 0.8% at the start of the year, before the coronavirus\u2019s outbreak became clear. Yields, which move inversely to prices, have plummeted as demand for safer bonds has soared. Perhaps the spread of the disease will see investors effectively paying to lend money to the government, with a negative yield? The release of the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, may have been delayed by the coronavirus outbreak, but Cineworld insists that it is not being squeezed too hard. The chain has not seen \u201cany material impact on our movie theatre admissions due to COVID-19\u201d, it said today in an unscheduled statement to the market. Following an increase in admissions in the first two months of the year against the same period in the previous year, we continue to see good levels of admissions in all our territories, despite the reported spread of COVID-19. Although the release of the new Bond movie has been postponed to November 2020 largely due to closure of cinemas in the Asian markets, the studios have advised us that in the countries in which we operate, they currently remain committed to their release schedule for the coming months and remainder of the year. However, the company did leave the door open to cost cuts and lower investment spending if the outbreak worsens. Looking across the FTSE 100 risers... there are none. But it\u2019s also striking that there are not any huge moves down either \u2013 the worst faller is Tui, leading the travel companies on their way down, but only by 4.6%. It\u2019s a proper broad selloff. Carnival, the cruise operator, has lost 3.8% (Carnival is the only company listed on both the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 \u2013 today\u2019s markets trivia). European stocks have followed their Asian counterparts back down \u2013 adding another big move to a dramatic fortnight on equity markets. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 1.8% in opening trades, France\u2019s Cac 40 has slumped by 2%, and shares in Italy have fallen by 2.5%. The Euro Stoxx index has lost 1.6% \u2013 with only two gainers across 600 companies. (With US non-farm payrolls data due later we could be set for yet another bumpy day.) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian shares have fallen further with the coronavirus outbreak showing no sign of abating in the Europe or the US. Japan\u2019s Topix index slumped by 2.9% and the Nikkei 225 lost 2.7%. The Shanghai Stock Exchange index fell by 1.2% and the CSI 300, which also tracks shares in Shenzhen, lost 1.6%. Australian shares on the ASX 200 lost 2.8%, and the Hang Seng index lost 2.4%. \u201cNo sign of risk appetite stabilising, as the reports of new coronavirus cases spread across Europe and North America, resulting in further event cancellations and profit warnings,\u201d said Ian Williams, economics and strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt. It came after US stocks last night took a tumble \u2013 on what will surely be remembered as one of the most tumultuous weeks on stock markets. Where is all that money going? The bond market. Investors are betting that the US Federal Reserve will step in with more stimulus \u2013 after their previous emergency cut. The yield on US 10-year Treasury bonds, the benchmark for global demand for bonds, has plumbed new depths during the outbreak \u2013 far beyond even the financial crisis or the market turmoil that followed the election of Donald Trump as US president. Yields move inversely to prices, so the steep fall indicates a global flight to safety by investors. Here\u2019s a chart, the yield on the US 10-year over two decades that illustrates that amazing run: A few days ago the idea of Treasury yields falling below 1% was astonishing to many investors. Today it hit 0.808%. Deutsche Bank macro strategist Jim Reid said: For bonds [...] it\u2019s just a straight line down in yields at the moment. Asset allocation specialists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 people who make exactly these kinds of decision on what to buy on a daily basis \u2013 suggest that Treasuries do indeed provide the best protection. But they also add that further losses could be limited, and they are raising exposure to Chinese equities: Policy makers have clearly entered the race, which should prevent \u2013 for now \u2013 an extended bear market on risk assets. Containment of the number of new cases has been impressive in mainland China, and we now expect a V-shaped recovery from the second quarter onwards there. The agenda 8:30am GMT: UK Halifax house prices (February) 1:30pm: GMT: US non-farm payrolls (February)",

Let\u2019s track back to last April when the Morrison government was mulling the grants at the centre of the \u201csports rorts\u201d scandal.</p> <p>Politics was hurtling towards a federal election that the Coalition (well, perhaps everyone apart from the prime minister himself) fully expected to lose. Believing there were five minutes left to live, the government went into hyperdrive. There was a rush of appointments and decisions \u2013 in the press gallery it felt like a volcano was erupting in our inboxes.</p> <p>My colleague Christopher Knaus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/11/one-in-five-appointed-to-government-bodies-in-last-fortnight-linked-to-coalition\">tracked some of this activity contemporaneously</a>, and found in the fortnight between 27 March and 11 April, the government announced 70 appointments to boards, statutory bodies and tribunals, and diplomatic postings. One in five people appointed to government bodies in that fortnight had links to the Liberal or National parties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/06/scott-morrison-refuses-to-take-questions-about-timing-of-changes-to-sports-grants\">Scott Morrison refuses to take questions about timing of changes to sports grants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So that\u2019s the time when the rubber was hitting the road on sports grants, round three. This is useful context to have in your mind: a government moving as fast as a retreating army, sprinkling explosive ordinance chaotically in its wake to impede the anticipated advance. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t the high-water mark of commonwealth decision making. Perhaps people were making decisions they didn\u2019t expect to have to defend, or explain.</p> <p>We can jump to the present now, or near enough. On Friday, Scott Morrison declined to take any questions on sports grants at his press conference. As well as that being a shocker, Morrison\u2019s avoidance of accountability is a great pity in a substantive sense, because it multiplies the number of questions without answers. <a href=\"http://www.bridgetmckenzie.com.au/Media/Media-Releases/ID/1265/Statement--Senate-Estimates\">A statement issued by Bridget McKenzie</a> on Thursday night opens brand new territory in this imbroglio, and things were already serious enough.</p> <p>Anyone watching can see sports \u201crorts\u201d is a gripping political story.

Did our government act lawfully?</p> <p>There are currently three tiers of legal uncertainty associated with this program. The first is constitutional. A leading legal academic<em><strong> </strong></em>has warned that the sports grants program <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/21/bridget-mckenzies-sports-grants-program-may-be-unconstitutional-expert-warns\">may be unconstitutional</a> because the federal government lacks power to hand out money to sports clubs,<em><strong> </strong></em>a view supported by other expert submissions.</p> <p>The second tier relates to whether the grants in this scheme were ever made with proper legal authority. This important question was raised by the Australian National Audit Office when it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/13/sports-rorts-almost-half-projects-funded-ineligible-audit-office-says\">excoriated the government\u2019s management of the program</a>. If you want the full box and dice of the ANAO\u2019s questioning, I went through this in some detail in a column at the end of January.</p> <p>If you lack the time for that detailed recap, all you really need to know is no one has yet produced evidence indicating the process was conducted lawfully.

Given this is still new information, let\u2019s step through it carefully.</p> <p>Bit of background first. We know, because the ANAO has told either a Senate inquiry or Senate estimates, the following things: McKenzie signed a brief detailing the successful grants (which were listed at attachments) on 4 April. Subsequent to that there was email traffic between McKenzie\u2019s office and Morrison\u2019s office, and between McKenzie\u2019s office and Sport Australia. This all happened on 10 April and 11 April \u2013 the day the parliament was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/apr/11/australian-election-campaign-2019-officially-under-way-politics-live\">prorogued for the 2019 election</a>. Caretaker conventions were in effect from 8.30am on 11 April.</p> <p>During this to and fro, one project came out of the spreadsheet and another came in at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office. Let\u2019s pause here long enough to absorb the fact that this evidence directly contradicts the many breezy statements from Morrison declaring McKenzie was the decision maker and his office just passed on \u201crepresentations\u201d \u2013 including statements to this effect made by the prime minister in parliament. Bit of a problem, that.</p> <p>Another set of changes was made before the final material was sent to Sport Australia at lunchtime on 11 April, with one project removed and nine added. The ANAO suggested McKenzie\u2019s office made those final changes. So three versions of the material went to Sport Australia on 11 April: one at 8.46am, one at 12.35pm, and the last at 12.43pm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/03/scott-morrison-wants-the-nation-to-trust-him-but-how-can-we-after-sports-rorts\">Scott Morrison wants the nation to trust him \u2013 but how can we after sports rorts? | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I won\u2019t divert us too much with outrage here, but this wrangling was going on at a time when official government business was supposed to have ceased, and Sport Australia was evidently perturbed enough to seek advice about whether this was OK in the caretaker period, when current governments are not supposed to bind future governments to major decisions.</p> <p>Now we arrive at McKenzie\u2019s statement on Thursday night.

      "bodyText": "Before we go forward, just for a minute, I want to look back. Let\u2019s track back to last April when the Morrison government was mulling the grants at the centre of the \u201csports rorts\u201d scandal. Politics was hurtling towards a federal election that the Coalition (well, perhaps everyone apart from the prime minister himself) fully expected to lose. Believing there were five minutes left to live, the government went into hyperdrive. There was a rush of appointments and decisions \u2013 in the press gallery it felt like a volcano was erupting in our inboxes. My colleague Christopher Knaus tracked some of this activity contemporaneously, and found in the fortnight between 27 March and 11 April, the government announced 70 appointments to boards, statutory bodies and tribunals, and diplomatic postings. One in five people appointed to government bodies in that fortnight had links to the Liberal or National parties. So that\u2019s the time when the rubber was hitting the road on sports grants, round three. This is useful context to have in your mind: a government moving as fast as a retreating army, sprinkling explosive ordinance chaotically in its wake to impede the anticipated advance. Perhaps this wasn\u2019t the high-water mark of commonwealth decision making. Perhaps people were making decisions they didn\u2019t expect to have to defend, or explain. We can jump to the present now, or near enough. On Friday, Scott Morrison declined to take any questions on sports grants at his press conference. As well as that being a shocker, Morrison\u2019s avoidance of accountability is a great pity in a substantive sense, because it multiplies the number of questions without answers. A statement issued by Bridget McKenzie on Thursday night opens brand new territory in this imbroglio, and things were already serious enough. Anyone watching can see sports \u201crorts\u201d is a gripping political story. There is pork barrelling, a gritted-teeth ministerial resignation, which in part triggered a major eruption in the National party, and a rolling effort by the prime minister to inoculate himself from the fallout of the government\u2019s failure to administer the program through the lens of public interest. But as well as the drama, there are questions of substance that remain comprehensively unanswered despite this mess spanning a couple of months. The question I\u2019ve been asking about sports grants since the end of January is a foundational one: when it comes to this expenditure, did our government act lawfully? Perhaps in the age of politics-as-reality television, in the Trump epoch, our collective expectations have now lowered to the point where these sorts of questions are now considered quaint. But for what it\u2019s worth, I reckon these questions remain the difference between order and chaos; the difference between inhabiting a world of facts and liberal democratic norms, and a universe where the benchmark for powerful people is not the national interest but whatever you can get away with. So let me repeat this because it\u2019s important, because it\u2019s a measure of things, and we still don\u2019t have an authoritative answer. Did our government act lawfully? There are currently three tiers of legal uncertainty associated with this program. The first is constitutional. A leading legal academic has warned that the sports grants program may be unconstitutional because the federal government lacks power to hand out money to sports clubs, a view supported by other expert submissions. The second tier relates to whether the grants in this scheme were ever made with proper legal authority. This important question was raised by the Australian National Audit Office when it excoriated the government\u2019s management of the program. If you want the full box and dice of the ANAO\u2019s questioning, I went through this in some detail in a column at the end of January. If you lack the time for that detailed recap, all you really need to know is no one has yet produced evidence indicating the process was conducted lawfully. Sports Australia, the agency at the centre of the maelstrom, has told a Senate inquiry it has legal advice from an eminent QC clearing it of exceeding authority, but the agency is yet to make that advice public. Now we\u2019ve reached the third tier of legal uncertainty, which are the new questions raised by the statement McKenzie posted on her website on Thursday night, just after parliament rose.

I\u2019ve spent much of my career as a journalist in the national political sphere thinking we don\u2019t really need an anti-corruption commission federally, for two reasons. The first was most of the political class I watched and interacted with seemed to respect \u2013 not all of the time, but most of the time \u2013 the self-regulatory norms and conventions of the vocation to the point where there were sanctions for transgressions. The second reason I was attentive, but sanguine, was media organisations possessed the institutional power to check the worst impulses of powerful people. Now, 23 years after I started as a reporter in Canberra, I question both of my previous beliefs, at a fundamental level. Our ecosystem is profoundly disrupted. Politicians are bolder, and we who watch them on behalf of voters are weaker institutionally. These deductions take me to the logical place.

She tells the audience almost nonchalantly: \u201cI lost my arm but I wouldn\u2019t change it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s this kind of line that explains why the cinema hosting a Q&amp;A session with one of the world\u2019s best-known shark attack survivors is filled to bursting. \u201cI had a sense of peace after the attack. Faith helped me through,\u201d she says as a notably young crowd looks on. \u201cAdult me is like: \u2018Whoa how did I do that?\u2019 It was a childlike faith.\u201d</p> <p>Seventeen years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/03/usa.garyyounge\">a 15ft tiger shark took the left arm of the surfing prodigy</a> at age 13, and people have wanted to know her story ever since. Her resilience, and successful return to competitive surfing just a few months later, have made her an idol to many. She has been on every chat show and in every teenage glossy magazine. She freely admits she appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show without knowing who Oprah Winfrey was.</p> <p>We are sitting on the sand at Avoca Beach in New South Wales, where a 30-year-old Hamilton has just been knocked out of the Central Coast Pro at an early stage, months after breaking her elbow while skateboarding. Not a good start to 2020, a year in which her main ambition is to make it back on to the Championship Tour, surfing\u2019s highest level. With her young family playing around her, she remains calm despite the setbacks, and we talk about her new film, Unstoppable, and the year everything changed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8VeLf5uHPs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E8VeLf5uHPs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Notably absent in the film is a fear of going back in the water, something she did within weeks of the attack. Was it ever a concern? \u201cYeah there was subtly that but \u2026 I think most normal surfers that aren\u2019t overly fearful, they don\u2019t paddle out every time with a deep fear that they\u2019re going to be bitten. Even though I have been attacked, my fear of losing surfing was greater than my fear of sharks.\u201d</p> <p>Unusually in a professional athlete as driven as Hamilton, she agrees she has had more impact as a survivor rather than as one of Hawaii\u2019s best surfers. \u201cOh most definitely,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out my life to have a great impact or anything but it is really beautiful to see all the good that\u2019s come from what seems like such an awful thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a6a6633e36ae0f6b1ae09e7b03784e3f47aaf6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6a6633e36ae0f6b1ae09e7b03784e3f47aaf6f/213_0_4069_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bethany Hamilton surfs Jaws in Hawaii\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bethany Hamilton surfs Jaws in Hawaii.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lieber Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of those good things is the new portrayal of her life. The plan was to make a punchy 10-minute action film to promote women\u2019s surfing.

She is quite frank about not being ready for motherhood, and director Aaron Lieber does not shy away from showing the many mountainous challenges Hamilton has faced, and the faith that helped her overcome them. So she seems better placed than most to understand why there is suffering in the world. \u201c[God] doesn\u2019t say that life\u2019s going to be easy peasy and perfect \u2026 to think that we are not going to have trouble sets ourselves up for mental struggles and the fact is we are all going to face hard times.

      "bodyText": "Bethany Hamilton has no regrets. She tells the audience almost nonchalantly: \u201cI lost my arm but I wouldn\u2019t change it.\u201d It\u2019s this kind of line that explains why the cinema hosting a Q&amp;A session with one of the world\u2019s best-known shark attack survivors is filled to bursting. \u201cI had a sense of peace after the attack. Faith helped me through,\u201d she says as a notably young crowd looks on. \u201cAdult me is like: \u2018Whoa how did I do that?\u2019 It was a childlike faith.\u201d Seventeen years ago, a 15ft tiger shark took the left arm of the surfing prodigy at age 13, and people have wanted to know her story ever since. Her resilience, and successful return to competitive surfing just a few months later, have made her an idol to many. She has been on every chat show and in every teenage glossy magazine. She freely admits she appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show without knowing who Oprah Winfrey was. We are sitting on the sand at Avoca Beach in New South Wales, where a 30-year-old Hamilton has just been knocked out of the Central Coast Pro at an early stage, months after breaking her elbow while skateboarding. Not a good start to 2020, a year in which her main ambition is to make it back on to the Championship Tour, surfing\u2019s highest level. With her young family playing around her, she remains calm despite the setbacks, and we talk about her new film, Unstoppable, and the year everything changed. Notably absent in the film is a fear of going back in the water, something she did within weeks of the attack. Was it ever a concern? \u201cYeah there was subtly that but \u2026 I think most normal surfers that aren\u2019t overly fearful, they don\u2019t paddle out every time with a deep fear that they\u2019re going to be bitten. Even though I have been attacked, my fear of losing surfing was greater than my fear of sharks.\u201d Unusually in a professional athlete as driven as Hamilton, she agrees she has had more impact as a survivor rather than as one of Hawaii\u2019s best surfers. \u201cOh most definitely,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out my life to have a great impact or anything but it is really beautiful to see all the good that\u2019s come from what seems like such an awful thing.\u201d One of those good things is the new portrayal of her life. The plan was to make a punchy 10-minute action film to promote women\u2019s surfing. Seven years later, the result is Unstoppable, a 100-minute documentary in which Hamilton tells her own story, right from the start. \u201cThe reason I made it was just to go surfing and push myself in the sport and hopefully push women\u2019s surfing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then just kind of along the way a lot of things have happened and the director was like, \u2018Can I please make a documentary?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Sure go for it as long as we have a strong say.\u2019 I think it turned out amazing and really captures my whole life thus far in a way that any other portrayals of my story haven\u2019t ... plus it\u2019s the real me.\u201d The project took on a new life, literally, when Hamilton became pregnant with her first child a year into filming. She is quite frank about not being ready for motherhood, and director Aaron Lieber does not shy away from showing the many mountainous challenges Hamilton has faced, and the faith that helped her overcome them. So she seems better placed than most to understand why there is suffering in the world. \u201c[God] doesn\u2019t say that life\u2019s going to be easy peasy and perfect \u2026 to think that we are not going to have trouble sets ourselves up for mental struggles and the fact is we are all going to face hard times. When I lost my arm I was just thankful to be alive and that propelled me to have a more positive mindset.\u201d Her determination to avoid getting mired in anger or self-pity had a ripple effect, and set the tone for the rest of her family, too. \u201cMy dad was really angry when I lost my arm but eventually he got over that and saw that I was still just eager for life,\u201d she says. \u201cHe clung on to the purpose of \u2018Wow if my daughter thinks she can surf then I think she can, too, and I\u2019m going to support her\u2019.\u201d That backing, from her parents, two brothers, and wider surf family, got her into the water weeks after the 2003 attack, and inspired her father, Tom, to fashion a special handle for her surfboard to help her duck dive under oncoming waves. Hamilton prides herself on putting out an \u201chonest version of me\u201d in Unstoppable, and there is little that appears confected in it. There may not be much need when you are paddling one-armed into 60ft waves at Hawaiian big-wave spot Jaws. The genesis of it as an action movie is clear, with visits to Bali and Tahiti to experiment with aerials and riding barrelling, heavy waves. Yet, even with Hamilton\u2019s evident skill and influence, she admits finding it hard when there is too much testosterone in the water \u2013 a reflection on how far surfing has yet to go when it comes to equality in the water. \u201cEven this week it\u2019s been such a struggle just to catch waves in the line-up with all the guys. And there\u2019s a lot of times I\u2019ll paddle out in the line-up and it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s just kind of a disconnect in that sense of [being] a gentleman,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s sad because it also forces the women to put up this [makes angry face] just to get a wave. And I will literally just cut off guys because I\u2019ve waited my turn and they didn\u2019t have a sense of decency.\u201d This kind of openness about everyday struggles forms another part of Hamilton\u2019s enduring public appeal and burgeoning career as life coach and motivational figure (her \u201cnext big passion project\u201d), particularly to teenage girls. She is surprisingly relatable, despite an existence lived by so few. She still encounters people offering to help after taking one look at her (\u201cI\u2019ve learned to say yes.

We give children endless opportunities to express preferences but deny our parents the same right.

Unwilling to consider future frailty and wary of strangers, she agreed reluctantly.</p> <p>The most frustrating setback related to her desire to have a non-slip vinyl floor in the bathroom, instead of ceramic tiles, dictated by her entirely reasonable fear of falling and knowledge of the stats: most falls occur in bathrooms where hard surfaces make them potentially more severe.</p> <p>It turns out that there are compliance standards for flooring installation. Maddeningly, these vary from state to state. Although it is used in hospitals, the non-slip vinyl my mother wanted could not be installed in her home. </p> <p>We moved out for the build. When we moved back in, she expressed surprise at how the plans translated into reality.</p> <p>\u201cOooh look, I\u2019m cantilevered,\u201d she exclaimed, amazed the the gravity defying engineering of the bathroom. \u201cWon\u2019t it collapse?\u201d she asked, and avoided that end of the shower stall for days.</p> <p>As soon as she buckled herself in, it became clear that the stair chair was a triumph: safe, quiet, smooth and precision-engineered, it wrapped around the staircase with sinuous discretion, a far cheaper and less intrusive option than a lift. As she rises through the air on her mobile throne, Mum waves regally.</p> <p>After a few days mastering the many washing and drying functions on the remote, Mum pronounced the Japanese toilet \u201cdelightful\u201d.</p> <p>Some things have not worked out as planned: the kitchenette is virtually unused, except for the microwave if we are away. We had lowered the benchtops to accommodate a wheelchair but, while unable to stand at the stove, Mum is not ready to accept the alternative. Her intention of cooking for herself has not become a reality; she glides downstairs for every meal. We have regained some privacy, but not as much as we\u2019d hoped: although she has her own TV upstairs, she prefers to watch in our company. The juliet balcony with sweeping ocean and escarpment views from her bedroom remains unused; perhaps it\u2019s a little too high for someone whose balance is precarious.</p> <p>Our architect estimates that the customised modifications to door widths for wheelchair access, and the additional work to make powerpoints and light switches more accessible, and the security intercom and safety rails have added an extra 15% to the project\u2019s budget. A small price to pay for peace of mind.</p> <p>Within months, Mum felt at home. We drew satisfaction from being within reach when needed, while reclaiming our spare room to welcome friends to stay. Even the sceptics are impressed. All of them want a ride on the stair chair.</p>",

The most frustrating setback related to her desire to have a non-slip vinyl floor in the bathroom, instead of ceramic tiles, dictated by her entirely reasonable fear of falling and knowledge of the stats: most falls occur in bathrooms where hard surfaces make them potentially more severe. It turns out that there are compliance standards for flooring installation. Maddeningly, these vary from state to state. Although it is used in hospitals, the non-slip vinyl my mother wanted could not be installed in her home. We moved out for the build. When we moved back in, she expressed surprise at how the plans translated into reality. \u201cOooh look, I\u2019m cantilevered,\u201d she exclaimed, amazed the the gravity defying engineering of the bathroom. \u201cWon\u2019t it collapse?\u201d she asked, and avoided that end of the shower stall for days. As soon as she buckled herself in, it became clear that the stair chair was a triumph: safe, quiet, smooth and precision-engineered, it wrapped around the staircase with sinuous discretion, a far cheaper and less intrusive option than a lift. As she rises through the air on her mobile throne, Mum waves regally. After a few days mastering the many washing and drying functions on the remote, Mum pronounced the Japanese toilet \u201cdelightful\u201d. Some things have not worked out as planned: the kitchenette is virtually unused, except for the microwave if we are away. We had lowered the benchtops to accommodate a wheelchair but, while unable to stand at the stove, Mum is not ready to accept the alternative. Her intention of cooking for herself has not become a reality; she glides downstairs for every meal. We have regained some privacy, but not as much as we\u2019d hoped: although she has her own TV upstairs, she prefers to watch in our company. The juliet balcony with sweeping ocean and escarpment views from her bedroom remains unused; perhaps it\u2019s a little too high for someone whose balance is precarious. Our architect estimates that the customised modifications to door widths for wheelchair access, and the additional work to make powerpoints and light switches more accessible, and the security intercom and safety rails have added an extra 15% to the project\u2019s budget. A small price to pay for peace of mind. Within months, Mum felt at home. We drew satisfaction from being within reach when needed, while reclaiming our spare room to welcome friends to stay. Even the sceptics are impressed. All of them want a ride on the stair chair.",

And it said it would install fast-charging equipment for electric vehicles at 12 sites this year. The government also announced a review of what would need to be done to reach net zero emissions before 2050. The Liberal administration in question was not the Morrison government in Canberra, where the climate policy debate remains focused on the cost of acting above all else, but the Tasmanian state government in Hobart. Peter Gutwein, a long-time treasurer who became Tasmanian premier in January after the surprise resignation of Will Hodgman, used his first \u201cstate of the state\u201d address to set out what, by national standards, were a striking series of commitments that could put the state at the forefront of the shift to an emissions-free world. Gutwein, who has retained responsibility for treasury and also taken on the climate change portfolio, said it was time for the state to \u201cshowcase our innovation to the world and stake our claim as a renewables powerhouse\u201d. \u201cTasmania has the opportunity to ensure that the most compelling 21st century competitive advantage that industry and consumers want \u2013 renewable energy \u2013 underpins our economy,\u201d he said.

Measuring just eight metres long and three metres wide, Dall\u2019s tiny home has become something of an inspiration for the movement, with his fight to retain its status potentially having lasting ramifications around the country. Dall, originally from Scotland, has been engaged in a high-profile legal battle with government and the local council for three years, after the council classified his tiny house a building, making it subject to the same building codes and consents as standard homes. Dall appealed to the ministry of business, innovation and finance (MBIE) but it backed the council\u2019s decision that the \u201chouse\u201d must comply with the building code or face being demolished. Determined not to lose his first-ever permanent home, built with his own hands, Dall took his fight to the Christchurch district court at a cost of around NZ$10,000 and last week Judge Callaghan ruled in his favour.

Working families are also now feeling the bite, with some forced to sleep in cars, tents and shipping containers despite being in full-time employment. The Green party MP Gareth Hughes said the rate of council evictions from tiny houses was rising as they increased in popularity, and evicting anyone in the midst of a housing crisis made no sense.

      "bodyText": "German airline Lufthansa is planning to slash half of its flights and is considering grounding its entire fleet of A380 superjumbos, as the fallout from the coronavirus continues to hit the global air travel industry. The company, which includes Swiss International Air Lines and Austrian Airlines, said it was considering temporarily grounding its entire fleet of 14 Airbus A380 superjumbos in Frankfurt and Munich. It will cut up to half its flights from April in response to a drastic decline in air travel bookings as the number of coronavirus cases around the world grows daily. \u201cIn recent days, the Lufthansa Group has been exposed to drastic declines in bookings and numerous flight cancellations due to the spread of the Covid-19 virus. All traffic areas are now affected,\u201d it said in a statement. The latest drastic cutback comes just two days after the company said it would ground about 20% of its fleet. Earlier on Friday shares in rival airline Norwegian fell by more than a quarter amid investor fears over the airline\u2019s resilience amid the coronavirus outbreak. The selloff came as analysts warned that the airline\u2019s cash reserves were slim. On Thursday, shares had already tumbled as the budget carrier withdrew its profits forecasts from last month and cancelled 22 transatlantic flights in the spring due to reduced passenger demand. The company said it had already reduced capacity by 15% this year, and had relatively low exposure to Italy and the business travel market, both of which have been hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak. However, its share price has now dropped by more than 70% in less than a month. Norwegian is the third-largest low-cost carrier in Europe behind easyJet and Ryanair, and a pioneer of low-cost, long-haul flights. While several analysts have viewed Norwegian as undervalued after it appeared to have got on to a firmer financial footing, on Friday morning the Oslo-based Pareto Securities cut its rating on the stock from buy to hold. Analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said: \u201cThe situation it is likely to wipe out [Norwegian\u2019s] stellar start of the year and a prolonged crisis might require equity refill as the cash buffer is slim.\u201d Airlines worldwide have been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with many implementing emergency cost-cutting measures and cutting back their flight schedules. The owners of Flybe said the coronavirus was the final blow that pushed Europe\u2019s largest regional airline into administration this week. According to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), the impact of the coronavirus could cost passenger airlines up to $113bn (\u00a387bn) in lost revenues this year. While Norwegian\u2019s share price has dropped more than most, an average of 25% has been wiped off airline\u2019s market value since the start of the outbreak in China.",

There has been nothing subtle about their modus operandi for this championship and setting out to hassle and suffocate Wales at source will be the primary aim. Ireland could not get any prolonged foothold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/23/england-ireland-six-nations-rugby-match-report\" title=\"\">at HQ a fortnight ago</a> and there is a fair chance of history repeating itself.</p> \n<p>Or at least there should be if England, as they insist they will, turn up in earnest. This season that has not always been a given. This is a side who found themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/02/france-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">17-0 down at half-time in Paris</a> only to be 17-0 up at the same juncture against Ireland a mere three weeks later. If they are not winning the collisions, it makes a massive difference to their potency. Take away the tries they have collected following opportunistic kicks ahead \u2013 two against Ireland, one against France and, indirectly, Ellis Genge\u2019s in Scotland after Stuart Hogg got in a tangle under his own posts \u2013 and England have scored only two others all tournament, one courtesy of a piece of Jonny May magic in Paris and the other a close-range drive from Luke Cowan-Dickie against the Irish. Perhaps significantly, neither of those was scored prior to the final quarter. If England do not start well, it does not absolutely scupper them but it undoubtedly galvanises the opposition.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0137204347a6a59e4d86838bd751a2c61b38db58\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0137204347a6a59e4d86838bd751a2c61b38db58/0_0_5156_3474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Jones and Owen Farrell plot Wales\u2019s downfall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Jones and Owen Farrell plot Wales\u2019s downfall.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Wales to stand any realistic chance, therefore, they will need to be rather more than competitive at the breakdown, where Josh Navidi\u2019s inclusion is significant, stand resolutely firm in the scrums and enjoy supremacy in the aerial battle, the lineout included. With Liam Williams back to complement Leigh Halfpenny and the patched-up Dan Biggar, England are anticipating plenty of hoisted high balls, while it is equally certain the visitors will look to get beneath the skins of the English half-backs, George Ford and Ben Youngs.</p> \n<p>On the front foot Ford and Youngs, in common with most half-backs, are past masters at dictating a game\u2019s tempo and shape.

      "bodyText": "If ever there was a weekend for rugby to supply an escape from the cares of the world, this is it. This might not have been the most uplifting of Six Nations championships but against a backdrop of grim coronavirus bulletins and widespread flooding, Saturday\u2019s match between England and Wales at Twickenham is a hugely welcome distraction. With next week\u2019s final-round fixture in Italy already postponed and England\u2019s summer tour to Japan in July not entirely certain to proceed, it also represents the last opportunity for now for Eddie Jones\u2019s team to banish further the disappointment of their World Cup final defeat. Win well and they could yet sneak the title away from under French noses at a later date. Underperform and the charge of flattering only to deceive may once more have to be revived. This particular date, either way, has been circled in red for over a year. John Mitchell, the defence coach, freely admits he and his players have not forgotten the game in Cardiff 12 months ago when Wales came from 10-3 down at half-time to win 21-13 and put themselves on track for a raucously acclaimed grand slam. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how some games niggle away at you,\u201d said Mitchell, after England\u2019s final training run in bright south-west London sunshine. \u201cThat\u2019s one that niggles away in your stomach and your head. It\u2019s a good thing. If you\u2019re a competitor \u2013 and there are plenty inside our dressing room \u2013 I\u2019m sure it will be a motivation.\u201d On this occasion the immediate priority will be to try to ignore swirling off-field events beyond their control. Even the most ardent campaigners for \u2018clean\u2019 sport never envisaged an 82,000-capacity stadium packed to the rafters with hand sanitisers. The point has not yet been reached where both teams walk out wearing face masks for the anthems but should the captains opt to touch health-conscious elbows with the referee, Ben O\u2019Keeffe, prior to kick-off rather than shake hands it really will set a Twickenham precedent. Once the whistle goes, though, England will be deliberately seeking as much contact with as many red jerseys as possible. There has been nothing subtle about their modus operandi for this championship and setting out to hassle and suffocate Wales at source will be the primary aim. Ireland could not get any prolonged foothold at HQ a fortnight ago and there is a fair chance of history repeating itself. Or at least there should be if England, as they insist they will, turn up in earnest. This season that has not always been a given. This is a side who found themselves 17-0 down at half-time in Paris only to be 17-0 up at the same juncture against Ireland a mere three weeks later. If they are not winning the collisions, it makes a massive difference to their potency. Take away the tries they have collected following opportunistic kicks ahead \u2013 two against Ireland, one against France and, indirectly, Ellis Genge\u2019s in Scotland after Stuart Hogg got in a tangle under his own posts \u2013 and England have scored only two others all tournament, one courtesy of a piece of Jonny May magic in Paris and the other a close-range drive from Luke Cowan-Dickie against the Irish. Perhaps significantly, neither of those was scored prior to the final quarter. If England do not start well, it does not absolutely scupper them but it undoubtedly galvanises the opposition. For Wales to stand any realistic chance, therefore, they will need to be rather more than competitive at the breakdown, where Josh Navidi\u2019s inclusion is significant, stand resolutely firm in the scrums and enjoy supremacy in the aerial battle, the lineout included. With Liam Williams back to complement Leigh Halfpenny and the patched-up Dan Biggar, England are anticipating plenty of hoisted high balls, while it is equally certain the visitors will look to get beneath the skins of the English half-backs, George Ford and Ben Youngs. On the front foot Ford and Youngs, in common with most half-backs, are past masters at dictating a game\u2019s tempo and shape. Remove that vital platform and, as Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray found a fortnight ago, it becomes an infinitely harder game. Wales could certainly do with an appropriately flaky Youngs performance on his 99th England appearance as they try to avoid suffering three consecutive Six Nations defeats for the first time since 2007. The visitors, furthermore, have not won a Six Nations game at Twickenham since 2012, although they were more than a touch unfortunate to lose 12-6 two years ago, saved by Sam Underhill\u2019s last-ditch tackle and a dubious TMO decision which denied Gareth Anscombe a potential try. They were well beaten 33-19, however, in a World Cup warm-up game last August and England\u2019s 2015 World Cup pool defeat increasingly belongs to a different era. Mitchell and the Wales coach, Wayne Pivac, have also been in opposing camps in a former life, having played against each other for Waikato and North Harbour respectively in what the former remembers as \u201cquite spiteful\u201d contests back in the day. There is a sense this time, though, that Wales will be doing mighty well to become only the third team after Ireland and New Zealand to win at Twickenham in the Jones era. There is also a Triple Crown up for grabs, something modern England squads have contrived to secure only twice \u2013 aside from their 2016 grand slam \u2013 since 2003. \u201cWe feel the guys are totally ready for what is to come,\u201d insisted Mitchell. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hugely contestable, highly chaotic and physical.

At any other time, Biden\u2019s age, manner and CV could have doomed his candidacy. But with a plague looming, Americans might just view a flawed man of undoubted empathy and with an intimate knowledge of loss, a man who\u2019s spent a lifetime inside the US government, as something like a remedy. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The City watchdog may soon demand Britain\u2019s top-tier companies come clean on their effect on the environment and disclose the financial risks they face due to the climate crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set out proposals which would call on all companies listed on the UK\u2019s premium stock markets \u2013 including most companies listed on the FTSE \u2013 to fall in line with tough new climate standards. The plans are expected to draw heavily on the climate recommendations set out by the by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a voluntary framework for companies that is considered a global gold standard for climate disclosure. The watchdog opened the plans to consultation on Friday, and hopes to draw up final rules before the end of the year. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the FCA, who is due to take over from Mark Carney as Bank of England governor later this month, said the global climate crisis presents \u201ca serious and wide-ranging threat to global economic prospects, society more broadly and our natural environment\u201d. \u201cThe changes we propose will help to provide the transparency the market needs to be able to assess how well companies are adjusting to the risks of climate change. Improved disclosures will support better asset pricing and enable investors to make more informed choices about where to allocate their capital \u2013 which will ultimately support the transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d he said. The TCFD framework was spearheaded by Carney during his time as Bank of England governor, and chaired by US businessman Michael Bloomberg, to create a standard set of climate disclosure rules to help create a sustainable financial system. Carney warned late last year that major corporations have two years to agree rules for reporting climate risks before global regulators devise their own and make them compulsory. The FCA\u2019s proposals still leave wriggle room for companies to continue to withhold climate-risk information by calling for them to comply with the rules or to \u201cexplain why not\u201d. But most publicly listed companies are expected to comply due to rising pressure to prove their sustainability credentials. Earlier this week the Investment Association, which represents 250 members with \u00a37.7tn under management, set a three-year deadline for companies to explain in their annual reports how they plan to measure and manage the threat of a climate catastrophe. The UK\u2019s accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, has also launched a major review into whether companies and their auditors are adequately reflecting the financial risks of the climate crisis in their accounts. Ben Stansfield, an environmental lawyer at Gowling WLG, said it was a \u201cvery significant step\u201d from the FCA and underlined the green agenda established by Carney. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the sense of \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 around climate non-disclosure continues \u2013 there is a climate emergency and business who don\u2019t respond to it will very likely struggle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that there are activists and investors alike who read and take note of climate change disclosures and we know they will take action if climate risks and environmental impacts are not properly described. I do hope that best practice will infiltrate the culture of the UK\u2019s top companies and drive long-lasting change and direction where climate change is concerned,\u201d Stansfield added.",

      "bodyText": "The government has asked supermarkets to increase availability of home delivery services to help people in self-isolation with coronavirus get access to food and other essentials. Top supermarket executives held a call with George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs on Friday afternoon. The teleconference came after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed he had been in touch with supermarkets and he was \u201cconfident\u201d food supplies would not run out. However, several supermarket executives told the Guardian that until Friday there had been no communication from the government about managing potential shortages during the outbreak. During the call Eustice is understood to have asked if the industry had the capacity to deal with increased home deliveries to cope with self-isolation cases, with the government advising people who have returned from badly affected coronavirus areas to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. The supermarkets said they had already seen a surge in online orders as some shoppers avoid public spaces. One executive said their existing delivery slots were full and the industry have be able to expand capacity by up to 20% but was unlikely to be able to do more. Prior to the call, industry chiefs held a summit between themselves earlier this week at which they discussed working together if food supplies did become limited because of factory shutdowns, for example. On Friday, Eustice is also understood to have asked supermarket bosses for details on how they were coping with a surge in demand for essentials such as toilet roll, hand sanitiser and pasta. One industry insider said: \u201cThe government has been a bit slow off the mark but they are getting into gear. There is a string of meetings starting today.\u201d More than one executive said their main fear was that panic-driven stockpiling would lead to shortages. One executive said that, while there were likely to be short-term gaps on shelves where some products were in high demand, there was plenty of capacity to cope. \u201cIt has been a much bigger week than normal for early March but it\u2019s not as big as Easter or Christmas,\u201d he said.

I suspect that Joe Marler would have retired had England won the World Cup but this could be the last time we see him in an England shirt at Twickenham. I think you can put Ben Youngs and George Kruis in that category too and if this does mark the end of an era for this England squad then they will not be lacking in motivation. There is so much uncertainty swirling around at the moment \u2013 will the tournament ever be finished? \u2013 but for those guys, shutting out the external noise will be much easier. Rugby is a very emotive sport and there will be a lot of emotion for those guys.</p> \n<p>On top of that, England need to put on a show at Twickenham. Since the World Cup this is only their third outing there \u2013 an opening training session, the Ireland match and this game. There is going to be a celebration at Twickenham before the match, more than 750 kids from 73 schools who are new to rugby this year from all different backgrounds and from all over the country. It brings a welcome note of positivity and the challenge for England is are they able to end their season by producing another massively physical performance as they did against Ireland? They weren\u2019t able to at the World Cup so there will be a determination to put that right.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/05/unfinished-six-nations-rugby-union-headache-rfu\">Unfinished symphony a major headache for rugby union's money men</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Composure</strong></h2> \n<p>England need to beware of Wales\u2019s ability to ruffle feathers. They did it last year, in particular with Alun Wyn Jones, but Ken Owens and Ross Moriarty are also protagonists. I do believe however, that England are improving that side of their game and are becoming more streetwise.</p> \n<p>I look back to the incident with Maro Itoje against James Ryan and CJ Stander in the Ireland match. There are many different lenses from which to view an incident like that, but from a rugby point of view, that was one England player taking two Ireland players out of the game for five or six phases. There are plenty of ways to get under opponents\u2019 skin, you can do it at the ruck, with your running lines but someone like Maro gets his energy by going after every scrum-half and targeting every box-kick, by dismantling rucks and taking players out.</p> \n<p>When he is doing that kind of thing England are at their best, they harass and they hurry and they force their opponents to make mistakes. Wales can be very good at it too and we have two proud, passionate nations going at it. There will be plenty of flashpoints and whoever can keep cool will be hugely significant.</p>",

I think you can put Ben Youngs and George Kruis in that category too and if this does mark the end of an era for this England squad then they will not be lacking in motivation. There is so much uncertainty swirling around at the moment \u2013 will the tournament ever be finished? \u2013 but for those guys, shutting out the external noise will be much easier. Rugby is a very emotive sport and there will be a lot of emotion for those guys. On top of that, England need to put on a show at Twickenham. Since the World Cup this is only their third outing there \u2013 an opening training session, the Ireland match and this game. There is going to be a celebration at Twickenham before the match, more than 750 kids from 73 schools who are new to rugby this year from all different backgrounds and from all over the country. It brings a welcome note of positivity and the challenge for England is are they able to end their season by producing another massively physical performance as they did against Ireland? They weren\u2019t able to at the World Cup so there will be a determination to put that right. Composure England need to beware of Wales\u2019s ability to ruffle feathers. They did it last year, in particular with Alun Wyn Jones, but Ken Owens and Ross Moriarty are also protagonists. I do believe however, that England are improving that side of their game and are becoming more streetwise. I look back to the incident with Maro Itoje against James Ryan and CJ Stander in the Ireland match. There are many different lenses from which to view an incident like that, but from a rugby point of view, that was one England player taking two Ireland players out of the game for five or six phases. There are plenty of ways to get under opponents\u2019 skin, you can do it at the ruck, with your running lines but someone like Maro gets his energy by going after every scrum-half and targeting every box-kick, by dismantling rucks and taking players out. When he is doing that kind of thing England are at their best, they harass and they hurry and they force their opponents to make mistakes. Wales can be very good at it too and we have two proud, passionate nations going at it. There will be plenty of flashpoints and whoever can keep cool will be hugely significant.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

      "bodyText": "The EU has told migrants in Turkey that Europe\u2019s doors are closedas Greek and Turkish police fired teargas at their shared border amid growing tensions over the plight of Syria\u2019s refugees. In a blunt message, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cDon\u2019t go to the border. The border is not open. If someone tells you that you can go because the border is open \u2026 that is not true. \u201cAvoid the situation in which you could be in danger \u2026 Avoid moving to a closed door,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t tell people that they can go because it\u2019s not true.\u201d Borrell was speaking after a hastily convened meeting of EU foreign ministers in Zagreb, where the bloc restated its criticism of \u201cTurkey\u2019s use of migratory pressure for political purposes\u201d. Tensions flared last weekend when the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, declared he was \u201copening the doors\u201d because Turkey could no longer cope with refugees fleeing Idlib province, the last remaining rebel stronghold in Syria. Thousands of refugees and migrants have since attempted to reach Greece via its land or sea borders. Greek riot police have been using teargas and water cannon to repel people trying to get into the country, while Turkish police have been firing volleys of teargas towards Greece in return. EU ministers met hours after a ceasefire in Idlib came into force, following an agreement in Moscow between Erdo\u011fan and Vladimir Putin on Thursday. Russia and Turkey, on rival sides in Syria\u2019s war, have agreed to preserve some territorial gains made by Russian-backed Syrian forces during the three-month offensive in Idlib, while Turkey keeps a foothold in the region. On Friday skies in the province were free of warplanes for the first time in three months as the ceasefire appeared to be holding, although clashes before dawn in the south killed six regime soldiers and nine fighters from the Uighur-dominated jihadist group the Turkistan Islamic party, a war monitor said. Erdo\u011fan said on Friday that Ankara would not abandon its 12 observation posts in Idlib, despite the fact that at least four are now encircled by regime forces and allied militias. What will happen to the posts, which were supposed to monitor a previously agreed 2018 de-escalation line, was notably absent from Thursday\u2019s deal. \u201cThe observation points are very, very important for us. They will be preserved as they were in the past,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. On Friday, the EU announced \u20ac60m (\u00a352m) in humanitarian aid for civilians in north-west Syria, while warning of the complexities of distributing food, medical supplies and tents in the war-torn region. But EU-Turkey relations are likely to remain in the deep freeze, with no sign of any additional European funds for Turkey, which is hosting nearly 4 million refugees, mostly from Syria. EU ministers did not agree to add to the \u20ac6bn promised in 2016 under the terms of a migration deal with Ankara. The EU has allocated \u20ac4.5bn to Syrian refugee aid in Turkey, but only \u20ac3.4bn has been spent. On his return from Moscow, Erdo\u011fan signalled there was no change in policy. \u201cOur gates are open. The refugees will go as far as they can,\u201d Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency quoted him as saying. Turkey has also announced it is sending 1,000 special operations police to prevent Greek authorities from returning people who manage to cross, raising the prospect of vulnerable people trapped indefinitely in a no-man\u2019s land. Meanwhile, the EU is under fire from human-rights NGOs for accepting Greece\u2019s decision to suspend asylum applications for one month. In an open letter to EU leaders and the Greek prime minister Kyri\u00e1kos Mitsot\u00e1kis, 85 charities, including Action Aid and Amnesty International, said they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about how authorities were handling new arrivals to Greece. Greece\u2019s decision to keep its borders shut to asylum seekers is widely supported among EU leaders, who fear a repeat of the 2015 migration crisis, when more than 1 million people arrived in Europe after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, signalled that the doors were open to them. Austria\u2019s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, warned EU states against taking in migrants gathered on the border. \u201cIf we do, soon it will be hundreds of thousands and later maybe millions,\u201d he told Funke, a German media group. Kurz also said that if Greece did not secure its borders, he was prepared to close Austria\u2019s border. As well as dispatching elite troops to the region, Mitsot\u00e1kis\u2019 centre-right government also decided to extend the existing 12.5km razor-wire border fence, equipped with sonar systems and thermal sensors, by another 40km, officials said. New sections will be placed in areas believed to be \u201cvulnerable\u201d to passage along the Evros river separating the two countries. Growing numbers of people have been bussed to the Evros region by Turkish authorities. Despite international criticism of Turkey exploiting migrants for its own political ends, Ankara continued to insist that the land border - unlike the Aegean isles - had never been part of the landmark accord reached in 2016 between Turkey and the EU to stem migratory flows. Indicative of the tensions between the two longstanding regional foes, Erdo\u011fan ruled out meeting Mitsotakis, repeating unproven claims that Greek police had killed at least five migrants in clashes at the land border and were deliberating sinking boatsheaded for the islands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the same place with him,\u201d he was quoted as telling reporters on his return flight from Moscow. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the same photograph as him.\u201d Athens has repeatedly denounced the accusations as \u201cfake news\u201d, saying the movement of migrants was part of a \u201cmass, organised and coordinated operation\u201d to destabilise Greece. Meanwhile, thousands of Greek-Americans have signed a letter to the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, telling him that Erdo\u011fan \u201cis weaponizing migrants who are not even from Syria in order to blackmail Europe. These are not the actions of an ally, a humanitarian, or a responsible global actor. These are the actions of a human trafficker or a terrorist.\u201d",

The university said it strongly disapproved of the decision to disinvite her, tweeting that it is \u201ccommitted to freedom of speech and opposes no-platforming\u201d. The row over the decision \u2013 which drew in students, politicians and Rudd\u2019s family on Friday \u2013 is the latest incident in the long-running discussion about freedom of speech at universities.

Rudd resigned as home secretary in 2018 after heavy pressure over her role in the Windrush scandal. After news of the cancellation broke, she tweeted her frustration at the decision, saying it was \u201cbadly judged and rude of some students last night at Oxford to decide to \u2018no platform\u2019 me 30 mins before an event \u2026 to encourage young women into politics\u201d.

The radio presenter James O\u2019Brien tweeted: \u201cI think Amber Rudd was treated pretty shabbily, but I wish I could think of a word to describe people more exercised by her experience than they were by people of colour being wrongly deported from the only home they\u2019d ever known.\u201d And the political commentator Ash Sarkar said: \u201cI actually don\u2019t think there\u2019s a moral duty to no platform Amber Rudd the same as a fascist. But after presiding over the wrongful deportations of mums, dads, grandparents &amp; loved ones, you don\u2019t get to complain about not being allowed somewhere you feel you have a right to be.\u201d",

Prior to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lewis-capaldi\">Lewis Capaldi</a>\u2019s performance at Glasgow\u2019s SSE Hydro on Thursday night, there were pockets of calm as fans undertook breathwork classes to learn how to stay centred in a crowded space.</p> <p>Capaldi, the UK\u2019s bestselling musician of 2019, has rolled out Livelive, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/18/lewis-capaldi-arena-tour-help-fans-anxiety-escape-room\">pioneering mental health initiative</a> for gig-goers attending his arena tour. After the 23-year-old Scottish star openly discussed his own history of panic attacks in interviews, he received dozens of messages from fans thanking him for speaking publicly.</p> <p>This influx of support and shared experiences of panic and anxiety convinced Capaldi and his team that coming up with such an initiative for his biggest shows to date was essential, said Livelive co-founder Jack Williamson. \u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Thank you \u2013 I feel less alone.\u2019 Or, \u2018I have social anxiety and that\u2019s stopped me from coming to your shows.\u2019 One in 10 people have anxiety, and we saw that there was an opportunity for us to provide that support for people.\u201d</p> <p>Livelive offers an email support service so fans can inquire about facilities prior to a performance.

      "bodyText": "The corridors at arena gigs are usually abuzz with pre-show anticipation and thronging bar queues. Prior to Lewis Capaldi\u2019s performance at Glasgow\u2019s SSE Hydro on Thursday night, there were pockets of calm as fans undertook breathwork classes to learn how to stay centred in a crowded space. Capaldi, the UK\u2019s bestselling musician of 2019, has rolled out Livelive, a pioneering mental health initiative for gig-goers attending his arena tour. After the 23-year-old Scottish star openly discussed his own history of panic attacks in interviews, he received dozens of messages from fans thanking him for speaking publicly. This influx of support and shared experiences of panic and anxiety convinced Capaldi and his team that coming up with such an initiative for his biggest shows to date was essential, said Livelive co-founder Jack Williamson. \u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Thank you \u2013 I feel less alone.\u2019 Or, \u2018I have social anxiety and that\u2019s stopped me from coming to your shows.\u2019 One in 10 people have anxiety, and we saw that there was an opportunity for us to provide that support for people.\u201d Livelive offers an email support service so fans can inquire about facilities prior to a performance. One hour before doors open, Capaldi posts meeting points for a gig-buddy system on Instagram, designed for solo gig-goers to find company. A help desk in the foyer promotes awareness and points people towards longer-term resources. Behind this, a quiet space is set aside for anyone feeling overwhelmed. Medical staff and trained mental health professionals are on hand to provide extra care. Fan Kevin, 23, said: \u201cLewis is such a legend for doing it, honestly. It\u2019s something that society needs and he\u2019s at the forefront.\u201d Inspired by the work of Attitude Is Everything, a charity that improves accessibility for deaf and disabled people at live performances, Williamson says the team behind Livelive want mental health support at gigs to become an industry standard. While their research indicates that Livelive is the first initiative of its kind at this scale, it builds on work being carried out across the arts to make venues more accessible, from relaxed performances in the theatre to dementia-friendly cinema screenings. This weekend\u2019s BBC 6 Music festival in Camden, London, features a designated relaxation space with quiet music and beanbags. The logistics behind Livelive are complex. Undertaking background checks, safeguarding and policy work is time-consuming and expensive, although Livelive works with volunteers from mental health organisations local to each performance. At a smaller show in Manchester earlier in the week they collaborated with 42nd Street, a mental health charity that offered support to young people following the Manchester arena bombing. In Glasgow some volunteers came from local social enterprise LifeLink. An extra 50p has been added to ticket prices to fund the scheme.

The collapse of talks between the world\u2019s largest oil producing nations has stoked investor fears that the coronavirus could trigger the most severe oil market shock in history by throttling demand from heavy industry and airlines. The benchmark price of oil plummeted by over 7% to $46.31 a barrel due to economic fears ignited by the coronavirus, the lowest price for Brent crude since July 2017. Opec hoped to deepen their production cuts by 1.5m barrels of oil a day with the help of allies outside the cartel, led by Russia, to avert a price crash. But the so-called Opec+ group ended three days of crunch talks in Vienna without a deal after Russia balked at the plans for the deepest oil production cuts since the 2008 global financial crisis. Opec had planned to cut output by 1m barrels a day but was relying on Russia to lead cuts of 500,000 barrels a day in return. A statement from the petro-nations said energy ministers would continue talks to stabilise the market, but stopped short of assurances that any production cuts would be put in place. The Russian energy minister, Alexander Novak, told reporters that it meant members could now pump as much oil as they like from 1 April this year. Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, the head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, said the unexpected development \u201cfalls far below our worst-case scenario\u201d.

      "body": "<p>In 1983 ministers of the revolutionary Sandinista government lined up on the tarmac to welcome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/02/guardianobituaries.catholicism\" title=\"\">Pope John Paul II</a> on his first visit to Nicaragua. Moments later, TV cameras showed the pontiff wagging a finger at the kneeling Ernesto Cardenal, priest and minister of culture, admonishing him for mixing religion and politics.</p> <p>But for Cardenal, who has died aged 95, there was no distinction between the two. His beliefs as a Roman Catholic growing up in Central America in the 1940s and 50s led him to seek social justice in a country that had for many years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/nicaraguans-jubilant-after-somoza-resignation-archive-1979\" title=\"\">suffered under the dynastic rule of the Somoza family</a>. His faith also meant he could not avoid political responsibility if it was thrust upon him.</p> <p>The bridge between these two sides of Cardenal\u2019s life was his poetry. As he said in a 1970 interview when asked about his writing: \u201cI have expressed one reality, which is political, economic, social, religious and mystical all at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>It was Cardenal\u2019s poetic vocation that first showed itself. Born in the provincial city of Granada in western Nicaragua, he spent his childhood in Le\u00f3n, the other university city in the country. As a youth he began writing love poems, heavily influenced by the Chilean poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/pablo-neruda\" title=\"\">Pablo Neruda</a>. From 1943 to 1947 he studied abroad, at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City. While there, in 1946 he brought out his first volume of poems, La Ciudad Deshabitada (The Uninhabited City). In the same year, his anthology of contemporary Nicaraguan poetry was published in Spain. He also helped start a venture to publish cheap editions of classic texts.</p> <p>Cardenal spent the next two years at Columbia University in New York City, where, among other work, he wrote the long poem Raleigh, in which, for the first time, he explored the shared history of the peoples of the American continent before and after its conquest by Europeans.</p> <p>By the time of his return to Nicaragua in 1950, Cardenal had founded a new poetic movement, <em>exteriorismo</em>. This, in its choice of images from the everyday world, showed that he was decisively on the side of those writers who rejected \u201cpure\u201d poetry and wanted their work to have a social dimension. Part of his literary output at this time came in the form of aphorisms.</p> <p>Many of them called for revolt against the Somoza dynasty, landing Cardenal in jail for a short period in 1952. His commitment to action as well as literature led to his participation in the failed April 1954 uprising against the dictatorship, which marked him deeply and permanently.</p> <p>In 1956 Cardenal experienced his religious conversion. \u201cGod simply showed himself to me as love,\u201d was how he explained it. In May 1957 he became a novice at the Trappist monastery of Our Lady of Gethsemani in Kentucky, in the US, under the guidance of the poet and philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/22/my-hero-thomas-merton-nicola-barker\" title=\"\">Thomas Merton</a>. His life there is reflected in the collection of poems Gethsemani, Ky, published in 1960. The stern Trappist regime took its toll on Cardenal\u2019s health, however, so that after two years he moved on to a Benedictine monastery in Colombia. He was ordained in 1962. His major book of poems from these years is Zero-Hour, published in Mexico in 1960, as were his Epigramas the following year.</p> <p>Cardenal returned to Nicaragua as a priest, and then embarked on what in many ways was his most enduring achievement: founding a religious community among the peasant farmers and fishermen of Solentiname on the island of Mancarr\u00f3n in Lake Nicaragua. The community was established in 1966, and, as well as literacy and poetry workshops, soon became famous for its naive paintings and tapestries.</p> <p>In 1970 Cardenal underwent what he saw as another conversion: a three-month stay in revolutionary Cuba convinced him that Marxism offered the best way forward for social justice.

      "bodyText": "In 1983 ministers of the revolutionary Sandinista government lined up on the tarmac to welcome Pope John Paul II on his first visit to Nicaragua. Moments later, TV cameras showed the pontiff wagging a finger at the kneeling Ernesto Cardenal, priest and minister of culture, admonishing him for mixing religion and politics. But for Cardenal, who has died aged 95, there was no distinction between the two. His beliefs as a Roman Catholic growing up in Central America in the 1940s and 50s led him to seek social justice in a country that had for many years suffered under the dynastic rule of the Somoza family. His faith also meant he could not avoid political responsibility if it was thrust upon him. The bridge between these two sides of Cardenal\u2019s life was his poetry. As he said in a 1970 interview when asked about his writing: \u201cI have expressed one reality, which is political, economic, social, religious and mystical all at the same time.\u201d It was Cardenal\u2019s poetic vocation that first showed itself. Born in the provincial city of Granada in western Nicaragua, he spent his childhood in Le\u00f3n, the other university city in the country. As a youth he began writing love poems, heavily influenced by the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. From 1943 to 1947 he studied abroad, at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City. While there, in 1946 he brought out his first volume of poems, La Ciudad Deshabitada (The Uninhabited City). In the same year, his anthology of contemporary Nicaraguan poetry was published in Spain. He also helped start a venture to publish cheap editions of classic texts. Cardenal spent the next two years at Columbia University in New York City, where, among other work, he wrote the long poem Raleigh, in which, for the first time, he explored the shared history of the peoples of the American continent before and after its conquest by Europeans. By the time of his return to Nicaragua in 1950, Cardenal had founded a new poetic movement, exteriorismo. This, in its choice of images from the everyday world, showed that he was decisively on the side of those writers who rejected \u201cpure\u201d poetry and wanted their work to have a social dimension. Part of his literary output at this time came in the form of aphorisms. Many of them called for revolt against the Somoza dynasty, landing Cardenal in jail for a short period in 1952. His commitment to action as well as literature led to his participation in the failed April 1954 uprising against the dictatorship, which marked him deeply and permanently. In 1956 Cardenal experienced his religious conversion. \u201cGod simply showed himself to me as love,\u201d was how he explained it. In May 1957 he became a novice at the Trappist monastery of Our Lady of Gethsemani in Kentucky, in the US, under the guidance of the poet and philosopher Thomas Merton. His life there is reflected in the collection of poems Gethsemani, Ky, published in 1960. The stern Trappist regime took its toll on Cardenal\u2019s health, however, so that after two years he moved on to a Benedictine monastery in Colombia. He was ordained in 1962. His major book of poems from these years is Zero-Hour, published in Mexico in 1960, as were his Epigramas the following year. Cardenal returned to Nicaragua as a priest, and then embarked on what in many ways was his most enduring achievement: founding a religious community among the peasant farmers and fishermen of Solentiname on the island of Mancarr\u00f3n in Lake Nicaragua. The community was established in 1966, and, as well as literacy and poetry workshops, soon became famous for its naive paintings and tapestries. In 1970 Cardenal underwent what he saw as another conversion: a three-month stay in revolutionary Cuba convinced him that Marxism offered the best way forward for social justice. He saw no contradiction between this and the kind of primitive Christian community he was developing in Solentiname, even producing a liberation theology version of the New Testament: El Evangelio en Solentiname (The Gospel in Solentiname). His 1960s poetry appeared in collections such as Oraci\u00f3n por Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn Monroe and Other Poems, 1975), in which he used collage, multiple voices and other modernist techniques to convey his message. In 1977, following an attack on a national guard barracks in the nearby town of San Carlos, the settlement at Solentiname was razed to the ground in reprisal. Cardenal himself was forced to flee into exile in Costa Rica, where he became one of the Group of Twelve \u2013 a dozen core members of the Frente Sandinista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (FSLN) coordinating the Sandinistas\u2019 international efforts. He returned in triumph to Nicaragua in July 1979 when the FSLN toppled Anastasio Somoza from power, and was immediately appointed minister of culture, with headquarters in Somoza\u2019s former mansion. Again he saw no contradiction between his political work \u2013 which included a publishing venture and the creation of poetry workshops everywhere from coffee plantations to army units \u2013 and his religious duties. The pope and traditionalists in the Roman Catholic church saw things differently, however, and in 1984 he was suspended from the priesthood. The Sandinista government\u2019s attempts to alleviate poverty, distribute land and bring radical change to all levels of one of the poorest countries in Latin America quickly brought it up against the US president Ronald Reagan. He financed the rightwing Contra rebels, who opposed the Sandinista government and soon stifled the gains of the revolution in a bloody civil war.

Weakened in recent years by illness, he nevertheless published two new collections of poetry: As\u00ed en la Tierra Como en el Cielo (On Earth As in Heaven, 2018) and Hijos de las Estrellas (Children of the Stars, 2019). Most gratifyingly for Cardenal, in February 2019 Pope Francis lifted the ban on him practising as a priest, declaring in a personal letter to him that he was \u201cabsolved of all canonical censure\u201d. The community Cardenal created at Solentiname continues to prosper. The members produce paintings of the lake, its birds and other wildlife, and pursue the vision of a utopia in this world to which Cardenal dedicated his life.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Stung by criticism of its handling of the outbreak, Tehran has pointed to WHO assessments that have not challenged the government figures. Health officials said the new figures may reflect the availability of more accurate testing kits.</p> \n<p>In two further signs of rising concern about the situation in Iran, Christoph Hamelmann, the WHO country director, told senior overseas diplomats in Tehran that funding was urgently needed for a \u201crapid upscaling\u201d of laboratory and clinical components, and Saudi Arabia called on citizens to declare visits to Iran in the past 14 days. Members of the kingdom\u2019s Shia minority tend to keep their visits to Iran secret because of the bitter rivalry between the two countries.</p> \n<p>But at a briefing on Friday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s director general, praised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a> for \u201cswitching on\u201d to the outbreak and for taking an \u201call-of-government approach\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tedros said the epidemic was continuing to spread, adding: \u201cWe are continuing to recommend that all countries make containment their highest priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in the Middle East, 12 new cases were reported among workers on a cruise ship in Egypt.

      "bodyText": "The total number of coronavirus cases confirmed around the world passed 100,000 on Friday as Iran reported a sharp rise in cases and threatened to use force to stop people travelling between cities. Tehran\u2019s announcement came as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d and Donald Trump signed a $8.3bn emergency spending bill to deal with the virus, despite insisting that it \u201cwill go away\u201d.

Speaking at a televised press conference on Friday, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s health ministry said the authorities had confirmed 4,747 cases of the virus, a rise of 1,234 on the day before. While he did not elaborate on the threat to use force, the spokesman acknowledged that the virus was present in all of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces. The threat may be aimed at stopping people from using closed schools and universities as an excuse to go to the Caspian Sea and other holiday spots in the run-up to the Persian new year, which falls on 21 March. Semi-official news agencies in Iran posted images of long lines of traffic of people trying to reach the coast from Tehran on Friday despite authorities earlier telling people to remain in their cities. Checkpoints on roads in Mazandaran and Gilan provinces were being operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in perhaps the most visible intervention by the state yet. There also appeared to be checks for those entering or leaving the holy city of Qom. Friday prayers and football matches have already been cancelled but public trust in the authorities\u2019 capacity to deal with the virus had been undermined by the government\u2019s sluggish and complacent initial response to the outbreak, and by the state\u2019s secrecy over the killing of hundreds of street protesters in November. Stung by criticism of its handling of the outbreak, Tehran has pointed to WHO assessments that have not challenged the government figures. Health officials said the new figures may reflect the availability of more accurate testing kits. In two further signs of rising concern about the situation in Iran, Christoph Hamelmann, the WHO country director, told senior overseas diplomats in Tehran that funding was urgently needed for a \u201crapid upscaling\u201d of laboratory and clinical components, and Saudi Arabia called on citizens to declare visits to Iran in the past 14 days.

Tedros said the epidemic was continuing to spread, adding: \u201cWe are continuing to recommend that all countries make containment their highest priority.\u201d Elsewhere in the Middle East, 12 new cases were reported among workers on a cruise ship in Egypt. A tourist who travelled on the same ship sailing between Luxor and Aswan tested positive for the virus on her return to Taiwan a week ago.

Passengers on a large cruise ship off the California coast were instructed to stay in their cabins on Friday as they awaited test results that could determine whether the virus was circulating among the more than 3,500 people aboard. A military helicopter crew lowered test kits onto the Grand Princess by rope and later retrieved them for analysis at a lab as the vessel lay at sea off San Francisco, under orders to keep its distance from shore. Authorities undertook the testing after a passenger on a previous voyage of the ship died of the coronavirus and at least four others became infected. \u201cThe ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,\u201d the Califorinia governor, Gavin Newsom, said. In Asia, a diplomatic row erupted between Japan and South Korea after Tokyo said it would quarantine all passengers arriving from the country, which has the highest number of cases outside China. From Saturday, anyone arriving in Japan from South Korea will be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated sites, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Thursday. Seoul described the move as \u201cunreasonable, excessive and extremely regrettable\u201d, accusing Japan of failing to address its own outbreak properly, and threatening retaliatory measures. The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have insisted the Games will open as planned on 24 July, but speculation is growing that they will have to be cancelled. Meanwhile, schools in parts of China were set to reopen as the central province of Hubei \u2013 excluding the provincial capital Wuhan \u2013 reported no new cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours for the first time since the outbreak began last year. While Hubei reported no new cases for a full day, Wuhan, the centre of the epidemic, said it had confirmed 126 new cases of the virus on Thursday.

The UK can show the world that hitting net zero is eminently possible, and is more than just a slogan.\u201d</p> <p>Local government is also urging the chancellor to deliver a green budget for Cop26. A group of councils and local government organisations wrote to the chancellor on Friday to say that councils are \u201cuniquely well placed to help the government meet its carbon emissions reduction targets\u201d.</p> <p>Some groups are calling for the government to devote at least 5% of spending to the low carbon effort.</p> <p>\u201cMassive investment in our abundant renewable power potential, public transport and a nationwide energy efficiency programme would put the UK at the forefront of the green industrial revolution \u2013 and show genuine leadership ahead of this year\u2019s crucial climate summit in Glasgow,\u201d said Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth.</p> <p>In a sign of the growing impact of the coronavirus on Cop26, the UN announced planned meetings in Bonn in March and April would be cancelled. However the main preparatory Cop26 meeting scheduled for Bonn in June is so far unaffected.</p> <p>Some also fear that the need for urgent measures on the coronavirus will distract attention from the green agenda.</p> <p>\u201cThe need to avoid recession as a result of coronavirus cannot be made an excuse for dodging vital decisions on de-carbonising the economy,\u201d said Spiers. \u201cInvesting in warmer homes, infrastructure for electric vehicles, the renewable energy industry and natural flood defences will boost the economy, not least in poorer regions, as well as tackling the climate and wider environmental emergency.\u201d</p>",

Green groups and experts say much more is needed, including strategies on fixing Britain\u2019s heat-leaking homes, boosting renewables, halting the rapid rise in emissions from transport, restoring the natural environment and tackling waste. \u201cAs the first major opportunity for the Johnson government to show it is serious on delivering net zero, the budget is a huge moment ahead of Cop26,\u201d said Jonathan Marshall, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. \u201cThe minimum expected is to lead by example and convince other nations to submit ambitious pledges, amplifying domestic action on to the global stage. The UK can show the world that hitting net zero is eminently possible, and is more than just a slogan.\u201d Local government is also urging the chancellor to deliver a green budget for Cop26. A group of councils and local government organisations wrote to the chancellor on Friday to say that councils are \u201cuniquely well placed to help the government meet its carbon emissions reduction targets\u201d. Some groups are calling for the government to devote at least 5% of spending to the low carbon effort. \u201cMassive investment in our abundant renewable power potential, public transport and a nationwide energy efficiency programme would put the UK at the forefront of the green industrial revolution \u2013 and show genuine leadership ahead of this year\u2019s crucial climate summit in Glasgow,\u201d said Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth. In a sign of the growing impact of the coronavirus on Cop26, the UN announced planned meetings in Bonn in March and April would be cancelled. However the main preparatory Cop26 meeting scheduled for Bonn in June is so far unaffected. Some also fear that the need for urgent measures on the coronavirus will distract attention from the green agenda. \u201cThe need to avoid recession as a result of coronavirus cannot be made an excuse for dodging vital decisions on de-carbonising the economy,\u201d said Spiers. \u201cInvesting in warmer homes, infrastructure for electric vehicles, the renewable energy industry and natural flood defences will boost the economy, not least in poorer regions, as well as tackling the climate and wider environmental emergency.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll wrap things up, then. Thanks for joining us today, here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s column: Jonny remains out for Wolves ahead of Brighton game. Jonny is unavailable for Wolves ahead of the visit of Brighton. The wing-back remains sidelined after suffering an ankle injury against Norwich last month. Midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White will also miss out after suffering his own ankle injury playing for the under-23s but it is not thought to be serious. Brighton boss Graham Potter reported no fresh selection concerns following last weekend\u2019s home defeat by rivals Crystal Palace. Midfielder Alexis Mac Allister is now training with the first-team squad again following his recall from a loan spell at Boca Juniors in Argentina. Colombian Jose Izquierdo remains unavailable as he continues to recovery from a knee problem. David Moyes and Eddie Howe defend Eric Dier\u2019s fit of midweek pique. As Eric Dier waits to hear what punishment will be handed down to him by the FA following his unsuccessful bid to confront an abusive fan after climbing into the lower tier of White Hart Lane\u2019s West Stand following Tottenham\u2019s FA Cup exit to Norwich, David Moyes has spoken out in his defence. \u201cFor Eric to do what he has done, it must have been required and needed,\u201d said West Ham\u2019s manager. \u201cIn many ways I admire him and like it. I like how he stands up for his family, for himself, and you know we all get criticism and we have to take it in different ways. \u201cThere have been many events recently where they haven\u2019t taken it well but footballers and football managers have to get it regularly. I know Eric well as he was with me at Everton, he is a great boy. Really good professional from a really good sporting family and background who understands all the issues in sport.\u201d Eddie Howe said that, while Dier\u2019s post-match reaction was unfortunate and regrettable, the behaviour of some football fans needs to be subjected to more scrutiny. \u201cIt is very easy to focus on the reaction of the player, and I don\u2019t think anybody wants to see players, coaches or anybody confronting supporters in that way,\u201d the Bournemouth boss said. \u201cBut the world of football needs to look at what is said and what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. It is almost anything that is said from the terraces: \u2018Oh, that is just football banter, that is the world of football\u2019, but I don\u2019t think it should be like that. \u201cI think it is an opportunity to look at this and maybe review what is acceptable and what is not, highlighting it for everybody who goes to games.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s investigation of the incident is on hold until Metropolitan Police finish their own enquiries, while the Football Association will also wait to see the outcome before acting. Blackburn Rovers taking no risks regarding coronavirus. Blackburn Rovers have issued a statement saying they will be obeying the EFL diktat banning pre-match \u201cFair Play\u201d handshakes, but are going further in their efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In addition to the Government advice, Rovers have opted to implement additional precautions at Ewood Park, as well as the club\u2019s Senior Training Centre and Academy \u2013 and we have advised our players and coaching staff not to shake hands, sign autographs or pose for photos with supporters before or after games \u2013 in order to help mitigate the risk of the virus spreading further,\u201d they say. \u201cWe apologise for any inconvenience caused, but hope that supporters understand the reasons behind these measures being taken. Additionally, any supporter who has recently returned from an affected country should seek professional medical advice before travelling to any upcoming Rovers fixtures.\u201d Harry Maguire is \u201ctouch and go\u201d to feature in Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby. Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says centre-back Harry Maguire may not be ready to face Manchester City on Sunday. The United captain missed Thursday\u2019s FA Cup win at Derby after rolling his ankle in training on the eve of the game and will be assessed ahead of the match. Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James have not trained this week with knocks so will also need checking over. Marcus Rashford (back) and Paul Pogba (ankle) remain out. Kevin De Bruyne is doubtful for City after falling awkwardly on his shoulder in the latter stages of the Carabao Cup final last weekend and will be assessed. Winger Leroy Sane continues to make progress in his recovery from the knee injury that has sidelined him since August but the trip to Old Trafford comes too soon for the German. Defender Aymeric Laporte is still missing with a hamstring problem. Ederson will return in goal after sitting out the past two domestic cup games. Neil Lennon fields inevitable questions about the coronavirus. The Celtic boss has described the prospect of playing games behind closed doors as \u201cnot ideal\u201d but accepts the broader picture of fixtures being fulfilled. Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster has warned an outbreak of the virus at even one club could make finishing the season \u201cvery difficult\u201d. As of Friday morning, 11 people had tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland, with the UK figure standing at 163. The possibility of matches taking place at empty stadiums was flagged up as the football authorities consider what options might be available. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal but they have had to do it in Italy,\u201d said Lennon. \u201cI don\u2019t know what measures are taken elsewhere but we\u2019ll have to take a view on that if and when that situation arises. It\u2019s not ideal. I don\u2019t know the financial situations of other clubs but I would say it would be very detrimental to the financial well-being. \u201cI think we are maybe getting a little bit too far ahead of ourselves at the minute and we will have to take it week by week. Yes, we want to play the games and obviously we want to play them in front of full houses, that\u2019s what football is all about. Behind closed doors isn\u2019t ideal and, like I say, the club will guide me on how to guide the players and staff on that.\u201d Bar\u00e7a coach Quique Seti\u00e9n echoed Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp widely-shared response to a request for his opinion on how football will deal with coronavirus. Klopp won plaudits after carpeting the journalist who asked the question, asking how the words of those with no specialist medical knowledge were of any value during a health crisis. Seti\u00e9n said: \u201cI think he gave an extraordinary answer. The reality is that I have dedicated my life to football and so has he. I don\u2019t know what value my opinion has when I know nothing about this situation. \u201cThere are much more competent people out there who can talk about this issue, it\u2019s as if people want to know everything but I don\u2019t understand these questions. I guess people feel they have to ask something.\u201d Well that\u2019s this liveblog of football manager responses to questions about coronavirus told. Eesh. Probably as well that Barry\u2019s returned to take the reins back here. Daniel Farke this week enjoyed back-to-back wins for the first time this season, at home to high-flying Leicester and away in the Cup for the spot-kick success at Spurs. Speaking as he prepares his side to face fellow promoted side Sheffield United, he said: \u201cSuccess is no coincidence. Even when the odds are against you there is no reason to give up. We will keep going and try to make something extraordinary.\u201d \u201cWe are realistic and know we are bottom of the league. We have to earn the right to play here next season, so we are not carried away. I don\u2019t want to stop the feelgood factor we have, but I don\u2019t see any danger of us being over confident or losing the ground beneath our feet.\u201d Speaking of the derby, this from Jamie Jackson has just landed \u2026 Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City will on Sunday face an \u201cincredibly aggressive\u201d Manchester United enjoying their best moment of the season. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team are unbeaten in nine matches, a best run for a year. The trip to Old Trafford will be City\u2019s fourth meeting with their crosstown rivals this term, having lost two of the previous three. \u201cWhen I saw the last games they were incredibly aggressive and in Old Trafford that will happen,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIn some games they defend against us, but what I saw in the last games \u2013 not just against us but against every team in the league \u2013 is they were aggressive. At Goodison Park [in Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw against Everton] they played a good game \u2013 and in others.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has been harrumphing at the fixture list. He\u2019s unhappy that his side had to play in the Cup last night and then strap up their aching bones for the derby on Sunday, while rivals City got an extra days\u2019 rest. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s that help we get from the FA again, the extra 24 hours that they\u2019ve had \u2026 I cannot believe there\u2019s a derby on Sunday and we\u2019ve got to play on Thursday night. What\u2019s the point in that? That doesn\u2019t level the playing field. \u201cIt was the same when we beat them last time to be fair [on 7 December], we played [the previous] Wednesday, they played Tuesday. Them 24 hours, they\u2019re important so we\u2019ve got to be good at recovering now.\u201d Jamie Vardy is closing on a return for Leicester in Monday night\u2019s match against Aston Villa. Having missed the defeat to Norwich and Wednesday FA Cup win over Birmingham, the forward \u201clooked very good in training and he\u2019s still on track for Monday\u201d, according to Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers added: \u201cHe\u2019s a very important player for the club and has been for a number of years, particularly since I arrived here. It\u2019s very important he\u2019s available for us for this final part of the season.\u201d Full-back Ben Chilwell is more of a doubt, however, with the club monitoring \u201ca hamstring twinge\u201d. Roy Hodgson has been talking about his one-year contract extension (see 11.09), and said securing his backroom colleagues\u2019 future at Crystal Palace was the \u201ccrucial factor\u201d in re-signing. He said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased. We talked about it for quite a long time \u2026 It was more a case of making sure everyone around me is going to be looked after as well, and receive new contracts, because you don\u2019t work in isolation at a football club. You\u2019re very dependent upon the people you\u2019re working with, and I happen to think we have a very, very good team who work with the players and prepare the games. \u201cThat was a crucial factor for me. People can\u2019t give you assurances and guarantees, but everyone at the club \u2013 Steve Parish and the American owners \u2013 we\u2019re all pretty much aware of the fact it would be nice to have some investment in the team and to strengthen in certain areas. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be trying to do.\u201d John McGinn is closing on a return for Aston Villa after suffering a fractured ankle late last year. The midfielder\u2019s fine early-season performances caught the eye but in his absence Villa have won only two of nine games in the league and now find themselves second from bottom. His manager Dean Smith said: \u201cHe\u2019s getting to where we want him to be and had a CT Scan today to make sure there\u2019s a full union of the fracture. He trained with us, we\u2019ve not had him training in contact sessions yet, he\u2019s been involved in possession and shape work. He feels really good which is the important thing. He\u2019ll be pushing me for Chelsea [on 14 March], that\u2019s for sure. \u201cOnce he gets on that training ground he\u2019ll move quickly and he\u2019s certainly progressing quickly now. Obviously, there will be a lot of pressure put on him because of the pressure on him before his injury, but we have to make sure he\u2019s right when he actually comes back.\u201d West Ham\u2019s manager has responded to Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin\u2019s suggestion that the League Cup be scrapped with an alternative. David Moyes said: \u201cI\u2019ve always thought we should have included Scotland. I think it could do with a revamp, maybe there\u2019s a way that then a certain amount of Premier League teams wouldn\u2019t enter. \u201cI understand the fixture pile-up and there are an awful lot of games for the top players \u2026 a lot who will be playing in the Euros and just off the back of playing long seasons, Saturday-Wednesday, and are then expected to start again in the Premier League with only two or three weeks\u2019 break, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct. The players are going to have no time off at all. \u201cIt\u2019s in need of some way of being revamped. Call it the British Cup. A couple of teams from Northern Ireland, maybe two of the Welsh League clubs.\u201d Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s full story on Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeping gah \u2026 \u201cUnfortunately Ali is out,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHe had a little incident in training before the Chelsea game. We all thought it was nothing and it was clear he would not play anyway; the plan was he was on the bench. \u201cThere, we thought: \u2018Come on, we don\u2019t have to take any risks\u2019 so left him out of the squad. [There was a] scan the next day and they found something so now he is out. It is a muscle, slight, in the hip region. A small muscle.\u201d Asked to confirm the length of the goalkeeper\u2019s absence, the Liverpool manager said: \u201cNext week no, that means Atl\u00e9tico. I don\u2019t want to say no [to the Everton game] but I don\u2019t know if he will be available. He is not available for tomorrow and then the next week. We have to judge the situation anew. I would say after the international break 100%. Whatever we can get before that we will see.\u201d More on Chelsea\u2019s injuries. Willian feels Mateo Kovacic\u2019s achilles pain and requires a late fitness test. Jorginho starts a two-match league suspension after racking up 10 yellows this season, while N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 still has adductor ouch and Tammy Abraham\u2019s ankle knack continues. Lampard said: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been spoken about that much, but we\u2019ve had probably the worst injury list of certainly the top group of the table I think, lots of numbers injured, important players injured, Kant\u00e9, Loftus-Cheek etc.\u201d However Lampard added that Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Pulisic played in an \u201cin-house game\u201d at Chelsea\u2019s training ground earlier today: \u201cIt was great to see Christian get some minutes, he\u2019s still short of match fitness, but it\u2019s the first time the injury\u2019s gone up to a level to get him on a big pitch in a relatively competitive match, so it\u2019s a big step forward hopefully. Ruben played half of that game himself, and is trying to find match fitness.\u201d Dominic Calvert-Lewin is just a pen, paper and photographer away from committing more of his life to Everton, says Carlo Ancelotti. The club this week nailed down defender Mason Holgate on a five-year deal, and the Italian said: \u201cHolgate is going to be the future of this club. It\u2019s important for him and for us to renew the contract, to have stability here with this player. \u201cWe are close to Dominic Calvert-Lewin also and I hope he\u2019s going to sign soon. The idea for the future is really clear for us.\u201d Pep Guardiola says derby rivals Manchester United are \u201cgetting better\u201d under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r \u2026 \u201cThe players follow him \u2013 the commitment they have \u2013 and it\u2019s getting better,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now maybe is the best moment in the season there \u2026 I always have a great opinion and a good respect for Man United.\u201d For Covid-19 corner, he offered: \u201cWe try to do our normal life and when the authorities, the club, the politicians or the doctors go to say what you\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to do [it].\u201d Our first few match previews are in for tomorrow\u2019s matches \u2026 Frank Lampard has been asked about coronavirus things, and how it could affect how Chelsea approach the rest of the season, starting with Everton on Sunday \u2026 \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t affect anything in terms of preparation \u2013 you would take on the opposition in front of you. Obviously it would affect the atmosphere, clearly. It obviously takes a lot away from the game when you don\u2019t have fans in the stadium. There are some things that are more important, and if that\u2019s the path that\u2019s chosen by the authorities then you would go with that.\u201d Lampard is injury-hit, with up to nine players out, after Callum Hudson-Odoi suffered a recurrence of his hamstring twang on his return to full training. Mateo Kovacic is also sidelined with an achilles problem. Afternoon all. Just emptied a tin of Vim over Mr Glendenning\u2019s workstation, but straight off the bat there\u2019s this just in from Spurs, in follow-up to this from earlier \u2026 Dier will play against Burnley tomorrow. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, when asked if the versatile midfielder would feature, said: \u201cOf course, the only thing that matters is nothing really big happened and secondly he played so, so well. Of course he is going to play. The only thing I can say is that if I see something happen to my son I would do the same. I would think two seconds about doing the same.\u201d In further keeper news, Hugo Lloris is a mild doubt for tomorrow\u2019s game but is expected to play. Important handover news: Stuart Goodwin will be taking over for an hour or so. Please be gentle with him. Liverpool news: Andy Hunter is at Jurgen Klopp\u2019s press conference and brings reasonably good tidings from the Liverpool manager. Fitba: Interested in seeing what happened when a famously dour, occasionally belligerent, crotchety and temperamental Scotsman sat down to interview the manager of his national football team? Ewan Murray sat down with Steve Clarke so you could find out ... Fitba: Steven Gerrard admits he is facing one of his most difficult periods in football - but says that challenging himself was exactly why he opted to begin his managerial career with Rangers. After advancing to the last 16 of the Europa League by beating Braga over two legs, his side has lost twice in five days - their Scottish Cup exit against Hearts followed by a home defeat by Hamilton. \u201cThe whole 20 months has been challenging but of course when results are not good enough in a short space of time there\u2019s more heat and more pressure on myself, which I accept,\u201d he said, when asked if this was the most challenging week of his professional career. \u201cIn many ways, yeah, it probably has been challenging but even when we were winning, this job is challenging because you have got to do everything you can to continue that. This is one of the most challenging jobs out there. I knew that and it hasn\u2019t disappointed.\u201d Meanwhile in Barcelona: Over in La Liga, Barcelona have the chance to regain top spot on Saturday night when they host Real Sociedad at Camp Nou. But in the buildup to the match their manager, Quique Setien, has been bogged down by chatter about the behaviour of his assistant Eder Sarabia, who has made headlines with his language during Barca\u2019s 2-0 defeat by Real Madrid. Setien has since apologised to his Barcelona squad. He told El Periodico: \u201cWe apologised to everyone [in our squad], we cannot behave like that. We don\u2019t like to see things like this, we have committed an error and we should try to avoid something like this happening again. This situation has affected me a lot, because I am concerned about the image of the club. We need to take care of that image, because we can be criticised for substitutions, tactics, etc, but not for our behaviour.\u201d For a sample of effing and jeffing in question, click here. Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur: James Tarkowski has rejected the suggestion Burnley\u2019s chances of recording yet another clean sheet when Tottenham visit Turf Moor this weekend will be easier in the absence of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. The frontline pair are both injured and will miss Spurs\u2019 trip to the north-west at teatime on Saturday as they look to arrest a slump that has seen them lose ground on the Premier League top-four. Burnley could leapfrog them with a win following a six-match unbeaten run that has carried them into the top half of the table, in part thanks to the effectiveness of their back-line. On 11 occasions this season, Burnley\u2019s opponents have drawn a blank in front of goal, but Tarkowski is not taking another clean sheet for granted. \u201cYes and no!\u201d said Tarkowski, upon being asked if now was a good time to be playing Tottenham. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s more expectation on us because they are missing two of their big hitters. \u201cWhen they are missing Harry and Son then obviously there may be a chance there for us to put a good performance in. I don\u2019t think it makes easier. Maybe from your perspective it does but not for me, no. \u201cThere is still a player in front of me I have got to stop from scoring goals and there is a team of 11 players we have got to go and beat.\u201d Tarkowski, fellow centre-half Ben Mee and goalkeeper Nick Pope have started every match in the top-flight this term, bolstering the impression that familiarity has bred success. \u201cWe\u2019ve had quite a consistent back four this season which is nice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe full-backs have chopped and changed a little bit but me, Ben and Popey have been there all season and that sort of consistency helps. It sort of comes more natural with each other, we know each other\u2019s game, I expect where Ben is going to be and he expects where I am going to be at times and we cover round each other.\u201d More on that Jesse Lingard abuse: As we mentioned earlier, Manchester United have launched an investigation into the shocking abuse aimed at Jesse Lingard following Thursday\u2019s FA Cup fifth-round victory at Derby. The 27-year-old was among six changes made for the 3-0 win against his former club at Pride Park, where video emerged on social media showing the midfielder being abused as he made his way onto the team coach. Lingard is heard being sworn at repeatedly as he signs autographs, before boarding the coach as another fan shouts \u201czero goals and zero assists\u201d. United team-mate Luke Shaw confronts supporters from the doorway of the bus and what appears to be a racist remark is allegedly uttered by someone waiting outside the coach. You can see and hear the footage below, but please be advised that it is not safe for work and contains lots of loud \u201ceffing\u201d and \u201cjeffing\u201d, as well as other depressingly unsavoury and unimaginative, possibly racist abuse. Sheffield United v Norwich City: Two of the three promoted teams meet on Saturday and a difference in transfer spending is not the whole story behind their divergent paths, writes Paul Wilson. Brighton news: Brighton boss Graham Potter intends to take it one match at a time as his team prepare for a daunting run of fixtures which could decide their Premier League fate. This weekend\u2019s trip to sixth-placed Wolves being followed by successive matches against Arsenal, Manchester United, Norwich, Liverpool and Manchester City. It is a formidable challenge awaiting the south-coast side, but Potter prefers not to look too far ahead or worry about what could happen elsewhere. \u201cWe have to focus on ourselves and not think about external things too much. You can\u2019t look any further than the next game, otherwise you overthink,\u201d Potter said. \u201cRather than worrying about what might or might not happen we will make sure our attention is on our game.\u201d Potter knows just what a tough ask it will be to leave Molineux with a good result. \u201cThey have done amazingly well and full credit has to go to the manager for getting them promoted and then stable in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cWolves have been on a good European run and maintained their level. They are well organised and are competing for a top-four spot. They have a really dangerous front three and have a good mix of attacking qualities.\u201d EFL statement: \u201cAs a result of the ongoing concerns posed the by Coronavirus outbreak and following specific medical advice, the Fair Play handshake between players and match officials will not take place at this weekend\u2019s EFL matches and until further notice. \u201cWhilst the Government guidance does remain unchanged, a decision has been taken on medical advice and as a precautionary measure. Matchday operations at EFL grounds are set to continue this weekend with Clubs being advised to take appropriate prevention measures as per the Government guidance. \u201cIt is understood, however, that individual Clubs may take decisions at a local level to help mitigate the risk of the virus spreading further ahead of this weekend\u2019s matches. \u201cThe EFL continues to remain in regular dialogue with the Government regarding the ongoing developments and is being appraised on a regular basis of developments that could potentially impact our Clubs and Competitions \u201cWe will continue to provide EFL Clubs with updates and advice as it is issued to ensure that they have all the relevant up-to date information so that they can continue to advise their players, staff and supporters. \u201cThese matters are subject to constant change and we will update as appropriate.\u201d Coronavirus update: The Football League is to follow the Premier League in banning pre-match handshakes between sets of players in a bid to halt the spread of the virus. As gestures go, it could scarcely be more pointless, but it does at least allow both governing bodies to be seen to be doing something. Neither the Premier League nor the EFL have mentioned if they will also be forbidding players from spitting, blowing their noses, screaming in each other\u2019s faces. For the time being at least, they will also allow tens of thousands of spectators to sit together in close proximity to each other and the pitch, coughing, sneezing and shouting. Coronavirus is spread via droplets from the nose and mouth and can be transmitted on to the hands and passed on via a handshake. Coronavirus update: Denmark has become the latest country to announce that all football matches will be played behind closed doors for the rest of March. The country has also banned events that involve gatherings of over 1,000 people. All sport in Italy, including Serie A games, will be played behind closed doors until 3 April in an effort to contain the disease, the government has said. Manchester United news: The club have condemned what appears to be racist abuse suffered by Jesse Lingard after Thursday\u2019s FA Cup win at Pride Park, and will contact Derby for help in investigating the matter, writes Jamie Jackson. Women\u2019s football: England\u2019s Lionesses continue to be nowhere near as good as their delusional manager Phil Neville seems to think they are and were beaten by the USA in their SheBelieves Cup opener in Orlando yesterday. Suzanne Wrack was there to see England get swatted aside by a half-fit team of Americans interrupting their off season to play in the tournament. Crystal Palace news: Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has signed a one-year contract extension that will keep him at the club until the end of the 2020-21 campaign, the Premier League club have announced. More as we get it ... although I\u2019m not sure how much more there is to add. The news does put an end to uncertainty surrounding Hodgson\u2019s future at the club, following speculation that he was very displeased indeed by their lack of activity in the January transfer window. Newcastle news: Steve Bruce fears it is \u201cpretty inevitable\u201d that Premier League games will be played behind closed doors as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The authorities in Italy have introduced a ban on mass gatherings which has hit sports events, and Bruce believes it is only a matter of time before the same happens in the UK. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine, isn\u2019t it? But obviously, they\u2019re doing it now in Italy and it\u2019s something we\u2019re probably going to face. We all know football is a way out for everybody, but people\u2019s lives are at stake and we\u2019ve got to go by the authorities. But it looks pretty inevitable that could be on the cards.\u201d The potential for some respite then, for disillusioned Newcastle fans who remain unhappy with their team\u2019s style of play under Bruce. Newcastle duo ink new deals: Jonjo Shelvey, 28, and Matt Ritchie, 30, have both signed new three-year contracts which will keep them at the Premier League club until 2023. Our chief football correspondent writes: David Hytner has penned an interesting comment piece on the furore surrounding Eric Dier\u2019s spirited, fraternal foray into the White Hart Lane stands in the wake of Tottenham\u2019s FA Cup defeat at the hands of Norwich City on Wednesday night. While no supporters were harmed in the making of this controversy, Dier almost certainly regrets his actions and is apparently resigned to whatever ban he inevitably receives from the Football Association for angrily making his way over 15 rows of seats with intent. His manager, however, has stood by him and urged Tottenham to do the same. Meanwhile, Dier\u2019s rush of blood to the head has intensified the focus on fan behaviour, specifically the behaviour of those entitled dunderheads who think buying a ticket for a football match entitles them to scream toxic abuse at the players putting on the show. Read on and feel free to add your two cents in the comments section below ... This weekend\u2019s Premier League fixtures The Manchester derby is probably the pick of the bunch, although the eye is also draw to wobbling Liverpool\u2019s game against Bournemouth at Anfield and Tottenham\u2019s trip to Turf Moor as they attempt to halt a run of four consecutive defeats. The only manager in football history ever to lose players through injury, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been getting his excuses in early, having told the BBC the club hierarchy must choose between prioritising the weekend\u2019s clash with Burnley or the upcoming Champions League visit to Leipzig. \u201cIn this moment I have to think about what\u2019s next and I have to speak to my club because I think some of these boys to have a chance to fight Tuesday for a Champions League position they just can\u2019t play on Saturday,\u201d he said, somewhat bafflingly. Coronavirus latest ... The spread of coronavirus means it is likely matches will be played behind closed doors this month, writes Paul MacInnes. Sasha Ryazantsev, the Everton chief financial officer, said banning fans from games in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus would be a decision imposed on clubs. However, with Italian authorities having taken the decision to play Serie A games behind closed doors until April, the possibility of something similar here is increasing. \u201cIt would be a forced decision rather than one we would proactively engage in,\u201d said Ryazantsev at the FT Business of Football Summit in London. \u201cBut the whole situation goes far beyond the world of sport. Nobody wants to play behind closed doors and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable that it will happen. But we feel it is quite likely it may happen in the coming weeks.\u201d Welcome to your one-stop shop for all the news and build-up ahead of another weekend\u2019s piping hot football action. With assorted managers scheduled to host press conferences ahead of the latest round of fixtures, we\u2019ll bring you all the news that\u2019s fit to print and almost certainly a whole lot more that isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t touch that dial. Or mouse. Or ... em, touchscreen. Or your face. And for the love of humanity, wash your hands!",

      "bodyText": "Quarantined Italian towns are buckling under the strain, major cities are emptying out and some of those infected say they are being stigmatised as Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of coronavirus takes hold. As of Friday night, 4,636 cases had been detected as Italy aggressively tests for the virus. Out of that number, 197 people have died. Eleven towns are under lockdown \u2013 10 in Lombardy and one in Veneto \u2013 and schools have been closed across the country as the government tries to contain a virus about which there are still many unknowns. Its neighbour Austria announced it is introducing \u201cspot\u201d health checks at the border for two weeks as of next week. Stories that have emerged since the outbreak began reflect the contrasting nature of the virus\u2019s impact, from the reassuring accounts of people cured to the suffering of those who have died or are in a critical condition. The heavily pregnant wife of \u201cpatient one\u201d, the 38-year-old man who was Italy\u2019s first confirmed locally transmitted case, was dismissed from hospital on Thursday; her husband, a marathon runner and amateur footballer, remains in intensive care. The dead, mostly elderly and with underlying health problems, are buried quickly without ceremony to mitigate the risk of infection posed by their corpses. The living have become wary of those with even the slightest cough. Nowhere is the situation more acute than in the areas under quarantine.

Cantona must be thrown out of the game. I care not one jot about his supreme talent!!\u201d</p> \n<p>The words of the young firebrand Jonathan Pearce there. Pearce was commentating on the radio as Cantona <em>scissor kung</em><em> fu kicked</em> \u2013 excellent football-style technique descriptor there \u2013 an abusive supporter at Selhurst Park in January 1995. In the process he captured perfectly the mind-boggling weirdness of a moment where modern football became, ahead of time, a truly interactive entertainment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/06/eric-dier-in-right-frame-of-mind-to-play-for-tottenham-jose-mourinho-burnley\">Eric Dier in right frame of mind to play for Tottenham, insists Jos\u00e9 Mourinho</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was no equivalent sense of outrage when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/eric-dier-confronts-fan-in-stands-after-tottenhams-fa-cup-defeat-to-norwich\" title=\"\">Eric Dier climbed the hoardings</a> and entered the crowd at the end of Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s FA Cup defeat by Norwich on Wednesday night. For obvious reasons. Dier didn\u2019t attack anyone. He didn\u2019t really do anything wrong, other than giving off an alluring sense of menace while jumping, quite slowly, over some seats.</p> \n<p>The common territory is that Dier and Cantona both broke the fourth wall, crossing the spatial and emotional boundary between observer and performer, something English sport finds particularly transgressive. Dier\u2019s crime was to break character as a paid entertainer; and to risk wider disorder that might have endangered stewards and bystanders.</p> \n<p>With a little distance two things seem clear. First it is extraordinary that 25 years on from Selhurst Park there have been so few incidents of this type in modern football. All that trapped rage. And in the middle of it, what poise! What dutiful respect of personal space! But then, anonymity is a useful cloak. Give a man a mask and he\u2019ll tell you the truth; bury him in a crowd and he\u2019ll gleefully express the very worst of himself.</p> \n<p>Beyond this it is striking how different the response has been. Dier has drawn a tide of sympathy, support and applause. Correctly so, too. He was trying to protect his brother, which is right up there with saving his dog or making sure the mail gets through when it comes to hitting the big emotional bullseyes. Climbing up through those rows of plastic seats, he looked angry but also noble and sad and messianic, like the last polar bear on earth in lone pursuit of the retreating snowline.</p> \n<p>Dier was also successful. The spectator in question beat a limp retreat, having realised that abusing people from behind a fence might actually have real-life consequences.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Where can there be a place in the game for a man of such extravagant talent, a man of such wicked temperament? A man who has now \u2026 OH MY GOODNESS ME!!! He has KICKED \u2026 He has PUNCHED A FAN!!! Eric Cantona has jumped in and SCISSOR KUNG FU KICKED a fan. I have never seen such a disgraceful incident in all my years in football. Cantona must be thrown out of the game. I care not one jot about his supreme talent!!\u201d The words of the young firebrand Jonathan Pearce there. Pearce was commentating on the radio as Cantona scissor kung fu kicked \u2013 excellent football-style technique descriptor there \u2013 an abusive supporter at Selhurst Park in January 1995. In the process he captured perfectly the mind-boggling weirdness of a moment where modern football became, ahead of time, a truly interactive entertainment. There was no equivalent sense of outrage when Eric Dier climbed the hoardings and entered the crowd at the end of Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s FA Cup defeat by Norwich on Wednesday night. For obvious reasons. Dier didn\u2019t attack anyone. He didn\u2019t really do anything wrong, other than giving off an alluring sense of menace while jumping, quite slowly, over some seats. The common territory is that Dier and Cantona both broke the fourth wall, crossing the spatial and emotional boundary between observer and performer, something English sport finds particularly transgressive. Dier\u2019s crime was to break character as a paid entertainer; and to risk wider disorder that might have endangered stewards and bystanders. With a little distance two things seem clear. First it is extraordinary that 25 years on from Selhurst Park there have been so few incidents of this type in modern football. All that trapped rage. And in the middle of it, what poise! What dutiful respect of personal space! But then, anonymity is a useful cloak. Give a man a mask and he\u2019ll tell you the truth; bury him in a crowd and he\u2019ll gleefully express the very worst of himself. Beyond this it is striking how different the response has been. Dier has drawn a tide of sympathy, support and applause. Correctly so, too. He was trying to protect his brother, which is right up there with saving his dog or making sure the mail gets through when it comes to hitting the big emotional bullseyes. Climbing up through those rows of plastic seats, he looked angry but also noble and sad and messianic, like the last polar bear on earth in lone pursuit of the retreating snowline. Dier was also successful. The spectator in question beat a limp retreat, having realised that abusing people from behind a fence might actually have real-life consequences. As a wise man once said: \u201cDon\u2019t make threats you cannot and will not back up.\u201d Dier will be punished, but hopefully with lenience. When he looks back on his career, he won\u2019t regret doing it. But I suspect there are more diffuse reasons for all that sympathy. For a start, these days you don\u2019t have to be a sporting celebrity to know what random, anonymised abuse feels like. Rage is all around us, one of the three great gifts of the internet\u2019s gleaming new frontier, along with horse porn and disinformation.

      "body": "<p>In years past, a reader Googling the definition of \u201canatomy\u201d on their phone would have found a couple of example sentences demonstrating how the word might be used: \u201cHe left dusty handprints on his lady customers\u2019 anatomies,\u201d or \u201cShe was unable to reach for the bag in case she revealed more of her anatomy than she already had.\u201d</p> <p>Not any more. After a huge project that involved picking over tens of thousands of example sentences, Oxford University Press (OUP) has been quietly replacing hundreds of those that \u201cunnecessarily perpetuate sexist stereotypes\u201d in Oxford Dictionaries, the dictionary source licensed by Apple and Google. Now the example given for anatomy is \u201cpeople should never be reduced to their anatomies\u201d \u2013 and the \u201clady customers\u201d have been consigned to the past.</p> <p>The extensive research was prompted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/25/oxford-dictionary-review-sexist-language-rabid-feminist-gender\">a complaint four years ago from the Canadian anthropologist Michael Oman-Reagan</a>, who had noticed that the word \u201crabid\u201d was illustrated with the example phrase \u201crabid feminist\u201d, that \u201cshrill\u201d was defined as \u201cthe rising shrill of women\u2019s voices\u201d, and the adjective \u201cnagging\u201d used the example phrase \u201ca nagging wife\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women\u2019s hair was always being described with adjectives like lustrous, and there was a lot of stuff about women\u2019s appearance that wasn\u2019t necessary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople were talking about stereotypes being perpetuated by example sentences. That was something we\u2019d never considered before,\u201d said Katherine Martin, head of language content and data at OUP. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a really extensive project looking at every example sentence that had a female pronoun in it, involving thousands and thousands of examples, looking for patterns to check if this was a valid critique.\u201d</p> <p>It was. \u201cWe noticed \u2026 women\u2019s hair was always being described with adjectives like lustrous, and there was a lot of stuff about women\u2019s appearance that wasn\u2019t necessary to explain what the meanings of words were,\u201d said Martin.</p> <p>Housework, for example, had been illustrated with the sentence, \u201cShe was doing the housework\u201d. OUP\u2019s lexicographers went back to the dictionary\u2019s corpus - its huge collection of texts drawn from real life \u2013 to find examples \u201cthat would not perpetuate unnecessarily sexist stereotypes about housework\u201d, said Martin. \u201cAnd it was unreal, all the examples were either \u2018she was doing the housework\u2019 or \u2018he wasn\u2019t doing the housework\u2019, that\u2019s so tied into the notion of housework.\u201d</p> <p>The lexicographers ended up with \u201cI was busy doing housework when the doorbell rang\u201d. Around 500 changes to example sentences have been made to date in the ongoing project, including words to do with appearance (anatomy, hip, hot, ugly), sexuality and sexual behaviour (arouse, frumpy, frigid, grope), personality traits (avaricious, brainy, high-maintenance, shopaholic, stubborn), and concepts of traditional gender roles (housework, chore, domestically, housekeeping).</p> <p>New editorial standards and practices have been established for example sentences \u201cso we can be factually based but not unintentionally cause harm\u201d, said Martin.</p> <p>Deborah Cameron, a professor of language and communication at Oxford, welcomed the changes. \u201cThat\u2019s very good news that they\u2019re trying to fix that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re using a dictionary and every time you\u2019re looking at example sentences they\u2019re reproducing everyday sexism, then you are playing your part in a much wider cultural process whereby those associations \u2013 woman as sexual object, as body part \u2013 just get reproduced. So it\u2019s not the dictionary on its own. The point is, the dictionary is participating in a process that produces consistent and persistent bias, and if there isn\u2019t any actual reason to do it, we should not do it.\u201d</p> <p>The move comes after a week in which OUP has also faced criticism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/fresh-call-for-oxford-dictionaries-to-change-sexist-definitions\">over the synonyms featured in Oxford Dictionaries</a> for the word \u201cwoman\u201d, with an open letter from campaigners criticising the inclusion of synonyms such as \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cmaid\u201d, and sexist examples of usage including, \u201cGod, woman. Will you just listen?\u201d</p> <p>OUP said it has been reviewing the word, along with other terms relating to women, and is set to label words such as \u201cslut\u201d, \u201cslag\u201d, and \u201cwhore\u201d as offensive \u2013 meaning that the terms would be deemed unacceptable to use whatever the situation - rather than merely derogatory, slang, or informal. Words such as \u201cspinster\u201d and \u201cfrigid\u201d are to be specifically labelled as derogatory, because they can no longer be used in a neutral way without a negative implication.</p> <p>OUP is also planning expanded coverage of the word \u201cwoman\u201d, with more examples and idiomatic phrases, and will be adjusting the labelling on its synonyms for \u201cwoman\u201d to make it clear which terms are derogatory and offensive.</p> <p>\u201cWe felt some words were given as synonyms for woman and were not strictly synonyms; there are different levels of a word meaning the same thing and we wanted to be really conscious of that,\u201d said Martin.</p> <p>But there are no plans to remove words such as bitch, which is labelled as offensive, from the synonyms provided for woman. The dictionary, said Martin, \u201creflects the way that language is used.

      "bodyText": "In years past, a reader Googling the definition of \u201canatomy\u201d on their phone would have found a couple of example sentences demonstrating how the word might be used: \u201cHe left dusty handprints on his lady customers\u2019 anatomies,\u201d or \u201cShe was unable to reach for the bag in case she revealed more of her anatomy than she already had.\u201d Not any more. After a huge project that involved picking over tens of thousands of example sentences, Oxford University Press (OUP) has been quietly replacing hundreds of those that \u201cunnecessarily perpetuate sexist stereotypes\u201d in Oxford Dictionaries, the dictionary source licensed by Apple and Google. Now the example given for anatomy is \u201cpeople should never be reduced to their anatomies\u201d \u2013 and the \u201clady customers\u201d have been consigned to the past. The extensive research was prompted by a complaint four years ago from the Canadian anthropologist Michael Oman-Reagan, who had noticed that the word \u201crabid\u201d was illustrated with the example phrase \u201crabid feminist\u201d, that \u201cshrill\u201d was defined as \u201cthe rising shrill of women\u2019s voices\u201d, and the adjective \u201cnagging\u201d used the example phrase \u201ca nagging wife\u201d. \u201cPeople were talking about stereotypes being perpetuated by example sentences. That was something we\u2019d never considered before,\u201d said Katherine Martin, head of language content and data at OUP. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a really extensive project looking at every example sentence that had a female pronoun in it, involving thousands and thousands of examples, looking for patterns to check if this was a valid critique.\u201d It was. \u201cWe noticed \u2026 women\u2019s hair was always being described with adjectives like lustrous, and there was a lot of stuff about women\u2019s appearance that wasn\u2019t necessary to explain what the meanings of words were,\u201d said Martin. Housework, for example, had been illustrated with the sentence, \u201cShe was doing the housework\u201d. OUP\u2019s lexicographers went back to the dictionary\u2019s corpus - its huge collection of texts drawn from real life \u2013 to find examples \u201cthat would not perpetuate unnecessarily sexist stereotypes about housework\u201d, said Martin. \u201cAnd it was unreal, all the examples were either \u2018she was doing the housework\u2019 or \u2018he wasn\u2019t doing the housework\u2019, that\u2019s so tied into the notion of housework.\u201d The lexicographers ended up with \u201cI was busy doing housework when the doorbell rang\u201d. Around 500 changes to example sentences have been made to date in the ongoing project, including words to do with appearance (anatomy, hip, hot, ugly), sexuality and sexual behaviour (arouse, frumpy, frigid, grope), personality traits (avaricious, brainy, high-maintenance, shopaholic, stubborn), and concepts of traditional gender roles (housework, chore, domestically, housekeeping). New editorial standards and practices have been established for example sentences \u201cso we can be factually based but not unintentionally cause harm\u201d, said Martin. Deborah Cameron, a professor of language and communication at Oxford, welcomed the changes. \u201cThat\u2019s very good news that they\u2019re trying to fix that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re using a dictionary and every time you\u2019re looking at example sentences they\u2019re reproducing everyday sexism, then you are playing your part in a much wider cultural process whereby those associations \u2013 woman as sexual object, as body part \u2013 just get reproduced. So it\u2019s not the dictionary on its own. The point is, the dictionary is participating in a process that produces consistent and persistent bias, and if there isn\u2019t any actual reason to do it, we should not do it.\u201d The move comes after a week in which OUP has also faced criticism over the synonyms featured in Oxford Dictionaries for the word \u201cwoman\u201d, with an open letter from campaigners criticising the inclusion of synonyms such as \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cmaid\u201d, and sexist examples of usage including, \u201cGod, woman. Will you just listen?\u201d OUP said it has been reviewing the word, along with other terms relating to women, and is set to label words such as \u201cslut\u201d, \u201cslag\u201d, and \u201cwhore\u201d as offensive \u2013 meaning that the terms would be deemed unacceptable to use whatever the situation - rather than merely derogatory, slang, or informal. Words such as \u201cspinster\u201d and \u201cfrigid\u201d are to be specifically labelled as derogatory, because they can no longer be used in a neutral way without a negative implication. OUP is also planning expanded coverage of the word \u201cwoman\u201d, with more examples and idiomatic phrases, and will be adjusting the labelling on its synonyms for \u201cwoman\u201d to make it clear which terms are derogatory and offensive. \u201cWe felt some words were given as synonyms for woman and were not strictly synonyms; there are different levels of a word meaning the same thing and we wanted to be really conscious of that,\u201d said Martin. But there are no plans to remove words such as bitch, which is labelled as offensive, from the synonyms provided for woman. The dictionary, said Martin, \u201creflects the way that language is used. It\u2019s a mirror, and so it\u2019s really important that it be a reliable, trustworthy, fact-based repository of information about the English language. That\u2019s why if there\u2019s a slur that exists, and it\u2019s widely known, leaving it out would misrepresent the reality of the uses of the language.\u201d \u201cWhat we want to do is present accurate factual information about language, that\u2019s our key focus,\u201d she said. \u201cWithin that boundary it\u2019s an important consideration to be conscious of the unintentional impact that authoritative resources like the dictionary can have on historically marginalised groups. We have to hold that ideal alongside the ideal of being factually accurate.\u201d The changing definitions psyche: (definition: the human soul, mind, or spirit) original examples: I will never really fathom the female psyche new example: The mind, the psyche, the soul, the spirit - call it what you will - also has to be returned to some sort of equilibrium housework: regular work done in housekeeping, especially cleaning and tidying original example: she still does all the housework new example: I was busy doing housework when the doorbell rang high-maintenance: (of a person) demanding a lot of attention original example: if Martin could keep a high-maintenance girl like Tania happy, he must be doing something right new example: I freely admit to being high-maintenance rabid: Having or proceeding from an extreme or fanatical support of or belief in something original example: a rabid feminist new example: a rabid ideologue",

      "bodyText": "Europe has always had major political parties hostile to European integration since the first steps to supra-national cooperation and partnership were taken in 1950 (Eurosceptic parties thrive across EU, but public in no mood to quit the bloc, 3 March). Labour opposed European partnership with vivid language from leaders like Hugh Gaitskell and Jim Callaghan, who used Ukip-type jargon. The Labour leadership since 2015 has not exactly been Europhile. The German Social Democrats in the 1950s denounced the European Economic Community as \u201cCatholic, conservative and capitalist\u201d. The French and other communist parties, which had much bigger voting shares than far-right parties today, regularly denounced Brussels. In 1978, Jacques Chirac said \u201cvoting by majority means France is paralysed\u201d and \u201ca federal Europe cannot fail to be dominated by the Americans\u201d.

Poland\u2019s PiS party has nothing positive to say about Europe except when it comes to EU agricultural and regional subsidies, when suddenly its Euroscepticism dissolves into embrace of Brussels handouts. One of the fascinating consequences of Brexit is that nearly every party on the continent that before June 2016 called for a referendum on staying in the EU or using the euro has now dropped such demands as European voters see the mess Brexit has caused here.

      "bodyText": "The south-east\u2019s seaside hubs have been undergoing something of a renaissance of late, from trendy Margate with its creative ex-London crowd, to Hastings with its burgeoning art and dining scene. Hot on their heels is Eastbourne, which has been quietly reinventing itself over the past few years. A postcard-pretty town braced against the dramatic English coast, it\u2019s home to arty cinemas and theatre spaces, cool bars and trendy shopping quarters, away from the bustle of neighbouring Brighton. Here\u2019s why you should pay it a visit. Towner Art Gallery Gleaming like a pearl against Eastbourne\u2019s Victorian seafront architecture, the modernist Towner Gallery \u2013 with its fantastical rainbow-painted fa\u00e7ade \u2013 is one of the most interesting buildings in town. What\u2019s happening inside is pretty captivating too, with a lineup of fascinating exhibitions, film screenings and creative workshops. Founded in 1923, the Towner has actually been collecting and exhibiting modern art for almost 100 years and houses pieces from agenda-setting artists including Grayson Perry, Wolfgang Tillmans and Eric Ravilious, whose unique, sweeping style captures the beauty of the surrounding South Downs. Printers Playhouse A pocket-sized art hub tucked between shops on lively Grove Road, the Printers Playhouse opened in 2015 as proof of Eastbourne\u2019s growing alternative scene. The understated venue \u2013 with an acoustic stage downstairs and theatre space on the first floor \u2013 plays host to comedy nights, live music from local bands and some cutting-edge theatre (as well as lively open mic nights that draw in the locals). There\u2019s also an in-house \u201cUkulele Army\u201d, which meets for communal strumming every Tuesday night (novices welcome). Eastbourne Pier There\u2019s nothing quite like a bit of salty English tradition and Eastbourne\u2019s pier offers old-school seaside glamour in spades (excuse the pun). Crunch your way across the pebbly beach, keeping your eyes peeled for the starlings that swoosh across the skies, and you\u2019ll soon find yourself at the focal point: the Victorian-era pier, built between 1866 and 1872. As well as a retro amusement arcade, the pier is home to a smattering of eateries including the Victorian Tea Rooms for satisfying cream teas, and The Chippy for traditional vinegar-slathered fish and chips with mushy peas. Sovereign Harbour Marina If people-watching is your thing, take a stroll around the waterfront at Sovereign Harbour marina, northern Europe\u2019s largest composite marina complex and a veritable hive of activity. Settle into one of its many cafes for glittering water views and an ice-cream sundae \u2013 the strawberry delight at Di Lieto\u2019s coffee lounge is a hot weather winner \u2013 or take to the water for a 30-minute marina boat trip. You\u2019ll also find an urban beach, a spring market and a petanque court for working off any competitive energy. Just make sure you have enough left in the tank for a turn around the harbour walking route \u2013 a meandering labyrinth of paths, lochs and bridges, perfect for a crisp spring day. Eastbourne Bandstand So much more than just a humble bandstand, this Eastbourne institution is known for hosting more live events than any other bandstand in the country. Combining old with new, its traditional blue-domed roof, swirling sea views and 1,400 seats, make it a striking backdrop against which raucous rock\u2019n\u2019roll gigs, haunting acoustic performances and soul-rousing choral evenings have taken place. The stand also has connections to the Titanic, as one of its past band members, John Wesley Woodward, who took his best cello on the ship\u2019s maiden voyage, died alongside the other musicians on the ill-fated journey. You\u2019ll find a plaque dedicated to him here. Little Chelsea A clutch of streets near the town\u2019s railway station, Little Chelsea stokes the flames of Eastbourne\u2019s already-roaring indie scene. The vibrant shopping quarter \u2013 located at Grove Road and South Street \u2013 is filled with craft shops, cafes and an antiques emporium, making it a must-visit for those in search of secondhand trinkets, vintage fashion and classic vinyl. Book lovers should head to locals\u2019 favourite, Camilla\u2019s, a literary wonderland bursting with piles of secondhand books stacked floor-to-ceiling, while those with a penchant for boutique shopping will adore the Enterprise Centre \u2013 a former Victorian railway building hosting more than 50 independent shops and restaurants. Pevensey Court House Museum and Gaol History lovers, assemble. If you venture just beyond Eastbourne, you\u2019ll come across Pevensey, the landing place of William the Conquerer and home to a Norman castle built by the man himself on the site of a Roman fort. History courses through the streets here and the town is also home to a former court house, gaol and town hall, which dates back to Tudor times. The house is set up like a living museum and still looks exactly as it did in 1886, meaning you can visit the prison cells (where, during the second world war, a captured German airman was held), take a look at the stocks and stroll around the exercise yard below. You\u2019ll find all sorts of fascinating artefacts here, including dinosaur footprints, Roman coins and an embroidered replica of the Bayeux Tapestry Pevensey scene. How to get there Get to Eastbourne in just over an hour-and-a-half from London Victoria with Southern Railway. Book direct at southernrailway.com and avoid any booking fees. Look for Super Off Peak and Off Peak fares which offer great value for money when you travel outside of peak times.",

The area actually takes its name from the beautiful glass palace that once stood here, which was ravaged by fire and destroyed in 1936. Vintage lovers will have plenty to explore in Crystal Palace, with Haynes Lane Market \u2013 tucked away off the busy Westow Street \u2013 offering up an Aladdin\u2019s cave of trinkets and treats, including antiques, vinyl, books, clothes and even tarot readings. Afterwards, head to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/crespidia/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crespidia</a>, a beautiful cafe filled with fresh flowers, a vintage rail and homemade cakes and lunches.

Bursting with history, the picturesque town is home to Dunstable Priory, which was established by King Henry I in 1132 and still houses surviving architecture from its early years (making it one of the most complete Norman Romanesque buildings in the UK).

The jewel in its crown is Fairlands Valley Park, a sweep of 48 hectares of parkland situated within the heart of the town. The park is known for its range of water sports activities, including dragon boat racing, stand-up paddleboarding, sailing and kayaking, which all take place on the 4.5-hectare sailing lake. There\u2019s also plenty to do on dry land too, with grass sledging, orienteering, mountain biking and power kiting on offer for energetic sorts. History lovers will be well-served in Stevenage too. Knebworth House \u2013 dating back to 1490 \u2013 is a sight to behold, with its towering turrets, neat domes and grisly gargoyles.

      "body": "<p>Some observers of European integration often reframe crises like Brexit as opportunities for further development. Consequently, one can sympathise with Timothy Garton Ash\u2019s nod to \u201cnoughties nostalgia\u201d and commendation of the EU\u2019s trade, regulatory and environmental expertise (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/02/europe-britain-superpower-european\" title=\"\">Europe can be a superpower. It just needs to hang together</a>, Journal, 2 March).</p> <p>He focuses on a specific set of challenges, such as diplomacy, intelligence, counter-terrorism, development aid, and \u201creadiness to use military force\u201d. But he omits more mundane structural problems challenging Europe\u2019s future.</p> <p>First, it still hasn\u2019t recovered from the consequences of last decade\u2019s crisis. Leaving aside political animosity, almost a quarter (22.4%) of EU households are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Top income inequality has intensified since the early 1980s, with tax rates and distributional social systems in retreat. And, while unemployment looks low on the surface (6.3%), in Greece, Italy or Spain it remains around 10%. This is the economic counterpart to the political programme that liberals like Garton Ash have promoted since the early 1990s. Besides extending market mechanisms to social affairs, they discouraged state intervention. Voters from Greece to Spain accepted the deal: to regain stability, sacrifices were necessary. However, after \u201cbreaking the eggs\u201d, the omelette is quite bland.</p> <p>Abroad, China shows that the state can be a powerful economic agent. European nations after the war carefully negotiated protections and alliances between industries to grow together, not against each other. Garton Ash must recognise that industrial policies and other \u201centrepreneurial state\u201d mechanisms can build better foundations for a superpower. Boris Johnson and Donald Trump are already employing unilateral state interventionism for short-term political gain. They will soon be joined by the Salvinis and Orb\u00e1ns of the world, while the EU becomes even more technologically dependent, unless economic grievances are addressed.<br><strong>Roy </strong><strong>Cobby</strong><br><em>Research student in digital humanities, King\u2019s College London </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

      "bodyText": "Some observers of European integration often reframe crises like Brexit as opportunities for further development. Consequently, one can sympathise with Timothy Garton Ash\u2019s nod to \u201cnoughties nostalgia\u201d and commendation of the EU\u2019s trade, regulatory and environmental expertise (Europe can be a superpower. It just needs to hang together, Journal, 2 March). He focuses on a specific set of challenges, such as diplomacy, intelligence, counter-terrorism, development aid, and \u201creadiness to use military force\u201d. But he omits more mundane structural problems challenging Europe\u2019s future. First, it still hasn\u2019t recovered from the consequences of last decade\u2019s crisis. Leaving aside political animosity, almost a quarter (22.4%) of EU households are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Top income inequality has intensified since the early 1980s, with tax rates and distributional social systems in retreat. And, while unemployment looks low on the surface (6.3%), in Greece, Italy or Spain it remains around 10%. This is the economic counterpart to the political programme that liberals like Garton Ash have promoted since the early 1990s. Besides extending market mechanisms to social affairs, they discouraged state intervention. Voters from Greece to Spain accepted the deal: to regain stability, sacrifices were necessary. However, after \u201cbreaking the eggs\u201d, the omelette is quite bland. Abroad, China shows that the state can be a powerful economic agent. European nations after the war carefully negotiated protections and alliances between industries to grow together, not against each other. Garton Ash must recognise that industrial policies and other \u201centrepreneurial state\u201d mechanisms can build better foundations for a superpower. Boris Johnson and Donald Trump are already employing unilateral state interventionism for short-term political gain. They will soon be joined by the Salvinis and Orb\u00e1ns of the world, while the EU becomes even more technologically dependent, unless economic grievances are addressed.

      "bodyText": "A royal flush is guaranteed at Westminster Abbey\u2019s annual Commonwealth Day service on Monday. The Queen, as head of the 54-nation alliance, will be seated in the front row alongside the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. But behind, a little apart from this nucleus of the royal family, will be the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, in their final official UK public engagement as senior working royals before \u201cMegxit\u201d. The prime minister, senior politicians, and ambassadors from around the globe will be in the congregation to bear witness to Harry and Meghan\u2019s last hurrah before they depart these shores for an uncertain future. The service draws to a close the couple\u2019s brief farewell tour, which began when Meghan flew in from Canada, where they are currently based, to join Harry at the Endeavour Fund awards for wounded and sick military veterans at London\u2019s Mansion House on Thursday. If, during their flurry of engagements, there has been time for moments of reflection, or even a little sadness, at what they are leaving behind, there was no trepidation evident in their dazzling smiles to the camera. According to a source close to them, the couple are on \u201cgreat form\u201d. Both are feeling \u201cpositive and excited\u201d at what the future holds, even though events have been somewhat overwhelming since they made their shock announcement in January to step back as working royals and base themselves mainly in north America. They remain \u201c1,000% committed\u201d to their patronages, it is said. In the past couple of days they have had private meetings with organisations they are involved with, and with their staff. After 31 March, this team of 15 \u2013 currently based at Buckingham Palace \u2013 will either be made redundant or redeployed. Meghan, who is said to be \u201cvery happy to be back\u201d, has attended several private meetings. On Thursday, she paid a low-key visit to a hologram exhibit at the National Theatre, as well as a comprehensive school in Dagenham, east London on Friday. On Sunday she will mark International Women\u2019s Day. Meanwhile, Harry joined the Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton to open a museum at the Silverstone circuit, and met staff at his Invictus charity, to which he remains committed. On Saturday the couple will attend the Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall. It will be Harry\u2019s final engagement as Captain General of the Royal Marines, the highest rank of his honorary military titles, which he must now relinquish under terms agreed with the Queen. Agreeing to sever his official military ties will have been painful for Harry, who spent 10 years in the army, and who on Thursday, told veterans he was \u201cdeeply proud to have served alongside you as Capt Wales\u201d. No replacements will appointed to these roles in the 12 months before the couple\u2019s new status is reviewed. \u201cNothing is final,\u201d said the source. \u201cIt was intentionally not binary \u2026 Because this is the great unknown. And, the family wants the best for them.\u201d This was the message the Queen conveyed to her grandson over a private lunch at Windsor Castle last Sunday. The lunch, at Harry\u2019s request, was their first meeting since the Sandringham summit in January, where senior royals thrashed out details of the couple\u2019s new financially independent role.

Got to say that \u201ccontemporary\u201d is obscuring a multitude of sins. After all, the last time Cash wrote in the Mail on Sunday on Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7439103/Society-writer-William-Cash-reveals-Prime-Minister-agreed-let-raise-love-child.html\" title=\"\">he was telling the story </a>of how he tried and failed to bring up one of the prime minister\u2019s secret children for him.

Thanks for letting me know.\u201d \u201cAnd then,\u201d concludes Cash, \u201cwe walked off in different directions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/mar/05/stand-down-experts-celebrities-coronavirus-crisis\">Stand down, experts: celebrities have got coronavirus covered</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lovely people. Anyway, on to Cash\u2019s latest article, which begins at a recent fundraiser. \u201cI was sitting at a table close to Boris Johnson at last week\u2019s Conservative Winter Ball,\u201d writes Cash. Do get your head round the fact that we live in a country where in the midst of our various shitshows, the prime minister was performing for coins mere feet from some guy who once offered to bring up one of his spare kids. Even if The Jeremy Kyle Show hadn\u2019t been axed, this would be a scenario simply too trashy to air. But on we go. \u201cI have a sense that Boris will enjoy his new life,\u201d judges Cash, a man demonstrably not famed for his judgment.</p> <p>At any rate, it\u2019s all part of the great change of pace for Johnson. Think about it: this was a man who once enjoyed the freedom of one of the great capital cities, with a girl in every postcode, and a life of light work and positively buccaneering irresponsibility. But now? Now 55-year-old Johnson has to go to sleep in the same place every night, with two coppers standing outside his bedroom door and a crying baby in the post. (Don\u2019t write in about the newborn magic; I\u2019ve had three of them.) It\u2019s rather perfect.</p> <p>Workwise, instead of a short column and a long lunch, his intray contains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/06/boris-johnson-voters-wednesday-budget-prime-minister\" title=\"\">reaping his own Brexit whirlwind</a>, and a likely global pandemic. So, given we have to take our wry smiles where we can these days, this does resemble a form of poetic justice. Half close your eyes, and you could almost swing from not wanting Boris Johnson to be prime minister to wanting him to be prime minister, just like this, for ever and ever and ever.</p> <p>Never mind \u201clevelling up\u201d; he could end up begging to be levelled down to his old life. If not, and in only mildly metaphorical terms, this could yet turn out to be a story about a Midas character who is \u2013 quite agonisingly \u2013 prime ministered to death.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Thanks for letting me know.\u201d \u201cAnd then,\u201d concludes Cash, \u201cwe walked off in different directions.\u201d Lovely people. Anyway, on to Cash\u2019s latest article, which begins at a recent fundraiser. \u201cI was sitting at a table close to Boris Johnson at last week\u2019s Conservative Winter Ball,\u201d writes Cash. Do get your head round the fact that we live in a country where in the midst of our various shitshows, the prime minister was performing for coins mere feet from some guy who once offered to bring up one of his spare kids. Even if The Jeremy Kyle Show hadn\u2019t been axed, this would be a scenario simply too trashy to air. But on we go. \u201cI have a sense that Boris will enjoy his new life,\u201d judges Cash, a man demonstrably not famed for his judgment. At any rate, it\u2019s all part of the great change of pace for Johnson. Think about it: this was a man who once enjoyed the freedom of one of the great capital cities, with a girl in every postcode, and a life of light work and positively buccaneering irresponsibility. But now? Now 55-year-old Johnson has to go to sleep in the same place every night, with two coppers standing outside his bedroom door and a crying baby in the post. (Don\u2019t write in about the newborn magic; I\u2019ve had three of them.) It\u2019s rather perfect. Workwise, instead of a short column and a long lunch, his intray contains reaping his own Brexit whirlwind, and a likely global pandemic. So, given we have to take our wry smiles where we can these days, this does resemble a form of poetic justice. Half close your eyes, and you could almost swing from not wanting Boris Johnson to be prime minister to wanting him to be prime minister, just like this, for ever and ever and ever. Never mind \u201clevelling up\u201d; he could end up begging to be levelled down to his old life. If not, and in only mildly metaphorical terms, this could yet turn out to be a story about a Midas character who is \u2013 quite agonisingly \u2013 prime ministered to death. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

Part of the collapsed Beales chain, Palmers has been a familiar sight in the seaside resort since 1837 when Garwood Burton Palmer opened a drapery shop.

However, the limit on reductions due to downward phasing meant it was effectively denied a \u00a3230,000 tax cut. Robert Hayton, its head of UK business rates, said abolishing these restrictions would put fairness back into the heart of the system. It was imperative, however, to continue to cap large increases as they acted \u201cas an important shock absorber\u201d, he added. With another business rates review on the cards retailers will be dusting off their submissions while hoping for a different outcome this time round. \u201cEssentially we will be going over old ground with the tough questions having already been asked,\u201d Hayton concludes.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Fiona Bruce has told the Radio Times she has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/fiona-bruce-surprised-at-question-times-level-of-toxicity\">surprised by the toxicity</a> of the Question Time debates. So I can only assume she had never watched the programme when she agreed to take over the presenter\u2019s role from David Dimbleby. For some years now \u2013 not helped by Brexit which still continues to divide the country no matter how much we are told that now is the time for everyone to come together \u2013 Question Time has been a bit of a bear-pit with panels, composed of politicians and professional gobshites, and audiences selected for their capacity to kick lumps out of one another. All of which I am sure is entirely deliberate as it\u2019s the rows that pull in the ratings. QT\u2019s prime aim is to attract viewers and get people mouthing off on Twitter, not stimulate intelligent debate. If anyone ends the hour any better informed, then it\u2019s just an added bonus. A politician not abjectly defending a party line, or a business person or pundit making a nuanced argument are the exception. I\u2019ve never been invited to take part in the programme, but even if I were to be I would turn it down. Partly because I wouldn\u2019t want the stress of being in such a pressured situation \u2013 my anxiety levels are bad enough on the occasions I punish myself by watching it on TV \u2013 but mainly because there are many topics on which I either don\u2019t have a particularly strong opinion or don\u2019t feel sufficiently well-informed to start sounding off. Somehow, I suspect, the producers would be tearing their hair out at a guest whose main contribution was to say, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t really know\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>On my way in to No 10 for the coronavirus press conference, I was rather surprised to find I was the only journalist keen to take advantage of the hand sanitiser on offer by the door. No one else seemed that bothered, even when I pointed it out to them. I\u2019m guessing this could be a function of age. Most of my colleagues are much younger than me while I, approaching my mid 60s, am in what the Daily Mail rather unkindly called \u201cthe Death Zone\u201d. Last week, I rather prematurely wrote about how \u2013 as a professional hypochondriac \u2013 I wasn\u2019t that bothered about the coronavirus as there many more deadly conditions to worry about. Well, all that\u2019s now changed and I am regularly waking up in the middle of the night after the most disturbing anxiety dreams. Not least because I didn\u2019t find the Downing Street press conference altogether reassuring. While it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/05/as-chris-whitty-provides-a-dose-of-reality-boris-is-just-an-annoying-distraction\">refreshing to have the experts back in charge</a>, with the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t rather he was prime minister instead of Boris? \u2013 and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, in command of their subject, able to communicate clearly and treating the country as adults, the information they had to share of a possible 80% infection rate and a 1% mortality rate over a six-month period wasn\u2019t what many of us of a certain age were hoping to hear. That\u2019s a possible 600,000 deaths. It\u2019s all rather taken the gloss off this coming weekend\u2019s visit from my son and his girlfriend who are on their way back from holiday. Because I\u2019m now worried he will give me a hug and kill me.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>We need to talk about Spurs. The season is currently going from bad to worse, with four defeats \u2013 three of them at home \u2013 on the bounce. Nor is it obvious if the team is capable of improvement. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/tottenham-hotspur-norwich-city-fa-cup-fifth-cup-match-report\">FA Cup loss to Norwich</a> marked a new low as no one would easily have identified any of the Spurs\u2019 players as professional footballers. The match ended in a penalty shoot out in which Tottenham contrived to take three of the worst spot kicks ever seen anywhere. The last one was a collector\u2019s item. A gentle pass to the opposition keeper that would have struggled to get over the line. Bizarrely, at the end of the game, the manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, spoke of how brilliant the team had been. In which case, I\u2019d hate to seem them when they were a bit rubbish. I\u2019ve had many low points with Spurs over the years \u2013 part of their attraction is their commitment to letting you down \u2013 but I haven\u2019t felt this way about them since the late 90s. I am beyond despair and into indifference. I was surprised to find that I genuinely was neither that surprised at nor that bothered by losing to Norwich. And I\u2019m far from alone. Sometimes boos can be heard after a bad defeat: the only reaction among fans near me when the last penalty was missed was laughter. Spurs have somehow contrived to build one of the best new stadiums in the country, yet simultaneously destroy both the atmosphere in the ground and one of the best teams I\u2019ve watched in years. As so often at Tottenham, money is the thing that talks loudest and the club knows there are suckers like me who can be relied on to renew our season tickets \u2013 prices inevitably going up, as the football gets worse \u2013 just because we always have. The only way my friend Matthew can cope is by losing himself in the virtual world of Championship Manager. Under his guidance, Spurs have just beaten Barcelona, Christian Eriksen is still with the club and is actually trying, and Tanguy Ndombele has played every minute of every game. It may be fantasy, but I \u2013 and 60,000 others \u2013 would much rather be watching Matthew\u2019s Spurs than Mourinho\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"834512f614b7ed7c0ae1a1cb460dd9b798235523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/834512f614b7ed7c0ae1a1cb460dd9b798235523/0_0_5091_3394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry the cat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry the cat: \u2018Jesus.

A Finnish study of more than 13,740 mutts published in the journal Scientific Reports has found that nearly three-quarters of pets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/05/dog-breeders-urged-to-act-over-high-levels-of-anxiety-in-pets\">display problematic anxiety-related behaviour</a>. Having checked through the symptoms, Herbie appears to be less disturbed than some. I don\u2019t know if he howls when we\u2019re not there \u2013 though I dare say if I had an Alexa I could find out \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t appear too bothered, as he doesn\u2019t chase his tail or trash the place. Neither is he at all aggressive: quite the reverse in fact. He is completely terrorised by the cats who treat him with contempt. My one area of concern with Herbie is his OCD behaviour, though I rather suspect that could be something he has learned from me. We are both at our happiest when we are doing the same things that we always do. On walks we play the same games with sticks and neither of us ever gets bored of them: precisely because we know how they are going to end. Herbie is also still bewildered that the squirrels he chases can disappear by running up trees. Though that could be because he isn\u2019t that bright. He also likes to sleep in the same place each night: on our bed. Still, I will be doing my best to protect him this weekend by preventing him from watching Crufts on TV. He is a very woke dog and he still hasn\u2019t quite come to terms with me telling him some years ago that cockapoos are no platformed for the elite pedigree competition and only allowed in as a novelty act.

      "bodyText": "Monday Fiona Bruce has told the Radio Times she has been surprised by the toxicity of the Question Time debates. So I can only assume she had never watched the programme when she agreed to take over the presenter\u2019s role from David Dimbleby. For some years now \u2013 not helped by Brexit which still continues to divide the country no matter how much we are told that now is the time for everyone to come together \u2013 Question Time has been a bit of a bear-pit with panels, composed of politicians and professional gobshites, and audiences selected for their capacity to kick lumps out of one another. All of which I am sure is entirely deliberate as it\u2019s the rows that pull in the ratings. QT\u2019s prime aim is to attract viewers and get people mouthing off on Twitter, not stimulate intelligent debate. If anyone ends the hour any better informed, then it\u2019s just an added bonus. A politician not abjectly defending a party line, or a business person or pundit making a nuanced argument are the exception. I\u2019ve never been invited to take part in the programme, but even if I were to be I would turn it down. Partly because I wouldn\u2019t want the stress of being in such a pressured situation \u2013 my anxiety levels are bad enough on the occasions I punish myself by watching it on TV \u2013 but mainly because there are many topics on which I either don\u2019t have a particularly strong opinion or don\u2019t feel sufficiently well-informed to start sounding off. Somehow, I suspect, the producers would be tearing their hair out at a guest whose main contribution was to say, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t really know\u201d. Tuesday On my way in to No 10 for the coronavirus press conference, I was rather surprised to find I was the only journalist keen to take advantage of the hand sanitiser on offer by the door. No one else seemed that bothered, even when I pointed it out to them. I\u2019m guessing this could be a function of age. Most of my colleagues are much younger than me while I, approaching my mid 60s, am in what the Daily Mail rather unkindly called \u201cthe Death Zone\u201d. Last week, I rather prematurely wrote about how \u2013 as a professional hypochondriac \u2013 I wasn\u2019t that bothered about the coronavirus as there many more deadly conditions to worry about. Well, all that\u2019s now changed and I am regularly waking up in the middle of the night after the most disturbing anxiety dreams. Not least because I didn\u2019t find the Downing Street press conference altogether reassuring. While it was refreshing to have the experts back in charge, with the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t rather he was prime minister instead of Boris? \u2013 and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, in command of their subject, able to communicate clearly and treating the country as adults, the information they had to share of a possible 80% infection rate and a 1% mortality rate over a six-month period wasn\u2019t what many of us of a certain age were hoping to hear. That\u2019s a possible 600,000 deaths. It\u2019s all rather taken the gloss off this coming weekend\u2019s visit from my son and his girlfriend who are on their way back from holiday. Because I\u2019m now worried he will give me a hug and kill me. Wednesday We need to talk about Spurs. The season is currently going from bad to worse, with four defeats \u2013 three of them at home \u2013 on the bounce. Nor is it obvious if the team is capable of improvement. The FA Cup loss to Norwich marked a new low as no one would easily have identified any of the Spurs\u2019 players as professional footballers. The match ended in a penalty shoot out in which Tottenham contrived to take three of the worst spot kicks ever seen anywhere. The last one was a collector\u2019s item. A gentle pass to the opposition keeper that would have struggled to get over the line. Bizarrely, at the end of the game, the manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, spoke of how brilliant the team had been. In which case, I\u2019d hate to seem them when they were a bit rubbish. I\u2019ve had many low points with Spurs over the years \u2013 part of their attraction is their commitment to letting you down \u2013 but I haven\u2019t felt this way about them since the late 90s. I am beyond despair and into indifference. I was surprised to find that I genuinely was neither that surprised at nor that bothered by losing to Norwich. And I\u2019m far from alone. Sometimes boos can be heard after a bad defeat: the only reaction among fans near me when the last penalty was missed was laughter. Spurs have somehow contrived to build one of the best new stadiums in the country, yet simultaneously destroy both the atmosphere in the ground and one of the best teams I\u2019ve watched in years. As so often at Tottenham, money is the thing that talks loudest and the club knows there are suckers like me who can be relied on to renew our season tickets \u2013 prices inevitably going up, as the football gets worse \u2013 just because we always have. The only way my friend Matthew can cope is by losing himself in the virtual world of Championship Manager. Under his guidance, Spurs have just beaten Barcelona, Christian Eriksen is still with the club and is actually trying, and Tanguy Ndombele has played every minute of every game. It may be fantasy, but I \u2013 and 60,000 others \u2013 would much rather be watching Matthew\u2019s Spurs than Mourinho\u2019s. Thursday It\u2019s the little things that count. After I had spent much of the week enviously eyeing up the hand sanitiser lying around on his desk, my friend Rajeev reached into his bag and brought out another bottle and gave it to me.

      "body": "<h2><strong>SHAKE IT OFF</strong></h2> \n<p>Eager to be seen to be doing something to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, however useless it might be, the Premier League and Football League have decided to dispense with the \u201cFair Play handshake\u201d between players and match officials until further notice. Despite obvious concerns that the absence of these mandatory, utterly insincere and tokenistic pre-match pleasantries, introduced 16 years ago for reasons that still remain unclear, could result in a nationwide pandemic of \u201cunfair play\u201d, the two governing bodies are pressing ahead with an anti-social initiative that will be severely tested during Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby at Old Trafford.</p> \n<p>Finally looking like something resembling a half-decent team following the January arrival of Bruno Fernandes, United host bitter rivals City, whose boss Pep Guardiola has been flying in the face of medical experts by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/06/pep-guardiola-expects-incredibly-aggressive-manchester-united-in-derby-city\">blowing smoke up his opposite number\u2019s nether regions</a> in the buildup to what could be a decidedly spicy encounter. \u201cFrom what I saw they follow [Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r] absolutely,\u201d trilled Pep. \u201cThey\u2019re getting better. Right now is maybe their best moment of the season.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/06/pep-guardiola-expects-incredibly-aggressive-manchester-united-in-derby-city\">Pep Guardiola expects 'incredibly aggressive' Manchester United in derby</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Asked if he was concerned about the likelihood of trouble at the game, after United midfielder Fred was hit by a missile thrown from the stands during the closing stages of their win at the Etihad in December, Pep was more circumspect. \u201cWe have to try to behave good as managers and professionals and then as supporters,\u201d he tooted, as mobile phone footage of cerebrally challenged knuckleheads \u2013 who\u2019d taken time out of their evening to wait by the United team coach and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/06/manchester-united-condemn-apparent-racist-abuse-of-jesse-lingard-at-derby\">relentlessly eff and jeff at Jesse Lingard</a>, while also appearing to racially abuse the midfielder, following his side\u2019s FA Cup win at Derby County \u2013 circulated on assorted social media disgraces.</p> \n<p>While it remains unclear whether the troglodytes in question are home or away fans, United are understood to be furious that their player was subjected to such appalling brickbats. They plan to enlist the help of both the Rams and local constabulary in a bid to identify the culprits, who are hopefully trembling with fear in their parents\u2019 spare bedroom as they contemplate whatever unpleasantness is about to be visited upon them. You don\u2019t need to be a virologist to know that washing their filthy pottymouth mouths out with soap and water might not halt the spread of such toxic abuse, but it might help to slow it down.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cFollowing unacceptable behaviour of the Ultras supporters group over a number of games this season we have taken the decision to ban this group from home games.

      "bodyText": "SHAKE IT OFF Eager to be seen to be doing something to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, however useless it might be, the Premier League and Football League have decided to dispense with the \u201cFair Play handshake\u201d between players and match officials until further notice. Despite obvious concerns that the absence of these mandatory, utterly insincere and tokenistic pre-match pleasantries, introduced 16 years ago for reasons that still remain unclear, could result in a nationwide pandemic of \u201cunfair play\u201d, the two governing bodies are pressing ahead with an anti-social initiative that will be severely tested during Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby at Old Trafford. Finally looking like something resembling a half-decent team following the January arrival of Bruno Fernandes, United host bitter rivals City, whose boss Pep Guardiola has been flying in the face of medical experts by blowing smoke up his opposite number\u2019s nether regions in the buildup to what could be a decidedly spicy encounter. \u201cFrom what I saw they follow [Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r] absolutely,\u201d trilled Pep. \u201cThey\u2019re getting better. Right now is maybe their best moment of the season.\u201d Asked if he was concerned about the likelihood of trouble at the game, after United midfielder Fred was hit by a missile thrown from the stands during the closing stages of their win at the Etihad in December, Pep was more circumspect. \u201cWe have to try to behave good as managers and professionals and then as supporters,\u201d he tooted, as mobile phone footage of cerebrally challenged knuckleheads \u2013 who\u2019d taken time out of their evening to wait by the United team coach and relentlessly eff and jeff at Jesse Lingard, while also appearing to racially abuse the midfielder, following his side\u2019s FA Cup win at Derby County \u2013 circulated on assorted social media disgraces. While it remains unclear whether the troglodytes in question are home or away fans, United are understood to be furious that their player was subjected to such appalling brickbats. They plan to enlist the help of both the Rams and local constabulary in a bid to identify the culprits, who are hopefully trembling with fear in their parents\u2019 spare bedroom as they contemplate whatever unpleasantness is about to be visited upon them. You don\u2019t need to be a virologist to know that washing their filthy pottymouth mouths out with soap and water might not halt the spread of such toxic abuse, but it might help to slow it down. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cFollowing unacceptable behaviour of the Ultras supporters group over a number of games this season we have taken the decision to ban this group from home games. They will be able to gain entry individually if accompanied by a parent\u201d \u2013 as pay-offs on club statements go, this from Fort William is quite the zinger. RECOMMENDED LISTENING The latest Football Weekly Extra podcast is right here. Meanwhile, tickets are also on sale for the next live show in London. FIVER LETTERS \u201cIf John Caley (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) is unhappy at the repetition of tired jokes aimed at easy targets, then I would suggest The Fiver isn\u2019t for him. Although, interestingly, he appears to have been fine with the main body of the article, containing \u2018fresh\u2019 material such as \u2018Lovren\u2019s not very good\u2019, and \u2018Devon Loch\u2019, and only seems to have taken offence when the \u2018humour\u2019 was directed at his club\u201d \u2013 Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019ll understand if your offering is a bit tardy today, what with the celebration. I hope no one died\u201d \u2013 Neil Austin. \u201cEric Dier\u2019s (apparently) admirable detour into the stands (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) might have been dramatic, but he\u2019s got a long way to go to beat flamin\u2019 Australian Rules footballer John Bourke\u201d \u2013 Gary Walsh. \u201cSo half of yesterday\u2019s Fiver was spent describing a Spurs player who arrived about 10 minutes too late to avert potential danger. Surely that\u2019s not news?\u201d \u2013 Justin Kavanagh. \u201cIn yesterday\u2019s Still Want Mores, you had a story around Billy Gilmour, noting him as next off the Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea conveyor belt. Given that Gilmour spent eight years at the Pope\u2019s O\u2019Rangers before joining FLC in 2017, can it really be called a FLC conveyor belt, or would it be more like a stepping stool?\u201d \u2013 Paul Dixon. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Paul Dixon, who bags a copy of Premier League Nuggets, by Richard Foster. We\u2019ve got one more to give away, so get scribbling. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Matches in Denmark are the latest to go behind closed doors due to coronavirus, while an Everton suit reckons the spread means the Premier League matches may follow. \u201cWe feel it is quite likely it may happen in the coming weeks,\u201d said Sasha Ryazantsev. Big Phil Neville put a very Big Phil Neville spin on England\u2019s 2-0 defeat by USA! USA!! USA!!! in the SheBelieves Cup. \u201cIt feels as if we are so close but yet so far at this moment in time,\u201d he blathered. He then said this of 19-year-old Lauren Hemp: \u201cShe\u2019s literally a bull.\u201d He really did. Manchester United can beat City in the derby if they don\u2019t lose it like they did in the Rumbelows Cup, according to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cFor 15 minutes definitely, our heads went for a spell there \u2026 we\u2019ve learned from that,\u201d he soothed. Meanwhile, a City medical bod will prod Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s shoulder-knack to see if he is fit enough to play on Sunday. Bar\u00e7a boss Quique Seti\u00e9n has apologised to his squad for the choice language (you really will want to click on this transcript here) used by his assistant manager Eder Sarabia in the cl\u00e1sico. \u201cWe apologised to everyone [in our squad], we cannot behave like that,\u201d sniffed Seti\u00e9n. \u201cThis situation has affected me a lot, because I am concerned about the image of the club.\u201d Mikel Arteta will sit down for a cosy chat with Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang at the end of the season to see if he can stop him from legging it out of the Arsenal door marked Do One. And Mr Roy, 178, has extended his Crystal Palace contract until the end of next season. \u201cEveryone knows how I feel about the club that I supported as a boy,\u201d he Robbie Keaned. STILL WANT MORE? \u201cIn Scotland people sweep sectarianism under the carpet\u201d: this Steve Clarke interview by Ewan Murray is well worth a read. Suzanne Wrack on why there is something for England fans to be cheerful. Where\u2019s my 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend, you ask? Relax, it\u2019s here. After Eric Dier snapped, it\u2019s time to turn the spotlight on the pieces of work dishing out abuse too, writes David Hytner. Norwich, Sheffield United and two divergent paths this season. By Paul Wilson. Playing in Europe expands your football horizons. And Eni Aluko should know. Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate will set their friendship aside when Charlton and Boro meet in a relegation dust-up on Saturday, reports Louise Taylor.

However when lower- and middle-class incomes have been stagnant for decades, nearly 140 million adults report \u201cmedical financial hardship\u201d every year, life expectancy is in decline as personal, mortgage and college debt continues to rise, this foundation starts to crumble. Surveys show the national sense of wellbeing has declined. Key indicators like these were what the Soviet leadership chose to ignore when they decided they would rather retain Brezhnev in senility or choose Chernenko months away from death than confront the challenge of domestic reform. This is where this \u201cserious joke\u201d gets really serious. Biden \u2013 if he survives the media- and Republican-led onslaught that will highlight every agonising mental blank as closely as Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2013 could actually win in November. Head to head polls in swing states show this electability. But those now rushing to endorse him have to be honest themselves about what kind of presidency this will be \u2013 a kind of caretaker government that will swear fealty to superpower myths, and ignore the immense structural problems hollowing out the nation\u2019s strength from within because they are too hard. \u2022 Ben Judah is the author of This is London and Fragile Empire",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s largest cinema chain says fears over the spread of coronavirus have not yet significantly impacted ticket sales, despite a 20% fall in its shares over the past two days. Following news on Wednesday that the release of new James Bond film No Time to Die would be pushed back from April to November, Cineworld\u2019s shares fell 13%. A further 7% decline was registered on Thursday as concerns continued to grow, leading to some analysts suggesting that globally there would be a minimum loss of $5bn on the film industry. Meanwhile AMC, the world\u2019s largest cinema chain, has seen a 30% drop in shares over the past fortnight. A spokesperson for Cineworld, which owns multiplexes throughout Europe as well as UK arthouse chain Picturehouse Cinemas, pointed to the fact that most releases remain on track, with studios apparently reluctant to change schedules unless it becomes absolutely necessary. \u201cAdmissions remain high,\u201d Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK cinema association told the Guardian. \u201cIn line with the advice given by the deputy chief medical officer this week, all sites will remain open,\u201d he said. A similar defiance was demonstrated by the Cannes film festival, which said it remained committed to proceeding as planned in mid-May. On Thursday, the French government extended a ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until the end of May. \u201c[These] instructions don\u2019t concern the festival,\u201d a spokesperson said, \u201cas we are never more than 5,000 in one enclosed space. As of today, nothing indicates the festival will not take place.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a confidence thing,\u201d one industry source added. \u201cYou can\u2019t start saying you\u2019re worried. It has to be very on until it\u2019s suddenly very off. In part, that\u2019s just a legal and insurance thing.\u201d More than 12,000 delegates attended Cannes last year, but the largest cinema at the Palais des Festivals seats only 2,300. Invitations to the Cannes lineup press conference in Paris on 16 April were sent out on Friday morning. No mention was made of any uncertainty; instead the invite noted that \u201caccreditations continue at an intensive pace\u201d as requests are up 9% from last year. Cannes regained credibility as a launchpad when three of its 2019 premieres \u2013 Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire \u2013 performed well during awards season. This followed a couple of underpowered editions for the festival in which its programme was overshadowed by Cannes film festival director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux\u2019s row with Netflix, whose films he barred from awards eligibility. Pressure on festival directors not to skip a year would therefore be considerable, despite both unsettling government advice and increasing industry precedent. On 4 March, organisers of the Cannes MIPTV content market \u2013 which also takes place in the Palais \u2013 announced they were cancelling this year. Forty of France\u2019s cinemas have been closed and the number of confirmed cases in the Cannes area has reached double figures. More than half of Italy\u2019s cinemas are closed and regulations prohibit people from sitting less than a metre away from each other in public. Mario Lorini, president of ANEC, the national association of exhibitors, has unveiled a system he hopes would comply and enable cinemas to remain open: allowing the booking of every third seat in a row, with empty seats directly in front and behind. Lorini said his team had been \u201cworking round the clock\u201d to try to make the plan viable. On Friday the International Indian Film Academy Awards were postponed because of \u201csensitivity\u201d over the mounting health crisis. Originally due to take place on 27 March, the annual gala is Bollywood\u2019s version of the Oscars. The inaugural Red Sea international film festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was cancelled earlier in the week, and increasing numbers of attendants \u2013 including Amazon and Apple \u2013 have withdrawn from the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. SXSW has a significant film sidebar, and is still scheduled to take place for 10 days from 13 March. But it is the mainstream end of the film industry which is likely to be hit hardest by the spread of coronavirus, while smaller films and streaming sites such as Netflix could be set for an unexpected boost. MGM\u2019s decision to delay the release of the Bond film was applauded by many, despite a potential $50m bill to cover logistics \u2013 as well as costs and share falls for the many sponsors whose tie-in campaigns have already begun. Momentum was built by the release of Billie Eilish\u2019s theme song last month, as well as a $4.5m Super Bowl advert, that will be chalked up to long-lead brand awareness. Had MGM stuck to its original date, estimates suggest that there would be a minimum 30% reduction to a global box-office take that was anticipated to top $1bn. In earmarking an alternative window quickly, the studio has bought dominance over a key date in the cinema-going calendar \u2013 No Time to Die opens in the US over Thanksgiving weekend \u2013 while the seven-month hiatus allows time to redraw plans. \u201cThat feels like a safe amount of breathing room,\u201d said a source close to the production. \u201cTentpole movies live or die on large audiences going out of their houses and watching them in cinemas with hundreds of other people. Right now, nobody wants to do that.\u201d \u201cIn China infections seem to have peaked but you can\u2019t see them opening cinemas before June,\u201d said another industry insider, \u201cnor people being keen to go for a while after that. Add three months for the rest of the world and November starts looking very attractive.\u201d Widespread cinema closures across China, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan and South Korea have already done drastic damage to the global box office, with one consulting firm suggesting that the loss during China\u2019s new year holiday alone amounts to around $1bn. Among projected big-hitters yet to be released in China\u2019s 70,000 screens are Dolittle, Sonic the Hedgehog and Oscar contenders such as 1917, Marriage Story, Jojo Rabbit and Little Women. When cinemas do reopen, the backlog will cause further delays and local titles will be prioritised. Bond\u2019s distributors did not directly mention coronavirus in their Wednesday statement, instead saying that the decision had been taken after \u201ccareful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace\u201d. Two-thirds of the money made by Bond movies comes from outside the US, with east Asia increasingly courted by Hollywood producers. Forthcoming blockbusters such as Mulan \u2013 whose $200m budget makes it Disney\u2019s most expensive live-action remake yet \u2013 and the ninth Fast and Furious film are highly reliant on Asian markets for their profits. The Chinese premiere of Mulan was cancelled some weeks ago and updates are anticipated from Disney on any changes to the worldwide launch, which is currently still scheduled for 27 March. Early estimates suggest that Mulan\u2019s US opening weekend may still manage a $90m take, with some crediting coronavirus\u2019s reportedly less dramatic impact on children as one reason that family films may not suffer as much as their adult counterparts. How Mulan fares will have substantial implications for the strategy surrounding Disney\u2019s first blockbuster of the year: Avengers spin-off Black Widow, which is meant to open worldwide at the start of May. Should these films flop, many forecast a domino effect as studios scramble to reschedule tentpole releases. F9, Scooby-Doo movie Scoob!, Wonder Woman 1984 and Netflix\u2019s Eurovision movie are all early summer releases whose release dates look vulnerable. Production disruption is already considerable, with Paramount halting a planned shoot in Venice on Mission: Impossible VII last week citing \u201cconcerns of the crew\u201d. \u201cWho is going to underwrite a movie which goes into production next week?\u201d queried one source. \u201cIf an actor is due on set in say, late March, their agent might well forbid them from working, saying it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d Nervousness was demonstrated by talent agency CAA on Wednesday when it clamped down on anything other than virtual meetings. The same day, Sony Pictures\u2019 offices in London, Paris and Poland were shut for the remainder of the week after a UK employee was feared to have been exposed to the virus while travelling abroad. Paramount is, however, pressing ahead with the release of the sequel A Quiet Place Part II on 20 March. Just a 10th of the original film\u2019s $340m take came from China; the curious parallels between the plot \u2013 a family self-isolates to try to survive \u2013 perhaps boosting its box office appeal among populations relatively unaffected by illness. Contingency plans for mid-range releases may involve fast-tracking them to streaming services, where there is likely to be a substantial appetite from a captive at-home audience. Water-cooler titles such as Promising Young Woman \u2013 in which Carey Mulligan feigns drunkenness on nights out before taking bloody revenge on men who attempt to take advantage of her \u2013 are thought to be prime candidates for films that could do well online, if a cinema release appears optimistic. However, legacy inertia could make such innovation challenging. \u201cThe ecosystem of release strategies would be really damaged by that kind of thing,\u201d said one source. \u201cEverything is booked and lined up already. I don\u2019t know if that tactic has real financial merit.\u201d The industry\u2019s structural makeup may also prove problematic, with studios and exhibitors prizing competition over collaboration, meaning strategy communication is limited. \u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory,\u201d said one source, \u201cbut that also means there are lots of opportunities out there if streamers can move quickly.\u201d Representatives for Netflix and Amazon did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment, but a boom in users and dwell time over the coming weeks appears likely. Even long-established studios are seeing silver linings online. Contagion, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s unfortunately prescient 2011 thriller about the global outbreak of a deadly virus, has proved such a viral hit over recent weeks that it\u2019s already Warner Bros\u2019 second-best-performing film of 2020.",

But her campaign to become Labour\u2019s first female leader has been a bumpy one, laced with frustration for her followers. There is some disappointment among her supporters that more has not been made of the expected joint-ticket bid with deputy leadership candidate Angela Rayner, who is also her flatmate when they are in London. The idea just hasn\u2019t taken off. The entry of Richard Burgon into the deputy leadership race, who is unashamedly marketing himself as Corbyn\u2019s successor with a raft of fresh policies, has infuriated some of her backers. They think his ideas, including balloting members on military action and creating a Tony Benn University, trivialise the left and Corbyn\u2019s legacy, sweeping her up along with it. Another irritation for her campaign has been the perpetual criticism that she is being directed by men. She has been described as a docker\u2019s daughter, the puppet of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, or Corbyn, or the Momentum founder Jon Lansman, who is now her leadership campaign chief. She has tried to make light of it; she joked about even being the pope\u2019s puppet, after her Catholic religion and views on abortion became an issue earlier in the campaign. She is personally uncomfortable with terminations beyond the 24-week limit in the event of a severe foetal abnormality, over concerns raised by disability rights groups, but has never sought to restrict abortion law on this matter. She supports a woman\u2019s right to choose. A union source admitted to the Guardian that Long-Bailey had let far too many men dominate her campaign, adding that it was like watching Labour\u2019s version of Judy Garland, being led continuously by male decision-makers. Yet there is no shortage of people who will attest to Long-Bailey\u2019s hard work, devotion to the party and distinctly low-key and policy-focused form of socialism. She read the Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists when she was younger, cites her favourite politician as the late Frank Allaun, the MP for Salford East, who she has said was \u201cquiet and unassuming and true to his beliefs\u201d. This diligence to whatever task comes her way has often led to comments that Long-Bailey is dull. Much was made of her ordinary-sounding \u201cdream Friday night\u201d in her pyjamas with a Chinese takeaway and Netflix. It\u2019s not all cosy nights in, though.

Now, her green new deal is a flagship policy of the party. She also likes to keep her political friends on their toes, adding that her particular forte is wryly pointing out inconsistencies in someone\u2019s statement or actions. Laura Smith, the former Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich, explained how Long-Bailey had always been a strong support to her and texted throughout the night of the December general election, checking in on the collapse of the red wall in punishing real time. Smith\u2019s marginal leave-voting seat turned blue again just two years after she had won it on the wave of Corbyn\u2019s popularity. \u201cShe was devastated for me when I lost,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBecky had been in touch with me constantly during the election.

When Smith was elected on to Cheshire East council in a byelection last week, Long-Bailey was one of the first people to get in touch and celebrate. Smith said: \u201cNothing against Keir, but as soon as women go for a position of power or leader people try to make out like she\u2019s vulnerable and being controlled by a number of men. That\u2019s rubbish. She\u2019s a strong person.\u201d Long-Bailey is not described as tribal but it cannot be ignored that some MPs feel she is in the frontbench bubble. A colleague, also from the north-west, said her diligence and potential were not in question, but, because she was with Unite from the very beginning of her political career, and then into Corbyn\u2019s team, she had missed a few vital rungs on the ladder. They pointed out that she did not have a wide network of friends across parliament beyond Angela Rayner and another MP, Cat Smith, and her immediate staffers, because she had never been a jobbing backbencher nor socialised beyond her tight circle. They also took offence at so much being made of her Stakhanovite work ethic, particularly the story of her staying up all night to work on the party\u2019s response to the finance bill, when former MP Robert Marris unexpectedly quit the party\u2019s treasury team. \u201cStuff like that happens all the time \u2013 that\u2019s the slog of opposition. People do leave and you\u2019re left being the sole portfolio holder,\u201d they said. One MP from the 2019 intake said she must have failed \u201csocialist Tinder\u201d as she had never met Long-Bailey or been courted for her support at the start of the campaign. \u201cSomeone must have taken one look at me online and swiped left, thinking I wasn\u2019t worth bothering with,\u201d she said. Another new MP said: \u201cNo one from Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign approached me and I\u2019d made a conscious effort to show when I started that I wasn\u2019t obviously attached to any group. \u201cNot like Emily Thornberry, who must have jumped out at me from every single column in this building to try to speak to me. She probably stopped me about five times.\u201d Long-Bailey presents the enduring conundrum in politics, the balance between policy and personality. Those close to her are effusive about her loyalty, wit, kindness and relatable normality. Yet even fans would say the intensely policy-focused, business-suited candidate is all that people see.

It could make it not only difficult but expensive,\u201d Provost said.</p> <p>Many of those selling dog merchandise said crowds were sparser than usual on Thursday.</p> <p>Kelly Clifford, a sales manager for the sustainable dog food brand Beco Pets, said the event was \u201cvery quiet\u201d, while Angela Pinder, who owns the cruelty-free pet grooming product range Paw Naturel, said she had been surprised by the lack of footfall.</p> <p>Elain MacDonald, preening her shih-tzu Willow\u2019s impressively sleek hairdo in between competitions, said she had been coming to Crufts since 1976 but had \u201cnever seen it like this\u201d.</p> <p>Although more than 160,000 people are expected to attend the event over the weekend, a Kennel Club spokesperson confirmed ticket sales had been down on usual numbers, and that some ticket holders may not have attended on Thursday because of coronavirus fears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34d751f376f08a80cd8ddeb127f0a6edc4c070dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34d751f376f08a80cd8ddeb127f0a6edc4c070dd/62_0_4278_2567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A visitor wears a face mask at Crufts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A visitor wears a face mask at Crufts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier in the week, the major sponsors, Royal Canin and James Wellbeloved, pulled their staff from Crufts in line with a temporary policy that they should only attend large events if it is \u201cbusiness critical\u201d.</p> <p>Inga Finsell, a spectator from Eastbourne, who has been attending Crufts for more than 40 years, seemed unfazed. \u201cIt\u2019s nice because it\u2019s a lot quieter because people haven\u2019t come.

      "bodyText": "As Frankie strutted along the astroturf at Crufts on Thursday, the cheers from the crowd were notably muted. The miniature poodle, who won the utility group presentation in which dogs are assessed on their weight and measurements, could be mistaken for looking slightly dejected. Much has been written about the impact of Brexit on education and the arts, but few have been concerned about another industry affected by new immigration rules: the world of canine performance competitions. Crufts, the world\u2019s biggest dog show, held at Birmingham\u2019s NEC Arena, experienced a significant drop in overseas dog entries this year, with organisers blaming the fall on Britain\u2019s recent departure from the EU. There are 19,696 dogs taking part this year, down from 20,395 in 2019. Of those 700 absentees, 63% (440) would have been overseas dogs, which make up 3,171 of those competing over the weekend. As the first agility contests got under way, several rows of seats in the arena stood empty, and stallholders noted the venue\u2019s halls were less busy than usual. The Kennel Club, which organises Crufts, said notification from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that travel regulations for pets would remain the same during the Brexit transition period was only received after entries had closed on 20 January. A spokesperson said: \u201cCrufts is a British institution with an international feel and is a great celebration of dogs, regardless of where they live. \u201cAs with many areas of British life, the future movement of dogs across the Channel in a post-Brexit world is a concern, and many dog owners \u2013 who needed to enter the Crufts by 20 January \u2013 could have been put off by the uncertainty around pet travel.\u201d This year, 42 overseas countries will take part in the gundog, working and pastoral, terrier and hound, and toy and utility categories, down from a peak of 55 in 2017. Kathleen Roosens, from Belgium, who owns last year\u2019s best in show winner, said she believed Brexit was the only reason fewer Europeans were entering Crufts. \u201cSome people I spoke to feared they needed rabies tests, and others didn\u2019t enter because of not knowing what \u2018worse case\u2019 could be,\u201d said Roosens, who won best in breed for Papillons on Thursday with her dog Simon, the brother of last year\u2019s winner, Dylan. Until 31 December 2020, when the transition period ends, dogs will still be able to travel to the show without quarantine using a passport introduced under the pet travel scheme in 2002. After that, new arrangements for pets to travel around the EU will be made by the government. Annick Provost, 57, a bus driver from Belgium, said if regulations were to be toughened, she could be priced out of the competition. On Saturday, she is heading to Crufts for the 30th time to compete in a breeds competition with her Irish wolfhound Erin. \u201c[After December] we hope they will only ask for a blood test in a recognised lab, then the dog will be fine to come over, but we are not sure. It could make it not only difficult but expensive,\u201d Provost said. Many of those selling dog merchandise said crowds were sparser than usual on Thursday. Kelly Clifford, a sales manager for the sustainable dog food brand Beco Pets, said the event was \u201cvery quiet\u201d, while Angela Pinder, who owns the cruelty-free pet grooming product range Paw Naturel, said she had been surprised by the lack of footfall. Elain MacDonald, preening her shih-tzu Willow\u2019s impressively sleek hairdo in between competitions, said she had been coming to Crufts since 1976 but had \u201cnever seen it like this\u201d. Although more than 160,000 people are expected to attend the event over the weekend, a Kennel Club spokesperson confirmed ticket sales had been down on usual numbers, and that some ticket holders may not have attended on Thursday because of coronavirus fears. Earlier in the week, the major sponsors, Royal Canin and James Wellbeloved, pulled their staff from Crufts in line with a temporary policy that they should only attend large events if it is \u201cbusiness critical\u201d. Inga Finsell, a spectator from Eastbourne, who has been attending Crufts for more than 40 years, seemed unfazed. \u201cIt\u2019s nice because it\u2019s a lot quieter because people haven\u2019t come. It was miserable trying to get around last year,\u201d Finsell said.",

BBC insiders confirmed that discussions had taken place on whether the brand should once again have a presence on traditional television but said no final decision had been taken. A spokesperson said a report in the Daily Mail that suggested a return was on the cards was \u201cspeculation\u201d, but did not rule it out. Any move to return BBC Three to screens or boost the resources of its commissioning team would likely mean savings need to be made elsewhere at the BBC, with the arts and history channel BBC Four considered a potential candidate for cuts.

The corporation said the move would save tens of millions of pounds a year, helping it to reduce its spending in line with cuts imposed by the government after 2010. Much of the channel\u2019s budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three became an online-only commissioning strand in the belief that younger audiences were better reached online.

      "body": "<p>Thousands of children and teenagers in England are being admitted to hospital for sleep disorders, with admissions for conditions such as insomnia almost doubling in seven years.</p> <p>Experts have described the situation as a hidden public health problem, putting it down to rising obesity levels, excessive use of social media before bedtime and a mental health crisis engulfing young people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/06/hard-to-calm-down-one-parent-child-sleep-ipad-phone\">'He finds it hard to calm down': one parent's fight to get her child to sleep</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian analysed data from NHS Digital, the national information and technology partner to the health and social care system in England, which revealed that hospital admissions for under-16s with a primary diagnosis of sleep disorder rose from 6,549 in 2012-13 to 9,451 in 2017-18 and 11,313 in 2018-19.</p> <p>By comparison, sleep disorder admissions for all ages rose only slightly between 2012-13 and 2018-19, from 29,511 to 30,098.</p> <p>Vicki Dawson, the founder of the NHS Doncaster-funded Children\u2019s Sleep Charity, the only free specialist service that provides support to families for children\u2019s sleep, said the organisation had been inundated with requests from families seeking help.</p> <p>\u201cWe find it hard to meet the demand due to our very limited resources,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rise will be linked to a number of factors, firstly, sleep-disordered breathing issues in children which is linked to obesity. It is commonly recognised that there is a problem around childhood obesity in the UK. What isn\u2019t recognised is that poor sleep quality can be a driver for it, impacting on the release of hormones that manage appetite and hunger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-06T14:40:50/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph: child sleeping disorder admissions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-06T14:40:50/embed.html\">Graph: child sleeping disorder admissions</a> </figure>  <p>Dawson said another area where they were seeing a significant rise was in children\u2019s mental health issues \u201cand again there is a strong link between anxiety and sleep deprivation. Unfortunately sleep is not on the public health agenda despite the huge impact it has on all areas of wellbeing, and when it goes wrong there aren\u2019t specialist services for families to access.\u201d</p> <p>Dawson also noted that screen activity played a role, saying there was \u201ca real lack of understanding around the impact that screens can have on sleep\u201d. Some research suggests the light from screens can suppress the sleep hormone melatonin, she said.</p> <p>The NHS data is for sleep conditions that were severe enough to warrant admission to hospital. This meant they were under the care of the hospital, as opposed to being an outpatient visiting for an appointment, and wereusually given a bed, even if they didn\u2019t end up staying overnight.</p> <p>Most of the admissions were for <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnoea/\">sleep apnoea</a>, a serious disorder that occurs when breathing is interrupted at night. Numbers for young people\u2019s admissions reached 7,557 in 2016-17, up from 5,675 in 2012-13.</p> <p>Obstructive sleep apnoea, the main affliction of sleep apnoea, is a potentially serious disorder that causes breathing to repeatedly stop during sleep. It happens when the throat muscles intermittently relax and block the airway.</p> <p>If obstructive sleep apnoea is not treated, it can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure, a stroke or heart attack.</p> <p>Sleep apnoea has many different possible causes. In adults, the most common cause of obstructive sleep apnoea is excess weight and obesity.</p> <p>At Millpond Sleep Clinic, a private children\u2019s clinic in London, the founder, Mandy Gurney, said the Guardian\u2019s findings were \u201cvery worrying\u201d and appeared to be linked to \u201cthe ever increasing rise in obesity rates in children\u201d.</p> <p>Gurney said research shows not sleeping well also creates an imbalance in our hunger hormones, ghrelin and leptin. \u201cHigh levels of ghrelin mean we are likely to eat more often, and low levels of leptin mean we find it hard to recognise when we\u2019re full. Due to changes in our neural pathways in the brain, when we\u2019re tired we are also more likely to make poor food choices, such as sugary, fatty and salty foods. So it becomes a vicious cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Rachael Taylor, the founder of the Sleep Sanctuary, said the rise in admissions could be because of a range of factors, including the explosion and reliance on personal technology by teenagers and younger children.</p> <p>\u201cThe blue light emitted from phone, tablet, computer and TV screens disrupts natural melatonin production, which inhibits sleep. I\u2019m increasingly seeing more and more young children sent to bed with a screen to help them fall asleep, when it is in fact disrupting their sleep and making falling asleep more difficult,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Taylor also noted the rise of anxiety, which she said was at the heart of a number of sleep difficulties and sleep disorders and could in part be \u201cattributed to the increasing pressures and expectations placed on our young people, an over-reliance on social media, and the creation of a 24/7 culture\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a Childwise survey found that more than half of children say they sleep with their mobile phone beside their bed. </p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/02/rise-in-melatonin-use-to-help-children-sleep-leads-to-safety-warning\">has previously reported</a> on the lengths parents go to to help their children sleep, including giving them melatonin. Produced naturally by the body in dark environments to help sleep preparations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/02/melatonin-the-bodys-natural-sleep-promoting-hormone\">melatonin</a> has been authorised for use by people aged over 55. It has been hailed as a less addictive alternative to insomnia drug treatments.</p> <p>The number of children and young people being given the hormone has risen year on year, increasing by 25% from 92,511 prescriptions in 2015-16 to the most recent full-year figure. But specialists have expressed concern about it being given to children \u201coff label\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/29/melatonin-prescribed-children-fashionable-treatment-sleep-experts-warn\">with little knowledge of the long-term safety or side-effects</a>.</p> <p>An NHS spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThese figures show that more must be done to limit the dangerous drivers of poor health, including the increasing use of social media and the rising levels of childhood obesity.</p> <p>\u201cOur <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/the-nhs-long-term-plan?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0aqfmPuF6AIVWODtCh0IyQv9EAAYASAAEgJbm_D_BwE\">NHS Long Term Plan</a> sets out ambitious action to transform care for children, supported by record investment, but while the NHS is playing its part, other industries must step up to protect our young people\u2019s health.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of children and teenagers in England are being admitted to hospital for sleep disorders, with admissions for conditions such as insomnia almost doubling in seven years. Experts have described the situation as a hidden public health problem, putting it down to rising obesity levels, excessive use of social media before bedtime and a mental health crisis engulfing young people. The Guardian analysed data from NHS Digital, the national information and technology partner to the health and social care system in England, which revealed that hospital admissions for under-16s with a primary diagnosis of sleep disorder rose from 6,549 in 2012-13 to 9,451 in 2017-18 and 11,313 in 2018-19. By comparison, sleep disorder admissions for all ages rose only slightly between 2012-13 and 2018-19, from 29,511 to 30,098. Vicki Dawson, the founder of the NHS Doncaster-funded Children\u2019s Sleep Charity, the only free specialist service that provides support to families for children\u2019s sleep, said the organisation had been inundated with requests from families seeking help. \u201cWe find it hard to meet the demand due to our very limited resources,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rise will be linked to a number of factors, firstly, sleep-disordered breathing issues in children which is linked to obesity. It is commonly recognised that there is a problem around childhood obesity in the UK. What isn\u2019t recognised is that poor sleep quality can be a driver for it, impacting on the release of hormones that manage appetite and hunger.\u201d Dawson said another area where they were seeing a significant rise was in children\u2019s mental health issues \u201cand again there is a strong link between anxiety and sleep deprivation. Unfortunately sleep is not on the public health agenda despite the huge impact it has on all areas of wellbeing, and when it goes wrong there aren\u2019t specialist services for families to access.\u201d Dawson also noted that screen activity played a role, saying there was \u201ca real lack of understanding around the impact that screens can have on sleep\u201d. Some research suggests the light from screens can suppress the sleep hormone melatonin, she said. The NHS data is for sleep conditions that were severe enough to warrant admission to hospital. This meant they were under the care of the hospital, as opposed to being an outpatient visiting for an appointment, and wereusually given a bed, even if they didn\u2019t end up staying overnight. Most of the admissions were for sleep apnoea, a serious disorder that occurs when breathing is interrupted at night. Numbers for young people\u2019s admissions reached 7,557 in 2016-17, up from 5,675 in 2012-13. Obstructive sleep apnoea, the main affliction of sleep apnoea, is a potentially serious disorder that causes breathing to repeatedly stop during sleep. It happens when the throat muscles intermittently relax and block the airway. If obstructive sleep apnoea is not treated, it can increase the risk of developing high blood pressure, a stroke or heart attack. Sleep apnoea has many different possible causes. In adults, the most common cause of obstructive sleep apnoea is excess weight and obesity. At Millpond Sleep Clinic, a private children\u2019s clinic in London, the founder, Mandy Gurney, said the Guardian\u2019s findings were \u201cvery worrying\u201d and appeared to be linked to \u201cthe ever increasing rise in obesity rates in children\u201d. Gurney said research shows not sleeping well also creates an imbalance in our hunger hormones, ghrelin and leptin. \u201cHigh levels of ghrelin mean we are likely to eat more often, and low levels of leptin mean we find it hard to recognise when we\u2019re full. Due to changes in our neural pathways in the brain, when we\u2019re tired we are also more likely to make poor food choices, such as sugary, fatty and salty foods. So it becomes a vicious cycle.\u201d Rachael Taylor, the founder of the Sleep Sanctuary, said the rise in admissions could be because of a range of factors, including the explosion and reliance on personal technology by teenagers and younger children. \u201cThe blue light emitted from phone, tablet, computer and TV screens disrupts natural melatonin production, which inhibits sleep. I\u2019m increasingly seeing more and more young children sent to bed with a screen to help them fall asleep, when it is in fact disrupting their sleep and making falling asleep more difficult,\u201d she said. Taylor also noted the rise of anxiety, which she said was at the heart of a number of sleep difficulties and sleep disorders and could in part be \u201cattributed to the increasing pressures and expectations placed on our young people, an over-reliance on social media, and the creation of a 24/7 culture\u201d. Earlier this year, a Childwise survey found that more than half of children say they sleep with their mobile phone beside their bed. The Guardian has previously reported on the lengths parents go to to help their children sleep, including giving them melatonin. Produced naturally by the body in dark environments to help sleep preparations, melatonin has been authorised for use by people aged over 55. It has been hailed as a less addictive alternative to insomnia drug treatments. The number of children and young people being given the hormone has risen year on year, increasing by 25% from 92,511 prescriptions in 2015-16 to the most recent full-year figure. But specialists have expressed concern about it being given to children \u201coff label\u201d, with little knowledge of the long-term safety or side-effects. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThese figures show that more must be done to limit the dangerous drivers of poor health, including the increasing use of social media and the rising levels of childhood obesity. \u201cOur NHS Long Term Plan sets out ambitious action to transform care for children, supported by record investment, but while the NHS is playing its part, other industries must step up to protect our young people\u2019s health.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The first wines I ever tried were European, most of the wines I buy are still European and I\u2019ve visited more European vineyards than those on any other continent. Except that I don\u2019t think of them as \u201cEuropean\u201d, but as French, Italian, Spanish, Greek \u2026 The great fallacy of the whole wretched Brexit debate is that individual countries lose their identity from being part of Europe. Well, not when it comes to wine, they don\u2019t \u2013 or very little else, for that matter. Be that as it may, most wine lovers \u2013 and winemakers \u2013 would agree that Europe produces the world\u2019s greatest wines: bordeaux, burgundy, barolo, brunello; and incomparable sweet wines such as sauternes and Hungary\u2019s tokaji. There\u2019s a reason champagne, chablis and ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-pape form the classic backbone of any wine list. But it\u2019s the byways of the wine world that are so fascinating. Italy alone has more than 377 grape varieties, according to Jancis Robinson\u2019s Wine Grapes (wine geeks who want to dig deeper should acquire Ian d\u2019Agata\u2019s absorbing Italy\u2019s Native Wine Grape Terroirs), while Portugal has 77, with colourful names that translate as \u201cfly droppings\u201d (bical) and \u201cbastard\u201d (bastardo). Priced at a fraction of better-known examples, they amply repay seeking out. What\u2019s txakoli when it\u2019s at home? A sharp, deliciously spritzy Basque country white that you may have come across if you\u2019ve ever visited San Sebastian. You can order the 2019 Txomin Etxaniz direct from Spain for \u00a37.81 a bottle (plus shipping) at winebuyers.com. If you\u2019re after unusual reds, try Austria\u2019s zweigelt (see today\u2019s picks ) or blaufr\u00e4nkisch (also known in Hungary as k\u00e9kfrankos). And if you want to explore what the European wine world has to offer, always drink local when you\u2019re travelling. In Venice, say, you\u2019ll find not just prosecco and pinot grigio, but the far more alluring friulano and refosco. While some regions cling rigidly to tradition, the wine world is constantly changing. There are parts of Europe, such as the Languedoc and parts of Sicily, which are now like the new world in their approach to wine-making and marketing, while climate change is making it possible to grow grapes commercially in places they never thrived before. Last autumn, I visited H\u00e4ll\u00e5kra, an organic vineyard in the Sk\u00e5ne region of southern Sweden, where there are now some 40 wineries. They even have their own winery restaurant. So we may be out of Europe, but we can, and still should, enjoy European wines. Quick, now, while we can still afford them. Four European wines you might not have tried Petri Pinot Noir Pfalz \u00a312.50 (or \u00a310.95 by the case) Lea &amp; Sandeman, 13.5%. Fruity, seductively rounded German pinot noir (they usually call it sp\u00e4tburgunder). Very good for the price. Pepp Blauer Zweigelt 2018 \u00a38.50 The Wine Society, 12.5%. If you like pinot (and beaujolais), you\u2019ll like this juicy Austrian red. Enjoy with grilled chicken or schnitzel. Dafnios Vidiano 2017/18 \u00a315 Maltby &amp; Greek, 13.5%. Sharp and salty as a chunk of feta, Greek whites are ace with salads and seafood, even grilled lamb. Cr\u00e9mant de la Loire \u00a37.99 Lidl, 12%. Cr\u00e9mant is a French word for sparkling wines that are not champagne: this, based on chenin blanc, is from the Loire. Good for a kir or bellini. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com",

Since then, the Greek authorities say they have prevented <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51735715\" title=\"\">more than 32,000 people</a> from entering the country without permission.</p> <p>But we are being manipulated. The disregard for people\u2019s safety exhibited by Greece\u2019s border guards \u2013 not just in the Aegean, but at the Evros land border in the north \u2013 is only the most visible part of the problem. Just as important is the role played by Turkey, which let the dinghy set sail, filmed it, then released the footage to the world; and by European political leaders, who would rather we forget that the events are partly a result of their own policies, a failure that has smouldered away for five years since the crisis of 2015.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s decision to \u201copen\u201d its European borders, aimed at pressuring Nato allies to support its recently expanded military intervention in the Syrian war, represents the collapse of the refugee deal it signed with the EU in March 2016. Despite Turkey\u2019s admirable role in hosting 3.7 million displaced Syrians, this decision is a cynical stunt that uses the lives of refugees as a bargaining chip and seeks to destabilise neighbouring countries. Turkey\u2019s action may come to be seen as the trigger for Europe\u2019s security crackdown, but in truth the situation had already become untenable, largely because Europe has spent the past five years treating migrants as a nuisance to be swept under the carpet.</p> <p>The EU never made good on a promise made in 2015 to relocate refugees en masse from Greece, leaving many trapped in appalling conditions on the Aegean islands. Local residents have become increasingly frustrated, in recent weeks clashing with riot police over the Greek government\u2019s attempt to start building \u201cclosed\u201d camps \u2013 ie detention centres \u2013 for asylum-seekers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An anti-refugee backlash has been brewing in Greece for months, but it has been intensified by the new border crisis, turning it into a cause celebre for far-right activists around the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, that anger is being turned towards migrants and the people who help them. Vigilante groups, some with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/tensions-refugees-and-islanders-crisis-on-lesbos\" title=\"\">suspected links</a> to the far right, have become increasingly present on Lesbos, attacking migrants, humanitarian workers, volunteers and journalists. On Chios, in the early hours of Tuesday morning, a fire broke out at an NGO-run warehouse being used to store aid supplies. Vigilante groups have also been reported at Evros, while migrants yesterday told reporters from <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/greece-denies-turkeys-claims-they-fired-on-migrants\" title=\"\">Channel 4</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Stone_SkyNews/status/1235219755474259968\" title=\"\">Sky</a> that they had been shot by live bullets from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForensicArchi/status/1235325831607652352\" title=\"\">the Greek side of the border</a>, with one person killed. Greece\u2019s government dismissed these claims as \u201cfake news\u201d.</p> <p>An anti-refugee backlash has been brewing in Greece <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/03/04/after-the-eu-turned-greece-into-a-refugee-warehouse-a-backlash/\" title=\"\">for several months</a>, but it has been intensified by the new border crisis, turning it into a cause celebre for far-right activists around the world. On social media, the hashtag #IStandWithGreece was flooded with racist claims that an Islamic invasion of Europe is under way. \u201cThis struggle is biblical in scale,\u201d tweeted the far-right provocateur Katie Hopkins, addressing Greece. \u201cYou are on the pointy end of the spear.\u201d</p> <p>A day later, the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, echoed this when she thanked Greece, at a press conference, for being Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/migration-eu-praises-greece-as-shield-after-turkey-opens-border\" title=\"\">\u201caspida\u201d</a>, the Greek word for shield. Von der Leyen has form here: in September, she launched her presidency by renaming the EU\u2019s head of migration policy the \u201ccommissioner for protecting the European way of life\u201d, a wording that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/13/protecting-europe-migrants-far-right-eu-nationalism\" title=\"\">widely criticised</a>, and later altered. Leading European politicians are at pains to reassure Greece, as well as the wider public that they will keep them secure. But in the rush to do so they are reinforcing a clash-of-civilisations framing that will only deepen the underlying problems in the long run.</p> <p>Now, the rhetoric is translating into policy. European leaders have been quick to pledge their solidarity with Greece, but this translates into support for border control rather than resettling refugees among countries better equipped to accommodate them. Greece, meanwhile, has taken the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/world/europe/greece-migrants-border-turkey.html?action=click&amp;module=Latest&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">drastic step</a> of suspending asylum applications for one month, a move that was swiftly criticised by NGOs, including the UN\u2019s refugee agency. A key principle of international refugee law is that people should have the right to claim asylum, and not be penalised for crossing borders in order to do so. Von der Leyen and her colleagues, however, have largely stayed silent on this \u2013 and on the reports of violence at the border. Indeed, the director of the EU\u2019s border agency Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, appeared to condone the use of live fire <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/2020/09/fabrice-leggeri-frontex-waffen-grenzwache-eu/komplettansicht\" title=\"\">in an interview last week</a>. \u201cWhen migrants \u2026 try to violently cross the border, we have to prevent that,\u201d he told the German newspaper Die Zeit.</p> <p>The urgent challenge now is for European politicians to avoid stoking yet another panic about migration, and to establish a system for accommodating refugees that shares the work fairly between countries, and makes the protection of human life a priority. A petition <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/charles-michel-europe-must-act-now-for-the-immediate-decongestion-of-the-aegean-islands-37ac8a88-cf7e-4ce2-9a98-1b2969f1bda4\">supported by 115 different NGOs</a> calls for the immediate evacuation of asylum-seekers from the Aegean. Britain, regardless of Brexit, has a role to play, too: it has the resources and capacity to resettle people, and the government has already <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlfDubs/status/1235217524440141824\" title=\"\">softened its negotiating position</a> on family reunions for child refugees after pressure from campaigners.</p> <p>Beyond that, however, we need to start being honest about an underlying cause of this crisis: wealthy parts of the world have increasingly been trying to foist the task of accommodating refugees \u2013 in Europe\u2019s case, not just from Syria, but from a series of other long-running conflicts, many of which have been fed by European troops and weapons \u2013 on to their <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/globaltrends2018/\" title=\"\">poorer neighbours</a>. But as Europe is once again being reminded, inconvenient people do not disappear simply because it might wish them to.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe</p>",

Local residents have become increasingly frustrated, in recent weeks clashing with riot police over the Greek government\u2019s attempt to start building \u201cclosed\u201d camps \u2013 ie detention centres \u2013 for asylum-seekers. Now, that anger is being turned towards migrants and the people who help them. Vigilante groups, some with suspected links to the far right, have become increasingly present on Lesbos, attacking migrants, humanitarian workers, volunteers and journalists. On Chios, in the early hours of Tuesday morning, a fire broke out at an NGO-run warehouse being used to store aid supplies. Vigilante groups have also been reported at Evros, while migrants yesterday told reporters from Channel 4 and Sky that they had been shot by live bullets from the Greek side of the border, with one person killed. Greece\u2019s government dismissed these claims as \u201cfake news\u201d. An anti-refugee backlash has been brewing in Greece for several months, but it has been intensified by the new border crisis, turning it into a cause celebre for far-right activists around the world. On social media, the hashtag #IStandWithGreece was flooded with racist claims that an Islamic invasion of Europe is under way. \u201cThis struggle is biblical in scale,\u201d tweeted the far-right provocateur Katie Hopkins, addressing Greece. \u201cYou are on the pointy end of the spear.\u201d A day later, the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, echoed this when she thanked Greece, at a press conference, for being Europe\u2019s \u201caspida\u201d, the Greek word for shield. Von der Leyen has form here: in September, she launched her presidency by renaming the EU\u2019s head of migration policy the \u201ccommissioner for protecting the European way of life\u201d, a wording that was widely criticised, and later altered. Leading European politicians are at pains to reassure Greece, as well as the wider public that they will keep them secure. But in the rush to do so they are reinforcing a clash-of-civilisations framing that will only deepen the underlying problems in the long run. Now, the rhetoric is translating into policy. European leaders have been quick to pledge their solidarity with Greece, but this translates into support for border control rather than resettling refugees among countries better equipped to accommodate them. Greece, meanwhile, has taken the drastic step of suspending asylum applications for one month, a move that was swiftly criticised by NGOs, including the UN\u2019s refugee agency. A key principle of international refugee law is that people should have the right to claim asylum, and not be penalised for crossing borders in order to do so. Von der Leyen and her colleagues, however, have largely stayed silent on this \u2013 and on the reports of violence at the border. Indeed, the director of the EU\u2019s border agency Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, appeared to condone the use of live fire in an interview last week. \u201cWhen migrants \u2026 try to violently cross the border, we have to prevent that,\u201d he told the German newspaper Die Zeit. The urgent challenge now is for European politicians to avoid stoking yet another panic about migration, and to establish a system for accommodating refugees that shares the work fairly between countries, and makes the protection of human life a priority. A petition supported by 115 different NGOs calls for the immediate evacuation of asylum-seekers from the Aegean. Britain, regardless of Brexit, has a role to play, too: it has the resources and capacity to resettle people, and the government has already softened its negotiating position on family reunions for child refugees after pressure from campaigners. Beyond that, however, we need to start being honest about an underlying cause of this crisis: wealthy parts of the world have increasingly been trying to foist the task of accommodating refugees \u2013 in Europe\u2019s case, not just from Syria, but from a series of other long-running conflicts, many of which have been fed by European troops and weapons \u2013 on to their poorer neighbours. But as Europe is once again being reminded, inconvenient people do not disappear simply because it might wish them to. \u2022 Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe",

Few official gatherings in Japan have properly begun until female employees \u2013 known collectively as the ochakumi (\u201ctea squad\u201d) \u2013 have placed cups of green tea in front of their invariably male senior colleagues, occasionally accompanied by something sweet. But members of the Saitama prefectural assembly near Tokyo have decided that it will no longer employ seven temporary staff whose job was to serve tea at committee meetings attended by the assembly\u2019s 93 members \u2013 just 14 of whom are women \u2013 and other senior officials. The move was not entirely motivated by a desire to challenge traditional gender roles, having been made at a meeting last month to discuss ways to cut costs, according to the daily newspaper the Asahi Shimbun. But Nobuaki Kojima, who heads the conservative Liberal Democratic party group in the assembly, said the change was also a recognition of changing attitudes towards women in the workplace. \u201cIn line with the trend of the times, we have been discussing whether it\u2019s appropriate to employ women who simply wait around to offer tea,\u201d Kojima told the Asahi, adding that from now on, thirsty assembly members would have to provide their own refreshments.

I don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s nothing to do with me but that\u2019s from previous years. I\u2019m reasonably new in this job. It\u2019s important neither myself nor this squad of players take in that it\u2019s been 22 years of doom and gloom. We have to see this as our chance, do our best and not worry about what has gone before.\u201d</p> <p>It is fitting to glance back through Clarke\u2019s fascinating journey, a rugged defender for whom missing out on Scotland\u2019s trip to the 1990 World Cup hurt. \u201cI went in the pre-squad in February, to Italy. I was in the 26 or 28 but dropped out of contention between then and the tournament. It was disappointing to be so close.\u201d</p> <p>By 1994, after six caps, Clarke\u2019s Scotland career was over.</p> <p>Clarke was a Chelsea fixture 10 years before the financial revolution at Stamford Bridge, his last appearance a winning one at right-back in the 1998 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final. Vialli floated the idea of a player-coach role. \u201cThat suggested he was going to bring someone else in to play in my position,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too happy.\u201d</p> <p>Chelsea would have demanded a fee if Clarke moved to Newcastle with Gullit as a player so he hung up his boots and took a coaching role at St James\u2019 Park. A switch back to Chelsea involved youth-team duties before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho took a shine to Clarke and hired him as his first assistant in England in 2004. \u201cI think he just wanted someone who knew the club, the league,\u201d Clarke says, somewhat bashfully. \u201cRight place, right time.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cJos\u00e9 was a breath of fresh air for the Premier League. He was great for the players. I liked his enthusiasm, his intensity. His training was really structured. He didn\u2019t have a great deal of time for fitness coaches and measurements, he just put on training sessions the players enjoyed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"070b7b8b7c5475d185663375165b7dc458fdd659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070b7b8b7c5475d185663375165b7dc458fdd659/0_0_2464_1648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Clarke sits between Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Rui Faria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Clarke sits between Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Rui Faria as part of Chelsea\u2019s new backroom staff in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe had a great three years together. In football you tend to drift away and on to the next job; you bump into someone after two or three years and it\u2019s the same as seeing them yesterday. It\u2019s a little bit like that with Jos\u00e9. We had text messages, eventually that dried up, then he has been away working all around the world. He isn\u2019t going to be that bothered about whether or not I\u2019m keeping in touch. We were really tight knit when we worked together.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke had the chance to remain at Chelsea after Mourinho departed. The appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari in 2008 was instead the precursor to Clarke\u2019s second Chelsea exit. \u201cI could have stayed. That would have been the easy option. I wasn\u2019t comfortable at being the perennial No 2. That didn\u2019t fulfil my ambition. I wanted to put myself under pressure.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it took until 2012 for Clarke to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/08/steve-clarke-west-brom-manager\" title=\"\">step into management at West Brom</a> after coaching roles at West Ham and Liverpool. Typically, there was method to that approach. \u201cYou know when you take a manager\u2019s job it could be terminal. I was making sure there was enough in the bank to cover that, making sure myself and my family would be all right when I took the plunge. That\u2019s not to say if the chance had come up earlier I wouldn\u2019t have done it.

      "bodyText": "Steve Clarke speaks with an occasional undertone of menace that suggests he could have starred on an alternative career path. It is easy to envisage the 56-year-old immersed in a Glasgow crime drama. This is not to suggest Clarke is not cut out for his chosen environment. An icy exterior \u2013 sometimes, perhaps, put on for effect \u2013 is useful in his line of work. The Scotland manager is not boastful about the individuals he has worked alongside but a list that includes Glenn Hoddle, Gianluca Vialli, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Kenny Dalglish, Frank Lampard and Ruud Gullit emphasises his status. Should Clarke take Scotland to Euro 2020 via the play-offs those in his homeland may hold him in loftier esteem than that sextet combined. Israel on 26 March, then potentially Norway or Serbia, lie between the Scots and a first finals appearance since 1998. \u201cI knew the magnitude of these games and in a strange way that was one of the draws,\u201d he says of being coaxed from Kilmarnock last summer. \u201cIt was an attraction because this is a good opportunity but listen, Israel, Norway and Serbia will all be saying the same thing. \u201cThe public are a bit disillusioned with the national team. I don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s nothing to do with me but that\u2019s from previous years. I\u2019m reasonably new in this job. It\u2019s important neither myself nor this squad of players take in that it\u2019s been 22 years of doom and gloom. We have to see this as our chance, do our best and not worry about what has gone before.\u201d It is fitting to glance back through Clarke\u2019s fascinating journey, a rugged defender for whom missing out on Scotland\u2019s trip to the 1990 World Cup hurt. \u201cI went in the pre-squad in February, to Italy. I was in the 26 or 28 but dropped out of contention between then and the tournament. It was disappointing to be so close.\u201d By 1994, after six caps, Clarke\u2019s Scotland career was over. Clarke was a Chelsea fixture 10 years before the financial revolution at Stamford Bridge, his last appearance a winning one at right-back in the 1998 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final. Vialli floated the idea of a player-coach role. \u201cThat suggested he was going to bring someone else in to play in my position,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too happy.\u201d Chelsea would have demanded a fee if Clarke moved to Newcastle with Gullit as a player so he hung up his boots and took a coaching role at St James\u2019 Park. A switch back to Chelsea involved youth-team duties before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho took a shine to Clarke and hired him as his first assistant in England in 2004. \u201cI think he just wanted someone who knew the club, the league,\u201d Clarke says, somewhat bashfully. \u201cRight place, right time.\u201d He adds: \u201cJos\u00e9 was a breath of fresh air for the Premier League. He was great for the players. I liked his enthusiasm, his intensity. His training was really structured. He didn\u2019t have a great deal of time for fitness coaches and measurements, he just put on training sessions the players enjoyed. \u201cWe had a great three years together. In football you tend to drift away and on to the next job; you bump into someone after two or three years and it\u2019s the same as seeing them yesterday. It\u2019s a little bit like that with Jos\u00e9. We had text messages, eventually that dried up, then he has been away working all around the world. He isn\u2019t going to be that bothered about whether or not I\u2019m keeping in touch. We were really tight knit when we worked together.\u201d Clarke had the chance to remain at Chelsea after Mourinho departed. The appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari in 2008 was instead the precursor to Clarke\u2019s second Chelsea exit. \u201cI could have stayed. That would have been the easy option. I wasn\u2019t comfortable at being the perennial No 2. That didn\u2019t fulfil my ambition. I wanted to put myself under pressure.\u201d Still, it took until 2012 for Clarke to step into management at West Brom after coaching roles at West Ham and Liverpool. Typically, there was method to that approach. \u201cYou know when you take a manager\u2019s job it could be terminal. I was making sure there was enough in the bank to cover that, making sure myself and my family would be all right when I took the plunge. That\u2019s not to say if the chance had come up earlier I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I knew I was ready.\u201d Clarke took West Brom to their highest Premier League finish and points total before a \u201cstrange ending\u201d that included being placed on gardening leave. \u201cFor the first time in 18 months we lost four in a row and the chairman was obviously nervous. His club, his choice. I can be pleased with my work there.\u201d Clarke took Reading to the FA Cup semi-finals and coached alongside Roberto Di Matteo at Aston Villa. Management might have passed him by before the umpteenth call from Kilmarnock in October 2017. Clarke\u2019s brother Paul played more than 400 times for the club. Steve left Scotland \u2013 and St Mirren \u2013 at 23. Clarke was branded a miracle worker at Kilmarnock, dragging them from the perennial threat of relegation to a third-place Scottish Premiership finish in the 2018-19 season. \u201cKilmarnock had been on the phone a few times over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d decided I was finished. I was happy working on my golf and doing a bit of fishing. My wife started nagging that I needed to go and work again. Everything just clicked.\u201d Everything within his control. Clarke made headlines across Britain last February after vehemently criticising sectarian abuse from Rangers supporters during a defeat at Ibrox. A year on he is candid when asked whether the landscape has improved. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has,\u201d he says. \u201cI had been so far out of it and came back \u2013 for me it was very clear. \u201cI always put it on the line as the racism one: if you call someone a black bastard, that\u2019s not good; if you call them a fenian bastard or an orange bastard, that\u2019s all right. What\u2019s the difference? It exists in society but it manifests itself in football grounds. I don\u2019t understand it. \u201cThere was obviously an amount of frustration on the night \u2026 It\u2019s pretty normal that you get an outburst then everything just quietens down, people sweep it under the carpet and it goes away again. That is how they deal with sectarianism here in Scotland.\u201d The Scotland manager\u2019s job should carry a health warning. Alex McLeish used it as a platform to move to Birmingham 13 years ago, but he is the clear exception to an inauspicious rule.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Trump questions Biden\u2019s cognition as election field narrows Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator whose promise of progressive economics and policy detail briefly made her the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has dropped out of the race, while vowing that her \u201cplace in this fight has not ended\u201d. With the contest now between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden as to who will face Donald Trump in November, the president on Thursday gave a preview of one potential general election attack line, appearing to question Biden\u2019s cognitive health. Sexism question. With Warren out, the only woman left in the race is Tulsi Gabbard, who has a single delegate and zero chance of winning the nomination. David Smith reports on how American politics sets a \u201ctrap\u201d for women. Unity candidate. Democrats will have to unite if they want to beat Trump, writes Andrew Gawthorpe. But with Bernie and Biden representing opposing wings of the party, that is far from a foregone conclusion. Administration \u2018brain drain\u2019 hampering coronavirus response Experts have warned that the Trump administration\u2019s purge of scientific expertise and the president\u2019s own penchant for spreading misinformation could prevent the US from properly tackling the coronavirus. Healthcare workers on the frontline of the crisis have complained of a shocking lack of preparedness, while US markets continue their rollercoaster response to the disease. Better news from China: Hubei province had no new cases outside the city of Wuhan on Thursday, for the first time since the outbreak began. Diplomatic crisis. Seoul has reacted with anger after Japan announced plans to quarantine all passengers arriving from South Korea. And in South Korea itself, there are complaints the authorities are sharing embarrassing information on the private lives of coronavirus patients. Diamond Princess. As Covid-19 swept through a quarantined cruise ship, its crew had to keep on working regardless. They recall the chaos and fear on board the Diamond Princess. Turkish military kills 21 Syrian troops despite new ceasefire The Turkish military has killed 21 Syrian troops in retaliation for the deaths of two of its soldiers in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, hours after a ceasefire deal for the region was agreed between the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The two major powers have been engaged in hostilities in Idlib, the last remaining opposition stronghold in Syria, where Turkey supports anti-government fighters and Russia is backing the Assad regime. Hostile mood. Turkey is home to some 3.5 million Syrian refugees. When fighting breaks out across the border, they often face the wrath of angry locals, as Bethan McKernan and Hussein Akoush report. UK investigates Dubai ruler for abducting his own daughters A British judge has ruled that the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, orchestrated the abduction of two of his daughters from the streets of the UK \u2013 opening the door to a police investigation of the sheikh, who is a friend of the Queen and an important regional ally to the British government. Princess Shamsa was snatched from Cambridge in 2000 when she was 19. Princess Latifa, then 32, was seized by Indian army commandos in the Indian Ocean and returned to Dubai after fleeing in 2018. Family courts. The sheikh\u2019s sixth wife, Princess Haya, 45, fled to London last April with their two young children. His attempts to return the children to Dubai triggered the legal action in the family courts that has shed fresh light on the past incidents. Cheat sheet Alabama has executed Nathaniel Woods, a man convicted of murder for the 2004 killings of three police officers, despite an outcry from activists and public figures \u2013 and his co-defendant, who admitted guilt and insisted Woods was innocent. Five senior members of the US neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division have been arrested across several states in recent weeks, dealing a major blow to a far-right organisation associated with at least five murders. More than a million women are set to join a protest march in Chile on Sunday, marking International Women\u2019s Day and potentially reigniting the social unrest that has rocked the country since October. Nasa has cultivated space-grown lettuce found to be as safe and healthy as the variety on Earth, expanding astronauts\u2019 hitherto limited diets for a decade when they are expected to travel back to the oon \u2013 and possibly even to Mars. Must-reads Greg Kinnear on Bob Hope: \u2018Times were changing around him\u2019 Greg Kinnear plays Bob Hope in his new film, Misbehaviour, set in 1970 when the entertainer faced women\u2019s liberation movement protests while hosting Miss World. Kinnear was once a TV presenter, too \u2013 but, he tells Ryan Gilbey, Hope was at work in an era which \u201cheld up in today\u2019s light\u2026 does look, uh, slightly off\u201d. Why are we so complacent about existential risks? We can now say with certainty that the coronavirus does not pose an existential threat to humanity. But the next pandemic might. As Toby Ord writes, the more technological progress humanity makes, the greater the danger that we could wipe ourselves out. A Zodiac Killer theory that\u2019s very close to home The Zodiac Killer terrorised the Bay Area in the 1960s and 70s, killing seven and taunting the police and public. Decades later, Gary Stewart believes he has identified the killer: his own birth father. Stewart\u2019s bestselling book has been made into a documentary series, as Adrian Horton explains. The race to save Europe\u2019s secret Amazon Polesia is Europe\u2019s largest wilderness, spread across four countries and home to an extraordinary array of flora and fauna. Once affected by fallout from Chernobyl, Polesia now faces another potential catastrophe: the construction of a new inland shipping route, as Phoebe Weston reports. Opinion The abortion rights case heard by the supreme court this week threatens the end of Roe v Wade, against the will of most Americans. Alexis McGill Johnson, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, says the stakes for reproductive rights have never been higher. Legal abortion means nothing if only the privileged have access. Together, alongside our reproductive justice partners on the ground, we must fight state by state to protect access where it still exists, and to expand access where we can.

      "bodyText": "Forget dreams of wolves, bears or lynx \u2013 the next animal to be restored to the British countryside could be a river bottom-dwelling fish that resembles a giant tadpole. The burbot, much-maligned for its unprepossessing appearance with a fleshy appendage dangling from its chin, was last sighted in British rivers in 1969. A reward for spotting it remains unclaimed and now a costed reintroduction plan is being drawn up for Natural England, the government\u2019s conservation watchdog. \u201cThe chance to bring back burbot to our rivers is hugely exciting,\u201d said Jonah Tosney, operations director of the Norfolk Rivers Trust, which is masterminding the reintroduction plan. \u201cUnlike beavers, lynx and sea eagles, they haven\u2019t been gone for long; only about 50 years. Anglers still remember catching them.

In both cases, agricultural and heavy metal pollution may have played a role. Tosney said the cause of the burbot\u2019s disappearance remained \u201ca bit of a mystery\u201d but was a combination of pressures including the disappearance of natural \u201cmessy\u201d edges to rivers, including pools, flooded areas and back channels. \u201cPeople did used to eat them but it\u2019s more likely to be water quality and habitat quality slowly degrading since the second world war that caused their disappearance,\u201d he said. The burbot, the only freshwater species of cod, once thrived at the bottom of cool lowland rivers across eastern England but leaves its preferred habitat for ponds and pools to spawn and so requires pools and other freshwater close to the river. Burbot could also be a beneficiary of beaver reintroductions, as the beavers create burbot-friendly habitat. The fish has been successfully reintroduced into Belgium and Germany, and Tosney said there were several river valleys in the East Anglian Fens with good floodplains that could be ideal habitat. Before the fish is brought back there will be further feasibility studies and also an environmental DNA survey to check there are no traces of burbot DNA in rivers, which would prove that a few survivors have evaded detection since the 1960s. The Norfolk Rivers Trust hopes to raise \u00a380,000 to fund a five-year reintroduction pilot.

      "body": "<p>How can Labour win back Scotland? That question has been an occasional, albeit muted theme of the Labour leadership contest, with each candidate offering their own credentials as the one who can reignite Labour\u2019s Caledonian hearth. They tiptoe carefully around the cold and morbid pessimism that haunts the Scottish Labour party, chilled by another question that hovers unasked and unanswered over every party meeting: can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/15/scottish-labour-urges-uk-party-to-learn-from-fall-of-tartan-wall\" title=\"\">Labour win back Scotland</a>?</p> <p>Answering that means understanding the causes of defeat. Though Labour was electorally dominant in Scotland until as recently as 2010, the party has in fact undergone the same long, secular decline over generations that has taken place more obviously in England. In the 1980s this was concealed by the broad, cross-class unpopularity of the Conservatives; anti-Tory votes gravitated naturally towards Labour, thanks to the binary choices encouraged by the first past the post electoral system. Scotland\u2019s civic leaders claimed to reject Thatcherism, but the country did not escape the late-20th-century confluence of neoliberalism and postmodernity that carried away social housing and heavy industries as well as old community, familial and religious ties, eroding much of what had been Labour\u2019s home turf.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many in Scottish Labour struggle to understand why the SNP's failures have not already returned them to power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Amid this deeper structural decline, Labour was also able to sustain itself between the 1970s and 1990s by becoming the party of Scotland, combining with Scottish trade unions to fight for Scottish interests both in and against the Westminster state. They remade Scotland in Labour\u2019s image, knitting together industry, faith and the public sector, combining manual workers and the white-collar world of \u201ccivic Scotland\u201d in a coalition for the peaceful navigation of global change. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/03/strange-death-labour-scotland\" title=\"\">Labour Scotland</a>\u201d \u2013 as Gerry Hassan and Eric Shaw call it in their book The Strange Death of Labour Scotland \u2013 turned the lived experience of industrial Scotland into a powerful political identity that, for years, survived the loss of its natural habitat. One of its last achievements, but also perhaps its greatest, was the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>Yet this strategic triumph set the scene for the party\u2019s biggest unforced error. During the 2000s, instead of renewing its claim to be Scotland\u2019s insurgent voice against Westminster, Labour \u2013 back in government north and south \u2013 allowed the SNP to occupy that terrain. By the time of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/20/scottish-independence-lord-ashcroft-poll\" title=\"\">2014 independence referendum</a>, Labour had become Westminster\u2019s voice in Scotland at a time when Scots \u2013 like many across the UK \u2013 were increasingly fed up with a distant and centralised British political system. Scottish Labour helped to keep the UK together, but its defence of the constitutional status quo sacrificed its credibility as being the best party to resist an unpopular Tory-Liberal government in Westminster. The results were brutal: <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/109/4930858?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" title=\"\">according to</a> the political scientists Ailsa Henderson and James Mitchell, of the Scots who voted Labour in 2010 and yes in 2014, an extraordinary 82% switched to the SNP in 2015 .</p> <p>Are there any hopes for recovery? Fortunately for Scottish Labour, most Scots still vote for parties that position themselves on the centre left. Though the Scottish Conservatives are now the main opposition, the most likely alternative to the SNP for most SNP voters remains Labour. The SNP\u2019s failures in government are increasingly hard to deny, and they are in precisely the areas of diligent service delivery \u2013 particularly education, transport and health \u2013 that Labour knows best.</p> <p>Many in Scottish Labour struggle to understand why this hasn\u2019t already returned them to power and blame \u201cthe constitutional divide\u201d for distracting voters from their real interests. This is an excuse, not a strategy, based on a bitterly tribal refusal to wonder whether the voters might be on to something. Scottish Labour\u2019s best electoral options clearly lie on the Scottish nationalist side of that \u201cdivide\u201d, and there are copious resources in the Labour tradition for claiming back some of that ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/15/scottish-labour-urges-uk-party-to-learn-from-fall-of-tartan-wall\">Scottish Labour urges UK party to learn from fall of 'tartan wall'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The SNP\u2019s cosy relationship with multinational corporations such as <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/amazon-receive-36m-scottish-government-10160102\" title=\"\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://theferret.scot/airbnb-lobbying-snp-tories-regulation/\" title=\"\">Airbnb</a>, as well as the fossil fuels sector, also leaves miles of space for Scottish Labour to embrace an unambiguous economic nationalism based on democratic public ownership and state-driven investment in renewable industries.</p> <p>The party already espouses this in policy terms but remains detached from the kind of visionary national project in which any policy programme needs to be embedded. The idea of an heroic, big-state \u201csocialism\u201d relies too heavily on a dated British left identity that supporters of independence have largely abandoned, while the proposed constitutional fix of \u201cfederalism\u201d is too dependent on technocratic detail to offer the kind of populist clarity successful winning electoral coalitions are made of.</p> <p>What is striking is how open the goal is, and how determinedly it is being ignored. Recent polls suggest that about <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scottish-independence/latest-poll-shows-support-scottish-independence-52-1395231\" title=\"\">50% of Scots</a> now support independence; it is likely that there are many more who want to but remain uncertain of Scotland\u2019s ability to weather economic upheaval. The SNP\u2019s \u201csustainable growth commission\u201d, designed to assuage these fears, has already irritated the party\u2019s left wing by arguing for disciplined deficit reduction and the continued use of sterling after independence.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/former-nicola-sturgeon-adviser-blasts-21430392\" title=\"\">some in the SNP</a> are suggesting that as long as the Conservatives refuse another independence referendum, they may have to wait for another Labour government before a vote is possible. The problem is that as long as Labour is dead set against both independence and a referendum, independence supporters can\u2019t risk diminishing the SNP\u2019s bargaining power should Labour get another shot at power.</p> <p>Labour should support a new referendum on clear democratic grounds, backing Scotland\u2019s right to revisit its place in the union with Brexit going ahead. But it can also take these opportunities to go a step further and pinch the SNP\u2019s \u201cgradualist\u201d clothes. If Scotland\u2019s economy is not quite ripe for self-government then only Scottish Labour can promise to use the full resources of the British state to create the best possible conditions for the independence in Europe that Scots increasingly want.</p> <p>Scottish Labour could argue for continued union and a Labour government as part of a patient but more secure path to an independent Scotland, ensuring that some of the wealth sucked into London over the past few decades can be redistributed to build up the resilience and autonomy of the Scottish economy \u2013 as well as pursuing a relationship with Europe that reduces the potential for friction between a post-Brexit England and an independent Scotland in the EU. To recover, Scottish Labour needs a new and distinctly Scottish horizon that goes beyond mere \u201cgood governance\u201d of public services and the hope that England will vote Labour. It just needs to listen to the voters it has lost.</p> <p>\u2022 Rory Scothorne is completing a PhD on the radical left and Scottish nationalism between 1968 and 1992</p>",

      "bodyText": "How can Labour win back Scotland? That question has been an occasional, albeit muted theme of the Labour leadership contest, with each candidate offering their own credentials as the one who can reignite Labour\u2019s Caledonian hearth. They tiptoe carefully around the cold and morbid pessimism that haunts the Scottish Labour party, chilled by another question that hovers unasked and unanswered over every party meeting: can Labour win back Scotland? Answering that means understanding the causes of defeat. Though Labour was electorally dominant in Scotland until as recently as 2010, the party has in fact undergone the same long, secular decline over generations that has taken place more obviously in England. In the 1980s this was concealed by the broad, cross-class unpopularity of the Conservatives; anti-Tory votes gravitated naturally towards Labour, thanks to the binary choices encouraged by the first past the post electoral system. Scotland\u2019s civic leaders claimed to reject Thatcherism, but the country did not escape the late-20th-century confluence of neoliberalism and postmodernity that carried away social housing and heavy industries as well as old community, familial and religious ties, eroding much of what had been Labour\u2019s home turf. Amid this deeper structural decline, Labour was also able to sustain itself between the 1970s and 1990s by becoming the party of Scotland, combining with Scottish trade unions to fight for Scottish interests both in and against the Westminster state. They remade Scotland in Labour\u2019s image, knitting together industry, faith and the public sector, combining manual workers and the white-collar world of \u201ccivic Scotland\u201d in a coalition for the peaceful navigation of global change. \u201cLabour Scotland\u201d \u2013 as Gerry Hassan and Eric Shaw call it in their book The Strange Death of Labour Scotland \u2013 turned the lived experience of industrial Scotland into a powerful political identity that, for years, survived the loss of its natural habitat. One of its last achievements, but also perhaps its greatest, was the Scottish parliament. Yet this strategic triumph set the scene for the party\u2019s biggest unforced error. During the 2000s, instead of renewing its claim to be Scotland\u2019s insurgent voice against Westminster, Labour \u2013 back in government north and south \u2013 allowed the SNP to occupy that terrain. By the time of the 2014 independence referendum, Labour had become Westminster\u2019s voice in Scotland at a time when Scots \u2013 like many across the UK \u2013 were increasingly fed up with a distant and centralised British political system. Scottish Labour helped to keep the UK together, but its defence of the constitutional status quo sacrificed its credibility as being the best party to resist an unpopular Tory-Liberal government in Westminster. The results were brutal: according to the political scientists Ailsa Henderson and James Mitchell, of the Scots who voted Labour in 2010 and yes in 2014, an extraordinary 82% switched to the SNP in 2015 . Are there any hopes for recovery? Fortunately for Scottish Labour, most Scots still vote for parties that position themselves on the centre left. Though the Scottish Conservatives are now the main opposition, the most likely alternative to the SNP for most SNP voters remains Labour. The SNP\u2019s failures in government are increasingly hard to deny, and they are in precisely the areas of diligent service delivery \u2013 particularly education, transport and health \u2013 that Labour knows best. Many in Scottish Labour struggle to understand why this hasn\u2019t already returned them to power and blame \u201cthe constitutional divide\u201d for distracting voters from their real interests. This is an excuse, not a strategy, based on a bitterly tribal refusal to wonder whether the voters might be on to something. Scottish Labour\u2019s best electoral options clearly lie on the Scottish nationalist side of that \u201cdivide\u201d, and there are copious resources in the Labour tradition for claiming back some of that ground. The SNP\u2019s cosy relationship with multinational corporations such as Amazon and Airbnb, as well as the fossil fuels sector, also leaves miles of space for Scottish Labour to embrace an unambiguous economic nationalism based on democratic public ownership and state-driven investment in renewable industries. The party already espouses this in policy terms but remains detached from the kind of visionary national project in which any policy programme needs to be embedded. The idea of an heroic, big-state \u201csocialism\u201d relies too heavily on a dated British left identity that supporters of independence have largely abandoned, while the proposed constitutional fix of \u201cfederalism\u201d is too dependent on technocratic detail to offer the kind of populist clarity successful winning electoral coalitions are made of. What is striking is how open the goal is, and how determinedly it is being ignored. Recent polls suggest that about 50% of Scots now support independence; it is likely that there are many more who want to but remain uncertain of Scotland\u2019s ability to weather economic upheaval. The SNP\u2019s \u201csustainable growth commission\u201d, designed to assuage these fears, has already irritated the party\u2019s left wing by arguing for disciplined deficit reduction and the continued use of sterling after independence. Meanwhile, some in the SNP are suggesting that as long as the Conservatives refuse another independence referendum, they may have to wait for another Labour government before a vote is possible. The problem is that as long as Labour is dead set against both independence and a referendum, independence supporters can\u2019t risk diminishing the SNP\u2019s bargaining power should Labour get another shot at power. Labour should support a new referendum on clear democratic grounds, backing Scotland\u2019s right to revisit its place in the union with Brexit going ahead. But it can also take these opportunities to go a step further and pinch the SNP\u2019s \u201cgradualist\u201d clothes. If Scotland\u2019s economy is not quite ripe for self-government then only Scottish Labour can promise to use the full resources of the British state to create the best possible conditions for the independence in Europe that Scots increasingly want. Scottish Labour could argue for continued union and a Labour government as part of a patient but more secure path to an independent Scotland, ensuring that some of the wealth sucked into London over the past few decades can be redistributed to build up the resilience and autonomy of the Scottish economy \u2013 as well as pursuing a relationship with Europe that reduces the potential for friction between a post-Brexit England and an independent Scotland in the EU. To recover, Scottish Labour needs a new and distinctly Scottish horizon that goes beyond mere \u201cgood governance\u201d of public services and the hope that England will vote Labour. It just needs to listen to the voters it has lost. \u2022 Rory Scothorne is completing a PhD on the radical left and Scottish nationalism between 1968 and 1992",

Arlene Phillips is the choreographer and the director is Luke Sheppard, whose current smash hit &amp; Juliet rewrites Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy with songs by the Swedish pop producer Max Martin. It leads the nominations at this year\u2019s Olivier awards, where it will compete for nine prizes including best new musical. Sheppard said that the first staged reading for What\u2019s New Pussycat? \u201cleft me flying high\u201d. Jones\u2019s music, said the director, \u201chas such range it can break your heart one moment and have you on the dance floor the next\u201d. The show opens on 23 September. Leeds Playhouse celebrates its 50th anniversary in the autumn. The theatre recently underwent a \u00a316m redevelopment and has reverted to its original name after a 28-year spell as the West Yorkshire Playhouse.",

      "body": "<p>Forty years ago this spring, the supermarket sandwich was born. Despite a deeply unappetising start (M&amp;S\u2019s debut salmon and tomato filling reads like a dire omen), the packaged sandwich proved irresistible. Today, <a href=\"https://www.kantarworldpanel.com/en/PR/How-the-sandwiches-consumed-Brits\">it is a \u00a35.6bn-a-year industry</a> that dominates the to-go lunch market.</p> <p>Yet bizarrely, given the scale of that penetration, the subject of this month\u2019s How to Eat is rarely discussed in detail. Perhaps that is the insidious genius of what Sam Knight brilliantly christened \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/24/how-the-sandwich-consumed-britain\">the sandwich-industrial complex</a>\u201d. It so neatly fulfils a need in time-poor late-capitalist societies that we meekly accept it without objection.</p> <p>\u201cSandwiches freed us from the fork, the dinner table, the fixed mealtime. In a way, they freed us from society itself. We may lament this or we may welcome it, but there is not much point in fighting it. This is the way we eat now,\u201d Bee Wilson wrote in her 2010 book <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ydR5na_9fnYC&amp;pg=PP110&amp;lpg=PP110&amp;dq=%2B%22bee+wilson%22+%2B%22sandwich%22+%2B%22freed+us+from+society+itself%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E1dfYN5ixp&amp;sig=ACfU3U1k0J0voop4c_CfeIj4KgF7E6jLsw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi72aTi6_vnAhXPTsAKHfvPBxAQ6AEwBHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%2B%22bee%20wilson%22%20%2B%22sandwich%22%20%2B%22freed%20us%20from%20society%20itself%22&amp;f=false\">Sandwich: A Global History</a><em>.</em></p> <p>If it is impossible to see a future without the supermarket sandwich \u2013 its convenience is often invaluable \u2013 there is nonetheless a case to be made that Britain should wean itself off its sandwich habit and try to make its own lunch more often. The industrial sandwich market is a huge culprit in creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/lunch-on-go-habit-generates-11bn-items-packaging-waste-year-uk\">unrecyclable food packaging waste </a>and, it is calculated, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/25/scientists-calculate-carbon-emissions-of-your-sandwich\">the same CO<sub>2</sub> annually as 8.6m cars</a>. If not for the planet, act to save yourself a few quid, rather than accepting supermarket sandwiches as an inescapable, functional necessity.</p> <p>Could the way forward be to eat fewer supermarket sandwiches but get more out of them when we do? In that case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/how-to-eat\">How to Eat </a>(HTE) \u2013 the series exploring how best to enjoy our most popular foods \u2013 has a plan.</p> <h2><strong>The joy of repetition</strong></h2> <p>It is difficult to believe Dominic Raab could be right about anything. He is a man to ruin rather than capture the public mood.

Serving cold, leathery bacon in any circumstances should be a criminal offence. Worked into the general all-day breakfast slurry, it is particularly awful. Note: experts have concluded that the all-day breakfast sandwich has the largest carbon footprint of any sandwich, equal to driving 12 miles. That justifies a two-mile detour to buy a tastier, greener lunch (a salad, say, from M&amp;S\u2019s Plant Kitchen range).</p> <p>As for the BLT, can there be a convenience product that has travelled so far from its original conception? The still-warm, toasted BLT, full of newly fried streaky bacon, thick with mayo and properly seasoned, room-temperature lettuce and tomatoes, can be wonderful. The drab, cold supermarket version (the volatile compounds that give tomatoes their flavour chilled into inertia), is more a deliberate provocation, a faint echo of the original just recognisable enough to make you acutely aware of the pleasure you are being denied.</p> <p>Oh \u2026 and never eat any supermarket sandwich described as low-calorie.</p> <h2><strong>Filling forensics</strong></h2> <p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/consumer/supermarket-sandwich-fillings-wh-smith-sainsburys-vary-282832\">Channel 5\u2019s Shop Smart: Save Money</a> found almost half the sandwiches it tested contained less than the advertised filling. The amount of filling in comparable sandwiches can also differ widely. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/14/are-there-enough-prawns-in-your-sandwich-the-ultimate-taste-test\">At the time,</a> the Boots prawn mayo contained just 22% prawns compared with M&amp;S\u2019s 41%.</p> <p>In short, the struggle against under- and meanly filled sandwiches is real. Yet, having settled on a flavour, HTE has found no easy way to judge the sandwiches on the shelf against one another, to find the fullest. You can try the pinch test (gently squeezing the cartons to gauge plumpness), while some swear by examining the cut ends of sandwiches to find those that look as if they have a thicker filling. But in HTE\u2019s experience neither test is particularly reliable, another reason to avoid supermarket sandwiches. That surge of resentment on opening a dramatically underfilled one is an unhealthy emotion.</p> <h2><strong>Jazzing up your sandwich</strong></h2> <p>This is difficult, given they are usually eaten in transit, away from home. But most supermarket sandwiches benefit from a (filling-dependent) extra layer of salt\u2019n\u2019vinegar or ready-salted crisps.

      "bodyText": "Forty years ago this spring, the supermarket sandwich was born. Despite a deeply unappetising start (M&amp;S\u2019s debut salmon and tomato filling reads like a dire omen), the packaged sandwich proved irresistible. Today, it is a \u00a35.6bn-a-year industry that dominates the to-go lunch market. Yet bizarrely, given the scale of that penetration, the subject of this month\u2019s How to Eat is rarely discussed in detail. Perhaps that is the insidious genius of what Sam Knight brilliantly christened \u201cthe sandwich-industrial complex\u201d. It so neatly fulfils a need in time-poor late-capitalist societies that we meekly accept it without objection. \u201cSandwiches freed us from the fork, the dinner table, the fixed mealtime. In a way, they freed us from society itself. We may lament this or we may welcome it, but there is not much point in fighting it. This is the way we eat now,\u201d Bee Wilson wrote in her 2010 book Sandwich: A Global History. If it is impossible to see a future without the supermarket sandwich \u2013 its convenience is often invaluable \u2013 there is nonetheless a case to be made that Britain should wean itself off its sandwich habit and try to make its own lunch more often. The industrial sandwich market is a huge culprit in creating unrecyclable food packaging waste and, it is calculated, the same CO2 annually as 8.6m cars. If not for the planet, act to save yourself a few quid, rather than accepting supermarket sandwiches as an inescapable, functional necessity. Could the way forward be to eat fewer supermarket sandwiches but get more out of them when we do? In that case, How to Eat (HTE) \u2013 the series exploring how best to enjoy our most popular foods \u2013 has a plan. The joy of repetition It is difficult to believe Dominic Raab could be right about anything. He is a man to ruin rather than capture the public mood. But, in 2018, when it was revealed our foreign secretary eats the same lunch every day \u2013 a Pret chicken caesar baguette \u2013 many will have nodded in knowing approval. In repeated surveys, as many as one in eight of us have confessed (is this anything to feel guilty about?) to eating the same lunch every day. For years and years. Such statistics are often reported, if only subliminally, as evidence of British society\u2019s ingrained conservatism. We don\u2019t like faff. Or new-fangled. Or foreign. Food is fuel. We want to get back to our desks and Mail Online\u2019s sidebar of shame without having to confront Sainsburys\u2019 smoked carrot and cream cheese sandwich. Famously, 80% of sandwich sales are derived from a handful of core flavours; several of them, such as the BLT and chicken salad, are monstrosities. A more generous reading of that predictability is that supermarket sandwiches are almost universally terrible. Why experiment, when from routine disappointment at Boots to Waitrose\u2019s frequent woeful inability to fulfil your expectations, most store-bought sangers are hangers, misery encased in malted granary.

As you know, there is currently an increase in the epidemic of the coronavirus worldwide. The World Health Organization has announced the highest epidemic - red. Many competitions and significant events in the world are canceled or postponed to a later date, based on the development of the situation.</p>\n    <p>\"The International Chess Federation has implemented a number of preventative measures but not all. It was stated that the Chinese players, their coaches and accompanying persons will be quarantined for 14 days in Russia. One of the Chinese chess players [Ding Liren], coaches and the delegation are indeed quarantined. However, the second participant from China [Wang Hao] will not be quarantined and will arrive at the beginning of the tournament from a country where the epidemic of coronavirus is growing every day [Japan].</p>\n    <p>\"In addition, there is no explanation from Fide how the tournament will proceed in the event that any participant or coaches or accompanying persons, journalists, interviewers, arbiters have signs of a cold or influenza, or, God forbid, a coronavirus is determined. Will participants will be quarantined, how much time and steps are needed to analyse and determine the exact presence or absence of the virus?</p>\n    <p>\"The Candidates Tournament is a chess marathon, consisting of 14 rounds over 22 days. How the tournament will develop in the conditions of the global epidemic, what measures will be taken in case of detection of the virus and what measures will be taken in relation to a sick participant, no one explains. Due to the complexity of all these points, I turned to Fide with a proposal to postpone the tournament to a later date. I was refused this offer of mine. In connection with the above, I considered that such conditions can greatly affect the necessary level of concentration and mood required for the maximum level of play in such an important competition as the Candidates Tournament, and a possible health hazard. As a result, I was replaced with another participant.\"</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s 4NCL (Four Nations Chess League) played its latest matches last weekend at Daventry, where Guildford stretched their unbeaten sequence to 85 matches and eight years.

      "body": "<p>Four years ago Guardian Video teamed up with the theatre company<a href=\"https://headlong.co.uk/\"> Headlong</a> to create a nine-part drama series called<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ng-interactive/2017/jun/19/brexit-shorts-time-to-leave-david-hare-kristin-scott-thomas-video\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ng-interactive/2017/jun/19/brexit-shorts-time-to-leave-david-hare-kristin-scott-thomas-video\">Brexit Shorts</a>, stories from across the UK giving a range of views on Brexit. When we took the series to European film festivals, the common feedback was that Europe was rarely mentioned in the films and that the series showed up Brexit as more of a domestic debate. With this in mind, we wanted to directly focus on Europe by giving voice to the rich diversity of language and culture across the continent. We commissioned high-profile scriptwriters from Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Ireland, UK and Sweden to write works of fiction that explored their country\u2019s relationship with the EU.</p> <p>How much do we know about how Europeans feel about Europe? How does the history of each country influence its relationship to the EU? And how does that affect people\u2019s daily lives? We knew these films had to be about delivering a script that was rich in emotion and information as well as visually placing the viewer into a specific cultural environment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"820e334b295ba9970f3aeaa207ead0b8e331029d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/820e334b295ba9970f3aeaa207ead0b8e331029d/0_36_3334_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Left to right: Jess Gormley (producer), Amy Hodge (director), Noah Payne-Frank (filmmaker and editor)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Left to right: Jess Gormley (producer), Amy Hodge (director), Noah Payne-Frank (filmmaker and editor).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/02/europeans-one-right-answer-by-alice-zeniter-starring-sabrina-ouazani\">Episode 1: France</a></strong></h2> <p>This script, written by Alice Zeniter, came as a great surprise to us. In 2005 the French held a referendum to decide if they should ratify the proposed constitution of the EU. The no campaign won with 55% of the votes. Two years later with the Treaty of Lisbon, President Nicolas Sarkozy ignored the referendum and pushed the constitution through parliament regardless. The young woman in the film expresses how it feels to have your voice ignored: she believes in the EU but for her it should be more about the citizen, not the consumer. This film looks at what happens to a generation whose commitment to democracy has been so undermined.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/02/europeans-borders-by-jakub-zulczyk-starring-jacek-koman\">Episode 2: Poland</a></strong></h2> <p>A lorry driver reflects on how hard it was to do his job before the Schengen agreement and on the lack of trust at borders. \u201cI gave half my life to waiting,\u201d he said. Filmed in a lorry park on the border with Germany, just east of Berlin, we encountered every nationality of driver, stopping off for food, conversation and a cigarette. Through the lorry driver, the episode\u2019s writer, Jakub \u017bulczyk, wanted to explore the impact of freedom of movement (having seen his entire peer group emigrate to western Europe the moment Poland joined the EU in 2003). The driver comments on the difference between his life and that of his sons: \u201cYou can do whatever you want. The world \u2026 Europe, it\u2019s a completely different place to 20 or 30 years ago.\u201d</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/02/europeans-dim-sum-by-clint-dyer-starring-javone-prince\">Episode 3: UK</a></strong></h2> <p>We were unsure whether to include a UK episode, thinking that perhaps we\u2019d covered the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU through our previous series Brexit Shorts. However, it was pointed out that those films looked more at national politics than at the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. We wanted to see how British values differed from those of other EU countries.</p> <p>The writer, Clint Dyer, embodied this through the story of a bailiff emptying the house of an unsuspecting couple, showing a particular British individualism in opposition to European collectivism. The bailiff does his job with little empathy, believing that in order to fulfil his role as a good citizen he must work to financially contribute to a strongly capitalist system, yet at what cost?</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/02/europeans-terra-firma-by-blanca-domenech-starring-paula-iwasaki\">Episode 4: Spain</a></strong></h2> <p>While the big topic for Europe is immigration, in Spain it\u2019s emigration, particularly for the young. The writer, Blanca Dom\u00e9nech, grew up in a small rural town and understands the pull of local community and local traditions. The woman in her film is grappling with her boyfriend\u2019s choice to leave their home town for a city he doesn\u2019t know, to clean toilets or answer phones in a call centre, and to live in a house packed together with other immigrants. The woman in the film is angry that the EU has encouraged a generation to abandon where they\u2019re from. Dom\u00e9nech warns that we should be careful of ignoring that impassioned voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1659d33052142daaacc7c225db8e9b9b5cb5ddd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1659d33052142daaacc7c225db8e9b9b5cb5ddd0/30_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evanna Lynch, the star of the Irish entry in the series, Fake Tan (Donn\u00fa Br\u00e9ige).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evanna Lynch, the star of the Irish entry in the series, Fake Tan (Donn\u00fa Br\u00e9ige).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/02/europeans-neanderthal-by-marius-von-mayenburg-starring-robert-beyer\">Episode 5: Germany</a></strong></h2> <p>This script dealt with Germany\u2019s difficult and complex relationship to its past and place in Europe. The writer Marius von Mayenburg chose a Neanderthal as his main character because, as he says, \u201cI wanted to see him talking from the perspective of someone who has experienced war. Who has experienced historical guilt. And who believes that this guilt leads to a commitment of responsibility for the following generations.\u201d The Neanderthal says: \u201cIf we don\u2019t want to live together, we\u2019re going to die together.\u201d The film was partly shot on a darkly lit stage at the Schaub\u00fchne Theatre in Berlin, creating a surreal environment that gives the film a timeless setting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af4d2e7a29a29ba8152aa307fd6b7520ba0944c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af4d2e7a29a29ba8152aa307fd6b7520ba0944c0/0_84_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Filming the short film Neanderthal, starring Robert Beyer, the German entry in the Guardian\u2019s short film series This Is Europe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filming the short film Neanderthal, starring Robert Beyer, the German entry in the Guardian\u2019s short film series This Is Europe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/02/europeans-top-of-the-class-by-jonas-jonasson-starring-viktor-akerblom\">Episode 6: Sweden</a></strong></h2> <p>We shot this film in a heatwave in the beautiful countryside of S\u00f6derk\u00f6ping, south-west of Stockholm. The dad in this film describes how social media has reduced Swedish politics to soundbites. The writer Jonas Jonasson, known for his acclaimed book The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared says this script shows how \u201cdemocracy as we know it can be dismantled by democratic methods\u201d. The script goes on to poke fun at Swedish arrogance when the character says that \u201cWe didn\u2019t really join the EU, we rather decided they could join us.\u201d</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/02/europeans-fake-tan-by-lisa-mcinerney-starring-evanna-lynch\">Episode 7: Ireland</a></strong></h2> <p>According to the writer Lisa McInerney, \u201cany script on Ireland\u2019s relationship to the EU has to be seen through the lens of Brexit so that\u2019s why I decided on framing my character as a young woman breaking up with her English boyfriend\u201d. Played by the Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch, the character says that \u201cI have to go on without him.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago Guardian Video teamed up with the theatre company Headlong to create a nine-part drama series called Brexit Shorts, stories from across the UK giving a range of views on Brexit. When we took the series to European film festivals, the common feedback was that Europe was rarely mentioned in the films and that the series showed up Brexit as more of a domestic debate. With this in mind, we wanted to directly focus on Europe by giving voice to the rich diversity of language and culture across the continent. We commissioned high-profile scriptwriters from Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Ireland, UK and Sweden to write works of fiction that explored their country\u2019s relationship with the EU. How much do we know about how Europeans feel about Europe? How does the history of each country influence its relationship to the EU? And how does that affect people\u2019s daily lives? We knew these films had to be about delivering a script that was rich in emotion and information as well as visually placing the viewer into a specific cultural environment. Episode 1: France This script, written by Alice Zeniter, came as a great surprise to us. In 2005 the French held a referendum to decide if they should ratify the proposed constitution of the EU. The no campaign won with 55% of the votes. Two years later with the Treaty of Lisbon, President Nicolas Sarkozy ignored the referendum and pushed the constitution through parliament regardless. The young woman in the film expresses how it feels to have your voice ignored: she believes in the EU but for her it should be more about the citizen, not the consumer. This film looks at what happens to a generation whose commitment to democracy has been so undermined. Episode 2: Poland A lorry driver reflects on how hard it was to do his job before the Schengen agreement and on the lack of trust at borders. \u201cI gave half my life to waiting,\u201d he said. Filmed in a lorry park on the border with Germany, just east of Berlin, we encountered every nationality of driver, stopping off for food, conversation and a cigarette. Through the lorry driver, the episode\u2019s writer, Jakub \u017bulczyk, wanted to explore the impact of freedom of movement (having seen his entire peer group emigrate to western Europe the moment Poland joined the EU in 2003). The driver comments on the difference between his life and that of his sons: \u201cYou can do whatever you want. The world \u2026 Europe, it\u2019s a completely different place to 20 or 30 years ago.\u201d Episode 3: UK We were unsure whether to include a UK episode, thinking that perhaps we\u2019d covered the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU through our previous series Brexit Shorts. However, it was pointed out that those films looked more at national politics than at the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. We wanted to see how British values differed from those of other EU countries. The writer, Clint Dyer, embodied this through the story of a bailiff emptying the house of an unsuspecting couple, showing a particular British individualism in opposition to European collectivism. The bailiff does his job with little empathy, believing that in order to fulfil his role as a good citizen he must work to financially contribute to a strongly capitalist system, yet at what cost? Episode 4: Spain While the big topic for Europe is immigration, in Spain it\u2019s emigration, particularly for the young. The writer, Blanca Dom\u00e9nech, grew up in a small rural town and understands the pull of local community and local traditions. The woman in her film is grappling with her boyfriend\u2019s choice to leave their home town for a city he doesn\u2019t know, to clean toilets or answer phones in a call centre, and to live in a house packed together with other immigrants. The woman in the film is angry that the EU has encouraged a generation to abandon where they\u2019re from. Dom\u00e9nech warns that we should be careful of ignoring that impassioned voice. Episode 5: Germany This script dealt with Germany\u2019s difficult and complex relationship to its past and place in Europe. The writer Marius von Mayenburg chose a Neanderthal as his main character because, as he says, \u201cI wanted to see him talking from the perspective of someone who has experienced war. Who has experienced historical guilt. And who believes that this guilt leads to a commitment of responsibility for the following generations.\u201d The Neanderthal says: \u201cIf we don\u2019t want to live together, we\u2019re going to die together.\u201d The film was partly shot on a darkly lit stage at the Schaub\u00fchne Theatre in Berlin, creating a surreal environment that gives the film a timeless setting. Episode 6: Sweden We shot this film in a heatwave in the beautiful countryside of S\u00f6derk\u00f6ping, south-west of Stockholm. The dad in this film describes how social media has reduced Swedish politics to soundbites. The writer Jonas Jonasson, known for his acclaimed book The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared says this script shows how \u201cdemocracy as we know it can be dismantled by democratic methods\u201d. The script goes on to poke fun at Swedish arrogance when the character says that \u201cWe didn\u2019t really join the EU, we rather decided they could join us.\u201d Episode 7: Ireland According to the writer Lisa McInerney, \u201cany script on Ireland\u2019s relationship to the EU has to be seen through the lens of Brexit so that\u2019s why I decided on framing my character as a young woman breaking up with her English boyfriend\u201d. Played by the Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch, the character says that \u201cI have to go on without him. I don\u2019t mind, it just feels weird.\u201d McInerney describes how the EU greatly elevated Ireland\u2019s status on the European stage. They were no longer viewed as the poor relations of the British but were quickly seen as a symbol of the progressive politics that the EU stood for, and her lead character demonstrates that emboldened position. At a time of divisive politics, these stories go beyond news headlines to enable us to access the personal in the political.

      "bodyText": "UK consumers will spend more than \u00a34bn getting their caffeine fix from high street coffee shops this year. Spending at big brand coffee shops, from Costa Coffee to Starbucks, will reach an all-time high this year, with sales up \u00a31bn since 2015, according to research from Mintel. However, the rate of sales growth slowed by two-thirds between 2015 and 2019 as drinkers looked beyond high street coffee chains to buy hot drinks. A quarter of consumers buy hot drinks from fast-food chains such as McDonald\u2019s, while a fifth buy them from a supermarket or in-store cafe such as Tesco and Ikea. One in six consumers seek out a traditional cafe to enjoy their hot drink. Nevertheless, the enduring popularity of the high street coffee shop chain is highlighted in Mintel\u2019s research, which found that almost half (48%) of UK consumers bought a hot drink at Costa Coffee in a three-month period last year. Starbucks ranked second at 30%, with fast-food chains in aggregate third at 26%. The British love affair with popping out for a coffee began in the late 1990s when Starbucks arrived in the UK and made it cool, and Costa Coffee led the charge of the coffee shop on to high streets up and down the country. \u201cCoffee drinking came out of the home at scale,\u201d says Jeffrey Young, the chief executive of coffee research specialists Allegra. \u201cDrinking coffee became a lifestyle experience, there were branded cups, you could sit in and take your time.\u201d There are almost 26,000 outlets across the UK \u2013 from the main chains to independent coffee shops and cafes in supermarkets, service stations and retail stores \u2013 with the total market valued at more than \u00a310bn.

Image of the week A rarely seen Canaletto painting of Westminster Abbey has gone on public display for probably the first time in more than two centuries. Since 1792, it has hung in the private living quarters of the dean. It\u2019s the earliest work of art to depict the abbey\u2019s famous west towers, completed in 1745. Planned refurbishment of the deanery and the opening of gallery spaces in 2018 has now allowed the abbey to put one of its jewels on public display.

      "body": "<p>As Mohammad Arshad\u2019s body was brought into the courtyard, his lifeless face covered in a white shroud, the wailing began. The 22-year-old house painter, who had been beloved by his six sisters and would always bring them fruit when he finished work, had died a brutal death two days earlier. He had been killed because he was Muslim.</p> <p>Several of Arshad\u2019s sisters reached out to touch his cold bruised cheeks. \u201cPlease wake up, brother,\u201d they cried. \u201cWake up. Please open your eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Arshad\u2019s death is just a small fragment of the devastating legacy<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\"> of the riots</a> that engulfed Delhi last week \u2013 the worst religious violence in the capital in decades. For four consecutive days, Hindu mobs of thousands roamed the streets of north-east Delhi, destroying Muslims\u2019 houses and shops, and lynching or killing Muslim residents. The bodies of the dead are gradually being returned to families but the thousands of Muslims who fled their homes in the riots are mostly still too afraid to go back.</p> <p>While there was retaliation on both sides, the majority of the violence was carried out against Muslims. A senior Delhi government health department official told the Guardian that of the 49 found dead so far from the violence, 35 were Muslim. More bodies were still being recovered from the drains more than a week on.</p> <p>Last Wednesday had begun as a normal day for Arshad, who had left for work on his motorcycle accompanied by two Hindu friends. But in the Delhi neighbourhood of Karaval Nagar, a mob of around 30 Hindus had descended, demanding to know their religion. According to a witness, Arshad kept quiet, so the mob forced down his trousers. On seeing he was circumcised, as is common among Muslims in India, the mob instantly beat him to death. His bloodied body was later found in a gutter, his pants still around his ankles.</p> <p>At his funeral on Monday, held in his uncle\u2019s hometown of Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, Arshad\u2019s 15-year-old sister Ayesha broke into a furious, grief-ridden rage and began pointing her finger angrily at an onlooker she presumed to be Hindu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31b002d424d9548c934c33ef0b98dd179001f1b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b002d424d9548c934c33ef0b98dd179001f1b1/0_0_3847_2308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammad Arshad\u2019s mother and sisters surround his body shortly before his funeral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammad Arshad\u2019s mother and sisters surround his body shortly before his funeral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhy have you killed my brother?\u201d said Ayesha. \u201cHis body bears many torture marks. You tortured my brother brutally and murdered him. Do you know what a nice person he was? Did you not hesitate to kill him? I know you killed him just because he was Muslim. Why do you hate some people in society? Does your religion teach you to kill people of other religions? Shed the hatred from your heart.\u201d</p> <p>While the violence may have abated, the hatred and fear that the riots stirred up among communities in Delhi, where Hindus and Muslims had until last week lived peacefully side-by-side, remains potent. In the aftermath, even in unaffected areas of Delhi, an exodus of Muslim families began this week, with swathes packing up their bags and returning for good to their home villages, fearing for their safety in the capital.</p> <p>In a prayer ground in Mustafabad, a makeshift relief camp had been set up for over a thousand Muslim families who had fled the violence and still could not return home, out of fear over their safety or simply because their houses and all their worldly possession had been looted, destroyed or burned. Food, shelter and medical care was being given out to those who had lost everything.</p> <p>Noor Jahan, 48, who lived in Shiv Vihar, said she did not feel she could go back to her home. She had run away as the mobs descended but not before hearing the taunts of the rioters, that she said still haunted her. \u201cThey shouted \u2018come out, come out, we will fuck you and you will give birth to [Hindu gods] Ram and Hanuman\u2019,\u201d she recalled with a shudder.</p> <p>\u201cHow can I go back, it is not safe there,\u201d said Jahan. \u201cPeople are saying that the rioters were outsiders but they had local knowledge, they knew which houses were the Muslim houses to attack, so it means local people helped them, my Hindu neighbours helped them. So I plan to either go back to my village or move to a Muslim-majority area in Delhi.\u201d</p> <p>Many once affluent families suddenly found themselves ruined overnight. Mohammad Akhtar had built up his successful business as a milkman from nothing. But his 14 water buffalo, worth millions of rupees, were stolen in the riots, his family house was looted and destroyed, and his whole family was sheltering in the camp, reliant on donations. Having lived in a Hindu-majority area, most of his customers had been Hindus. \u201cWe own our house so we have to go back, but I am scared it will be unsafe for us to live there,\u201d said his wife Raseena Akhtar, 40. \u201cWe have nothing left now.\u201d</p> <p>For the children who witnessed the violence, the trauma was evident. Sehliza Naaz, nine years old, lay under a makeshift tent looking pallid and staring blankly into the middle distance. She and her family had fled their house in the neighbourhood of Shiv Vihar around midnight on Tuesday as the buildings around them had begun to be set on fire by Hindu mobs. They had walked over an hour to Mustafabad, which is a Muslim-majority area.</p> <p>\u201cShe is not sleeping and she keeps repeating the same question \u2013 \u2018why did they burn the mosques\u2019,\u201d said her grandmother Shahida Begum,as she gently stroked her granddaughter\u2019s forehead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"92d9fb97262019a8c5e5d96de81a994b50a2f8b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92d9fb97262019a8c5e5d96de81a994b50a2f8b7/28_0_3784_2271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shehliza Naaz lies in a displaced people\u2019s camp in Mustafabad.

For three days, Hindu rioters attacked Shiv Vihar\u2019s Muslim localities and ran mayhem without any resistance from police. The mobs repeatedly used gas canisters as weapons, setting them alight and exploding them in Muslim properties so that the walls crumbled entirely.</p> <p>Abdul Kalam, a Muslim man who fled Shiv Vihar on Tuesday night, described how \u201cover 1,000\u201d men had arrived in the neighbourhood on trucks. \u201cMost of them wore helmets to hide their identity and shield their heads from possible stone attacks\u2026 Apart from being armed with pistols, iron rods, crowbars, hammers and other heavy tools, the attackers also carried gas cylinders, big jerry cans of acid and petrol,\u201d said Kalam.</p> <p>The families sheltering in Mustafabad and other neighbourhoods spoke repeatedly of their fears of returning to the places they had called home. Hasmata, 75, said her son had gone back to their house this week to pick up some possessions and had been confronted by Hindu neighbours. \u201cThey said to him: \u2018Why have you come back? You should not be here anymore\u2019. Even though that is our home, they chased him away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cbd48cf69d7aa541b21553b01f59daae810f3f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cbd48cf69d7aa541b21553b01f59daae810f3f4/13_0_3293_1976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shops and motorbikes owned by Muslims lie in ruins in Shiv Vihar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shops and motorbikes owned by Muslims lie in ruins in Shiv Vihar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One week on, some are still looking for relatives who went missing, and living with the agony of uncertainty.

      "bodyText": "As Mohammad Arshad\u2019s body was brought into the courtyard, his lifeless face covered in a white shroud, the wailing began. The 22-year-old house painter, who had been beloved by his six sisters and would always bring them fruit when he finished work, had died a brutal death two days earlier. He had been killed because he was Muslim. Several of Arshad\u2019s sisters reached out to touch his cold bruised cheeks. \u201cPlease wake up, brother,\u201d they cried. \u201cWake up. Please open your eyes.\u201d Arshad\u2019s death is just a small fragment of the devastating legacy of the riots that engulfed Delhi last week \u2013 the worst religious violence in the capital in decades. For four consecutive days, Hindu mobs of thousands roamed the streets of north-east Delhi, destroying Muslims\u2019 houses and shops, and lynching or killing Muslim residents. The bodies of the dead are gradually being returned to families but the thousands of Muslims who fled their homes in the riots are mostly still too afraid to go back. While there was retaliation on both sides, the majority of the violence was carried out against Muslims. A senior Delhi government health department official told the Guardian that of the 49 found dead so far from the violence, 35 were Muslim. More bodies were still being recovered from the drains more than a week on. Last Wednesday had begun as a normal day for Arshad, who had left for work on his motorcycle accompanied by two Hindu friends. But in the Delhi neighbourhood of Karaval Nagar, a mob of around 30 Hindus had descended, demanding to know their religion. According to a witness, Arshad kept quiet, so the mob forced down his trousers. On seeing he was circumcised, as is common among Muslims in India, the mob instantly beat him to death. His bloodied body was later found in a gutter, his pants still around his ankles. At his funeral on Monday, held in his uncle\u2019s hometown of Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, Arshad\u2019s 15-year-old sister Ayesha broke into a furious, grief-ridden rage and began pointing her finger angrily at an onlooker she presumed to be Hindu. \u201cWhy have you killed my brother?\u201d said Ayesha. \u201cHis body bears many torture marks. You tortured my brother brutally and murdered him. Do you know what a nice person he was? Did you not hesitate to kill him? I know you killed him just because he was Muslim. Why do you hate some people in society? Does your religion teach you to kill people of other religions? Shed the hatred from your heart.\u201d While the violence may have abated, the hatred and fear that the riots stirred up among communities in Delhi, where Hindus and Muslims had until last week lived peacefully side-by-side, remains potent. In the aftermath, even in unaffected areas of Delhi, an exodus of Muslim families began this week, with swathes packing up their bags and returning for good to their home villages, fearing for their safety in the capital. In a prayer ground in Mustafabad, a makeshift relief camp had been set up for over a thousand Muslim families who had fled the violence and still could not return home, out of fear over their safety or simply because their houses and all their worldly possession had been looted, destroyed or burned. Food, shelter and medical care was being given out to those who had lost everything. Noor Jahan, 48, who lived in Shiv Vihar, said she did not feel she could go back to her home. She had run away as the mobs descended but not before hearing the taunts of the rioters, that she said still haunted her. \u201cThey shouted \u2018come out, come out, we will fuck you and you will give birth to [Hindu gods] Ram and Hanuman\u2019,\u201d she recalled with a shudder. \u201cHow can I go back, it is not safe there,\u201d said Jahan. \u201cPeople are saying that the rioters were outsiders but they had local knowledge, they knew which houses were the Muslim houses to attack, so it means local people helped them, my Hindu neighbours helped them. So I plan to either go back to my village or move to a Muslim-majority area in Delhi.\u201d Many once affluent families suddenly found themselves ruined overnight. Mohammad Akhtar had built up his successful business as a milkman from nothing. But his 14 water buffalo, worth millions of rupees, were stolen in the riots, his family house was looted and destroyed, and his whole family was sheltering in the camp, reliant on donations. Having lived in a Hindu-majority area, most of his customers had been Hindus. \u201cWe own our house so we have to go back, but I am scared it will be unsafe for us to live there,\u201d said his wife Raseena Akhtar, 40. \u201cWe have nothing left now.\u201d For the children who witnessed the violence, the trauma was evident. Sehliza Naaz, nine years old, lay under a makeshift tent looking pallid and staring blankly into the middle distance. She and her family had fled their house in the neighbourhood of Shiv Vihar around midnight on Tuesday as the buildings around them had begun to be set on fire by Hindu mobs. They had walked over an hour to Mustafabad, which is a Muslim-majority area. \u201cShe is not sleeping and she keeps repeating the same question \u2013 \u2018why did they burn the mosques\u2019,\u201d said her grandmother Shahida Begum,as she gently stroked her granddaughter\u2019s forehead. In Shiv Vihar, from where they and many others had escaped, almost every Muslim home lay in blackened ruins, and two mosques looked like bomb sites. For three days, Hindu rioters attacked Shiv Vihar\u2019s Muslim localities and ran mayhem without any resistance from police. The mobs repeatedly used gas canisters as weapons, setting them alight and exploding them in Muslim properties so that the walls crumbled entirely. Abdul Kalam, a Muslim man who fled Shiv Vihar on Tuesday night, described how \u201cover 1,000\u201d men had arrived in the neighbourhood on trucks. \u201cMost of them wore helmets to hide their identity and shield their heads from possible stone attacks\u2026 Apart from being armed with pistols, iron rods, crowbars, hammers and other heavy tools, the attackers also carried gas cylinders, big jerry cans of acid and petrol,\u201d said Kalam. The families sheltering in Mustafabad and other neighbourhoods spoke repeatedly of their fears of returning to the places they had called home. Hasmata, 75, said her son had gone back to their house this week to pick up some possessions and had been confronted by Hindu neighbours. \u201cThey said to him: \u2018Why have you come back? You should not be here anymore\u2019. Even though that is our home, they chased him away.\u201d One week on, some are still looking for relatives who went missing, and living with the agony of uncertainty. Sitting outside GTB hospital, where most of the bodies were taken, Gulshan, 27, wept freely as she waited for the DNA results to confirm that a body brought in was that of her father. His body had been so badly burnt that only his right leg was found. \u201cI depended on my father for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will I do now?\u201d Meanwhile, Mohammad Nawab, a rickshaw driver, said he had been frantically searching for his father for days. His father had gone to an Islamic congregation at Kasabpura, New Delhi last Tuesday, in an area that was hit by violence, and had not been seen since. \u201cMany people are searching for the bodies of their relatives,\u201d said Nawab.\u201d I am searching for my father\u2019s body too. I visited morgues of two hospitals. I could not find my father\u2019s body there. Every day one or two bodies are being recovered from drains and other places. I shall keep visiting the morgues until I find his body.\u201d \u201cHe was a pious man, he never harmed anyone,\u201d he added. Nawab said he was packing up his life in Delhi and returning with his family to his village in Uttar Pradesh. \u201cI cannot sleep at night whenever it comes to my mind that my father might have been lynched for being a Muslim,\u201d he said. \u201cI have decided to leave Delhi and return to my village. Delhi is unsafe for all Muslims.\u201d",

Hermes, whose 15,000 couriers are normally paid only if they complete a parcel delivery or collection for retailers including John Lewis and Asos, said on Friday it had set aside a \u00a31m support fund. The move follows warnings from trade unions that a lack of sick pay for the more than 1 million gig economy workers could accelerate the spread of the virus, as workers would face financial difficulties if they did not carry on regardless of their or others\u2019 health. Many gig workers are in public, highly mobile roles visiting hundreds of addresses every week delivering parcels and takeaways and carrying passengers in minicabs. DPD UK, another large courier firm that relies on self-employed drivers, said on Tuesday it was not offering sick pay. Deliveroo, which uses self-employed couriers to deliver takeaways, said it was considering offering financial support to affected riders in the UK, as it has done in Hong Kong. Uber, which works with more than 40,000 self-employed minicab drivers in London alone, is in talks with Axa insurance about extending drivers\u2019 sickness cover to include self-isolation that does not involve sickness. The GMB trade union welcomed the move by Hermes. \u201cBy setting up this fund to assist those couriers they are not just protecting people who deliver for them; they are helping to keep the British public safe,\u201d said the national officer Mick Rix. \u201cThis is a very welcome step in the right direction, and all employers across the UK should follow their example.\u201d Self-employed workers are not eligible for statutory sick pay so Wednesday\u2019s announcement from Boris Johnson that workers will be eligible for payments from the first day off work, rather than the fourth, does not help them. The Department for Work and Pensions said welfare benefits including universal credit and employment and support allowance would be available, but these are considered by many to be too slow and cumbersome to apply for to be a viable short-term solution. Hermes couriers are expected to be offered a lump sum for the two-week period of self-isolation being requested by health authorities of people who believe they may have come into contact with the virus. \u201cThis is an extraordinary situation,\u201d said Martijn De Lange, the chief executive of Hermes UK. \u201cWe have taken the decision to help support our couriers financially if they need help and also ensure we are doing everything we can to prevent the spread of the virus.

Norwich seem to be attempting to follow the Burnley model of gaining a foothold in the top division anyway. It might not be possible to put down permanent roots in a single season, so it is not necessarily a good idea to go out on a financial limb the minute promotion is achieved. Relegation need not be calamitous as long as you can still live within your means, especially if you are able to retain the manager and keep the same core of players together.</p> <p>Although very few clubs other than Burnley spent as little as Norwich last summer \u2013 although perhaps significantly one of them was Liverpool \u2013 Sheffield United\u2019s \u00a340m outlay did not make them the division\u2019s biggest splashers of cash. Far from it; many bigger clubs paid out more than twice as much and United were not even the most conspicuous spenders among the three promoted clubs.</p> <p>Aston Villa, who came up through the play-offs, immediately set about restructuring their entire side, keeping Jack Grealish but bringing in virtually a fresh set of players to play alongside him at a cost variously estimated at between \u00a3110m and \u00a3140m. But Villa\u2019s reward for keeping pace with Manchester City and Manchester United in the transfer market is currently a place in the bottom three. Villa too have a game in hand on immediate rivals as a result of playing in the Carabao Cup final, but even if they win it they are likely to be worried about survival for the rest of the season.</p> <p>Some of their performances have been impressive, others much less so, and it was interesting that Tyrone Mings suggested last week that trying to bed in so many players at the same time might be a clue to their inconsistency. Villa have unquestionably been unlucky with injuries to key players such as Wesley and Tom Heaton, but the point Mings was making was that many of the new intake are new to the Premier League as well, at least as regular performers. \u201cHalf a dozen or more of us are learning on the job,\u201d the defender said. \u201cWe have to learn quickly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5e69a397c67c4234253aabd01c7600169ba793f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5e69a397c67c4234253aabd01c7600169ba793f/0_10_3333_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aston Villa are the third promoted team and Tyrone Mings (centre) says \u2018half a dozen or more of us are learning on the job\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aston Villa are the third promoted team and Tyrone Mings (centre) says \u2018half a dozen or more of us are learning on the job\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Norwich have the same problem. Their players may be familiar with each other but most are new to the Premier League, and though they managed to beat Manchester City back in September they have found the overall standard in the top flight a challenge most weeks.</p> <p>Sheffield United, on the other hand, are thriving, despite bringing in a clutch of players in summer and a couple more in January. They have reached the traditionally significant total of 40 points, and though Europe may prove a stretch, both in terms of finishing high enough in the table and buying more players to bulk out the squad if necessary, they are definitely not going to be relegated.</p> <p>Credit must go to Chris Wilder for his acuity in the transfer market, therefore, for apart from picking up Phil Jagielka on a free United did not go for established Premier League names or prominent overseas talent. Their team even now does not contain many players with vast Premier League experience, though you would never know that from watching them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>They broke their transfer record again in January to bring in the Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge from Genk, though that was in the knowledge they had made a solid start in their new division. They have done so without plunging themselves into unmanageable debt too, for Wilder is proud of spending just the money their rise in status allows. Perfectly appropriately given the club nickname and the industry for which Sheffield is famous, the Blades have proved themselves steely competitors. Not naive or soft-centred, but sharp and resilient from day one.</p> <p>Very few newly promoted teams in recent years have managed to find the magic formula quite as quickly, and Norwich\u2019s and Aston Villa\u2019s divergent paths but similar experiences would suggest Sheffield United are the exception rather than the rule.</p>",

Relegation need not be calamitous as long as you can still live within your means, especially if you are able to retain the manager and keep the same core of players together. Although very few clubs other than Burnley spent as little as Norwich last summer \u2013 although perhaps significantly one of them was Liverpool \u2013 Sheffield United\u2019s \u00a340m outlay did not make them the division\u2019s biggest splashers of cash. Far from it; many bigger clubs paid out more than twice as much and United were not even the most conspicuous spenders among the three promoted clubs. Aston Villa, who came up through the play-offs, immediately set about restructuring their entire side, keeping Jack Grealish but bringing in virtually a fresh set of players to play alongside him at a cost variously estimated at between \u00a3110m and \u00a3140m. But Villa\u2019s reward for keeping pace with Manchester City and Manchester United in the transfer market is currently a place in the bottom three. Villa too have a game in hand on immediate rivals as a result of playing in the Carabao Cup final, but even if they win it they are likely to be worried about survival for the rest of the season. Some of their performances have been impressive, others much less so, and it was interesting that Tyrone Mings suggested last week that trying to bed in so many players at the same time might be a clue to their inconsistency. Villa have unquestionably been unlucky with injuries to key players such as Wesley and Tom Heaton, but the point Mings was making was that many of the new intake are new to the Premier League as well, at least as regular performers. \u201cHalf a dozen or more of us are learning on the job,\u201d the defender said. \u201cWe have to learn quickly.\u201d Norwich have the same problem. Their players may be familiar with each other but most are new to the Premier League, and though they managed to beat Manchester City back in September they have found the overall standard in the top flight a challenge most weeks. Sheffield United, on the other hand, are thriving, despite bringing in a clutch of players in summer and a couple more in January. They have reached the traditionally significant total of 40 points, and though Europe may prove a stretch, both in terms of finishing high enough in the table and buying more players to bulk out the squad if necessary, they are definitely not going to be relegated. Credit must go to Chris Wilder for his acuity in the transfer market, therefore, for apart from picking up Phil Jagielka on a free United did not go for established Premier League names or prominent overseas talent. Their team even now does not contain many players with vast Premier League experience, though you would never know that from watching them. They broke their transfer record again in January to bring in the Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge from Genk, though that was in the knowledge they had made a solid start in their new division. They have done so without plunging themselves into unmanageable debt too, for Wilder is proud of spending just the money their rise in status allows. Perfectly appropriately given the club nickname and the industry for which Sheffield is famous, the Blades have proved themselves steely competitors. Not naive or soft-centred, but sharp and resilient from day one. Very few newly promoted teams in recent years have managed to find the magic formula quite as quickly, and Norwich\u2019s and Aston Villa\u2019s divergent paths but similar experiences would suggest Sheffield United are the exception rather than the rule.",

The administration created the tracking system following its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on immigration in 2018 where more than 2,500 children were forcibly separated from their parents at the southern border \u2013 though the watchdog has estimated that figure could be much higher. Immigration officials have continued to separate some children from their parents at the border for certain reasons including a parent\u2019s suspected criminal history, and have said the tracking system will help avoid some of the chaos, confusion and trauma suffered by separated children. According to court figures at least 955 children were separated between June 2018 and July 2019. But that tracking system is flawed, in part because details about whether separation from parents occurred are not automatically transmitted between federal agencies, from US Customs and Border Protection, which manages the border, to Health and Human Services (HHS), which deals with migrant children, the HHS Office of the Inspector General, reported. The report found that Health and Human Services only discovered the 2018 separations were occurring through media reports \u2013 in part because there was no communication between agencies. The result was chaos, with some children languishing in detention well beyond legal limits, others inconsolable in the hands of care providers who had no answers on when parents were returning.

The kids had lots of questions, but we had no answers for them.\u201d Health and Human Services officials said in a letter to the watchdog that it had the best interest of children at heart and was committed to improving, but that family separation is a thorny subject involving the Justice Department, Homeland Security and HHS, and there isn\u2019t a simple fix for some issues. Staff members interviewed by the watchdog team reported problems ranging from being unprepared with suitable facilities and personnel to care for young children in detention and difficulties matching parents back with their parents after they had been separated by the authorities. There was no plan in place to reunited children with their parents after they had been separated, inspectors found. One government employee said they \u201ccalled [the DHS detention center] every day seeking the parents of an 11-year-old child. They could not reach anyone. The child cried every day.\u201d The 2018 separations occurred in part because some migrant parents were charged criminally with illegal entry and jailed \u2013 while legally the children could not be put in jail and so were detained separately. Curbing immigration is Trump\u2019s signature policy and with more families coming to the border and turning themselves in, while traditionally unlawful crossings had more typically been lone males looking for work and trying to evade the authorities, the administration declared itself overwhelmed. Arrests were an effort in part to dissuade migrants from making the dangerous trek north, with families separated and tortuous court procedures, policy efforts critics decried as intentionally based on cruel intentions.

      "bodyText": "A group of eight Conservative rebel MPs, including four former cabinet ministers, have put down an amendment calling on the government to eliminate all Huawei technology from the UK\u2019s mobile phone networks by the end of 2022. Led by Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson, David Davis and Damian Green, the rebels hope to stage a show of strength \u2013 although it is not clear whether they can attract the 44 votes needed to threaten Boris Johnson\u2019s majority. There are some claims they could threaten the government if all opposition parties supported them, but one rebel source told the Guardian the true number of Tory malcontents was in the 30s, not enough to force a defeat. Insiders said the amendment represented the first step in a \u201cguerrilla\u201d campaign aimed at prompting a rethink in Downing Street, in tandem with pressure from the White House, which is strongly opposed to the deployment of Huawei. The White House and the Conservative rebels believe technology from the Chinese firm represents a potential surveillance risk, but Downing Street and Britain\u2019s spy agencies believe any risks can be managed, based partly on their experience of the kit. The amendment is attached to an obscure technical bill, the telecommunications infrastructure bill, and is unlikely to be effective if passed because the proposed legislation only applies where leasehold property owners are unresponsive to phone companies. It does, however, represent an opportunity for rebels to declare their numbers before Downing Street puts forward legislation to implement its Huawei decision to a vote later in the spring. Last month, Boris Johnson\u2019s government announced plans to cap Huawei\u2019s market share in 5G at 35%. The rebels want the UK to eliminate the Chinese company\u2019s involvement entirely, even though it has been used in British networks since 2003. On Thursday, Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary, met his US counterpart, Mark Esper, for a \u201ccandid discussion\u201d about Britain\u2019s 5G plans. Esper said he was particularly concerned about the security of intelligence-sharing between the two countries, and that any Chinese involvement \u201ccould allow Beijing to access, disrupt, manipulate and misuse vital information, thus jeopardising the integrity and strength of the Nato alliance\u201d. Wallace said Huawei was going to be prevented from supplying core technology to British networks, and that ministers aimed to reduce its share below the proposed 35%, without giving any commitment to go to zero as the rebels demand. British policy was to \u201cban, cap and cut\u201d, he said.",

They should stop hiding and start engaging.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/29/amber-rudd-resigns-as-home-secretary-after-windrush-scandal\">Rudd stepped down as home secretary as the Windrush scandal escalated</a> and it emerged she had misled parliament over the existence of targets within the Home Office to deport undocumented migrants.</p> <p>Before cancelling the event, the society attempted to assuage concerns about her appearance in a statement on Facebook. \u201cThe concerns we see happening now around this event are absolutely ones which we as a committee feel ourselves,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>\u201cWe invited Ms Rudd on the understanding that this would be an honest and frank conversation about how her policies have impacted women of all races, religions, classes etcetera.</p> <p>\u201cWe will not run away from mentioning any of Ms Rudd\u2019s past comments or policies, and we ask you to attend this event to help us campaign for a truly frank feminism which is not afraid of taking such opportunities to discuss these issues with high-profile figures.\u201d</p> <p>The society was incorporated as part of the UNWomen UK\u2019s Student Champion Programme, which aims to involve university students in advocating for gender equality.</p> <p>In response, Rudd\u2019s daughter Florence Gill tweeted: \u201cCan not believe mum was \u2018no-platformed\u2019 at my old Uni yesterday. Mum doesn\u2019t need the platform and travelled to talk for FREE for International Womens Day-proceeds to FGM charity. I don\u2019t care if you disagree with her. Its fucking rude This is NOT how women should treat each other.\u201d</p> <p>A number of former politicians also came to Rudd\u2019s defence.</p> <p>Responding to Gill, the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne tweeted: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your mum \u2013 \u2018no platforming\u2019 one of the most senior female politicians of our generation at an International Women\u2019s Day event just makes the Oxford students involved look stupid &amp; small-minded, the very opposite of what that great university stands for. Their loss.\u201d</p> <p>The former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson posted: \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to silence Amber Rudd you really are being anti-democratic.\u201d</p> <p>The former Conservative and Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Wollaston tweeted: \u201cNo platforming of @AmberRuddUK by Oxford is absurd &amp; worrying.

      "bodyText": "The former Conservative home secretary Amber Rudd has hit out at \u201crude\u201d students at the University of Oxford who cancelled her appearance at an International Women\u2019s Day event 30 minutes before it was due to take place. The event, called \u201cIn Conversation: Amber Rudd\u201d and organised by UNWomen Oxford, was scheduled for Thursday evening as part of its UN Women\u2019s 2020 Trailblazer Series before International Women\u2019s Day on Sunday. Rudd, who stepped down as an MP at the last election, was supposed to be interviewed about her earlier role as minister for women and equalities and was due to speak about encouraging women to get into politics. But after receiving criticism for inviting Rudd because of her links with the Windrush scandal, the society announced on Facebook that the talk was cancelled after a majority vote by the group\u2019s committee. Writing on Twitter, Rudd said: \u201cBadly judged and rude of some students last night at Oxford to decide to \u2018no platform\u2019 me 30 mins before an event I had been invited to for #IWD2020 to encourage young women into politics. They should stop hiding and start engaging.\u201d Rudd stepped down as home secretary as the Windrush scandal escalated and it emerged she had misled parliament over the existence of targets within the Home Office to deport undocumented migrants. Before cancelling the event, the society attempted to assuage concerns about her appearance in a statement on Facebook. \u201cThe concerns we see happening now around this event are absolutely ones which we as a committee feel ourselves,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe invited Ms Rudd on the understanding that this would be an honest and frank conversation about how her policies have impacted women of all races, religions, classes etcetera. \u201cWe will not run away from mentioning any of Ms Rudd\u2019s past comments or policies, and we ask you to attend this event to help us campaign for a truly frank feminism which is not afraid of taking such opportunities to discuss these issues with high-profile figures.\u201d The society was incorporated as part of the UNWomen UK\u2019s Student Champion Programme, which aims to involve university students in advocating for gender equality. In response, Rudd\u2019s daughter Florence Gill tweeted: \u201cCan not believe mum was \u2018no-platformed\u2019 at my old Uni yesterday. Mum doesn\u2019t need the platform and travelled to talk for FREE for International Womens Day-proceeds to FGM charity. I don\u2019t care if you disagree with her. Its fucking rude This is NOT how women should treat each other.\u201d A number of former politicians also came to Rudd\u2019s defence. Responding to Gill, the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne tweeted: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your mum \u2013 \u2018no platforming\u2019 one of the most senior female politicians of our generation at an International Women\u2019s Day event just makes the Oxford students involved look stupid &amp; small-minded, the very opposite of what that great university stands for. Their loss.\u201d The former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson posted: \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to silence Amber Rudd you really are being anti-democratic.\u201d The former Conservative and Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Wollaston tweeted: \u201cNo platforming of @AmberRuddUK by Oxford is absurd &amp; worrying. Why are universities allowing ideological fringes to crush freedom of speech in our centres of excellence?\u201d",

Decades ago, during the dictatorship, women led the resistance \u2013 from organizing soup kitchens to fighting for human rights,\u201d said Bel\u00e9n Calcagno, who is coordinating a group marching on Sunday in Concepci\u00f3n, a city in southern Chile. \u201cToday our role continues to be central.\u201d</p> \n<p>The slogan \u201cNunca m\u00e1s sin nosotras\u201d \u2013 Never again without us women \u2013 is often heard at protests, as female activists demand that women\u2019s call for justice and equity should be as important as those for social and economic reforms.</p> \n<p>Alondra Carrillo, spokesperson for the country\u2019s largest feminist advocacy group, La Coordinadora Feminista 8M, said that as well as sharing the demands of the wider movement, Chile\u2019s women are fighting for specific gender-related issues, such as legal abortion, an end to domestic violence, and for greater equality in the workplace.</p> \n<p>\u201cWomen are permanently subjected to various forms of patriarchal violence, which is an integral part of the way in which Chile is organized,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>That idea is also reflected in the anti-rape song by a Chilean feminist collective, which has become an anthem for protesters around the world. First performed last November, the song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/06/chilean-anti-rape-anthem-becomes-international-feminist-phenomenon\">A Rapist in Your Path</a> depicts a world in which state oppression mirrors sexual violence, and singles out police, judges and the president as accomplice in the aggression.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"71b8bbd0-c2be-4c89-b58f-401aefb4eea0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s5AAscy7qbI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Chile, as in other parts of Latin America, gender-based violence has reached epidemic proportions.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.nomasviolenciacontramujeres.cl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DOSSIER-2019-1.pdf\">The Chilean Network </a><a href=\"http://www.nomasviolenciacontramujeres.cl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DOSSIER-2019-1.pdf\">Against Violence Towards Women </a>calculates that an average of 130,000 cases of domestic violence are reported in Chile each year, making it one of the country\u2019s \u201cmost reported crimes\u201d.

      "bodyText": "More than a million women in Chile are preparing to join a massive protest this Sunday to mark International Women\u2019s Day, in a march expected to reignite the wave of social unrest that began four months ago. Anger over rising metro fares erupted in October into a series of nationwide protests against inequality, social injustice and the high cost of living. Violent clashes between protesters and police have resulted in more than 30 dead, thousands injured and 445 with eye injuries caused by police weapons \u2013 leaving 34 people blinded. After a summer lull, Sunday\u2019s march will be the first mass demonstration since New Year\u2019s Eve. It is expected to be the first of several protests in the run-up to a historic referendum in April, when Chileans will vote on reforming the country\u2019s Pinochet-era constitution. \u201cSocial movements in Chile have always been pushed by women. Decades ago, during the dictatorship, women led the resistance \u2013 from organizing soup kitchens to fighting for human rights,\u201d said Bel\u00e9n Calcagno, who is coordinating a group marching on Sunday in Concepci\u00f3n, a city in southern Chile. \u201cToday our role continues to be central.\u201d The slogan \u201cNunca m\u00e1s sin nosotras\u201d \u2013 Never again without us women \u2013 is often heard at protests, as female activists demand that women\u2019s call for justice and equity should be as important as those for social and economic reforms. Alondra Carrillo, spokesperson for the country\u2019s largest feminist advocacy group, La Coordinadora Feminista 8M, said that as well as sharing the demands of the wider movement, Chile\u2019s women are fighting for specific gender-related issues, such as legal abortion, an end to domestic violence, and for greater equality in the workplace. \u201cWomen are permanently subjected to various forms of patriarchal violence, which is an integral part of the way in which Chile is organized,\u201d she said. That idea is also reflected in the anti-rape song by a Chilean feminist collective, which has become an anthem for protesters around the world. First performed last November, the song A Rapist in Your Path depicts a world in which state oppression mirrors sexual violence, and singles out police, judges and the president as accomplice in the aggression. In Chile, as in other parts of Latin America, gender-based violence has reached epidemic proportions. The Chilean Network Against Violence Towards Women calculates that an average of 130,000 cases of domestic violence are reported in Chile each year, making it one of the country\u2019s \u201cmost reported crimes\u201d. Each day, 42 cases of sexual abuse are reported to the police \u2013 only 25.7% of which result in judicial rulings. Last year, 46 women were murdered by their partners. On Tuesday, during the inauguration of a new law to tackle femicide, Chile\u2019s president, Sebastian Pi\u00f1era, caused outrage by saying: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s not just that men want to commit abuse, but also that women put themselves in a position where they are abused.\u201d Camila Vallejo, the former student protest leader who is now a member of the chamber of deputies, responded in a tweet: \u201cPi\u00f1era continues to justify sexist violence. It is an offense for the families of the victims.\u201d Feminists say that Pi\u00f1era\u2019s rightwing government has done little to address women\u2019s rights issues and has even further limited access for women to abort under the current restricted circumstances. Meanwhile, neighbouring Argentina is set to legalise abortion. \u201cI march because I want to feel safe. I\u2019ve had friends that have been raped, or have had illegal abortions; they were so scared,\u201d said Macarena Cort\u00e9s, who runs a queer bar located next to Plaza Italia in Santiago, which has become a hotspot for feminist gatherings. \u201cWe will all march for our own reasons. I\u2019m a lesbian, so I march for a culture where they don\u2019t kill us for being gay, or punch us for holding hands with someone we love\u201d she said, referring to a spate of attacks on gay women in the past decade. \u201cBut every woman will march for her own reasons, and on 8 March we will unite with a common demand: to be respected.\u201d",

As a shy man, local chapter meetings never appealed to him, but as a truck driver on the road five to six days a week, whether in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, or Charlotte, North Carolina, he connected to a hub of others who shared his unusual theories. It offered a refuge, company. Mufon allowed my dad to feel like he belonged, no matter where he was originally from.</p> <p>Then in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ufo-sightings-mufon-2018-john-ventre-alien-extraterrestrial-905060\">Newsweek</a> reported on a wave of resignations within Mufon after John Ventre \u2013 the state director for the organization\u2019s Pennsylvania chapter, one of the largest in the country \u2013 posted on his personal Facebook that white men in America were being attacked by \u201cillegal affirmative action\u201d and \u201cinterracial couples in every show and commerical\u201d. Despite apologizing the day after his post, Ventre resigned as state director. \u201cI don\u2019t hate anybody, I apologized for what I said\u201d he told Newsweek. \u201cI\u2019m feeling like because I\u2019m a 60-year-old white man I\u2019m getting totally unfairly attacked here.\u201d</p> <p>The fallout continued. Mufon board members and other chapter leaders resigned after learning of Mufon\u2019s ties to JZ Knight, an author and New Age teacher, who, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, has made derogatory comments about Mexicans, LGBTQ people, Catholics, and Jews.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing to me to hear about these people, and the organization should be more careful,\u201d my dad told me. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to move away from a place where I am able to get access to a world that I love.\u201d</p> <p>My father cherished the digital space this organization allotted him, and with my encouragement, was even considering attending local chapter meetings after he retired. But after learning about Ventre and Knight, I was worried. I wondered if Mufon was actually not safe, not a sanctuary, for a black man like him. So, I went to a meeting myself.</p> <p>Windsor Locks, Connecticut is two hours north of New York City and home to just under 13,000 people. The town, according to Mufon, has one of the highest numbers of reported UFO sightings in America. On a Saturday in February, I joined about 70 members \u2013 almost entirely white \u2013 at a pizzeria to discuss sightings that had occurred nearby, and hear a psychic talk about the secret space program called Solar Warden. \u201cSolar Warden is a program based in Dahlgren, Virginia, run by the US navy that is responsible for monitoring all traffic in our solar system,\u201d the psychic told us, as people around the table nodded knowingly. \u201cIt was developed in the 1960s and 70s and deployed by earth governments to protect Earth from hostile aliens.\u201d</p> <p>Once the meeting was over, I wanted to talk to some members, many of whom have been attending for years. There was Pat, a woman in her 60s with bright red hair and married to another member, Mike. I met Mickey, an intense man who ranted about my iPhone giving me cancer and how aliens were, at that very moment, all around us. \u201cTheir technology is so advanced, we wouldn\u2019t even be able to see them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And there was Geoffrey P Whittum, who calls himself \u201cthe Woods Walker\u201d and believes that there is evidence of alien habitation in the forests of Connecticut. Although many were fervent in their attempts to convince me that the government was poisoning Americans through spacecraft \u2013 a common belief shared by all the members I talked with \u2013 not one of them seemed racist. They all seemed to enjoy gathering and creating a space where they could express their obscure thoughts about life beyond our world.</p> <p>After those initial greetings with members, I eventually worked up the nerve to ask everyone I talked with if they were familiar with Ventre and other allegations of racism within Mufon. They all said no. \u201cEveryone is welcome here, no matter what you look like or believe,\u201d Pat said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/area-51-raid-event-what-happened-nevada\">I 'stormed' Area 51 and it was even weirder than I imagined</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I left pleasantly surprised by the camaraderie I found.

Vietnam showed real flashes of promise, and some tidy skills and footwork at time. Unfortunately though, there was very much an underdog\u2019s attitude on show, they started with a defensive mindset and invited pressure upon themselves. Still, Australia have struggled at times to break down set defences, so did well to fashion shooting opportunities early on, especially combining well down the flanks with Carpenter and Catley getting forward on the overlap. A relief for the skipper Kerr to pick up a brace - she\u2019s had a lean trot recently and celebrated wholeheartedly after thumping home her second from the spot. Van Egmond and Simon were lively around the box, and Foord her usual industrious self. Hardly a bad performance in yellow (sorry, gold) as Australia booked themselves a handy five-goal advantage ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s return fixture in Vietnam.</p> <p>Thanks for your company - we\u2019ll see you again in five days time!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6217998f085f0b8d943405\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-06T09:29:27.221Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Australia 5-0 Vietnam</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And there\u2019s the final whistle! It\u2019s the result home fans were hoping for, and in fairness, the performance that accompanied it from the Matildas was pretty good too. They\u2019re in the boxseat heading into the return leg in five days time. The clean sheet was important in a two-legged contest. Perhaps a chance to manage the workload of some players for the second clash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be0c9b42765e79ab1940858a50bead4a54afe6a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be0c9b42765e79ab1940858a50bead4a54afe6a6/0_204_3534_2120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Polkinghorne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is there anything better than a defender\u2019s goal celebration?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Feder/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-06T09:31:21.501Z\">at 9.31am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6217548f085f0b8d943403\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-06T09:27:50.086Z\">9.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 + 5 min: </strong>Crossbar!

      "bodyText": "So - job done from a Matildas perspective. Vietnam showed real flashes of promise, and some tidy skills and footwork at time. Unfortunately though, there was very much an underdog\u2019s attitude on show, they started with a defensive mindset and invited pressure upon themselves. Still, Australia have struggled at times to break down set defences, so did well to fashion shooting opportunities early on, especially combining well down the flanks with Carpenter and Catley getting forward on the overlap. A relief for the skipper Kerr to pick up a brace - she\u2019s had a lean trot recently and celebrated wholeheartedly after thumping home her second from the spot. Van Egmond and Simon were lively around the box, and Foord her usual industrious self. Hardly a bad performance in yellow (sorry, gold) as Australia booked themselves a handy five-goal advantage ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s return fixture in Vietnam. Thanks for your company - we\u2019ll see you again in five days time! And there\u2019s the final whistle! It\u2019s the result home fans were hoping for, and in fairness, the performance that accompanied it from the Matildas was pretty good too. They\u2019re in the boxseat heading into the return leg in five days time. The clean sheet was important in a two-legged contest. Perhaps a chance to manage the workload of some players for the second clash. 90 + 5 min: Crossbar! And that\u2019s the shot of the night from the youngster, from Vietnam who beats Williams all ends up with a fine effort, but it cannons back. What a shame - they deserved something from this game, Vietnam. But that\u2019s how close the margins are in international football. 90 + 3 min: Raso with a fine ball to release Gielnik, but she\u2019s called offside and denied the shooting opportunity. Could she have done better there, the Matildas winger? It\u2019s an area of the game Australia could definitely improve on, especially against higher-rated opponents should they qualify for the Olympics. 90 min: Five minutes added on is the verdict, and we have an immediate pause in proceedings as Raso stays down after a nasty head-on-ground potential concussion. It was a lunging tackle that brought her down, but she\u2019s eventually up and about again. 87 min: Post! It\u2019s a terrific run from midfield from Raso, who uses her pace to set up the move, releasing Foord one-on-one with the \u2018keeper. She jinks round the Vietnamese custodian, but with the goal begging she dinks it into the upright! That\u2019s the miss of the evening. Following a suspect penalty and a potential red card though, you\u2019d have to say a touch of fortune Vietnam were sorely due. 84 min: And it is the new arrival Gielnik with a shooting opportunity, but she blasts her effort over the bar! A bad miss for the Bayern Munich player, she could be in danger of missing the Olympics squad, should Australia qualify. A break in play, as Vietnam\u2019s skipper again remonstrates with the referee. Logarzo has caught her opponent flush in the face with the elbow - and you have to say, should that have been a red card? 82 min: And that\u2019s Kerr\u2019s final contribution, as she makes way to the bench, and Emily Gielnik comes on in her place. You\u2019d have to imagine this is a straight audition between Gielnik and Raso for the wide position. There are of course limited spots in the squad for the Olympics - only 16 outfield players, which makes versatility an added plus. 80 min: It\u2019s the skipper who steps up to take it, and she blasts hard, down the guts. It clips the underside of the bar, but there\u2019s no chance for the \u2018keeper - that was moving. She celebrates - a relief for a player who has missed a couple from the spot in recent years. 79 min: Oh my. Raso\u2019s gone to ground in the box and the referee\u2019s called a penalty! \u201cShe\u2019s added a little bit of GST to that\u201d was the call from the commentary box, but in plain English - that\u2019s a dive, and she\u2019s got away with it, the winger. The Vietnamese defence are livid - they remonstrate with the referee. 77 min: 14,014 is the official crowd - a terrific turn out given the violent storms earlier in the day. They love their football in Northern New South Wales and some have no doubt driven from inland for this fixture. Shoutout to my first football club \u201cMoree Hot Bread Shop\u201d. 75 min: Vietnam with a very fast release after Kellond-Knight fouls Huynh Nhu, but Williams comes a long, long way to sweep! Good instincts from the \u2018keeper, but she did find herself about 30m outside her box. She spares her backline\u2019s blushes, as once again, Australia are turned around. 72 min: Vietnam with a rare foray forward, and they fashion an effort in the end, but it\u2019s a weak one as two or three in yellow surround the shooter. Williams, happy to watch it wide. Still, a promising build up. 69 min: Raso earns the freekick not far outside the box. A second substitute for Australia, as Elise Kellond-Knight comes on to replace Tameka Yallop. And the ball in is cleared by Vietnam, who pack the numbers and spring forward in transition once again. 66 min: Kerr with a sharp burst and she uses her body well to roll a ball centrally, but no teammate can get on the back of it. Australia with another chance from the corner, and it\u2019s a rehearsed routine that finishes with van Egmond picking out the veteran centre back - and it\u2019s a fine finish! Delight for the former skipper, her teammates rush to congratulate her. 63 min: Raso looks to break clear down the left, but it runs too long for the flying winger. A poor decision from Kerr centrally and she hangs her head for a long time. She\u2019s not had the best of starts to her time in the UK, the player voted the best in the world by The Guardian. Is she a little run down, either physically or mentally? It\u2019s a demanding schedule she observes these days. 60 min: You have to say, the referee is letting a lot go tonight - from a Vietnamese perspective there have been a lot of physical challenges that have gone unpunished from Australia. Foord looks for Kerr, but the final ball is over-floated. She\u2019s had little more than crumbs to feed on tonight, the Matildas\u2019 taliswoman. Something for Milicic to work on ahead of the return leg. 58 min: Foord with a terrific effort at goal - she jinks inside a couple and fires from outside the box, but it skips past the far post. Both sides go to the bench - Australia bring on Hayley Raso in place of Kyah Simon, while Vietnam go to their star striker Huynh Nhu, who is just coming back from injury. 56 min: Foord with a flick down the line for Simon, but Vietnam to their credit, are sticking very well to the task - hurrying and harrying, breaking up the play where they can. They just need to show a little more in possession and they could yet hope for something from this game. 53 min: Carpenter goes in the book - she was lucky to escape in the first half for a tackle that denied a good opportunity, but she goes in for shooting long after the whistle had blown. A little petulant from the youngster, but she accepts the decision from the referee. 50 min: A good passage of passing from the Matildas as Simon and van Egmond probe around the edge of the box. It\u2019s a late run from van Egmond who\u2019s denied by a fine save with the feet from the Vietnamese \u2018keeper, but it would have been hard on the visitors, replays suggest the ball had gone into touch earlier in the move. 47 min: Catley cuts in from the left, jinks past her marker and fires an effort goalwards with her right foot, but it doesn\u2019t quite curl back and flashes harmlessly wide. A nice sign of intent, though. Second half! 45 min: And we\u2019re back! Can Vietnam pinch an away goal to make it tasty; or will the Matildas keep the foot on the throat? We\u2019ll know shortly. Now, some WoSo action from elsewhere, where there was a World Cup semi-final rematch between the US and England at the SheBelieves Cup. The evergreen Carly Lloyd rearing her head once again there - Team USA with the chocolates: Australia had 70% possession that half, fashioned seven shots on target (to Vietnam\u2019s zero), and fired over 30 balls into the box - eight of these delivered by Carpenter. Still, Vietnam had at least two good chances - one from a set piece, and one with a ball over the top exposing the Matildas\u2019 backline for pace - if anything Pham Thi Tuoi could have had an equaliser if she\u2019d connected with Nguyen Thi Bich Thuy\u2019s cross. Murray Henman has written in: That third goal looked a tad offside to me. Am I wrong? Hmm. I\u2019d have to take another look. There have been some marginal calls so far, but at first glance I didn\u2019t see too much amiss. The third goal for mine is crucial though - going into the break 2-0 Vietnam might still have the spirit to keep this contest tight and then hope for home conditions to make things a little nervy in the return leg. But with an early goal after the break, 4-0 would definitely hammer a significant nail into their Olympics hopes. Players like Simon are looking hungry out there - don\u2019t expect anyone in yellow (sorry, gold) to let up from here. So - your assessment of that opening 45? Are Australia good value for their lead? It\u2019s a curious one for mine; Vietnam have shown flashes of real quality, and it begs the question if they had been a little braver could they have faced this test a little better? They started deep and instantly invited pressure from the Matildas. Still, the delivery from wide areas has been quality, with Carpenter and Logarzo combining well down the right. The Matildas concede a set piece to the left of their box, but it\u2019s easily claimed by Williams. And there\u2019s the whistle - and the home side jog off to a chorus of cheers. It\u2019s all going well for Australia, you\u2019d have to say. 45 min: We have three minutes added on - but there\u2019s another break in play as the skipper Tran Thi Hong Nhung receives some treatment. She got absolutely poleaxed by Foord then - a real ball-and-all challenge. She might have to watch herself, the new Arsenal striker. 43 min: Some ugly stuff going around at the moment - Kennedy comes to grips with an opposite number before Tran Thi Phuong Thao catches Kerr in the back with a knee. Foord clatters into her opposite number - it\u2019s not spiteful, but it\u2019s definitely physical out there. 41 min: A tricky patch here for Vietnam - they can\u2019t afford to go further behind ahead of the break. They need their more experienced heads to try and calm things down - it\u2019s been all a little too frenetic; Australia want to play fast, but Vietnam need to put the foot on the ball and stay as calm as they can. 38 min: It\u2019s fine work from Kerr and Catley who combine down the left - the skipper with the backheel. She picks out the range van Egmond who makes a clever near-post run, and her headed effort trickles in! Not sure if a defender or the goalkeeper got the last touch there, but either way - it\u2019s a third for the Matildas. 36 min: A brilliantly worked move as Yallop finds Catley at the far post. It\u2019s flicked on by Foord before Catley puts across the face for Logarzo once again - it was easier than the chance she already scored, but she shanks it badly wide! A real scramble in the goalmouth as the sweeper saves off the line behind her keeper before van Egmond blasts over. 34 min: It\u2019s a shot direct at goal from Nguyen Thi Bich Thuy - but it flashes just over Williams\u2019 crossbar! Not a bad effort, that. A few flutters among the home fans. 32 min: Vietnam with a ball into the area, but there\u2019s too much on it, and Lydia Williams watches it roll harmlessly past her posts. A dangerous moment as Carpenter takes down Vietnam\u2019s left winger. What can they make of this - a set piece just on the edge of the box. 29 min: Carpenter marauds through midfield before Simon picks up the loose ball, evades one or two tackles and earns Australia a corner. It\u2019s a set piece that finds Kerr along the ground and she thumps a fine first-time shot, but it\u2019s cleared by a body near the line. It\u2019s not letting up for the visitors! 27 min: It\u2019s another cross from wide, this time down the left from the vice-captain Catley - she finds van Egmond centrally whose header goes straight up in the air. Chloe Logarzo reacts fastest from midfield and she strokes home for her first goal since the World Cup. Australia doing it nicely! 24 min: Vietnam look to be targetting the space vacated by Carpenter when they get the ball - they\u2019ve obviously identified the right back\u2019s tendency to maraud forward; it\u2019s something to watch - Polkinghorne is the less mobile of the two centre backs, and she\u2019ll need to be on her toes against a mobile and pacey Vietnamese front line. 20 min: A ball in from van Egmond and Kerr wins the flick, but it doesn\u2019t find Simon behind her. The flag is raised again for offside, but replays suggest she perhaps wasn\u2019t. A short break in play as Vietnam \u2018keeper receives a bit of attention for a suspected elbow injury. 18 min: Carpenter steps in to win it well in the heart of midfield, but it\u2019s a poor turnover from van Egmond. Vietnam break quickly and it\u2019s a ball over the top that almost embarrasses the Matildas - only a last-ditch lunge from Kennedy prevents a shooting chance for the visitors! A real scare for the Matildas. 15 min: Van Egmond looks to release Kerr over the top - there\u2019s that offside trap concern when you player a sweeper - but it\u2019s marginally against the Australian striker. She would have been through one-on-one for a second in no time, but for the linesperson\u2019s flag. 13 min: The thinking from Vietnam would have been that the longer they stay at parity, the more frustrated Australia would become. So - what can they do now? Australia have enjoyed more than 80% possession - they\u2019ve made almost 100 completed passes already to Vietnam\u2019s 12. An early headache for their coach Mai Duc Chung, who incidentally is the national team coach of Vietnam\u2019s men\u2019s side as well. 10 min: Carpenter gets things going with an overlapping run - her cross is defended, but Australia recycle and her second ball in is whipped with venom, and who else - captain Kerr - throws the noggin at it and heads home well from around five metres out! 6 min: A good tackle prevents Simon from starting a promising move, before Foord swings in a cross for Logarzo, but it\u2019s a touch high and her headed effort floats harmlessly wide. The early pattern is set, as expected: this will be attack v defence. 4 min: It does look, as suspected that Vietnam are lining up with a back five - unusually though in the modern game one of them appears to be a sweeper. Will that present opportunities for the Matildas to spring the offside trap? It\u2019s Australia with the early possession, Vietnam looking to break with pace - if they can isolate Polkinghorne one-on-one it could be an interesting test. 1 min: Australia in their predominantly yellow strip, yellow shorts and yellow socks get us underway, Vietnam are in all red, so no kit clash concerns. An early foul as Yallop is brought down - a big test for the veteran as the \u201csitter\u201d in midfield. Graham Carnaffan has written in and solved my \u201cThi\u201d conundrum: The name Thi signifies a woman. Considering drinking coffee in Vietnam is the preserve of males then this is quite apt. There you go! How good is learning new things? Cheers, Graham. Our players are in the tunnel, which means we\u2019re not a million miles away from kick-off. It\u2019s a focused Sam Kerr with the armband as usual, about to lead out her chargers. Gee, hasn\u2019t she been racking up the airmiles lately, flitting between Australia and the UK, as many of this Matildas lineup are now doing, having signed in the Women\u2019s Super League. There\u2019s a bit of a threat of rain around, but hopefully that holds off. The pitch is otherwise in it\u2019s usual immaculate condition. A first question from me - and apologies in advance for my ignorance. The name \u201cThi\u201d features prominently in a lot of the Vietnamese players names - a standard honorific, common middle name - can anyone shed any light on that? Our action comes from the Hunter tonight, where already there\u2019s a decent crowd trickling in. They\u2019ve hosted a few Matildas games in recent times - and got 16,827 out to a match against Brazil in 2017. Let\u2019s hope the Newcastle faithful come out in similar numbers again tonight. So - without further ado, to team news where it\u2019s a largely as-expected XI for Australia: The biggest change is Tameka Yallop coming in at the base of midfield ahead of Elise Kellond-Knight or Aivi Luik, while Clare Polkinghorne retains her spot in the heart of defence ahead of challenger Jenna McCormick, and Kyah Simon beats out Emily Gielnik and Hayley Raso to start from the beginning. For Vietnam it\u2019s listed as a nominal 4-5-1, we\u2019ll see if that\u2019s how they actually line up: Tran Thi Kim Thanh (gk); Tran Thi Hong Nhung, Luong Thi Thu Thuong, Pham Thi Tuoi, Nguyen Thi Bich Thuy; Nguyen Thi Tuyet Dung, Thai Thi Thao, Ngan Thi Van Su, Duong Thi Van, Tran Thi Phuong Thao; Pham Hai Yen. Hi all! A fond greeting to you all, from wherever around the globe you\u2019re following this one. We\u2019d love to hear from you during tonight\u2019s coverage - firstly, your thoughts, predictions, concerns; but also if you\u2019re somewhere a little interesting. What\u2019s the internet reception like on The Orkneys? In Tierra del Fuego? Fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation.

But as we know, football changes very quickly - and with wins against Indonesia and Thailand recently, Vietnam are a team on the rise, knocking on the world\u2019s top 30. It could be a case of attack vs defence, at least that\u2019s what coach Ante Milicic is expecting pre-game: \u201cEvery opponent is different, and we know this will be a difficult game for us and one where we need to remain patient at all times, but we\u2019re the type of team that likes to focus on ourselves.\u201d Vietnam have flirted with a back-five at times, so the strategy could be stay resolute for this first leg, and then look to hit Australia in trickier conditions in C\u1ea9m Ph\u1ea3 in five days time.",

Think gastropub, but in a wine bar. It\u2019s a gastrobar! The website shows him chipping about on his moped, stubble-strewn and crumpled-looking, like an unrested Peter Hook. This is not a man pinned down by formality. Just eat your crisp veal brain with jerusalem artichoke and hang loose. Or your cream of cod liver with sea vegetables. Or kale gnocchi with smoked oyster.

      "bodyText": "\u201cOh, you British, always crying about Europe. It\u2019s time to grow up,\u201d my Greek friend said as we dined on Sophialaan, Amsterdam. The woman has no truck with my moist-eyed lament for the beloved bloc and the financial joys of the Eurozone. Fittingly, we\u2019re eating in Ron Gastrobar, where the owner also turned his back on an important institution. Ron Blaauw closed his fancy, two-Michelin-starred, eponymously titled restaurant in 2013, then reinvented it as a more relaxed and groovy affair. Ron is all about fun these days. Think gastropub, but in a wine bar. It\u2019s a gastrobar! The website shows him chipping about on his moped, stubble-strewn and crumpled-looking, like an unrested Peter Hook. This is not a man pinned down by formality. Just eat your crisp veal brain with jerusalem artichoke and hang loose. Or your cream of cod liver with sea vegetables. Or kale gnocchi with smoked oyster. Yes, I know none of these sounds remotely chilled out. Sadly for Blaauw \u2013 or happily; I\u2019m not really sure which at this stage \u2013 Michelin gave his new, cosier place a star, so even on a wet Wednesday night in February, the place is so noisy, I can barely hear myself mewling about the patchy quality of the UK\u2019s Eurovision entry. \u201cPah! No one ever votes for you at Eurovision anyway,\u201d the Greek laughs while fishing very good chilli-infused cornichons out of a jar and slathering warm bread with whipped butter. I am finding all this unfettered truth less than gentle on the stomach. An irrefutable truth: Amsterdam is lots of fun to eat around right now. Over the past year, I\u2019ve been to Mr Porter, part chic cocktail lounge, part rustic steakhouse, and I\u2019ve returned a few times to The Duchess, a giddily elegant dining hall within the former KAS Bank, which I recommend highly. The bento boxes at Momo are fantastic. I\u2019ve even fallen a little in love with Albert Heijn supermarkets (a sort of hybrid of Planet Organic and your local Spar) and their bars of Tony\u2019s Chocolonely chocolate and bizarrely realistic vegan fish sandwiches. Even the Eurostar that goes direct from St Pancras to Centraal station has a menu by Raymond Blanc. Whether I\u2019d return to Ron Gastrobar, however, is debatable. We ride roughshod through the small plates menu, eating one of those dinners where the next morning my most resounding memory is of foams, broths, quenelles and perilously small portions. All romantically lit and with bright, pleasant service, true, but we leave hungry. A minuscule cubic stack of duck liver and smoked eel is certainly earthy, as well as pretty to look at, but really not for sharing, as our servers insist.

      "bodyText": "JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is recovering from emergency heart surgery, with his two deputies taking over his duties as he recuperates, the US bank has announced. The lender publicly released an internal memo confirming that the 63-year-old executive, who has led the US\u2019s biggest bank by assets for more than a decade, had experienced a tear in his heart\u2019s main artery, which was caught early and treated successfully. The bank\u2019s co-presidents and co-chief operating officers, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, are running JP Morgan while Dimon recovers. \u201cHe is awake, alert and recovering well,\u201d Pinto and Smith said in the memo. Dimon led JP Morgan through the financial crisis in 2008 and became a key figure on Wall Street, where he is known for being an outspoken, larger-than-life character. He previously underwent treatment for throat cancer after being diagnosed in 2014, and made a full recovery. Dimon has been JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive since the end of 2005, following the 2004 merger between Bank One, which he led, and JP Morgan Chase. In 2018, Dimon said he intended to continue in the top job for five more years. JP Morgan created the co-president and co-chief operating officer roles, appointing Pinto and Smith, to support Dimon. As the US government bailed out banks during the financial crisis of 2008, Dimon played a pivotal role. Over one weekend he rescued the rival Wall Street firm Bear Stearns, buying it for only $2 per share. Since the crisis, the bank has grown into a global banking giant. JP Morgan\u2019s share price has almost trebled during Dimon\u2019s tenure, giving it a current market value of $350bn. The bank, like many of its peers, has restricted staff travel and divided its workforce to reduce contact between teams, in a response to the spread of the coronavirus.",

      "body": "<p><em>The Wandering</em> is the Indonesian writer Intan Paramaditha\u2019s first novel (her first story collection to appear in English, <em>Apple &amp; Knife</em>, came out in 2018). And what a debut it is: an ingenious choose-your-own-adventure challenge, it is at least five books in one, a series of forking paths as imagined by Leibniz, Borges or Deleuze.</p> <p>It opens with a Faustian bargain. After steamily copulating with Mephistopheles, the narrator receives a magic pair of sparkly red high heels that will take her anywhere she likes, with a note: \u201cTheir owner was a witch, but she is long dead.\u201d She wakes to find herself in New York City, about to board a plane to Berlin or Amsterdam or Zagreb. But which? That is up to you, reader. You will be addressed in the second person, in keeping with the conventions of the choose-your-adventure form, blending you with the narrator, and conferring upon you a god-like omnipotence. (To an extent, that is: Paramaditha hasn\u2019t written a path for you to chuck it all in and play pinochle in a retirement community in the south of France.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/05/intan-paramaditha-the-gathering-novel\">Intan Paramaditha's Choose Your Own Adventure \u2013 with a literary twist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reading this kind of novel in adulthood is a very different experience from what it was in childhood. Questions such as: \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d, \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d, \u201cWhich choice will make my life worthwhile?\u201d feel existential and urgent, but are also tied to our particular privileges and social mobility. It\u2019s a clever device for exploring globalisation at a time when borders are closing to the poor and to refugees, while the rich are able to purchase passports allowing them to live (or store their money) wherever they please. Who can travel, and on what conditions, is one of the primary human rights questions of our era, and <em>The Wandering</em> skilfully takes it on.</p> <p>In my first run-through, the narrative dead-ended with a pretty bourgeois, heteronormative outcome, which I guess says something about what I want from a story. (Domesticity may be the opposite of wandering, but it\u2019s not anathema to narrative.) I retraced my steps. The next few versions got ever more surreal, as I cycled through paths that routed through Queens, Tijuana, and a train to nowhere driven by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/jun/12/gertrude-stein\" title=\"\">Gertrude Stein</a>. As the endings piled up, they began to resemble a series of reflections on home, and the impossibility of return. \u201cGoing home,\u201d we are told, \u201cdemands disavowal.\u201d At one point, I was convinced that the prologue was a death scene and the ensuing paths a journey through the bardo. \u201cA haunted spirit roams from place to place,\u201d Paramaditha writes, \u201caccepted neither in heaven nor on earth, neither here nor there. Where is your home now? Maybe, like a ghost, you can only find shelter.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You find yourself wanting more of whatever it is these other stories have to tell you, so you flip back to where you began, and start again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paramaditha\u2019s references cleverly blend mythology, fairytales, Indonesian legends and popular culture: Hecate meets the Whore of Babylon in a window of the red-light district in Amsterdam, or tempts a Palestinian refugee to his death in 1970s Berlin. The Indonesian story of Malin Kundang, a sailor who was turned to stone when he refused to recognise his mother upon returning home, is juxtaposed with <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> for what it has to tell us about travellers and their relationship to home. The use of myth will no doubt inspire comparisons to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/01/angela-carter-far-from-fairytale-edmund-gordon\" title=\"\">Angela Carter</a>: both writers playfully subvert the patriarchal values embedded in our culture\u2019s darkest tales. But where Carter is a baroque, lyrical stylist, Paramaditha is chatty, frank and polemical. Her considerable storytelling skills, however, are not well served by this translation, which is pedestrian, plodding and wordy.</p> <p>The juxtaposed storylines are like people on aeroplanes you can choose to engage with, or not: whichever, you can\u2019t help overhearing parts of their story as you leaf through. In time, your curiosity is excited. You find yourself wanting more of whatever it is these other stories have to tell you, so you flip back to where you began, and start again.</p> <p>It seems that we are meant to read all the different permutations of the novel: alternative paths reveal other aspects of the narrator\u2019s past, and there are a few repetitions, but not many. Certain endings feel insufficient, so you dive back in for more. This raises formal questions about storytelling; narrative itself becomes a kind of wandering in search of its own sense of completeness. Plot begins to feel as if it is the least important aspect of the experience. The meat of the book lies in the questions that take shape \u2013 about travel, and identity, and about what makes a fulfilled life. We fool ourselves into thinking that what matters is what happens, but really, life is what happens in between.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Wandering, translated by Stephen J Epstein, is published by Harvill Secker (RRP \u00a316.99). <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-wandering-9781787301177.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.</a> Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.</em></p> <p>Chatty, frank and polemical Intan Paramaditha</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Wandering is the Indonesian writer Intan Paramaditha\u2019s first novel (her first story collection to appear in English, Apple &amp; Knife, came out in 2018). And what a debut it is: an ingenious choose-your-own-adventure challenge, it is at least five books in one, a series of forking paths as imagined by Leibniz, Borges or Deleuze. It opens with a Faustian bargain. After steamily copulating with Mephistopheles, the narrator receives a magic pair of sparkly red high heels that will take her anywhere she likes, with a note: \u201cTheir owner was a witch, but she is long dead.\u201d She wakes to find herself in New York City, about to board a plane to Berlin or Amsterdam or Zagreb. But which? That is up to you, reader. You will be addressed in the second person, in keeping with the conventions of the choose-your-adventure form, blending you with the narrator, and conferring upon you a god-like omnipotence. (To an extent, that is: Paramaditha hasn\u2019t written a path for you to chuck it all in and play pinochle in a retirement community in the south of France.) Reading this kind of novel in adulthood is a very different experience from what it was in childhood. Questions such as: \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d, \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d, \u201cWhich choice will make my life worthwhile?\u201d feel existential and urgent, but are also tied to our particular privileges and social mobility. It\u2019s a clever device for exploring globalisation at a time when borders are closing to the poor and to refugees, while the rich are able to purchase passports allowing them to live (or store their money) wherever they please. Who can travel, and on what conditions, is one of the primary human rights questions of our era, and The Wandering skilfully takes it on. In my first run-through, the narrative dead-ended with a pretty bourgeois, heteronormative outcome, which I guess says something about what I want from a story. (Domesticity may be the opposite of wandering, but it\u2019s not anathema to narrative.) I retraced my steps. The next few versions got ever more surreal, as I cycled through paths that routed through Queens, Tijuana, and a train to nowhere driven by Gertrude Stein. As the endings piled up, they began to resemble a series of reflections on home, and the impossibility of return. \u201cGoing home,\u201d we are told, \u201cdemands disavowal.\u201d At one point, I was convinced that the prologue was a death scene and the ensuing paths a journey through the bardo. \u201cA haunted spirit roams from place to place,\u201d Paramaditha writes, \u201caccepted neither in heaven nor on earth, neither here nor there. Where is your home now? Maybe, like a ghost, you can only find shelter.\u201d Paramaditha\u2019s references cleverly blend mythology, fairytales, Indonesian legends and popular culture: Hecate meets the Whore of Babylon in a window of the red-light district in Amsterdam, or tempts a Palestinian refugee to his death in 1970s Berlin. The Indonesian story of Malin Kundang, a sailor who was turned to stone when he refused to recognise his mother upon returning home, is juxtaposed with The Wizard of Oz for what it has to tell us about travellers and their relationship to home. The use of myth will no doubt inspire comparisons to Angela Carter: both writers playfully subvert the patriarchal values embedded in our culture\u2019s darkest tales. But where Carter is a baroque, lyrical stylist, Paramaditha is chatty, frank and polemical. Her considerable storytelling skills, however, are not well served by this translation, which is pedestrian, plodding and wordy. The juxtaposed storylines are like people on aeroplanes you can choose to engage with, or not: whichever, you can\u2019t help overhearing parts of their story as you leaf through. In time, your curiosity is excited. You find yourself wanting more of whatever it is these other stories have to tell you, so you flip back to where you began, and start again. It seems that we are meant to read all the different permutations of the novel: alternative paths reveal other aspects of the narrator\u2019s past, and there are a few repetitions, but not many. Certain endings feel insufficient, so you dive back in for more. This raises formal questions about storytelling; narrative itself becomes a kind of wandering in search of its own sense of completeness. Plot begins to feel as if it is the least important aspect of the experience. The meat of the book lies in the questions that take shape \u2013 about travel, and identity, and about what makes a fulfilled life. We fool ourselves into thinking that what matters is what happens, but really, life is what happens in between. \u2022 The Wandering, translated by Stephen J Epstein, is published by Harvill Secker (RRP \u00a316.99).

Sam (Dylan O\u2019Brien, who also stars in <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/shows/teen-wolf\">MTV\u2019s series Teen Wolf</a>, in case you want to experience your own little time vortex) is a lad about town currently helping his more responsible, settled brother Jake in his house restoration business.

Which seems to me to misunderstand the nature of the beast and the audience at which it\u2019s aimed, which is surely not world-weary adult or even young adult viewers, but \u2013 just like the original \u2013 children. At teatime, ideally, if teatimes are still a thing. To them, basement portals, the bemusement of people landing in the wrong era, beloveds parted across the decades and all the hoary rest of it will be as fresh and exhilarating as it was the first time you came across it, in a Bunty comic strip, or classic time-slip children\u2019s novel (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/28/lucy-mangan-building-childrens-library\">Marianne Dreams? Charlotte Sometimes? Tom\u2019s Midnight Garden?</a>), or one of the Back to the Futures. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s full of iPhones or devoid of feminist liberation depending on the direction of travel.

      "bodyText": "Do you remember the first iteration of Steven Spielberg\u2019s Amazing Stories in the mid-80s? An anthology series back in the days when we just called it \u201cTV\u201d. Some episodes were better than others, but they were all solid, satisfying, fully braced tales that left you with a deep sense of contentment. Restorative to the spirit in both form and content \u2013 tales of derring-do, noble sacrifice and uppances come abounded \u2013 they left you ready for your tea, bed and to face another day of leg warmers, neon eyeshadow and Thatcherism. I am delighted to report that the new incarnation, brought to you by young upstart Apple TV+, has \u2013 going by the one episode that the streaming service has released for review \u2013 deviated from this flawless formula not a jot. The first tale is an Outlander-esque time-travelling love story that\u2019s as compact and well made as you could hope. Sam (Dylan O\u2019Brien, who also stars in MTV\u2019s series Teen Wolf, in case you want to experience your own little time vortex) is a lad about town currently helping his more responsible, settled brother Jake in his house restoration business. As they work on their latest wreck, a fierce storm known as a derecho hits and Sam is transported back to the house\u2019s earliest days. There he meets and falls in love with Evelyn (Victoria Pedretti), the impoverished daughter of the family who built and live in the house, and who is about to be forced into a loveless marriage to save the family fortunes. From there, things unfold pretty much as you might expect. In its native US, the show has received much criticism for its lack of flair, innovation and complexity of character. Which seems to me to misunderstand the nature of the beast and the audience at which it\u2019s aimed, which is surely not world-weary adult or even young adult viewers, but \u2013 just like the original \u2013 children. At teatime, ideally, if teatimes are still a thing. To them, basement portals, the bemusement of people landing in the wrong era, beloveds parted across the decades and all the hoary rest of it will be as fresh and exhilarating as it was the first time you came across it, in a Bunty comic strip, or classic time-slip children\u2019s novel (Marianne Dreams? Charlotte Sometimes? Tom\u2019s Midnight Garden?), or one of the Back to the Futures. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s full of iPhones or devoid of feminist liberation depending on the direction of travel. And if you can let yourself watch as a child again, the hour can become charming once more, even for those old enough to remember when the future Marty was going back to (\u201cIt\u2019s your kids, Mary!\u201d) was still to come. It\u2019s an unfashionable approach, of course, and maybe it does sit a little oddly with Apple\u2019s image and positioning as a new and thrusting arrival on the streaming scene. But you don\u2019t recruit Spielberg if you aren\u2019t looking for a product with heart \u2013 one that has optimism instead of cynicism at its core, that seeks to entertain rather than emptily impress or dazzle. It may be a measure of Apple TV+\u2019s confidence in itself that it is prepared to look at a property and say: \u201cYou know what? If it ain\u2019t broke, let\u2019s not try to fix it.\u201d And Spielberg\u2019s never broken.",

Tom Holland and Chris Pratt voice two elf brothers who set off to magic up the top half of their dead dad (don\u2019t ask). After a run of Pixar sequels, it is a breath of fresh air to see some distinctive originals.</p> <h2>Portrait of a Lady on Fire (15)</h2> <p><em>(C\u00e9line Sciamma, 2019, France) 122 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-fQPTwma9o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R-fQPTwma9o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s period romance has been celebrated as a key moment for the acknowledgement of the lesbian gaze, as well as the focus of anti-Roman Polanski protest at the recent C\u00e9sar awards. Real-world significance aside, it is simply a tremendous watch, telling of confined female lives in the 18th century and of attempts to break out.</p> <h2>True History of the Kelly Gang (18)</h2> <p><em>(Justin Kurzel, 2020, UK/Fra/Australia) 125 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGlll-I_n8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KtGlll-I_n8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>George MacKay\u2019s ascension to the firmament has been remarkable, from the fresh-faced ex-squaddie in Sunshine on Leith to 19th-century Australian outlaw Ned Kelly. Ballasted by Peter Carey\u2019s novel, this version of the story has MacKay playing Kelly as an intense-but-vulnerable figure, leading a gang of misfits in a battle with authorities.</p> <h2>Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am (12A)</h2> <p><em>(Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, 2019, US) 120 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8sUwXTWb4M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A8sUwXTWb4M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Morrison, who died in 2019, got the chance to speak at length in this documentary. This is very much an admiring portrait/summary of the Nobel prize winner\u2019s life and work: from her childhood in Ohio, through her early publications, to her latter-day status as a literary great and African-American icon. As the title indicates, Greenfield-Sanders\u2019s approach is tapestry style. Major names such as Oprah and Angela Davis show up to shower praise.</p> <h2>Blumhouse\u2019s Fantasy Island (15)</h2> <p><em>(Jeff Wadlow, 2020, US) 109 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6O30nJ02PU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a6O30nJ02PU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Horror outfit Blumhouse has reinvigorated the Universal Monsterverse with The Invisible Man, so perhaps it is entitled to a promotional namecheck in this film\u2019s title.

On 2018\u2019s Rude she underpinned the rib-rattling beat with Psycho-esque strings, while ear-piercing screams were woven throughout last year\u2019s luxuriant boast track Uckers. Prepare to be a sweaty mess by the end of the evening. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/0800shygirl/events/?ref=page_internal\">Space 289, E2,</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/0800shygirl/events/?ref=page_internal\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/0800shygirl/events/?ref=page_internal\">Thursday 12 March</a></em></p> <h2>Tove Lo</h2> <p>Despite sustaining a fractured ankle midway through a recent New York show (she didn\u2019t realise it had happened until afterwards), the Swedish pop rebel Tove Lo arrives in the UK in support of last year\u2019s fourth album, Sunshine Kitty. Her Instagram suggests her post-injury staging now includes a bejewelled boot and comfy throne. <em><br><a href=\"https://tove-lo.com/tour\">Glasgow, Monday 9; Manchester, Tuesday 10; London, Thursday 12 March</a></em></p> <h2>C2C: Country to Country</h2> <p>Featuring a revolving lineup across three cities, the double-denim carnival, AKA the C2C festival, returns for its eighth year. The achy-breaky headliners this year include dustbowl heartthrob Eric Church, occasional Hootie and the Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker (pictured, above) and trucker-cap enthusiast Luke Combs. Support comes from the likes of Tanya Tucker and the \u201cnew Dixie Chicks\u201d, Runaway June. <br><em><a href=\"https://c2c-countrytocountry.com/\">London, Dublin &amp; Glasgow, Friday 13 to 15 March</a></em></p> <h2>Halsey</h2> <p>Halsey , said her recent album Manic was an exploration of \u201cfemale rage\u201d, and included nods to some of her forebears (Pink, Alanis) who had been too often dismissed as \u201cangsty\u201d. A shame then that the sweaty, Tatu-sampling headbanger Nightmare didn\u2019t make the final cut, an error of judgment that will hopefully be rectified on this brief arena jaunt. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.iamhalsey.com/#tour\">Glasgow, Saturday 7; London, Sunday 8; Dublin, Tuesday 10; Manchester, Thursday 12 March</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Vula Viel</h2> <p>Jazzwise magazine described the percussion-led trio as \u201clike Portico Quartet on steroids\u201d, a fair call for this hypnotic mix of Bex Burch and her woodily melodic, Ghana-rooted xylophone sound, Ruth Goller\u2019s thunderously punky bass, and Jim Hart\u2019s polyrhythmic drumming. The minimalist US trombonist-singer Peter Zummo uncorks his inimitable music on the London bill. <br><em><a href=\"https://vulaviel.com/gigs/\">London, Thursday 12; Folkestone, Friday 13 March</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b25ab783b437c67cf06adde58819ae05a12f295\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b25ab783b437c67cf06adde58819ae05a12f295/47_23_3309_1986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Masaaki Suzuki\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bach days\u2026 Masaaki Suzuki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Bye/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bach Collegium Japan</h2> <p>Over the past 30 years, under the directorship of their founder Masaaki Suzuki (pictured), the Bach Collegium Japan have become one of the world\u2019s leading baroque ensembles. As the name suggests, Bach is at the heart of the group\u2019s activities, and this European tour is devoted exclusively to his music. In Dublin, they play three cantatas, BWV 1, 78 and 55, and the Lutheran Mass in F Major, while the London date features the St John Passion, with soloists James Gilchrist, Hana Bla\u017eikov\u00e1, Damien Guillon, Zachary Wilde and Christian Immler. <br><em><a href=\"http://bachcollegiumjapan.org/en/concerts/\">National Concert Hall, Dublin, Monday 9; Barbican Hall, EC2, Tuesday 10 March</a></em></p> <h2>Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht</h2> <p>Edward Gardner\u2019s latest appearance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra includes a real rarity. Richard Dehmel\u2019s poem Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht is best known as the inspiration for Schoenberg\u2019s 1899 string sextet but, two years later, Oskar Fried made a setting of the poem for mezzo-soprano, tenor and orchestra. With Christine Rice and Stuart Skelton as the soloists, Gardner precedes the Fried with the string orchestra version of Schoenberg\u2019s work; there\u2019s also a rare Leh\u00e1r, Fieber, and Schoenberg\u2019s orchestration of Brahms\u2019s G Minor Piano Quartet. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/bbc-symphony-orchestragardner\">Barbican Hall, EC2, Friday 13 March</a></em></p> <h2>Pierre-Laurent Aimard</h2> <p>There are few more challenging works in the piano repertory than Beethoven\u2019s Hammerklavier Sonata and Ives\u2019s Concord Sonata. Putting them back to back in recital is rare indeed, but that is exactly what Pierre-Laurent Aimard is doing this week. The Beethoven comes first, so there will be no excuse for missing the quotes from it that Ives scatters through his monumental score. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/festivals-series/classical-season/pierre-laurent-aimard\">Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, Tuesday 10 March</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3803d3aa3afa5da24473077c20eb4f2eae0107e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3803d3aa3afa5da24473077c20eb4f2eae0107e1/37_210_4158_2495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joana Vasconcelos\u2019s Marilyn, 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pan handled\u2026 Joana Vasconcelos\u2019s Marilyn, 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Malhao/Yorkshire Sculpture Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Joana Vasconcelos</h2> <p>This Portuguese artist throws together sprawling, spectacular creations from textiles, wool and household stuff. Her sculptures are baroque entities, suspended from ceilings like candelabras or slung like monstrous glow worms through space. They wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a carnival, but within this fiesta of colours there is a critique of gender relations. <br><em><a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/exhibitions/joanavasconcelos\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park, nr Wakefield, Saturday 7 March to 3 January</a></em></p> <h2>Andy Warhol</h2> <p>The 20th-century artist who foresaw so much about the 21st gets his second big Tate Modern show since it opened. Every new twist in modern culture makes Warhol more uncannily current. He predicted everything from transgender rights to the global triumph of sushi. His paintings, films, photography and simply his persona thrill and fascinate. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/andy-warhol\">Tate Modern, SE1, Thursday 10 March to 6 September</a></em></p> <h2>Tom of Finland</h2> <p>An artist who gives filth a good name, Touko Laaksonen \u2013 who works under the moniker Tom of Finland \u2013 shows how the pencil can be an organ of pleasure. His rollicking visions create a graphic (in every sense) world where men embrace in unashamed joy, and his muscular heroes in leather have entered modern consciousness. This exhibition draws attention to the fact that he resists photography and celebrates the power of drawing. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.houseofillustration.org.uk/whats-on/current-future-events/tom-of-finland-love-and-liberation\">House of Illustration, N1, to 28 June</a></em></p> <h2>Drawn to Nature</h2> <p>Gilbert White was a contemporary of great landscape painters such as Joseph Wright of Derby and John Constable. His 1789 book The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne explores the natural world of an English village with a detail that mirrors theirs. This exhibition shows how it has inspired illustrators from Thomas Bewick\u2019s rustic woodcuts to the neo-Romantic 20th-century art of Piper and Nash. <br><em><a href=\"https://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/drawn-to-nature-gilbert-white-artists/\">Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, Wednesday 11 March to 28 June</a></em></p> <h2>Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk</h2> <p>In 1678, Anna Elizabeth van Reede posed for her portrait wearing a splendid kimono. This early evidence of the global exportability of a Japanese garment appears in a survey of its cultural history that includes Freddie Mercury\u2019s kimono and the Jedi robe Alec Guinness wore in Star Wars. There are also woodblock prints and real kimonos from the 19th century. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/kimono-kyoto-to-catwalk\">Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, to 21 June</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e7b82c072c5f38333c553f23262d48d563b88ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e7b82c072c5f38333c553f23262d48d563b88ba/0_324_4842_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"City of Angels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fatale attraction\u2026 City of Angels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>City of Angels</h2> <p>Larry Gelbart\u2019s mischievous Tinseltown-set musical features brooding private detectives and femme fatales, and a swinging score from jazz composer Cy Coleman.

Now this seven-hour-plus production \u2013 which explores the devastating impact of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima \u2013 is back. It will feature multilingual dialogue, percussion, puppetry, mirror-play and operatic singing. There are also extensive projections, shifting screens and a general air of mind-bending eeriness and devastation. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-seven-streams-of-the-river-ota\">National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, to 22 March</a></em></p> <h2>Rockets and Blue Lights</h2> <p>Winsome Pinnock\u2019s new play explores Britain\u2019s role in the transatlantic slave trade. One strand focuses on a black sailor and the painter JMW Turner in Victorian England. The other takes places in contemporary London, where an actor finds herself shackled by history. It is directed by Miranda Cromwell, co-director on the Young Vic\u2019s stunning Death of a Salesman. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/rockets-and-blue-lights\">Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, Friday 13 March to 4 April</a></em></p> <h2>The Glee Club</h2> <p>Out of Joint\u2019s productions are renowned for their political potency. Its latest show is a revival of Richard Cameron\u2019s comedy about a group of miners \u2013 who also happen to enjoy a good singalong. The play is set in the summer of 1962, as six men prepare to wow the locals with a gala concert. The show features a slew of popular songs from the 50s, stars Bill Ward and Kai Owen, and is directed by Kate Wasserberg. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.theatrclwyd.com/event/the-glee-club/\">Theatr Clwyd: Anthony Hopkins Theatre, Mold, Tuesday 10 to 14 March</a>; touring to 27 June</em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52604e181af83e9206deb863c69dcc84933b62af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52604e181af83e9206deb863c69dcc84933b62af/45_239_5144_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Alston Dance Company\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last leg\u2026 Richard Alston Dance Company.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Nash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Richard Alston Dance Company: Final Edition</h2> <p>These are the last ever shows from this much-loved company, closing after 25 years, led by one of the UK\u2019s finest contemporary choreographers.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Onward (U) (Dan Scanlon, 2020, US) 107 mins Pixar has two films out this year: afterlife/jazz yarn Soul, and this magic-fantasy quest with a heavy dose of family-value philosophising. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt voice two elf brothers who set off to magic up the top half of their dead dad (don\u2019t ask). After a run of Pixar sequels, it is a breath of fresh air to see some distinctive originals. Portrait of a Lady on Fire (15) (C\u00e9line Sciamma, 2019, France) 122 mins C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s period romance has been celebrated as a key moment for the acknowledgement of the lesbian gaze, as well as the focus of anti-Roman Polanski protest at the recent C\u00e9sar awards. Real-world significance aside, it is simply a tremendous watch, telling of confined female lives in the 18th century and of attempts to break out. True History of the Kelly Gang (18) (Justin Kurzel, 2020, UK/Fra/Australia) 125 mins George MacKay\u2019s ascension to the firmament has been remarkable, from the fresh-faced ex-squaddie in Sunshine on Leith to 19th-century Australian outlaw Ned Kelly. Ballasted by Peter Carey\u2019s novel, this version of the story has MacKay playing Kelly as an intense-but-vulnerable figure, leading a gang of misfits in a battle with authorities. Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am (12A) (Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, 2019, US) 120 mins Morrison, who died in 2019, got the chance to speak at length in this documentary. This is very much an admiring portrait/summary of the Nobel prize winner\u2019s life and work: from her childhood in Ohio, through her early publications, to her latter-day status as a literary great and African-American icon. As the title indicates, Greenfield-Sanders\u2019s approach is tapestry style. Major names such as Oprah and Angela Davis show up to shower praise. Blumhouse\u2019s Fantasy Island (15) (Jeff Wadlow, 2020, US) 109 mins The Horror outfit Blumhouse has reinvigorated the Universal Monsterverse with The Invisible Man, so perhaps it is entitled to a promotional namecheck in this film\u2019s title. Michael Pe\u00f1a plays the mysterious Roarke, who promises to make his clients\u2019 fantasies come true after they arrive on the island; a cast including Maggie Q and Lucy Hale have to deal with the consequences of taking up the offer. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz Shygirl Like her childhood idols Missy Elliott and Bj\u00f6rk, the south London singer and DJ Blane Muise, AKA Shygirl, seems intent on expanding the parameters of pop. On 2018\u2019s Rude she underpinned the rib-rattling beat with Psycho-esque strings, while ear-piercing screams were woven throughout last year\u2019s luxuriant boast track Uckers. Prepare to be a sweaty mess by the end of the evening. Space 289, E2, Thursday 12 March Tove Lo Despite sustaining a fractured ankle midway through a recent New York show (she didn\u2019t realise it had happened until afterwards), the Swedish pop rebel Tove Lo arrives in the UK in support of last year\u2019s fourth album, Sunshine Kitty. Her Instagram suggests her post-injury staging now includes a bejewelled boot and comfy throne. Glasgow, Monday 9; Manchester, Tuesday 10; London, Thursday 12 March C2C: Country to Country Featuring a revolving lineup across three cities, the double-denim carnival, AKA the C2C festival, returns for its eighth year. The achy-breaky headliners this year include dustbowl heartthrob Eric Church, occasional Hootie and the Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker (pictured, above) and trucker-cap enthusiast Luke Combs. Support comes from the likes of Tanya Tucker and the \u201cnew Dixie Chicks\u201d, Runaway June. London, Dublin &amp; Glasgow, Friday 13 to 15 March Halsey Halsey , said her recent album Manic was an exploration of \u201cfemale rage\u201d, and included nods to some of her forebears (Pink, Alanis) who had been too often dismissed as \u201cangsty\u201d. A shame then that the sweaty, Tatu-sampling headbanger Nightmare didn\u2019t make the final cut, an error of judgment that will hopefully be rectified on this brief arena jaunt. Glasgow, Saturday 7; London, Sunday 8; Dublin, Tuesday 10; Manchester, Thursday 12 March MC Vula Viel Jazzwise magazine described the percussion-led trio as \u201clike Portico Quartet on steroids\u201d, a fair call for this hypnotic mix of Bex Burch and her woodily melodic, Ghana-rooted xylophone sound, Ruth Goller\u2019s thunderously punky bass, and Jim Hart\u2019s polyrhythmic drumming. The minimalist US trombonist-singer Peter Zummo uncorks his inimitable music on the London bill. London, Thursday 12; Folkestone, Friday 13 March JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Bach Collegium Japan Over the past 30 years, under the directorship of their founder Masaaki Suzuki (pictured), the Bach Collegium Japan have become one of the world\u2019s leading baroque ensembles. As the name suggests, Bach is at the heart of the group\u2019s activities, and this European tour is devoted exclusively to his music. In Dublin, they play three cantatas, BWV 1, 78 and 55, and the Lutheran Mass in F Major, while the London date features the St John Passion, with soloists James Gilchrist, Hana Bla\u017eikov\u00e1, Damien Guillon, Zachary Wilde and Christian Immler. National Concert Hall, Dublin, Monday 9; Barbican Hall, EC2, Tuesday 10 March Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht Edward Gardner\u2019s latest appearance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra includes a real rarity. Richard Dehmel\u2019s poem Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht is best known as the inspiration for Schoenberg\u2019s 1899 string sextet but, two years later, Oskar Fried made a setting of the poem for mezzo-soprano, tenor and orchestra. With Christine Rice and Stuart Skelton as the soloists, Gardner precedes the Fried with the string orchestra version of Schoenberg\u2019s work; there\u2019s also a rare Leh\u00e1r, Fieber, and Schoenberg\u2019s orchestration of Brahms\u2019s G Minor Piano Quartet. Barbican Hall, EC2, Friday 13 March Pierre-Laurent Aimard There are few more challenging works in the piano repertory than Beethoven\u2019s Hammerklavier Sonata and Ives\u2019s Concord Sonata. Putting them back to back in recital is rare indeed, but that is exactly what Pierre-Laurent Aimard is doing this week. The Beethoven comes first, so there will be no excuse for missing the quotes from it that Ives scatters through his monumental score. Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, Tuesday 10 March AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Joana Vasconcelos This Portuguese artist throws together sprawling, spectacular creations from textiles, wool and household stuff. Her sculptures are baroque entities, suspended from ceilings like candelabras or slung like monstrous glow worms through space. They wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a carnival, but within this fiesta of colours there is a critique of gender relations. Yorkshire Sculpture Park, nr Wakefield, Saturday 7 March to 3 January Andy Warhol The 20th-century artist who foresaw so much about the 21st gets his second big Tate Modern show since it opened. Every new twist in modern culture makes Warhol more uncannily current. He predicted everything from transgender rights to the global triumph of sushi. His paintings, films, photography and simply his persona thrill and fascinate. Tate Modern, SE1, Thursday 10 March to 6 September Tom of Finland An artist who gives filth a good name, Touko Laaksonen \u2013 who works under the moniker Tom of Finland \u2013 shows how the pencil can be an organ of pleasure. His rollicking visions create a graphic (in every sense) world where men embrace in unashamed joy, and his muscular heroes in leather have entered modern consciousness. This exhibition draws attention to the fact that he resists photography and celebrates the power of drawing. House of Illustration, N1, to 28 June Drawn to Nature Gilbert White was a contemporary of great landscape painters such as Joseph Wright of Derby and John Constable. His 1789 book The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne explores the natural world of an English village with a detail that mirrors theirs. This exhibition shows how it has inspired illustrators from Thomas Bewick\u2019s rustic woodcuts to the neo-Romantic 20th-century art of Piper and Nash. Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, Wednesday 11 March to 28 June Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk In 1678, Anna Elizabeth van Reede posed for her portrait wearing a splendid kimono. This early evidence of the global exportability of a Japanese garment appears in a survey of its cultural history that includes Freddie Mercury\u2019s kimono and the Jedi robe Alec Guinness wore in Star Wars. There are also woodblock prints and real kimonos from the 19th century. Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, to 21 June JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows City of Angels Larry Gelbart\u2019s mischievous Tinseltown-set musical features brooding private detectives and femme fatales, and a swinging score from jazz composer Cy Coleman. Josie Rourke is reviving her glowingly reviewed 2014 Donmar Warehouse production \u2013 and she has a stellar cast on board, including Hadley Fraser, Rosalie Craig and Nicola \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d Roberts. Garrick Theatre, WC2, to 5 September Love, Love, Love Mike Bartlett\u2019s plays are exceptionally smart and brimming with lively characters. Love, Love, Love charts one couple\u2019s personal and political journey from the 1960s through to the present. Kenneth and Sandra think they have done everything possible for their kids; their kids disagree. It is directed by Rachel O\u2019Riordan and stars Rachael Stirling and Nicholas Burns. Lyric Hammersmith, W6, to 4 April The Seven Streams of the River Ota When Robert Lepage\u2019s epic show premiered at the National in 1996, the critics were not convinced it was ready. Now this seven-hour-plus production \u2013 which explores the devastating impact of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima \u2013 is back. It will feature multilingual dialogue, percussion, puppetry, mirror-play and operatic singing. There are also extensive projections, shifting screens and a general air of mind-bending eeriness and devastation. National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, to 22 March Rockets and Blue Lights Winsome Pinnock\u2019s new play explores Britain\u2019s role in the transatlantic slave trade. One strand focuses on a black sailor and the painter JMW Turner in Victorian England. The other takes places in contemporary London, where an actor finds herself shackled by history. It is directed by Miranda Cromwell, co-director on the Young Vic\u2019s stunning Death of a Salesman. Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, Friday 13 March to 4 April The Glee Club Out of Joint\u2019s productions are renowned for their political potency. Its latest show is a revival of Richard Cameron\u2019s comedy about a group of miners \u2013 who also happen to enjoy a good singalong. The play is set in the summer of 1962, as six men prepare to wow the locals with a gala concert. The show features a slew of popular songs from the 50s, stars Bill Ward and Kai Owen, and is directed by Kate Wasserberg. Theatr Clwyd: Anthony Hopkins Theatre, Mold, Tuesday 10 to 14 March; touring to 27 June MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Richard Alston Dance Company: Final Edition These are the last ever shows from this much-loved company, closing after 25 years, led by one of the UK\u2019s finest contemporary choreographers. Alston will carry on as an independent artist but these performances (including a new work, Shine On) mark the end of an era. It\u2019s going to be emotional.

      "body": "<p>When Final Fantasy VII hit the PlayStation in 1997, the role-playing adventure genre was changed for ever. Abandoning the stereotypical castles, creatures and grizzled beardy wizards of high fantasy, the game took place in a quasi-futuristic world the likes of which had never been seen in this style of game before. The revolutionary 3D modelled characters, the sci-fi stylings and detailed, often cinematic visuals, led critics and fans to declare it one of the greatest video games of all time.</p> <p>This April, the Final Fantasy VII Remake promises to redefine the genre again, and developer Square Enix has been keen to point out that this is no shot-for-shot remake. Much will be familiar \u2013 the opening cinematic, with Cloud Strife, the game\u2019s iconic, big-haired, big-sworded mercenary hero, arriving at the train station \u2013 has been lovingly updated, and the game\u2019s first chapter, of which a demo has been made available this week, takes players on a beautifully re-created version of the original\u2019s Mako reactor bombing mission.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e7ce0e7e2428d41c897a60d36fb73e4f61fe4cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e7ce0e7e2428d41c897a60d36fb73e4f61fe4cb/296_107_1622_973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The retro-futuristic architecture of the Shinra building typifies the look of Final Fantasy 7.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The retro-futuristic architecture of the Shinra building typifies the look of Final Fantasy 7.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Square Enix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Final Fantasy VII Remake expands greatly on that world, and will be released in multiple episodes, each providing a unique experience. In the opening release arriving in April, the whole adventure will be set in the slums of Midgar, a sprawling metropolis that is home to the mighty Shinra corporation, which was only seen for a couple of hours in the original. According to the development team, this expansion will \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d from the original, adding depth and detail that wasn\u2019t possible 23 years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe philosophy behind the remake wasn\u2019t to do something completely new,\u201d explains the remake\u2019s co-director, Naoki Hamaguchi, who has worked on the Final Fantasy series since 2003. \u201cThe original game was grounded in the technology of the day. And because of that, there was a lot of storytelling that the player had to fill in with their imagination. In the original, for example, when you travelled between areas, the screen would fade to black; players didn\u2019t see the journey.</p> <p>\u201cThe story would have moved on and what actually happened in the meantime would be left to your imagination. We approached this by thinking, what is actually supposed to be happening here? What are the gaps it doesn\u2019t show you, and how do we fill those in to make what was being implied actually shown? [In the original] there\u2019d be hundreds of things happening in that one night. It feels very weird. We had to find a more realistic way of arranging that story.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTCmN8TtkgQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aTCmN8TtkgQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While staying faithful to the original narrative and locations, Final Fantasy VII Remake will add intricate environmental detail. Midgar now feels like a living, breathing city with fascinating new elements to discover. Take the posters on the train platform in that first mission: \u201cWe thought, who comes to this platform? What kind of information would they want? Who\u2019d want to put up posters here? I really hope players see how deeply we\u2019ve gone into the world,\u201d says Hamaguchi. Elsewhere, the game\u2019s second chapter introduces us to deadly villain Sephiroth, and plants the seeds of the history between him and Cloud, which the game will contextualise.</p> <p>Some additions are more nuanced. In the first chapter of the game, as in the original, your team are on an eco-terrorist bombing mission to take down Mako Reactor 1, which is being used by the nefarious Shinra Electric Power Company to exploit the planet\u2019s essential natural Lifestream and threatening life itself in the process.</p> <p>\u201cIn the original, the character performances had to be very over-the-top,\u201d explains Hamaguchi. Now, we get a subtle picture of what your team are thinking, breaking down the motivations of returning fan-favourite character Barret. \u201cYou don\u2019t just see his gung-ho attitude. After they blow up the reactor, he has doubts and internal conflict. He obviously believes in his cause, but he\u2019s wondering if he did the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>Together with the extra storytelling time, refined voice acting performances will add to the authenticity of the world. Battles, too, are faithful to the original\u2019s gameplay \u2013 but more dynamic. And importantly, more fun, employing a hybrid of the original\u2019s complex Active Time Battle system with real-time combat. It\u2019s a clever combination that is both fast-paced and strategic.</p> <p>In line with the classic ATB setup, you must wait for your character\u2019s gauge to build up in order to use magic and to heal, but can use real-time battling to thrash your other weapons at enemies in the meantime. You must switch wisely between those in your party to use their move specialities against appropriate boss weak-spots, too. Cloud\u2019s huge sword is as satisfying as weapons come for close-quarters melee attacks, while Barret\u2019s machine gun (handily also part of his arm) is best used for long-range attacks; Tifa employs martial arts skills, and Aerith uses support-style magic to aid her allies. It\u2019s a lot to think about in the heat of a boss fight, but the complexities make battling rewarding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38fd6f0c13bec661248b8bf1eaf547e866de0d4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38fd6f0c13bec661248b8bf1eaf547e866de0d4a/83_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Final Fantasy 7 Remake overhauls the original game\u2019s Active Time Battle system with real-time elements.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Final Fantasy 7 Remake overhauls the original game\u2019s Active Time Battle system with real-time elements.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Square Enix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe really did look at what made the original Final Fantasy VII what it was: all the characters, the story, the mini games.\u201d says Hamaguchi. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got mini games \u2026\u201d Considering the remake is all about nuance and naturalism, it is surprising to hear that mini games will return: it\u2019s difficult to imagine the retro, old-school hangover of this convention being part of the industrial, gritty, highly-defined Midgar world. And yet, some of the most abiding memories of the original game are tapping buttons in a specific order to do squats in the gym at the Wall Market, slicing left and right on your motorcycle in the G Bike game, or tapping furiously to arm-wrestle a sumo warrior in the Wonder Square. And who can resist a Chocobo race?</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all in there,\u201d confirms Hamaguchi. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just reproduce the ones from the original game; there really are a lot of different mini games there.\u201d</p> <p>Now that the first episode of Final Fantasy VII Remake is almost here, the team is working on its sequel, which will take us further into the world beyond Midgar. There\u2019s no word yet on how many more instalments there will be beyond that, but the developers have been open about the saga continuing for not years, but decades, with producer Yoshinori Kitase, another Final Fantasy veteran,<a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-producer-yoshinori-kitase-is-prepared-to-work-on-the-story-for-the-rest-of-his-career/\"> announcing </a>that he plans to work on it for the rest of his career. And there is certainly rich enough material to carry it on for as long. It is clear, once again, that there is nothing at all final about this fantasy.</p> <p>\u2022 Final Fantasy VII Remake is released on PS4 on 10 April.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Final Fantasy VII hit the PlayStation in 1997, the role-playing adventure genre was changed for ever. Abandoning the stereotypical castles, creatures and grizzled beardy wizards of high fantasy, the game took place in a quasi-futuristic world the likes of which had never been seen in this style of game before. The revolutionary 3D modelled characters, the sci-fi stylings and detailed, often cinematic visuals, led critics and fans to declare it one of the greatest video games of all time. This April, the Final Fantasy VII Remake promises to redefine the genre again, and developer Square Enix has been keen to point out that this is no shot-for-shot remake. Much will be familiar \u2013 the opening cinematic, with Cloud Strife, the game\u2019s iconic, big-haired, big-sworded mercenary hero, arriving at the train station \u2013 has been lovingly updated, and the game\u2019s first chapter, of which a demo has been made available this week, takes players on a beautifully re-created version of the original\u2019s Mako reactor bombing mission. But Final Fantasy VII Remake expands greatly on that world, and will be released in multiple episodes, each providing a unique experience. In the opening release arriving in April, the whole adventure will be set in the slums of Midgar, a sprawling metropolis that is home to the mighty Shinra corporation, which was only seen for a couple of hours in the original. According to the development team, this expansion will \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d from the original, adding depth and detail that wasn\u2019t possible 23 years ago. \u201cThe philosophy behind the remake wasn\u2019t to do something completely new,\u201d explains the remake\u2019s co-director, Naoki Hamaguchi, who has worked on the Final Fantasy series since 2003. \u201cThe original game was grounded in the technology of the day. And because of that, there was a lot of storytelling that the player had to fill in with their imagination. In the original, for example, when you travelled between areas, the screen would fade to black; players didn\u2019t see the journey. \u201cThe story would have moved on and what actually happened in the meantime would be left to your imagination. We approached this by thinking, what is actually supposed to be happening here? What are the gaps it doesn\u2019t show you, and how do we fill those in to make what was being implied actually shown? [In the original] there\u2019d be hundreds of things happening in that one night. It feels very weird. We had to find a more realistic way of arranging that story.\u201d While staying faithful to the original narrative and locations, Final Fantasy VII Remake will add intricate environmental detail. Midgar now feels like a living, breathing city with fascinating new elements to discover. Take the posters on the train platform in that first mission: \u201cWe thought, who comes to this platform? What kind of information would they want? Who\u2019d want to put up posters here? I really hope players see how deeply we\u2019ve gone into the world,\u201d says Hamaguchi. Elsewhere, the game\u2019s second chapter introduces us to deadly villain Sephiroth, and plants the seeds of the history between him and Cloud, which the game will contextualise. Some additions are more nuanced. In the first chapter of the game, as in the original, your team are on an eco-terrorist bombing mission to take down Mako Reactor 1, which is being used by the nefarious Shinra Electric Power Company to exploit the planet\u2019s essential natural Lifestream and threatening life itself in the process. \u201cIn the original, the character performances had to be very over-the-top,\u201d explains Hamaguchi. Now, we get a subtle picture of what your team are thinking, breaking down the motivations of returning fan-favourite character Barret. \u201cYou don\u2019t just see his gung-ho attitude. After they blow up the reactor, he has doubts and internal conflict. He obviously believes in his cause, but he\u2019s wondering if he did the right thing.\u201d Together with the extra storytelling time, refined voice acting performances will add to the authenticity of the world. Battles, too, are faithful to the original\u2019s gameplay \u2013 but more dynamic. And importantly, more fun, employing a hybrid of the original\u2019s complex Active Time Battle system with real-time combat. It\u2019s a clever combination that is both fast-paced and strategic. In line with the classic ATB setup, you must wait for your character\u2019s gauge to build up in order to use magic and to heal, but can use real-time battling to thrash your other weapons at enemies in the meantime. You must switch wisely between those in your party to use their move specialities against appropriate boss weak-spots, too. Cloud\u2019s huge sword is as satisfying as weapons come for close-quarters melee attacks, while Barret\u2019s machine gun (handily also part of his arm) is best used for long-range attacks; Tifa employs martial arts skills, and Aerith uses support-style magic to aid her allies. It\u2019s a lot to think about in the heat of a boss fight, but the complexities make battling rewarding. \u201cWe really did look at what made the original Final Fantasy VII what it was: all the characters, the story, the mini games.\u201d says Hamaguchi. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got mini games \u2026\u201d Considering the remake is all about nuance and naturalism, it is surprising to hear that mini games will return: it\u2019s difficult to imagine the retro, old-school hangover of this convention being part of the industrial, gritty, highly-defined Midgar world. And yet, some of the most abiding memories of the original game are tapping buttons in a specific order to do squats in the gym at the Wall Market, slicing left and right on your motorcycle in the G Bike game, or tapping furiously to arm-wrestle a sumo warrior in the Wonder Square. And who can resist a Chocobo race? \u201cThey\u2019re all in there,\u201d confirms Hamaguchi. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just reproduce the ones from the original game; there really are a lot of different mini games there.\u201d Now that the first episode of Final Fantasy VII Remake is almost here, the team is working on its sequel, which will take us further into the world beyond Midgar. There\u2019s no word yet on how many more instalments there will be beyond that, but the developers have been open about the saga continuing for not years, but decades, with producer Yoshinori Kitase, another Final Fantasy veteran, announcing that he plans to work on it for the rest of his career. And there is certainly rich enough material to carry it on for as long. It is clear, once again, that there is nothing at all final about this fantasy. \u2022 Final Fantasy VII Remake is released on PS4 on 10 April.",

Appearing at a Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Trump \u2013 who has faced repeated scrutiny over his own mental acuity \u2013 said there was \u201csomething going on\u201d with Biden, in what may prove a rehearsal for Republican attacks during the presidential election. Thursday marked Trump\u2019s first public event since Biden\u2019s surprisingly strong performance on Super Tuesday, when he won 10 out of 14 states available to propel him into the lead in the Democratic primary. Trump said he had been \u201call set\u201d to face Biden\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders, whom he called a \u201ccommunist\u201d, until the recent vote. \u201cThen we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which [Biden] thought was Thursday, but he also said 150 million people were killed with guns and that he was running for the United States Senate.

Biden \u2013 who did say those things \u2013 has a track record of gaffes, and has turned in bumbling debate performances, but Trump\u2019s line of attack raised the unedifying spectacle of an election focused on two men in their 70s attacking each other\u2019s perceived cognitive decline. Biden did not immediately respond to Trump, who was speaking at the Scranton Cultural Center, on the street where Biden grew up, a mile and a half north-east. The town hall was hosted by the Trump-friendly Fox News but had a more sedate vibe than Trump\u2019s rallies, with many of the crowd wearing button-up shirts and not a single Make American Great Again hat to be seen. Trump, who brushed off questions about his handling of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 suggesting the economy could benefit because Americans may choose not to travel abroad \u2013 has had his own faculties questioned during his presidency.

      "body": "<p>Can I ask you something?\u201d says Greg Kinnear, slightly nervously, toward the end of our conversation. \u201cDid you notice that I\u2019m wearing a prosthetic nose?\u201d</p> <p>He is not talking about right now \u2013 he is on the other end of the line in a hotel room in British Columbia, so he could be sporting nothing but clogs for all I know \u2013 but rather how he appears in the new film Misbehaviour. In this British comedy-drama about the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement protests that disrupted the 1970 Miss World event, he plays the US entertainer Bob Hope, who hosted the pageant that year and made no secret of his disdain for the idea of gender equality. A month earlier, the comic had appeared in a TV special, Bob Hope Looks at Women\u2019s Lib, in which he imagined how different the TV networks would be if they were run by women: no televised sport but the offices would be spotless.</p> <p>I tell Kinnear that I hadn\u2019t noticed anything up with his schnoz; after a few minutes of the showbiz smugness, the slight squint and the right hand pressed flat against his body as though slipping inside an invisible pocket, it is possible to see him as Hope, despite the disparity in age (Kinnear is 56, while Hope was a creaky-looking 67 in footage from the event).</p> <p>\u201cWell, you sure know how to warm a guy\u2019s heart,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried about it. I said to my wife, \u2018Is the nose too subtle?\u2019 Because I think people are going to be asking: \u2018What\u2019s happened to Kinnear\u2019s nose? Has he been drinking?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s hardly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/15/movies/the-nose-was-the-final-straw.html\" title=\"\">Nicole Kidman in The Hours</a>, I tell him. \u201cRight. For her, it was like: \u2018Oh my gosh, look at the nose!\u2019 It was all anyone talked about. And here I am, my first interview out of the gate, and you\u2019re saying: \u2018I didn\u2019t even know you were wearing one.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Kinnear may have been acting for a quarter of a century, but he still has the joshing, laid-back bonhomie that made him such an effective television presenter, just the right side of snarky and smarmy \u2013 first on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmIJWQwaTVU\" title=\"\">Talk Soup</a>, an irreverent Clive James-style roundup of eccentric cable-TV clips from the early 1990s, and then as a chatshow host on Later with Greg Kinnear.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-roQtAmjOk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M-roQtAmjOk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cWe went out in the wee small hours,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwhen you get your smokers and tokers.\u201d It was from here that he was plucked by Sydney Pollack to star opposite Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in a remake of Billy Wilder\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twTksx_lWB4\" title=\"\">Sabrina</a>, which led to his Oscar-nominated performance in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrRl2QQKkI8\" title=\"\">As Good As It Gets</a> as the gay artist forced to fall on the mercy of his misanthropic, bigoted neighbour, played by Jack Nicholson. </p> <p>Playing Hope in Misbehaviour brought him back full circle to the sort of entertainer he used to be. Even before Kinnear\u2019s TV career took off, he hosted a weekly hour-long show on Armed Forces Radio in his teens (as the son of a diplomat, he lived in Athens and Beirut before returning to the US to finish his education) on which he would, he tells me, \u201cfill the hour with mindless talking and music.\u201d While he has yet to acquire national-treasure status, there are certainly similarities between his career path and Hope\u2019s. \u201cIt all began in radio for him, too, and that led to TV and a huge career at NBC \u2013 the same network where I worked \u2013 as well as movies. His job was so obviously a big part of who he was, part of his soul, even.\u201d But as Kinnear is only too aware, Hope does not emerge from Misbehaviour with dignity. \u201cWe have a guy here living in a different era, which, when held up in today\u2019s light and where we\u2019re at, it does look, uh, slightly off.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUa0Mtdv1HQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZUa0Mtdv1HQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The film makes no secret of Hope\u2019s infidelities; even before the feminist campaigners (Keira Knightley and Jessie Buckley among them) are pelting him with flour, his wife Dolores (Lesley Manville) is bracing herself for a repeat of the personal Miss World humiliation of a decade earlier, when he returned from his hosting gig with the winning contestant in tow. And that was only the mistress she knew about. His agent, Louis Shurr, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/17/laugh-factory\" title=\"\">once told a publicist</a>: \u201cOur mission in life is to keep all news about fucking and sucking away from Dolores.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t so familiar with that side of him,\u201d Kinnear says, \u201cbut I thought this was an interesting aspect of the movie. You\u2019re taking this beauty contest, this event that was so commonplace and accepted, you know \u2013 \u2018This is what we do, people.\u2019 And to bring that up in 2020, it\u2019s like I can\u2019t think of anything that signals more clearly the cultural changes and shifts that have occurred, even just in the past few years. I tried to find the reality of who he was in that day and age and what he was there to do \u2013 to be that smiling, winking guy with these bathing-suit-clad beauties. And I think the movie shows that the times were changing around him, and he was caught off-guard by that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reCX3_OAkv8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/reCX3_OAkv8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Does he think a persona such as Hope\u2019s can be a straitjacket? \u201cWell, you either change with the times or you don\u2019t. And you can see he was very flat-footed in that moment and he doesn\u2019t quite understand it. You see that situation all the time now and maybe in a more accelerated way in our current environment. It does show that progress is being made, whether or not we\u2019re ready for it.\u201d</p> <p>Kinnear, who is in the middle of shooting a nine-part television adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s The Stand, says that film sets are a very different place to be now. \u201cThe other day someone said: \u2018Oh yeah, human resources are on set today.\u2019 You know, a person who\u2019s there to make sure people are feeling safe and following the rules and aren\u2019t being compromised by someone who\u2019s doing shit they shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u2019 And I thought: \u2018Wow, where were human resources back in the 1990s?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Even setting aside the infidelities and his sexism, Hope is a prime candidate for \u201ccancel culture\u201d, which seeks to strike from the record the achievements of anyone whose moral and behavioural standards fall far below our 21<sup>st</sup>-century expectations. In the 1980s, for instance, Hope was using homophobic slurs and cracking <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-07-30-me-18831-story.html\" title=\"\">Aids jokes</a>. Kinnear asks me for a quick definition of cancel culture but it\u2019s evident immediately that its principles are at odds with what he as an actor relishes in a role. \u201cA person\u2019s imperfections are always part of the great work of studying any character, showing all sides and finding the truth. Even the most noble, regal character still has flaws. For me, it\u2019s a case-by-case basis. Egregious behaviour, where someone should have known better \u2013 well, I\u2019m not sure you can write that off as: \u2018Hey, the times were different!\u2019 But I do think also there are many examples of behaviour where you can say: \u2018Listen, this was a time when things were different and it\u2019s unfair and ridiculous and pointless to some degree to pretend that their contribution was not meaningful.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is a line that Kinnear delivers in As Good As It Gets that sums up the sentiment: <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/film-review-a-sitcom-for-the-big-screen-1149880.html\" title=\"\">\u201cIf you look at a person for long enough, you can see their humanity.\u201d</a> He practically trills when I mention it. \u201cI love that line and I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re citing it. It\u2019s true. There is always something to be discovered if you give it time.\u201d To Kill a Mockingbird is much on his mind at the moment \u2013 he takes over from Ed Harris as Atticus Finch next month in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s sellout Broadway adaptation \u2013 and he invokes that character here also. \u201cAtticus says that you can\u2019t really get to know a person until you get inside their skin and crawl around.\u201d</p> <p>As a father of three daughters aged between 10 and 16, he is keenly aware of the male bias in the movies that are greenlit. \u201cIt\u2019s like turning an aircraft carrier around. It\u2019s very slow. And you do feel that the inherent maleness of showbusiness for so many years is reflected in the vast majority of stories that get told. Misbehaviour I look at as a really entertaining story but it also has a strong female voice that I love and it isn\u2019t told like a two-hour civics lesson. It\u2019s just honest and powerful and it makes a dad of three daughters feel good.\u201d</p> <p>Will he show them the movie? \u201cOh my gosh, yes. The oldest one wants to take it to show at her school. In general, they are not particularly keen on watching anything that wasn\u2019t made in the last four-to-seven minutes. For them, if a song didn\u2019t drop in the last 15 hours, then it\u2019s old.\u201d I have to point out, though, that he said \u201cdrop\u201d rather than \u201ccome out.\u201d \u201cHow about that?

      "bodyText": "Can I ask you something?\u201d says Greg Kinnear, slightly nervously, toward the end of our conversation. \u201cDid you notice that I\u2019m wearing a prosthetic nose?\u201d He is not talking about right now \u2013 he is on the other end of the line in a hotel room in British Columbia, so he could be sporting nothing but clogs for all I know \u2013 but rather how he appears in the new film Misbehaviour. In this British comedy-drama about the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement protests that disrupted the 1970 Miss World event, he plays the US entertainer Bob Hope, who hosted the pageant that year and made no secret of his disdain for the idea of gender equality. A month earlier, the comic had appeared in a TV special, Bob Hope Looks at Women\u2019s Lib, in which he imagined how different the TV networks would be if they were run by women: no televised sport but the offices would be spotless. I tell Kinnear that I hadn\u2019t noticed anything up with his schnoz; after a few minutes of the showbiz smugness, the slight squint and the right hand pressed flat against his body as though slipping inside an invisible pocket, it is possible to see him as Hope, despite the disparity in age (Kinnear is 56, while Hope was a creaky-looking 67 in footage from the event). \u201cWell, you sure know how to warm a guy\u2019s heart,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried about it. I said to my wife, \u2018Is the nose too subtle?\u2019 Because I think people are going to be asking: \u2018What\u2019s happened to Kinnear\u2019s nose? Has he been drinking?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s hardly Nicole Kidman in The Hours, I tell him. \u201cRight. For her, it was like: \u2018Oh my gosh, look at the nose!\u2019 It was all anyone talked about. And here I am, my first interview out of the gate, and you\u2019re saying: \u2018I didn\u2019t even know you were wearing one.\u2019\u201d Kinnear may have been acting for a quarter of a century, but he still has the joshing, laid-back bonhomie that made him such an effective television presenter, just the right side of snarky and smarmy \u2013 first on Talk Soup, an irreverent Clive James-style roundup of eccentric cable-TV clips from the early 1990s, and then as a chatshow host on Later with Greg Kinnear. \u201cWe went out in the wee small hours,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwhen you get your smokers and tokers.\u201d It was from here that he was plucked by Sydney Pollack to star opposite Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in a remake of Billy Wilder\u2019s Sabrina, which led to his Oscar-nominated performance in As Good As It Gets as the gay artist forced to fall on the mercy of his misanthropic, bigoted neighbour, played by Jack Nicholson. Playing Hope in Misbehaviour brought him back full circle to the sort of entertainer he used to be. Even before Kinnear\u2019s TV career took off, he hosted a weekly hour-long show on Armed Forces Radio in his teens (as the son of a diplomat, he lived in Athens and Beirut before returning to the US to finish his education) on which he would, he tells me, \u201cfill the hour with mindless talking and music.\u201d While he has yet to acquire national-treasure status, there are certainly similarities between his career path and Hope\u2019s. \u201cIt all began in radio for him, too, and that led to TV and a huge career at NBC \u2013 the same network where I worked \u2013 as well as movies. His job was so obviously a big part of who he was, part of his soul, even.\u201d But as Kinnear is only too aware, Hope does not emerge from Misbehaviour with dignity. \u201cWe have a guy here living in a different era, which, when held up in today\u2019s light and where we\u2019re at, it does look, uh, slightly off.\u201d The film makes no secret of Hope\u2019s infidelities; even before the feminist campaigners (Keira Knightley and Jessie Buckley among them) are pelting him with flour, his wife Dolores (Lesley Manville) is bracing herself for a repeat of the personal Miss World humiliation of a decade earlier, when he returned from his hosting gig with the winning contestant in tow. And that was only the mistress she knew about. His agent, Louis Shurr, once told a publicist: \u201cOur mission in life is to keep all news about fucking and sucking away from Dolores.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t so familiar with that side of him,\u201d Kinnear says, \u201cbut I thought this was an interesting aspect of the movie. You\u2019re taking this beauty contest, this event that was so commonplace and accepted, you know \u2013 \u2018This is what we do, people.\u2019 And to bring that up in 2020, it\u2019s like I can\u2019t think of anything that signals more clearly the cultural changes and shifts that have occurred, even just in the past few years. I tried to find the reality of who he was in that day and age and what he was there to do \u2013 to be that smiling, winking guy with these bathing-suit-clad beauties. And I think the movie shows that the times were changing around him, and he was caught off-guard by that.\u201d Does he think a persona such as Hope\u2019s can be a straitjacket? \u201cWell, you either change with the times or you don\u2019t. And you can see he was very flat-footed in that moment and he doesn\u2019t quite understand it. You see that situation all the time now and maybe in a more accelerated way in our current environment. It does show that progress is being made, whether or not we\u2019re ready for it.\u201d Kinnear, who is in the middle of shooting a nine-part television adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s The Stand, says that film sets are a very different place to be now. \u201cThe other day someone said: \u2018Oh yeah, human resources are on set today.\u2019 You know, a person who\u2019s there to make sure people are feeling safe and following the rules and aren\u2019t being compromised by someone who\u2019s doing shit they shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u2019 And I thought: \u2018Wow, where were human resources back in the 1990s?\u2019\u201d Even setting aside the infidelities and his sexism, Hope is a prime candidate for \u201ccancel culture\u201d, which seeks to strike from the record the achievements of anyone whose moral and behavioural standards fall far below our 21st-century expectations. In the 1980s, for instance, Hope was using homophobic slurs and cracking Aids jokes. Kinnear asks me for a quick definition of cancel culture but it\u2019s evident immediately that its principles are at odds with what he as an actor relishes in a role. \u201cA person\u2019s imperfections are always part of the great work of studying any character, showing all sides and finding the truth. Even the most noble, regal character still has flaws. For me, it\u2019s a case-by-case basis. Egregious behaviour, where someone should have known better \u2013 well, I\u2019m not sure you can write that off as: \u2018Hey, the times were different!\u2019 But I do think also there are many examples of behaviour where you can say: \u2018Listen, this was a time when things were different and it\u2019s unfair and ridiculous and pointless to some degree to pretend that their contribution was not meaningful.\u2019\u201d There is a line that Kinnear delivers in As Good As It Gets that sums up the sentiment: \u201cIf you look at a person for long enough, you can see their humanity.\u201d He practically trills when I mention it. \u201cI love that line and I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re citing it. It\u2019s true. There is always something to be discovered if you give it time.\u201d To Kill a Mockingbird is much on his mind at the moment \u2013 he takes over from Ed Harris as Atticus Finch next month in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s sellout Broadway adaptation \u2013 and he invokes that character here also. \u201cAtticus says that you can\u2019t really get to know a person until you get inside their skin and crawl around.\u201d As a father of three daughters aged between 10 and 16, he is keenly aware of the male bias in the movies that are greenlit. \u201cIt\u2019s like turning an aircraft carrier around. It\u2019s very slow. And you do feel that the inherent maleness of showbusiness for so many years is reflected in the vast majority of stories that get told. Misbehaviour I look at as a really entertaining story but it also has a strong female voice that I love and it isn\u2019t told like a two-hour civics lesson. It\u2019s just honest and powerful and it makes a dad of three daughters feel good.\u201d Will he show them the movie? \u201cOh my gosh, yes. The oldest one wants to take it to show at her school. In general, they are not particularly keen on watching anything that wasn\u2019t made in the last four-to-seven minutes. For them, if a song didn\u2019t drop in the last 15 hours, then it\u2019s old.\u201d I have to point out, though, that he said \u201cdrop\u201d rather than \u201ccome out.\u201d \u201cHow about that? They\u2019re gonna be so proud of me. That\u2019s the most contemporary term I\u2019ve used in the past seven years.\u201d The air of the bumbling dad is endearing. \u201cI don\u2019t do any social media and they are always telling me I don\u2019t have much of an online footprint. They\u2019re just used to me being a goofball.\u201d To the rest of the world, he\u2019s Mr Nice. \u201cI know the Nice Guy thing,\u201d he sighs. \u201c\u2018Good old Greggy Kinnear!\u2019 As an actor, you can\u2019t avoid who you are. You can\u2019t get out of the way of your own persona. Jack Nicholson told me he thought 85% of who you are as an actor is just who you are, and the other 15% is what you can dial in and out.

In this sprightly and enthralling book, James Shapiro argues persuasively that 19th-century American textbooks, such as <em>McGuffey\u2019s Reader</em> (1836), which had sold more than 120m copies by the first world war, and <em>Scott\u2019s Lessons in Elocution</em>, played a major role in the process of domestication, for they excerpted many of the most celebrated speeches from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/30/war-migration-revenge-shakespeare-world-syrian-refugee-camps\" title=\"\">Shakespeare\u2019s plays.</a> Reassuringly, it also helped that the language of Shakespeare resembled the familiar cadences of the King James Version of the Bible, published in 1611.</p> <p>Regardless of the most obviously transgressive elements in Shakespeare \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/13/classics.artsfeatures\" title=\"\"> interracial marriage in <em>Othello</em>;</a> themes of incest and suicide<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/06/theatre.rsc\" title=\"\"> in <em>Hamlet</em></a>; crossdressing and gender instability in the comedies \u2013 the playwright was firmly incorporated as a defining element within America\u2019s own heritage.

An earlier president, John Quincy Adams, had become fixated on Desdemona \u2013 a white woman with an unseemly lust for a black man \u2013 as the real cause of Othello\u2019s misfortunes.

This is the south-eastern tip of Belarus, home to sleepy villages steeped in tradition, where people hang their Christmas trees upside-down from the ceiling and eat raw pig fat as an afternoon snack.</p> \n<p>It is also part of Polesia, Europe\u2019s largest wilderness. More than two-thirds the size of the UK (18m hectares) and spread across Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, in spring this brittle landscape blooms into a labyrinth of gigantic bogs and swamps that supports large populations of wolves, bison, lynx and 1.5 million migratory birds.

Between 1955 and 1965, the river initially flooded in the first week of March but now it happens 16 days earlier. Fish are spawning between five and six days earlier. Winter floods are also becoming more frequent, with less flooding in spring, causing large areas of floodplain meadows, marshes, old lakes, wet oak and black alder forests to dry out.</p> \n<p>Normally in January everything is frozen, but the last January snow fell in 2014, according to Vasil Blotski, who lives in the village of Verasnica with his wife Anastasia Blotskaja, head of Zhytkavichy APB-BirdLife Belarus branch.

      "bodyText": "On the banks of the Pripyat River lies a forest. On a crisp winter afternoon with an expansive blue sky above and hardened snow underfoot, the area is criss-crossed with the tracks of hares, deer and wolves. This is the south-eastern tip of Belarus, home to sleepy villages steeped in tradition, where people hang their Christmas trees upside-down from the ceiling and eat raw pig fat as an afternoon snack. It is also part of Polesia, Europe\u2019s largest wilderness. More than two-thirds the size of the UK (18m hectares) and spread across Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, in spring this brittle landscape blooms into a labyrinth of gigantic bogs and swamps that supports large populations of wolves, bison, lynx and 1.5 million migratory birds. It has been called \u201cthe Amazon of Europe\u201d for its extraordinary biodiversity. However, unlike its Brazilian cousin, this region is not best-known for its wildlife but something more sinister. In April 1986 this forgotten part of the Soviet Union made headlines after reactor 4 of the Chernobyl power plant blew up. The explosion cast a long shadow over Belarus, which absorbed 70% of the escaped radiation, making it one of the most contaminated places on Earth. Now another catastrophe could be about to befall its people: the construction of the E40 waterway, a 2,000km (1,240-mile) inland shipping route linking the Black Sea and the Baltic that would slice through the wilderness and involve dredging inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Experts say this will destroy vast ecosystems and stir up radioactive sludge that accumulated on the bottom of the river following the explosion, potentially contaminating the drinking water of millions of people. Dredging is due to start in the coming months following what campaigners have called a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d feasibility study that failed to consider the potentially catastrophic loss of biodiversity, radioactive contamination of drinking water, or loss of carbon from draining wetlands. \u201cWe call E40 the death of Polesia. It would completely kill the south of the country,\u201d says Alexandre Vintchevski, founder of APB-BirdLife Belarus, the country\u2019s largest wildlife NGO. \u201cVery few people know we have our own mini Amazon in Europe which is threatened by the construction of a waterway that no one has heard of.\u201d Linking the Black and Baltic seas The ambition to link the Black and Baltic seas dates back thousands of years. The ancient Greeks knew about this region and thought it must have been a sea because there was so much water, while Vikings paddled through Polesia\u2019s rivers during repeated attacks on Constantinople. Small vessels can already pass through regulated stretches of the route but the rivers would need to be significantly broadened, with dams and dykes built and meanders cut off to allow ships at least 80 metres long to pass. The water will need to be at least 2.5 metres deep along the whole route. Up to seven million tonnes of cargo (mainly oil, fertilisers and wood) would pass through each year. The E40 would stretch from Gdansk in Poland to Kherson in Ukraine, impacting five rivers en route: the Vistula, the Bug, the Pina, the Pripyat and the Dnieper, according to the feasibility study led by the Maritime Institute in Gdansk. At its closest it would pass only 2.5km from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, potentially contaminating a reservoir downstream that provides water for 2.8 million people in Kyiv. The E40 project is being pushed by a coalition of organisations and government ministries from Belarus, Poland and Ukraine, which is being led by the the Dnieper-Bug Republican Unitary Maintenance and Construction Enterprise. A coalition of wildlife organisations led by APB-BirdLife Belarus, Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) and the National Ecological Centre of Ukraine is trying to stop the E40 going ahead. One of Europe\u2019s least spoilt waterways The Pripyat river is one of the least spoilt waterways in Europe and is an integral part of the biodiversity of Polesia. More than 90% of all birds in Belarus are found in Polesia (which comprises the southern third of the country) and there are a number of unique ecosystems, including floodplain oak groves and black alder forests. The waterway will have a direct impact on 12 internationally important wildlife reserves that protect a number of rare species. BirdLife estimates that three-quarters of the world\u2019s aquatic warblers are threatened by the construction of E40. The Mid Pripyat Reserve covers 120km of the river and is designed to protect the largest area of natural river floodplain in Europe. Along this stretch alone, 182 bird species have been recorded, many of which are rapidly losing habitats elsewhere. One town within the reserve, Turov, has stood on the site for 1,000 years. The name is believed to originate from tur, the Slavic word for the aurochs, an ancestor of the cow which once would have been common here. These towns are the \u201cbloodlands\u201d of Europe where some of the worst crimes of the 20th century took place, including early Nazi pogroms. In Turov, 500 Jewish people were executed by the Nazis. Today it is home to about 3,000 people, has an ageing population and limited opportunities for the young. Like many towns in Belarus, it has kept Lenin-related street names, statues of Lenin and Soviet murals. It is also one of Europe\u2019s most important sites for migratory birds, and just outside the town is a 144-hectare meadow managed by APB-BirdLife Belarus. Over winter it looks like a large, unremarkable field where cattle are grazing. Networks of shrew tunnels and packs of stray dogs looking for trouble are the main signs of life. Volunteers regularly cut the scrub because wading birds like low grass as it allows nesting females to have a better view of potential danger. In spring, the grassy island comes to life as it is swallowed up by the Pripyat. Globally threatened birds such as lesser white-fronted geese and black-tailed godwits flock here. More than 30 species of birds nest on Turov meadow, including half a million ruff, which have extraordinary mating rituals with some males disguising themselves as females to improve their chances of finding a partner. It has the highest breeding densities of northern lapwing and redshank in the world. There\u2019s an annual party in the village to celebrate the arrival of spring migrants and Vintchevski says international birders are also starting to show an interest in the region. Four hours\u2019 drive downriver is the 190,000-hectare Pripyat National Park, nestled between the rivers Pripyat, Stviga and Ubort. It is visited by 256 bird species and contains rare alluvial oak forests unique to eastern Europe. The spring floods spread nutrients over the forest floor, making it particularly fertile. In winter the woods are still, but tracks in the snow show they are home to hares, wild boar and deer. It is completely silent except for the shrieks of siskin in the canopy. Dr Helen Byron, the Save Polesia campaign coordinator at the FZS, explains that in spring the Pripyat floods in a similar way to the Amazon. \u201cThe rivers, the meanders and the marshes are all similar to those found in the Amazon. Its size and importance as a stopover for a large number of birds is widely unknown. There are no other places in Europe where creatures can have so much space, and yet because it was behind the iron curtain people just don\u2019t know about it,\u201d she says. Climate change has already had an impact on the flooding, which means Polesia is becoming an increasingly fragile environment. Between 1955 and 1965, the river initially flooded in the first week of March but now it happens 16 days earlier. Fish are spawning between five and six days earlier. Winter floods are also becoming more frequent, with less flooding in spring, causing large areas of floodplain meadows, marshes, old lakes, wet oak and black alder forests to dry out. Normally in January everything is frozen, but the last January snow fell in 2014, according to Vasil Blotski, who lives in the village of Verasnica with his wife Anastasia Blotskaja, head of Zhytkavichy APB-BirdLife Belarus branch. For Blotski, the river is a good place to take his two children fishing (they once caught a two-metre long catfish). He points out marks on the reeds that show the water level is more than two metres lower than it should be for this time of year. Today he\u2019s caught a small perch, bream and roach in the space of 15 minutes which he\u2019ll cook for supper. He passes around chocolates and raw pig fat as he guts the fish. An eagle owl can be heard hooting in the background. \u201cI\u2019m worried that my children will no longer be able to enjoy this,\u201d he says. \u201cThe beauty of this local nature reserve is that it\u2019s unspoilt. It would be absolutely terrible if the E40 went ahead as I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to lose this river and it will just become a channel for ships.\u201d In addition to implications for Polesia, these wetlands are an important carbon sink, with 2,000 square kilometres of valuable carbon-sequestering peatland. According to FZS, if 50% of peatlands in Polesia turned to forest and 50% to grassland, it would release the same amount of carbon dioxide as one to two million extra cars on UK roads every year. The effects of radiation Further downstream, the Pripyat glides into the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Despite being the \u201cworst nuclear disaster in history\u201d, the official death toll is 54. Researchers believe the actual number could be as high as 200,000. Sizeable amounts of radioactive contamination fell far from the exclusion zone and thousands of deaths have not been properly investigated. Polesia experienced a spike in cancers and birth defects following the disaster \u2013 the \u201cBelarusian necklace\u201d refers to the horizontal scar after surgery for thyroid cancer. Some estimates suggest one in five people in Belarus still live on contaminated land. Poor people have the greatest exposure to radiation because they eat locally sourced food such as wild mushrooms, berries and milk. However, for many people life carries on as normal. \u201cBecause radiation is invisible no one was scared of it. I went to the 1 May parades after the explosion and had no idea it had happened. We still have very little information \u2013 the only bits I get are from the TV,\u201d says Siarhei Stasienok, 65, a retired policeman who lives with his sister Tatiana, 64, in Kalinichy, just outside the exclusion zone. \u201cI was happy with Chernobyl and it would have been nice if it had exploded 10 or 20 years earlier. Everything was polluted after the explosion and money was put into the village to get better roads and clean water. We got new fences and there was generally a lot of investment in the village.\u201d Stasienok has a 3D portrait of Lenin on the outside his house. Inside, doilies cover the windows and an old-fashioned rotary dial telephone sits on the windowsill. There is still no running water. Before Chernobyl there were 100 people living in Kalinichy, now there are 10. \u201cPeople have been dying in this village but not until a few years after the explosion. We don\u2019t know if they were killed by the radiation because doctors are not allowed to officially put cancer on death certificates,\u201d he says. When someone dies their house is destroyed to prevent others moving in. Stasienok had heard about the E40 plans but didn\u2019t know much more than that. \u201cI only believe things I can see,\u201d he says. Down the road from Stasienok\u2019s house is the village of Smalehau, which had such high levels of radiation the entire place was wrapped in plastic and buried. Only the road down the middle and the graveyard at one end remain. Former residents are only allowed to return in a coffin. Soviet experts have long maintained there is no need to further study the effects of radiation in this area, but many international scientists say we still know very little about it. Prof Wladimir Wertelecki, of the University of South Alabama, who has been studying birth defects in northern Polesia since 2000, says: \u201cIt is fundamental to study the rivers. Nothing is known without that. Dredging will stir up nucleoids that have been concentrated in the silt for decades. Radiation is not only airborne, rainborne and windborne but also waterborne.\u201d Kate Brown, a specialist in nuclear history from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of Manual for Survival: A Chernobyl Guide to the Future, describes Polesia as a \u201clayered toxic landscape\u201d. She agrees there are likely to be high levels of radiation at the bottom of the river. \u201cPart of the reason radioactivity in that region keeps getting suspended is because it\u2019s a floody, swampy terrain. That was a wonderful ecological system in the past because it fertilised the pasture every year. Now what it does is that it re-suspends radioactivity in the soils,\u201d she says. The International Atomic Energy Agency has recommended that the Kyiv reservoir remains undisturbed. Brown adds: \u201cThe zone of exclusion should stay a zone of exclusion as it was designed. We have such impatience; these are long-lived contaminants, but we want everything to decay on a normal biological timescale.\u201d What next? Despite these concerns, discussions around E40 have been going on since 2013 and are now gaining momentum. Ukrainian and Belarusian government officials have agreed to start dredging the Dnieper and Pripyat rivers. Speaking at a press conference in Minsk last September, the Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the Dnieper-Pripyat waterway could become an important part of the E40, which would essentially give Belarus access to the Black Sea. In Kyiv in the same month, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk, said the project was \u201cabsolutely real\u201d and ready to be implemented. Ten million UAH (\u00a3315,000) has been allocated to dredge 64.5km of the Pripyat river in Ukraine, according to the minister of infrastructure, Vladislav Krikli. Official documents suggest the Polish government has requested investment through China\u2019s \u201cbelt and road\u201d initiative, although it is not known if it has been granted. The waterway will have a direct impact on more than 70 wildlife reserves. In Poland, the waterway will pass through Natura 2000 sites, which are protected under EU law. As a result, the feasibility study suggests a canal should be built adjacent to the river Bug; this is the most expensive part of the project. However, such attempts at mitigation are not afforded to reserves in Belarus and Ukraine. \u201cFor me the E40 project is similar to a project on turning northern rivers to southern deserts: dividends to a small group of developers and builders and irreversible consequences for the wildlife in Polesia will take place. Some of the local inhabitants will get jobs at the E40 but most will suffer from the artificial changes in the region\u2019s ecosystems,\u201d says Vintchevski. The EU provided \u20ac500,000 sponsorship for the 2015 feasibility study but refused to finance the project further due to concerns about mounting economic, social and environmental costs. Matti Maasikas, head of the EU delegation to Ukraine, wrote a damning report published in September 2019 saying the project violated both national legislation and international treaties. Maasikas said the waterway would have \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for ecosystems in all three countries and would result in a \u201ccritical loss of biodiversity\u201d. Economically, he said, the project (with an estimated cost of more than \u20ac12bn) was \u201cunsound\u201d and posed a serious threat of secondary radioactive pollution. He also criticised the feasibility study for ignoring the issue of climate change, which makes the construction of new waterways \u201cunjustified and uneconomical\u201d, especially given the E40 would need to be at least 2.5 metres deep along its entire route. Without EU financing Poland, Ukraine and Belarus are now looking to implement the project in individual sections. Maasikas raised concerns that fragments of E40 infrastructure were being developed \u201cas if the project was already approved by all interested parties and supported by the public\u201d. When APB-BirdLife conservationists requested a meeting with the Belarusian ministry of transport and communications to discuss the environmental implications of the E40, deputy minister Natalia Alexandrovich said there was nothing to discuss because no decisions had been made. Przemys\u0142aw Daca, the head of the Polish State Water Enterprise, says that the E40 would be a \u201cpro-environment\u201d development. \u201cWaterborne transport is environmentally friendly, reduces CO2 emissions and other gases and particulates in the air. It also reduces noise emissions, the number of vehicles on roads and thus the number of road accidents.\u201d Ministers in Ukraine and Belarus declined the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. Ivan Shchadranok, director of a sustainable development NGO Interakcia Foundation, which lobbied for the E40 at the start of the project, acknowledged that there has not been an adequate survey of the environmental implications of the project. However, he highlighted that the feasibility study found the impact of the waterway would not be as dramatic as some environment NGOs seem to think. \u201cAs a member of the cross-border commission I always tried to involve environmentalists in the creation of the feasibility study \u2026 Environmentalists are against such a study as they consider it as the first step to approval of the E40 restoration. So the situation is quite complicated,\u201d he says. Shchadranok believes there should be scientific research on the waterway before dredging starts but he thinks this is unlikely and environmental issues will continue to be overlooked. \u201cWithout a highly credible and accurate environmental assessment in place, environmental supporters have no leverage over those who are moving the E40 project forward now.\u201d Shchadranok says the issue of radioactive contamination is considered \u201cquite serious by some water experts\u201d but that he does not have the expertise to comment further. Researchers from FZS are now rushing to help officials in Belarus and Ukraine have Polesia declared a Unesco world heritage site on account of its biodiversity. They believe it is in the same league as Yellowstone or Serengeti national parks. \u201cNobody cared about protecting the Pripyat until someone outside the country said it was important,\u201d says Vintchevski, who is working with FZS to get the project stopped. \u201cWe have been living next to something extraordinary without even noticing.

      "body": "<p>Regulars at the <a href=\"http://www.brudenellsocialclub.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Brudenell Social Club</a> in Leeds have all sorts of favourite memories of the venue. For some, it is the night Thee Oh Sees played in the games room and had people dancing on the pool tables. For Lyndsay \u201cLins\u201d Wilson \u2013 who used to live opposite and wheeled her amplifier over to play in bands such as Grammatics and Mother Vulpine \u2013 it is the time that the Israeli punks Monotonix \u201cset fire to the drum kit, wrapped the drummer up in a rug and carried him outside on a stool while the audience formed a conga line around the car park\u201d. Licensee and promoter Nathan Clark laughs as he recalls how a cab driver once got onstage during a gig and grabbed the microphone to yell: \u201cTaxi for Cooper!\u201d</p> <p>The 107-year old venue encourages colourful things to happen. To walk through the old wooden doors of this innocuous looking concrete building is to enter a Tardis. It reveals two 400-capacity live rooms (one an amphitheatre shape, the second \u2013 square \u2013 added recently), a games room laden with historic plaques of former club presidents and a bustling bar that reflects its origins as a working men\u2019s club. Johnny Marr calls it a \u201cspecial place\u201d. Evening drinker Martin Trippet, 59, who has been coming here for 20 years, describes the \u201cBrude\u201d as \u201cthe best local in the world. Where else can you come for a few pints after work, and walk into another room and see Sebadoh?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f909f6e30ec8a7d9c7c5d987206536a51efb9db3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f909f6e30ec8a7d9c7c5d987206536a51efb9db3/0_0_5718_3397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Clark, owner of the Brudenell Social Club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"594\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Clark, owner of the Brudenell Social Club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grassroots venues such as this are the lifeblood of UK music, connecting established names with audiences and nurturing talent. Everyone from Franz Ferdinand to Grimes has played the Brude on the way up. And yet, these venues are under threat. In the past decade, 35% have been lost, which Arts Council music director, Clair Mera-Nelson, puts down to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of issues such as the smoking ban, increases in parking charges, poor transport links, rocketing rent and rates, and changes to alcohol consumption, which for some venues \u201ccan be the final nail in the coffin\u201d. The <a href=\"https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/project-grants-supporting-grassroots-live-music\" title=\"\">Arts Council has launched a \u00a31.5m scheme</a> to support the sector, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/27/small-music-venues-to-get-50-reduction-in-business-rates\" title=\"\">the government has announced it will cut venues\u2019 business rates by 50%</a>. This will save each venue an average of \u00a37,500 a year, which \u201ccould be the difference between staying open and closing\u201d for some, says the Brudenell\u2019s Clark.</p> <p>In mid-February, I spend a few days watching the comings and goings at the Brudenell. It is a in a stronger position than many. It is a nonprofit enterprise, with any surplus cash reinvested into such things as the topnotch sound system. Crucially, the club owns the building and land so \u201cthere\u2019s no rent and no nasty landlord\u201d, says Clark.

She has played the Brude 34 times in bands such as Esper Scout and Fig By Four. She has met friends and partners here and was approached to form the indie-folk act Crake when she was here playing Flaming Lips songs wearing a bear costume. \u201cThere\u2019s something very community-spirited about the hybrid of 18-year-old students and 70-year-old people who\u2019ve never left Leeds,\u201d she says, sitting in the snug area by the games room. \u201cIt\u2019s a comfortable place to be for a lot of diverse people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e35c830cfdbc158b6692cae77e2a1c6f4b7bcd83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e35c830cfdbc158b6692cae77e2a1c6f4b7bcd83/0_0_5760_3728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musician Sarah Statham, who has played the Brudenell 34 times.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musician Sarah Statham, who has played the Brudenell 34 times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clark sees his venue as \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d a community hub, and staff and punters alike make unusually personal connections with the place.

      "bodyText": "Regulars at the Brudenell Social Club in Leeds have all sorts of favourite memories of the venue. For some, it is the night Thee Oh Sees played in the games room and had people dancing on the pool tables. For Lyndsay \u201cLins\u201d Wilson \u2013 who used to live opposite and wheeled her amplifier over to play in bands such as Grammatics and Mother Vulpine \u2013 it is the time that the Israeli punks Monotonix \u201cset fire to the drum kit, wrapped the drummer up in a rug and carried him outside on a stool while the audience formed a conga line around the car park\u201d. Licensee and promoter Nathan Clark laughs as he recalls how a cab driver once got onstage during a gig and grabbed the microphone to yell: \u201cTaxi for Cooper!\u201d The 107-year old venue encourages colourful things to happen. To walk through the old wooden doors of this innocuous looking concrete building is to enter a Tardis. It reveals two 400-capacity live rooms (one an amphitheatre shape, the second \u2013 square \u2013 added recently), a games room laden with historic plaques of former club presidents and a bustling bar that reflects its origins as a working men\u2019s club. Johnny Marr calls it a \u201cspecial place\u201d. Evening drinker Martin Trippet, 59, who has been coming here for 20 years, describes the \u201cBrude\u201d as \u201cthe best local in the world. Where else can you come for a few pints after work, and walk into another room and see Sebadoh?\u201d Grassroots venues such as this are the lifeblood of UK music, connecting established names with audiences and nurturing talent. Everyone from Franz Ferdinand to Grimes has played the Brude on the way up. And yet, these venues are under threat. In the past decade, 35% have been lost, which Arts Council music director, Clair Mera-Nelson, puts down to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of issues such as the smoking ban, increases in parking charges, poor transport links, rocketing rent and rates, and changes to alcohol consumption, which for some venues \u201ccan be the final nail in the coffin\u201d. The Arts Council has launched a \u00a31.5m scheme to support the sector, while the government has announced it will cut venues\u2019 business rates by 50%. This will save each venue an average of \u00a37,500 a year, which \u201ccould be the difference between staying open and closing\u201d for some, says the Brudenell\u2019s Clark. In mid-February, I spend a few days watching the comings and goings at the Brudenell. It is a in a stronger position than many. It is a nonprofit enterprise, with any surplus cash reinvested into such things as the topnotch sound system. Crucially, the club owns the building and land so \u201cthere\u2019s no rent and no nasty landlord\u201d, says Clark. Its LS6 location \u2013 a bus ride from the city centre \u2013 means it avoids higher rates and lies in an area densely populated with students and young people. \u201cThe Brudenell\u2019s part of the reason I moved to Leeds,\u201d says Sarah Statham, 32, who has never lived more than a 10-minute walk away since relocating from Manchester in 2007. She has played the Brude 34 times in bands such as Esper Scout and Fig By Four.

He mentions a recent incident when a regular texted him from the bar on a Saturday to complain about a new slimline tonic. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, we won\u2019t buy that one again,\u2019\u201d he chuckles. \u201cWhat other place could people message like that and know that they\u2019re being listened to?\u201d Few modern venues have a licensee who also promotes.

Coronavirus could knock $211bn off Asia-Pacific economies A fast spreading coronavirus outbreak could knock $211 billion off the combined economies of the Asia-Pacific, with Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia among the most exposed, S&amp;P Global Ratings said on Friday. S&amp;P cut its 2020 growth forecast for China to 4.8% from previous estimate of 5.7%. On Thursday the Dow Jones fell nearly 1,000 points, and markets in Europe are expected to react badly on opening. Europe toll mounts Italy death toll from the outbreak has risen to 148, with 3,858 infections. The French president Emmanuel Macron has said a coronavirus epidemic is \u201cinevitable\u201d in France. There are 423 infections and seven people have died. The UK announced its first death from the virus as confirmed cases rise past 115.",

Authorities are under pressure to bring to justice the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, after a UK judge found that he orchestrated the abduction of two of his daughters, including one from the streets of Cambridge. The Guardian can reveal the ruling after months of legal action, laying open a family saga spanning 20 years during which the sheikh, 70, organised international kidnappings, imprisoned both Princess Shamsa and another daughter, Princess Latifa, and \u201cdeprived [them] of their liberty\u201d. The sheikh\u2019s actions emerged after his sixth and youngest wife, Princess Haya, 45, fled to London in April 2019 with their two young children. His attempt to return the children to Dubai triggered a legal action in the family courts. The court judgment naming the sheikh, who is a friend of the Queen and one of the UK\u2019s most important horse-racing figures, risks destabilising diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates, a close Gulf ally. The sheikh has denied all allegations against him. * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 After the UK recorded its first death from coronavirus, in the US Donald Trump has admitted there \u201cmight\u201d be an impact on the economy but said it would pass.

A diplomatic row has erupted after Japan said it would quarantine all passengers arriving from South Korea \u2013 measures that Seoul branded \u201cunreasonable, excessive and extremely regrettable\u201d. China announced 143 new cases on Friday and 30 new deaths, while Italy\u2019s death toll has risen to 148 with 3,858 infections.

In the first, entitled Covid-19: where in the body does it infect us?, Ian Sample investigates how the virus takes hold and what difference this makes to disease severity and transmissibility. * * * Shaky ceasefire in Syria \u2013 The presidents of Russia and Turkey have declared a ceasefire, which came into force overnight. Escalating fighting in north-western Syria had threatened to put forces from the two countries into direct conflict. At the same time the Turkish military has said it killed 21 Syrian troops after two Turkish soldiers were killed in Idlib earlier. Turkey and Russia are on rival sides.

Lunchtime read: Expect the worst Threats to humanity, and how we address them, define our time. Why are we still so complacent about facing up to existential risk? \u201cIn science fiction, we sometimes encounter the idea of a pandemic so severe that it could cause the end of civilisation, or even of humanity itself,\u201d writes Toby Ord. \u201cSuch a risk to humanity\u2019s entire future is known as an existential risk. We can say with certainty that the novel coronavirus, named Covid-19, does not pose such a risk. But might the next pandemic?\u201d Sport The decision to postpone England\u2019s Six Nations trip to Italy could end up costing the Rugby Football Union a \u00a35m jackpot, with the tournament organisers on Thursday scrambling to save the championship. Wayne Rooney\u2019s Manchester United reunion was ruined by Odion Ighalo, who scored twice in a 3-0 FA Cup win over Derby, although the former United player still served up flashes of his glorious past. Any ambition Phil Neville\u2019s Lionesses had of asserting their claim to be the biggest rivals to four-time world champions the US took a heavy bruising as they slumped to a 2-0 defeat in their SheBelieves Cup opener. The FA has opened an investigation and contacted Eric Dier for his observations after the Tottenham player went into the stands and confronted a supporter. Rory McIlroy shot a 66, with his caddy calling a bunker shot his \u201cbest of the season\u201d, and finished the first day of the Arnold Palmer Invitational one behind America\u2019s Matt Every. England captain Heather Knight has called for the rules to be changed after England\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup campaign ended without a ball being bowled. Andy Murray remains hopeful of making his comeback at the Miami Open later this month. The FIA has said it could not conclusively prove Ferrari\u2019s engine had been operating outside the rules in 2019. And Hend Zaza, an 11-year-old Syrian table tennis player, is set to become the youngest athlete at this year\u2019s Olympics. Business The Bank of England has drawn up a plan to tackle the coronavirus amid a warning from Goldman Sachs that it could tip Britain into recession. Another rough day is expected on the stock markets after heavy losses on Thursday were followed up with more of the same in Asia overnight. The Nikkei in Tokyo has fallen 3% to a six-month low and the FTSE100 is seen losing 2% at the opening bell. The pound is buying $1.295 and \u20ac1.152. The papers Few of the papers depart from the first UK death of a coronavirus patient as their lead story, and splash headlines are constructed accordingly, including on our own front page. The Times, Express, Metro, Sun, Mirror and the i follow suit. There is a great deal of commonality, too, in the use of pictures of the Sussexes resurfacing at the Endeavour Fund Awards in London. The Times calls it a \u201clast lap\u201d in their royal duties, the Express manages \u201cMeghan an entrance\u201d, the Metro has \u201cI only have eyes for blue\u201d, picking up on the colour of the Duchess\u2019s dress, and the Sun calls it \u201cMarkle sparkle\u201d. Mileage is made too from our hard-won right to report on the court ruling concerning Dubai\u2019s ruler: \u201cCalls for sheikh to face justice over family abduction\u201d is the Guardian\u2019s front-page picture story. The Mail has the headline \u201cScandal of princess abducted from UK\u201d which is confusingly positioned next to a picture of Meghan Markle. The Telegraph adds to the Queen\u2019s woes this year with a picture of her next to Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai \u2013 its splash though is \u201cPatients told to stay home if they get \u2018mild\u2019 virus\u201d. The FT has \u201cUS hits out over export barriers to coronavirus medical supplies\u201d as countries including Germany, Turkey and Russia move to \u201choard\u201d stocks for themselves.

On Thursday evening McKenzie revealed she had not made \u201cany changes or annotations\u201d to the 4 April brief approving the third round of sports grants \u2013 raising the question of who changed the material before it was sent to Sport Australia on 11 April, and whether the changes had proper legal authority. Morrison declined to take questions on the sports grants issue at a press conference on Friday. He said he was there to talk about the latest developments on the coronavirus, including a new funding agreement with the states to provide additional health care. \u201cI\u2019m dealing with coronavirus,\u201d the prime minister said. Speaking on the Gold Coast, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said McKenzie\u2019s statement, which was uploaded to her website after federal parliament had risen for the fortnight, contradicted the prime minister\u2019s account that \u201cit was minister McKenzie who made all the decisions\u201d.

You can\u2019t have taxpayer funds being allocated, and changed, and swapped around without knowing who was making those decisions.\u201d Morrison has sought to distance both himself and his office from the controversy, insisting that McKenzie was the sole decision maker and characterising the role of his office as passing on information \u201cbased on\u201d representations from MPs. The Australian National Audit Office told Senate estimates this week the prime minister\u2019s office had requested a last-minute change before the documents were sent to Sports Australia at 8.46am on 11 April, which was the day parliament was prorogued for the 2019 election. But another set of changes were made later that day. Constitutional law expert Anne Twomey told Guardian Australia on Friday that McKenzie\u2019s revelation raised the prospect that somebody else made late changes to grants without legal authority. Twomey, who believes the sports grants are unconstitutional and that McKenzie lacked legal authority to make them, said the latest revelation was \u201cbizarre\u201d because it was not clear who made the changes, if not McKenzie. Twomey told Guardian Australia that even if McKenzie had legal authority, \u201c[if] the minister wasn\u2019t actually making the decision about which of those grants were approved because she made her decision on 4 April and somebody else \u2013 whether it be people in her office or whatever \u2013 made changes, that would be problematic from a legal point of view. \u201cIf you accept the commonwealth\u2019s view that the minister is the decision-maker, either the minister\u2019s staff as her agents made decisions to approve things after [4 April], which means she made that decision \u2026 [or] if they are asserting someone else made the decision, and that it wasn\u2019t legally her decision because they were not her agents, then these actions have been taken unlawfully.\u201d Twomey said McKenzie\u2019s claims she did not make the changes showed the \u201cenormous dysfunction\u201d of the way the government had handled sports and other grants. She renewed her calls for the government to explain the basis of its claim McKenzie had authority to approve the grants. Albanese noted that McKenzie and Phil Gaetjens, the head of Morrison\u2019s department who investigated a breach of ministerial standards in relation to the program, a process that ultimately lead to McKenzie\u2019s resignation, are due to appear before a Senate inquiry into the sports grants. \u201cWe actually just need some straight answers about this scandal,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWhat we know is \u2026 hardworking volunteers would have spent hundreds of hours of time filling out application forms, thinking there was a level playing field, when in fact, the fix was in. \u201cIt\u2019s taxpayers\u2019 funds.

Traditionally you\u2019d look to the country for oak, applied with varying degrees of finesse, or, more recently, for wines that were big, powerful and not shy with the alcohol. But, as a recent event in London aimed to show, Spanish wine has become so much more varied and, yes, elegant in the past decade or so. As the name of the event, Vi\u00f1ateros (which is the Spanish for vigneron or winegrower), meant to suggest, this is a development led by small producers, often working in out-of-the-way places and with long-neglected vineyards, such as those found in the Gredos mountains near Madrid.

But Gredos most certainly doesn\u2019t have the monopoly on haunting reds. In the northwest of the country, the menc\u00eda variety is responsible for some wonderfully evocative wines.

There was elegance, too, from the margins of Spain\u2019s most famous region, Rioja, not least in the fabulously silky, pure-fruited, quietly powerful Bodega Lanzaga 2014 (\u00a319.35, <a href=\"https://www.winebuyers.com/\">Wine Buyers</a>) from one of the original leading lights of modern Spanish wine, Telmo Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <p><strong>Batlliu de Sort Finca de Borda Blanc, Costers del Segre, Spain 2016 (\u00a318.82, <a href=\"https://www.lescaves.co.uk/lescaves-welcome\">Les Caves</a>)</strong> One of the pleasures of the new, cool Spanish wine is how individualistic the wines are \u2013 which is, perhaps, what happens when you have vi\u00f1ateros who are really committed to making wines that reflect where they come from.

      "body": "<p>The looming arrival of a new disease as it spreads across international borders is, naturally, a source of some anxiety.

      "body": "<p>The Democratic party primary season is a rancorous, high-stakes affair that divides families and ruptures friendships. This year\u2019s campaign has the unhappy distinction of severing one of the most longstanding alliances in hip-hop.</p> <p>When Public Enemy founder and frontman Carlton Ridenhour, AKA Chuck D, announced that the group would play a rally for Bernie Sanders in Los Angeles last Sunday, the lawyer of his livewire sidekick William Drayton, AKA Flavor Flav, sent a letter of complaint: \u201cThe Public Enemy Movement cannot allow its cultural identity, likeness and life\u2019s work to be misappropriated by political operatives in support of a fictional revolution.\u201d Perhaps unwisely, he quoted one of Chuck\u2019s most indelible lyrics: \u201cDon\u2019t believe the hype!\u201d</p> <p>Flavor\u2019s position in the band had survived not only a $2,600-a-day crack habit but also four seasons of the dating show Flavor of Love. However, this was the last straw. Chuck promptly sacked his old friend. \u201cAre you kidding me right now??? ... over Bernie Sanders??? You wanna destroy something we\u2019ve built over 35 years OVER POLITICS???\u201d, Flavor tweeted, as if POLITICS were a ridiculous distraction from the core business of the group behind Fight the Power and Rebel Without a Pause.</p> <p>Chuck clarified that \u201cit\u2019s not about Bernie with Flav \u2026 he don\u2019t know the difference between [former NFL player] Barry Sanders or Bernie Sanders.\u201d For Chuck, it was mundane band drama: Flavor doesn\u2019t like performing for free and was already on thin ice, having missed several shows over the past few years, including a charity fundraiser for Harry Belafonte in 2016 (Flavor reportedly chose to judge a bikini contest instead); in 2017, he sued Chuck, alleging unpaid royalties (the suit was dismissed). The Sanders rally appearance was actually billed as Public Enemy Radio, the Flavorless incarnation that Chuck launched \u201cto get away from this ridiculousness\u201d. It seems that Flavor\u2019s unreliability, rather than his overwhelming affection for Joe Biden, was the last straw.</p> <p>Bands are inherently unstable coalitions. Cram a group of young people into a tour bus for a few weeks, add booze and sleep deprivation, and watch the cracks start to form. Throw in some combination of musical differences, commercial pressure, media scrutiny and clashing egos, and it\u2019s a miracle that any band lasts longer than a couple of albums. Band dynamics are as hard to fathom as other people\u2019s marriages, which is why our cultural obsession with splits and reunions goes far beyond music. They are case studies in the forces that bring people together and drive them apart.</p> <p>Chuck has previously described himself and Flav as the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of hip-hop. When he formed Public Enemy in the early 1980s, Chuck was inspired by the Rolling Stones and the Clash, as well as sports teams, to construct a line-up of different personalities, each one with a unique skillset. He has described Flavor, with his comic-strip grin and giant clock medallion, as \u201ca visual character with audio bonuses\u201d: the capering hypeman in a band otherwise defined by stony-faced gravitas. On tracks such as Bring the Noise and Fight the Power, Flavor is halfway between performer and fan, babbling with excitement about what is going on around him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbaf877c6a1d9ebd0be656fd243e6a9770109f35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbaf877c6a1d9ebd0be656fd243e6a9770109f35/0_0_4366_4383/996.jpg\" alt=\"Sister Souljah.\" width=\"996\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sister Souljah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Barboza/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What made Public Enemy great also made them volatile, but when they stumbled into a media firestorm in May 1989, the problem wasn\u2019t Flavor but Richard Griffin, AKA Professor Griff, the group\u2019s forbiddingly stern \u201cminister of information\u201d. As Chuck told the NME: \u201cFlavor is what America would like to see in a black man \u2013 sad to say, but true \u2013 whereas Griff is very much what America would not like to see.\u201d Griff\u2019s antisemitic remarks were already causing unrest when he gave a bombshell interview to the Washington Times in which he blamed Jews for \u201cthe majority of wickedness that goes on across the globe\u201d. The backlash caused an existential crisis for Public Enemy, with Chuck forced to choose between reputation and unity. The controversy almost broke them before Chuck steadied the ship, minus Griff.</p> <p>Their next brush with notoriety came out of the blue during the 1992 presidential election campaign. Public Enemy didn\u2019t endorse a candidate (they rarely do, although Chuck later called Obama \u201cthe right man for the job\u201d), but one of the candidates certainly noticed them. Their 1991 single By the Time I Get to Arizona featured a young rapper and activist called Sister Souljah. In May 1992, after the Los Angeles riots, Souljah commented: \u201cIf black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?\u201d The full quote made clear that she was not actually encouraging violence, but Bill Clinton saw an opportunity to distance himself from the radical left by denouncing her as a racist. The practice of a candidate repudiating perceived extremism in their own party in order to appeal to moderates is still known as a \u201cSister Souljah moment\u201d. Chuck compared his experiences with Griff and Souljah to playing paintball: he was prepared to take flak for his own positions, but found himself caught in the crossfire generated by the words of his associates.</p> <p>These were extreme situations. When the media isn\u2019t fired up, it is quite possible for band members with even diametrically opposed political views to coexist. In the Police, for example, Sting was on the left while the drummer, Stewart Copeland, the son of the famously hawkish CIA officer Miles Copeland Jr, was a self-described \u201craving capitalist\u201d. As he cheerfully acknowledged in a round-table debate with Billy Bragg and Paul Weller: \u201cMe and my mate Sting are violently opposed to each other politically \u2013 not a single inch of shared ground.\u201d (To his credit, Copeland agreed to reunite the Police in 1986 for Amnesty International\u2019s Conspiracy of Hope tour, thus helping the victims of some of the regimes that his dad had conspired to bring to power.) But politics didn\u2019t break up the Police, any more than the Spice Girls split over Margaret Thatcher or Slayer over Donald Trump. Bands fracture over musical direction, or money, or infidelity, or just because they need a holiday, but not over who to vote for.</p> <p>A song, however, can bring tensions to a head. In 1985, Joey Ramone, who was Jewish, was outraged by Ronald Reagan\u2019s visit to a military cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany, which housed the graves of members of the Waffen-SS, and wrote the furious protest song Bonzo Goes to Bitburg. This did not go down well with lifelong Republican Johnny Ramone, who insisted that the title was changed to My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t talk about my favourite president like that,\u201d he huffed in his memoir, Commando. \u201cI never wanted the Ramones to be about politics.\u201d Last year, the Who\u2019s Brexit-loving frontman, Roger Daltrey, refused to sing the original lyrics to Street Song, about the Grenfell Tower fire, because: \u201cIt had a lot of political lyrics that kind of pointed fingers,\u201d so Pete Townshend wrote a less accusatory version.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7635a329f1bd93ee5cc9eb2a99732a666f9d63eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7635a329f1bd93ee5cc9eb2a99732a666f9d63eb/0_0_3069_2107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ramones in 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ramones in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The issue is often not specific political positions but how far to take them. With precious few exceptions \u2013 Bragg, Jay-Z, Bono \u2013 musicians don\u2019t have the stomach for the grubby machinations and compromises of serious politics. Most would rather ask questions than commit to solutions; throw their weight behind an issue rather than a candidate. That\u2019s understandable. If the campaign to which you have nailed your flag loses, then it\u2019s embarrassing. John Lennon\u2019s intense phase of political activism ended in a shriek of despair on the night of 7 November 1972, when the Democrat George McGovern lost to Richard Nixon by a historic landslide. If your party wins, on the other hand, then you are tied to their record in government and any subsequent criticism becomes newsworthy. In 1997, Pet Shop Boys\u2019 Neil Tennant was a prominent Labour donor; nine years later, he was writing scathing satirical lyrics about Iraq and ID cards.</p> <p>If it is risky for a single artist to endorse a candidate, and harder still for a band, then it is almost impossible to rally a broad-based coalition. The musicians\u2019 collective Red Wedge may have failed in its mission to elect a Labour government in 1987, but its very existence was an extraordinary achievement, creating an umbrella broad enough to accommodate everyone from lifelong Labour supporters to wary outsiders \u2013 at least for a while. \u201cWhatever misgivings I had about being involved in the Labour party or becoming that partisan were overshadowed by the fact we should get people out thinking about politics and maybe change the way we were going in the country, naive or not,\u201d reflected Weller. \u201cBut I think we were used and it put me off politics. I\u2019m not really one for joining clubs.\u201d</p> <p>That speaks volumes. Musicians, as a whole, are not so much leftwing or rightwing as instinctively libertarian. They want to be free to do what they want to do. It has been argued that the first rock\u2019n\u2019roll protest song was Summertime Blues, in which Eddie Cochran protests to his congressman about his parents and his boss getting in the way of his dating plans. You can draw a line from that to Rage Against the Machine\u2019s more radical version of this primal complaint: \u201cFuck you, I won\u2019t do what you tell me.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, the Grime 4 Corbyn movement stirred up disagreements that would have been familiar to veterans of Red Wedge. \u201cYour main focus is to live with that not existing in your life,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/22/boy-better-know-we-should-have-been-playing-big-festivals-six-years-ago\" title=\"\">Skepta told the Guardian about his refusal to participate</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a say in the country.\u201d When his Corbyn-boosting younger brother JME protested: \u201cYou must have an idea of something that you think is bullshit in the country you live in today and that could change,\u201d Skepta stuck to his ultra-libertarian guns: \u201cEverybody should run theirself.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers\u2019 altercation wasn\u2019t party political; it was about the eternal question of whether there is value in musicians being political at all. In that exchange Skepta was the Flavor to JME\u2019s Chuck, the Keith to his Mick. Many successful bands benefit from the push and pull between one member who believes that music should be a vessel for ideas and activism and one who just wants to give people a good time, the optimal result being music that is simultaneously righteous and fun. \u201cChuck D, he\u2019s the politician of the group,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/03/flavor-flav-bernie-sanders-interview-chuck-d\" title=\"\">Flavor told the Guardian this week</a>. \u201cI\u2019m just the friendly jester.\u201d It\u2019s a shame that after 35 years Public Enemy is no longer able to contain both impulses, but whoever is to blame, it\u2019s not Bernie Sanders. Electoral politics is child\u2019s play compared with band politics.</p>",

Chuck clarified that \u201cit\u2019s not about Bernie with Flav \u2026 he don\u2019t know the difference between [former NFL player] Barry Sanders or Bernie Sanders.\u201d For Chuck, it was mundane band drama: Flavor doesn\u2019t like performing for free and was already on thin ice, having missed several shows over the past few years, including a charity fundraiser for Harry Belafonte in 2016 (Flavor reportedly chose to judge a bikini contest instead); in 2017, he sued Chuck, alleging unpaid royalties (the suit was dismissed). The Sanders rally appearance was actually billed as Public Enemy Radio, the Flavorless incarnation that Chuck launched \u201cto get away from this ridiculousness\u201d. It seems that Flavor\u2019s unreliability, rather than his overwhelming affection for Joe Biden, was the last straw. Bands are inherently unstable coalitions. Cram a group of young people into a tour bus for a few weeks, add booze and sleep deprivation, and watch the cracks start to form. Throw in some combination of musical differences, commercial pressure, media scrutiny and clashing egos, and it\u2019s a miracle that any band lasts longer than a couple of albums. Band dynamics are as hard to fathom as other people\u2019s marriages, which is why our cultural obsession with splits and reunions goes far beyond music. They are case studies in the forces that bring people together and drive them apart. Chuck has previously described himself and Flav as the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of hip-hop. When he formed Public Enemy in the early 1980s, Chuck was inspired by the Rolling Stones and the Clash, as well as sports teams, to construct a line-up of different personalities, each one with a unique skillset. He has described Flavor, with his comic-strip grin and giant clock medallion, as \u201ca visual character with audio bonuses\u201d: the capering hypeman in a band otherwise defined by stony-faced gravitas. On tracks such as Bring the Noise and Fight the Power, Flavor is halfway between performer and fan, babbling with excitement about what is going on around him. What made Public Enemy great also made them volatile, but when they stumbled into a media firestorm in May 1989, the problem wasn\u2019t Flavor but Richard Griffin, AKA Professor Griff, the group\u2019s forbiddingly stern \u201cminister of information\u201d. As Chuck told the NME: \u201cFlavor is what America would like to see in a black man \u2013 sad to say, but true \u2013 whereas Griff is very much what America would not like to see.\u201d Griff\u2019s antisemitic remarks were already causing unrest when he gave a bombshell interview to the Washington Times in which he blamed Jews for \u201cthe majority of wickedness that goes on across the globe\u201d. The backlash caused an existential crisis for Public Enemy, with Chuck forced to choose between reputation and unity. The controversy almost broke them before Chuck steadied the ship, minus Griff. Their next brush with notoriety came out of the blue during the 1992 presidential election campaign. Public Enemy didn\u2019t endorse a candidate (they rarely do, although Chuck later called Obama \u201cthe right man for the job\u201d), but one of the candidates certainly noticed them. Their 1991 single By the Time I Get to Arizona featured a young rapper and activist called Sister Souljah. In May 1992, after the Los Angeles riots, Souljah commented: \u201cIf black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?\u201d The full quote made clear that she was not actually encouraging violence, but Bill Clinton saw an opportunity to distance himself from the radical left by denouncing her as a racist. The practice of a candidate repudiating perceived extremism in their own party in order to appeal to moderates is still known as a \u201cSister Souljah moment\u201d. Chuck compared his experiences with Griff and Souljah to playing paintball: he was prepared to take flak for his own positions, but found himself caught in the crossfire generated by the words of his associates. These were extreme situations. When the media isn\u2019t fired up, it is quite possible for band members with even diametrically opposed political views to coexist. In the Police, for example, Sting was on the left while the drummer, Stewart Copeland, the son of the famously hawkish CIA officer Miles Copeland Jr, was a self-described \u201craving capitalist\u201d. As he cheerfully acknowledged in a round-table debate with Billy Bragg and Paul Weller: \u201cMe and my mate Sting are violently opposed to each other politically \u2013 not a single inch of shared ground.\u201d (To his credit, Copeland agreed to reunite the Police in 1986 for Amnesty International\u2019s Conspiracy of Hope tour, thus helping the victims of some of the regimes that his dad had conspired to bring to power.) But politics didn\u2019t break up the Police, any more than the Spice Girls split over Margaret Thatcher or Slayer over Donald Trump. Bands fracture over musical direction, or money, or infidelity, or just because they need a holiday, but not over who to vote for. A song, however, can bring tensions to a head. In 1985, Joey Ramone, who was Jewish, was outraged by Ronald Reagan\u2019s visit to a military cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany, which housed the graves of members of the Waffen-SS, and wrote the furious protest song Bonzo Goes to Bitburg. This did not go down well with lifelong Republican Johnny Ramone, who insisted that the title was changed to My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t talk about my favourite president like that,\u201d he huffed in his memoir, Commando. \u201cI never wanted the Ramones to be about politics.\u201d Last year, the Who\u2019s Brexit-loving frontman, Roger Daltrey, refused to sing the original lyrics to Street Song, about the Grenfell Tower fire, because: \u201cIt had a lot of political lyrics that kind of pointed fingers,\u201d so Pete Townshend wrote a less accusatory version. The issue is often not specific political positions but how far to take them. With precious few exceptions \u2013 Bragg, Jay-Z, Bono \u2013 musicians don\u2019t have the stomach for the grubby machinations and compromises of serious politics. Most would rather ask questions than commit to solutions; throw their weight behind an issue rather than a candidate. That\u2019s understandable. If the campaign to which you have nailed your flag loses, then it\u2019s embarrassing. John Lennon\u2019s intense phase of political activism ended in a shriek of despair on the night of 7 November 1972, when the Democrat George McGovern lost to Richard Nixon by a historic landslide. If your party wins, on the other hand, then you are tied to their record in government and any subsequent criticism becomes newsworthy. In 1997, Pet Shop Boys\u2019 Neil Tennant was a prominent Labour donor; nine years later, he was writing scathing satirical lyrics about Iraq and ID cards. If it is risky for a single artist to endorse a candidate, and harder still for a band, then it is almost impossible to rally a broad-based coalition. The musicians\u2019 collective Red Wedge may have failed in its mission to elect a Labour government in 1987, but its very existence was an extraordinary achievement, creating an umbrella broad enough to accommodate everyone from lifelong Labour supporters to wary outsiders \u2013 at least for a while. \u201cWhatever misgivings I had about being involved in the Labour party or becoming that partisan were overshadowed by the fact we should get people out thinking about politics and maybe change the way we were going in the country, naive or not,\u201d reflected Weller. \u201cBut I think we were used and it put me off politics. I\u2019m not really one for joining clubs.\u201d That speaks volumes. Musicians, as a whole, are not so much leftwing or rightwing as instinctively libertarian. They want to be free to do what they want to do. It has been argued that the first rock\u2019n\u2019roll protest song was Summertime Blues, in which Eddie Cochran protests to his congressman about his parents and his boss getting in the way of his dating plans. You can draw a line from that to Rage Against the Machine\u2019s more radical version of this primal complaint: \u201cFuck you, I won\u2019t do what you tell me.\u201d In 2017, the Grime 4 Corbyn movement stirred up disagreements that would have been familiar to veterans of Red Wedge. \u201cYour main focus is to live with that not existing in your life,\u201d Skepta told the Guardian about his refusal to participate. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a say in the country.\u201d When his Corbyn-boosting younger brother JME protested: \u201cYou must have an idea of something that you think is bullshit in the country you live in today and that could change,\u201d Skepta stuck to his ultra-libertarian guns: \u201cEverybody should run theirself.\u201d The brothers\u2019 altercation wasn\u2019t party political; it was about the eternal question of whether there is value in musicians being political at all. In that exchange Skepta was the Flavor to JME\u2019s Chuck, the Keith to his Mick. Many successful bands benefit from the push and pull between one member who believes that music should be a vessel for ideas and activism and one who just wants to give people a good time, the optimal result being music that is simultaneously righteous and fun. \u201cChuck D, he\u2019s the politician of the group,\u201d Flavor told the Guardian this week. \u201cI\u2019m just the friendly jester.\u201d It\u2019s a shame that after 35 years Public Enemy is no longer able to contain both impulses, but whoever is to blame, it\u2019s not Bernie Sanders. Electoral politics is child\u2019s play compared with band politics.",

First, cut spending on the public sector, on wages, for instance, or on social security. Second, raise revenue through higher taxes and selling state assets. Greece, for instance, has sold its airports in Corfu and Santorini, among others, to a German company.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was their reasoning?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Proponents made a variety of arguments for this strategy. It was said that governments had spent too much money, that everyone needed to tighten their belts. The UK\u2019s then-chancellor, George Osborne, claimed that the public sector was \"crowding out\" the private sector, taking resources and workers away from businesses. Particularly influential was a paper by two US-based economists, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart, arguing that once a country\u2019s total public borrowing rose above 90% of its national income, or GDP, growth would slow sharply.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Did austerity get unanimous backing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics argued that austerity would stop economies recovering from the shock of the banking meltdown and would make teachers and nurses and people with disabilities pay for the excesses of bankers and chief executives. In his book Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea, political economist Mark Blyth showed that austerity had been tried before in the 20th&nbsp;century \u2013 everywhere from Weimar Germany to 1930s America \u2013 and failed, often with politically disastrous consequences.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Just how badly Blyth suffered is disputed by Tory-led Northumberland county council, which is responsible for the predominantly rural county, as well as the former mining towns at its south-eastern Tyneside border.</p> \n<p>\u201cHang on, hang on,\u201d says Peter Jackson, the council leader, when challenged on the impact of his party\u2019s cuts on the local authority budget. \u201cIt\u2019s the narrative I hear all the time. What they don\u2019t say is councils have been able to retain other money. The reality is the overall funding position has increased.\u201d</p> \n<p>Central government grants have been cut, but the council has been able to keep money from business rates. Yet accounts show Northumberland spent around \u00a323m less in <a href=\"https://www.northumberland.gov.uk/NorthumberlandCountyCouncil/media/About-the-Council/Finance/Final-Statement-of-Accounts-2018-19-Published-signed-version.pdf\">2019</a> than it did in <a href=\"https://www.northumberland.gov.uk/NorthumberlandCountyCouncil/media/About-the-Council-Media/statementofaccounts2009-2010.pdf\">2010</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland\">population</a> has increased and aged, putting more pressure on public services. If 2010 spending had simply risen with inflation it would have been more than \u00a3200m higher today.

      "bodyText": "On a cold, grey day in Blyth, as intermittent rain catches shoppers and the wind swirls off the North Sea to blow umbrellas inside out, it isn\u2019t hard to see why the town on the Northumberland coast has felt unloved in recent years. \u201cIt looks really desperate,\u201d says Ian Levy, the first Tory MP to represent the town in almost a century, as he strides across the empty marketplace. The market is off today, and it is a quiet afternoon belying the political earthquake here in December, when Blyth Valley became Labour\u2019s first \u201cred wall\u201d seat to crumble at the election. Flanked by several graffiti-strewn shops with shutters drawn, Levy says the state of the town centre was among top reasons voters ditched political loyalties going back generations to put a Tory in power. Brexit (Blyth voted 60.5% for Leave) and lost trust in Labour were the others, with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopular leadership the final straw after years of waning support. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in and around Blyth all my life and I\u2019ve seen the area just going down and down and down. People want to move with the times, really, and they feel that Blyth\u2019s been kept behind,\u201d said Levy. Expectations for change are high. At next week\u2019s budget the challenge for Levy and the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will be to show that a vote for the Tories delivers higher living standards in this traditionally working-class community. People here want to know Boris Johnson\u2019s talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d Britain\u2019s lopsided economy is more than just talk. Davy Orr, 36, runs a barber shop-cum-social centre in the town. Bald and tattooed, he looks nothing like a typical Tory voter, but is friendly with Levy and backed him at the election. \u201cWe need investment massively. You need somewhere for the people, somewhere for the kids to go. We live in a rural town, so where do the kids go? \u201cThe proof will be in the pudding. A lot of people will say he [Johnson] promised a lot of things. But it\u2019s about delivering.\u201d Less than 15 miles from Newcastle but a good hour away by public transport, Blyth might seem left behind but has plenty more going for it than the empty market square might suggest. The docks \u2013 once a major coal port for pits across Northumberland \u2013 now host a world-beating renewable energy industry and research catapult, which grew up around the UK\u2019s first offshore windfarm. The Port of Blyth wants to become a freeport under Tory plans to help expand further. There are cutting-edge industrial companies and vegan entrepreneurs, plus community spirit in spades. The nearby town of Cramlington, also within the constituency of Blyth Valley, is a more affluent commuter town with a direct rail link to Newcastle, and cannot be discounted from any assessment of December\u2019s political earthquake: the Cramlington North ward of Northumberland council switched from Labour to Tory in 2005, and has stayed that way since. Brian Palmer is chief executive and owner of Tharsus, a Blyth engineering business that makes robots for Ocado, started as a metal-bashing firm in 1964 by four Tyneside sheet metalworkers who won the football pools. \u201cI know Ian, he\u2019s very keen to support business in his patch. I think that\u2019s positive. But clearly we need to see what\u2019s delivered.\u201d He\u2019s concerned about Brexit, local education and access to skilled workers, as well as the terrible transport links. All need addressing at the budget: \u201cA town like Blyth isn\u2019t a major industrial centre but there\u2019s a population that needs to be economically mobile, and we need to be able to bring people into the town in order to grow business here.\u201d As a newfound poster child for blue-collar Toryism, Blyth has been promised plenty even before Sunak stands up to deliver the budget on Wednesday. About \u00a335m has been allocated from the government\u2019s flagship \u201cfuture high streets\u201d and \u201cstronger towns\u201d funds \u2013 pots of money designed to revitalise struggling town centres. Investment in transport is another massive local priority. About \u00a31.5m has been allocated to finance plans to reopen the Ashington to Blyth rail line, but much more is needed to bring back passenger services axed in the Beeching cuts half a century ago. Considered vital in one of the biggest towns in Britain without a railway station, the plan has been promised for years with limited progress. For Levy, ending austerity is another priority, even though it was his party in charge of the cuts from Westminster over the past decade. \u201cYou gotta balance the books to make things work. I think these cuts had to be made. But it\u2019s not saying that they\u2019re long-term cuts, they\u2019re not going to not be reinstated,\u201d he said. Just how badly Blyth suffered is disputed by Tory-led Northumberland county council, which is responsible for the predominantly rural county, as well as the former mining towns at its south-eastern Tyneside border. \u201cHang on, hang on,\u201d says Peter Jackson, the council leader, when challenged on the impact of his party\u2019s cuts on the local authority budget. \u201cIt\u2019s the narrative I hear all the time. What they don\u2019t say is councils have been able to retain other money. The reality is the overall funding position has increased.\u201d Central government grants have been cut, but the council has been able to keep money from business rates. Yet accounts show Northumberland spent around \u00a323m less in 2019 than it did in 2010, while the population has increased and aged, putting more pressure on public services. If 2010 spending had simply risen with inflation it would have been more than \u00a3200m higher today. Jackson said Labour mismanaged the local authority before the Tories took charge in 2017, and has been punished accordingly at the ballot box. Susan Dungworth, Levy\u2019s defeated Labour rival, disagrees: \u201cWe\u2019ve controlled the council for around four years out of the last 15, and we\u2019d not been in government for nine years at the time of the election.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about levelling up, are we talking about levelling up back to before we were playing the austerity game? \u201cPeople can\u2019t get hospital appointments. Our transport system is absolutely falling to pieces, for a lot of villages there is no bus to get them to a train. They\u2019ll probably only bring us back to nearly where we were before we started cutting,\u201d said Dungworth. Like many of the constituencies that turned from red to blue at the election, Blyth was once central to the coal industry. Decades on from the last pit closure, as many as 7.8% of working-age adults claim incapacity benefits across the old Northumberland coalfield, almost double the rate of southern England. Straight after the election, Boris Johnson rushed to Sedgefield, Tony Blair\u2019s former constituency, to thank voters in the north-east for lending him support, saying he would repay their trust. For Levy, the job will be to keep pressure on Johnson to keep his promises, with the hope that a town with a Tory MP gets more support from a Tory government than a Labour one. \u201cI haven\u2019t got the funding yet. I\u2019m not gonna give up until I get it, and I\u2019ll keep plugging away. There\u2019s a lot of expectation on us to get it right,\u201d he said.

For Westminster folk, mere winning is for racehorses: their champions must be invested with meaning too. Thus does the political elite justify itself to itself, and to the rest of us.</p> <p>Early in 2017 people were so eager to believe Theresa May stood for something they spent months hunting an elusive beast they called \u201c<a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/defining-mayism-one-nation-conservatism-with-a-hint-of-papal-purple-and-a-dash-of-labour-red/\" title=\"\">Mayism</a>\u201d. Today they wield their butterfly nets and go panting after Johnsonism.</p> <p>Except pinning down the new prime minister may be the most impossible job in politics. This, after all, is the man who on the defining moment of his career, Brexit, wrote two newspaper columns: one for, one against. He <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/07/20/boris-johnson-pledges-pro-business-pm-ever-despite-previous/\" title=\"\">vows</a> to be \u201cthe most pro-business prime minister in history\u201d, when previously he had <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-says-nobody-stuck-up-for-the-bankers-as-much-as-i-did-when-asked-about-fk-business-jibe-499911\" title=\"\">exclaimed</a> \u201cfuck business\u201d. While today he promises billions for the north and the Midlands, a few years ago he <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/04/26/job-creation-london-mayor-huffpost-linkedin_n_1456092.html\" title=\"\">claimed</a>: \u201cA pound spent in Croydon is of far more value to the country than a pound spent in Strathclyde.\u201d</p> <p>Politics is what you say; policy is what you do. A politician as skilled as Johnson can keep up the rhetorical plate-spinning until he has to act. And on that his biggest test so far comes next week, with his government\u2019s first budget \u2013 Johnson\u2019s first big opportunity since the election to lay out his plans to transform the country and to back them with serious cash. The revolution that Johnson and Dominic Cummings promised us starts next Wednesday, when the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, stands up in the Commons.</p> <p>Or not. Since commentators are supposed to take the odd punt, let me lay here two bets. The first is that next week\u2019s budget will be another publicity triumph for Johnson and co. The second is that it will completely fail to live up to the promises of transformative government that helped Johnson storm the last election and which are central to his premiership.</p> <p>The reasoning for my first wager is simple: the government could simply re-announce what\u2019s already lined up on economic policy and tell a very tidy story. Before he walked out of No 11, former chancellor Sajid Javid had already budgeted for about \u00a3100bn over the next five years to invest in the Midlands and the north. In last September\u2019s mini-spending round, practically ignored in the melee of that autumn, he ensured that for the next year at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/sajid-javid-promises-decade-renewal-sets-out-post-brexit-spending\" title=\"\">no government department</a> would have to make any spending cuts. Add to that the legacy of Tories past: George Osborne\u2019s four-year freeze on increases in benefits comes to an end <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/millions-set-to-get-a-benefits-boost-as-four-year-payment-freeze-ends-in-april-825327\" title=\"\">next month</a>. And there will be billions extra for the NHS, as Theresa May promised last year.</p> <p>Put all that together, and you have more than enough for the next day\u2019s papers, which will almost certainly trumpet the last rites of austerity and the start of a massive splurge. It will be part of Labour\u2019s job on the day to point out that the 2,000 extra police officers budgeted for next year cannot begin to make up for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47225797\" title=\"\">21,000</a> that have gone over the past 10 years.</p> <p>The Tory leader ran in the last election as a redistributionist, vowing that \u201ceveryone can get a fair share of future prosperity\u201d and pledging in his manifesto to bulldoze \u201carbitrary tax advantages for the wealthy in society\u201d. If he means it, then giveaways to the rich on entrepreneur\u2019s relief and pension contributions should be scrapped next Wednesday and the savings spent on adult social care and the countless other cash-starved departments.</p> <p>But any briefing to a friendly hack about taking away sweeties for the rich leads to huge pushback from Tory MPs. Higher costs on pension savings? A \u201cmoral disgrace \u2026 an economic farce\u201d, harrumphed David Davis to Andrew Marr last month. Abolishing entrepreneurs\u2019 relief? Backbenchers immediately <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50217c00-5bac-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4\" title=\"\">took to</a> WhatsApp to protest, \u201cIf we aren\u2019t backing entrepreneurs, then who are we for?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-entrepreneurs-relief-the-uks-worst-tax-break\">The Guardian view on entrepreneurs\u2019 relief: the UK\u2019s worst tax break  | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is on such rocks that the Johnson regime\u2019s uneasy alliance of true-blue Conservatives and Vote Leave\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\" title=\"\">misfits and weirdo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\" title=\"\">s</a>\u201d will eventually founder. Meanwhile, by next Wednesday Sunak will have spent precisely 27 days at No 11. Formerly of Goldman Sachs, he is no ideologue but is instead what sociologist Aeron Davis calls a \u201creckless opportunist\u201d: a politician who could have joined either main party or none, who is better at photo-ops than door-knocking and for whom politics is an entry on the CV rather than a vocation. Why would he begin his tenure as chancellor with a war over soaking the rich? Better to postpone any real head-scratchers for another day \u2013 say the next budget, this autumn.</p> <p>Except that delaying big decisions is precisely not what Johnson was elected to do. And any Tory chancellor running a fiscal strategy based on low taxes, high spending and strict budgetary targets is setting themselves an impossible political task.</p> <p>Amid all the talk of revolution that has hung over Westminster for the past few months, I have occasionally thought about a talk given by Thomas Friedman at the British Museum well over a decade ago. The New York Times columnist was talking about the promises of a green revolution, and he asked the packed house when was the last time there\u2019d been a revolution in which no one got hurt. France in 1789 sent its aristocrats to the guillotine, the IT revolution put numerous firms out of business. Yet this one, Friedman claimed, would be painless, easy, even money-saving. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a party.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cpainless revolution\u201d \u2013 that is to say, no revolution at all \u2013 is surely Johnson\u2019s preferred scenario. He is a people pleaser, an essay-crisis master, a spender not a taxer. He prefers the convivial, which is a perfectly fair personal choice, but a betrayal of what he offered as a politician.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Early in 2017 people were so eager to believe Theresa May stood for something they spent months hunting an elusive beast they called \u201cMayism\u201d. Today they wield their butterfly nets and go panting after Johnsonism. Except pinning down the new prime minister may be the most impossible job in politics. This, after all, is the man who on the defining moment of his career, Brexit, wrote two newspaper columns: one for, one against. He vows to be \u201cthe most pro-business prime minister in history\u201d, when previously he had exclaimed \u201cfuck business\u201d. While today he promises billions for the north and the Midlands, a few years ago he claimed: \u201cA pound spent in Croydon is of far more value to the country than a pound spent in Strathclyde.\u201d Politics is what you say; policy is what you do. A politician as skilled as Johnson can keep up the rhetorical plate-spinning until he has to act. And on that his biggest test so far comes next week, with his government\u2019s first budget \u2013 Johnson\u2019s first big opportunity since the election to lay out his plans to transform the country and to back them with serious cash. The revolution that Johnson and Dominic Cummings promised us starts next Wednesday, when the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, stands up in the Commons. Or not. Since commentators are supposed to take the odd punt, let me lay here two bets. The first is that next week\u2019s budget will be another publicity triumph for Johnson and co. The second is that it will completely fail to live up to the promises of transformative government that helped Johnson storm the last election and which are central to his premiership. The reasoning for my first wager is simple: the government could simply re-announce what\u2019s already lined up on economic policy and tell a very tidy story. Before he walked out of No 11, former chancellor Sajid Javid had already budgeted for about \u00a3100bn over the next five years to invest in the Midlands and the north. In last September\u2019s mini-spending round, practically ignored in the melee of that autumn, he ensured that for the next year at least no government department would have to make any spending cuts. Add to that the legacy of Tories past: George Osborne\u2019s four-year freeze on increases in benefits comes to an end next month. And there will be billions extra for the NHS, as Theresa May promised last year. Put all that together, and you have more than enough for the next day\u2019s papers, which will almost certainly trumpet the last rites of austerity and the start of a massive splurge. It will be part of Labour\u2019s job on the day to point out that the 2,000 extra police officers budgeted for next year cannot begin to make up for the 21,000 that have gone over the past 10 years. The Tory leader ran in the last election as a redistributionist, vowing that \u201ceveryone can get a fair share of future prosperity\u201d and pledging in his manifesto to bulldoze \u201carbitrary tax advantages for the wealthy in society\u201d. If he means it, then giveaways to the rich on entrepreneur\u2019s relief and pension contributions should be scrapped next Wednesday and the savings spent on adult social care and the countless other cash-starved departments. But any briefing to a friendly hack about taking away sweeties for the rich leads to huge pushback from Tory MPs. Higher costs on pension savings? A \u201cmoral disgrace \u2026 an economic farce\u201d, harrumphed David Davis to Andrew Marr last month. Abolishing entrepreneurs\u2019 relief? Backbenchers immediately took to WhatsApp to protest, \u201cIf we aren\u2019t backing entrepreneurs, then who are we for?\u201d It is on such rocks that the Johnson regime\u2019s uneasy alliance of true-blue Conservatives and Vote Leave\u2019s \u201cmisfits and weirdos\u201d will eventually founder. Meanwhile, by next Wednesday Sunak will have spent precisely 27 days at No 11. Formerly of Goldman Sachs, he is no ideologue but is instead what sociologist Aeron Davis calls a \u201creckless opportunist\u201d: a politician who could have joined either main party or none, who is better at photo-ops than door-knocking and for whom politics is an entry on the CV rather than a vocation. Why would he begin his tenure as chancellor with a war over soaking the rich? Better to postpone any real head-scratchers for another day \u2013 say the next budget, this autumn. Except that delaying big decisions is precisely not what Johnson was elected to do. And any Tory chancellor running a fiscal strategy based on low taxes, high spending and strict budgetary targets is setting themselves an impossible political task. Amid all the talk of revolution that has hung over Westminster for the past few months, I have occasionally thought about a talk given by Thomas Friedman at the British Museum well over a decade ago. The New York Times columnist was talking about the promises of a green revolution, and he asked the packed house when was the last time there\u2019d been a revolution in which no one got hurt. France in 1789 sent its aristocrats to the guillotine, the IT revolution put numerous firms out of business. Yet this one, Friedman claimed, would be painless, easy, even money-saving. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a party.\u201d The \u201cpainless revolution\u201d \u2013 that is to say, no revolution at all \u2013 is surely Johnson\u2019s preferred scenario. He is a people pleaser, an essay-crisis master, a spender not a taxer. He prefers the convivial, which is a perfectly fair personal choice, but a betrayal of what he offered as a politician. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

Vice-premier Sun Chunlan, one of the most senior government officials to visit the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, toured a residential community in Wuhan\u2019s Qingshan district on Thursday. According to state media, Sun was inspecting the operations of the neighbourhood committee, meant to make checks on residents each day and distribute necessities like medicine, food and fresh vegetables. Videos posted online showed Sun and a delegation walking along the grounds while residents appeared to shout from their apartment windows, \u201cfake, fake,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s all fake,\u201d as well as \u201cwe protest\u201d. Some could be heard yelling, \u201cformalism,\u201d a term that has employed frequently recently to criticise ineffective measures taken by government representatives for the sake of appearances. Wuhan reported 126 new coronavirus cases on Thursday but the wider province of Hubei excluding the capital recorded none for the first time during the outbreak, authorities said on Friday. Since 12 February, all residential compounds in Wuhan have been put under lockdown, barring most residents from leaving their homes. Neighbourhood committees have been charged with handling everything from arranging hospital visits and quarantines of residents, as well as residents\u2019 supplies of food and daily temperature checks. But many residents have complained to the Guardian and other media that the community workers have not provided needed assistance. Community workers have complained that they have been overwhelmed. In an unusual turn of events, on Friday various Chinese state media outlets reported the videos showing public discontent. Such videos are frequently censored from Chinese social media and government-run outlets have been focused on stories of \u201cpositive energy\u201d to boost morale in the fight against the coronavirus. Yet, the People\u2019s Daily posted a video subtitled in English showing one person shouting \u201cfake, fake,\u201d which has since been removed. Other outlets like Beijing Youth Daily reported on the incident. A government-affiliated account on WeChat, Taoran Notes, said in an essay posted on Thursday that all the facts of the incident were \u201cbasically true\u201d. According to state broadcaster CCTV, Sun held a meeting immediately after the incident to deal with the complaints. Staff have been dispatched to visit the residents one by one, according to Taoran. Observers say state media may be trying to co-opt discussion of the videos ,which circulated widely online, and provide their own narrative of events. The incident also provides the central government an opportunity to show it responding to public sentiment, after a wave of public anger over the suppression of early warnings of the virus. \u201cIt is by not covering up problems that we can resolve them,\u201d the article by Taoran Notes said. \u201cWe must face the problems in a realistic manner to gain the understanding and support of the masses.\u201d Versions of the video were still being posted on social media on Friday. \u201cIf they were not pushed to the edge, Chinese people would not shout,\u201d one Weibo user wrote. Another comment read: \u201cWhat were they shouting? They were shouting the truth. For years, when these high-level meetings or inspections took place, those who would tell the truth would be sent away or shut up.\u201d Another said: \u201cDo you hear the people?\u201d Elsewhere in China, schools in provinces reporting no new cases for a number of days, started to set their opening dates in a sign of the country returning to normal. Qinghai, a northwestern province in China that had reported no new infections for 29 days as of 5 March said it would stagger the start date of different school days from 11 March to 20 March, according to a notice posted on an official website on Friday. Separately, the southwestern province of Guizhou, which reported no new infections for 18 days, had said at the end of February that schools would start from 16 March.

Greg Hunt asked the Royal Australian College of Physicians (RACP) to assess the matter in August last year after receiving complaints about healthcare for trans children from a group that included former deputy president of Fred Nile\u2019s Christian Democratic Party Dr John Whitehall and psychology professor Dianna Kenny, both vocal opponents of trans healthcare for adolescents.

      "body": "<p>Christian Santos* remembers staying awake at night, anxiously listening to the sound of his colleague coughing. They were sleeping below deck, in one of the small rooms shared by workers on board the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/17/coronavirus-japan-braces-for-hundreds-more-cases-as-another-china-city-locked-down\">stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship</a>.</p> \n<p>He had spent the previous two weeks serving guests who were confined to their rooms, and watching the miserable failure of disease-control measures on the vessel. Now he knew the coronavirus, which had already transmitted to hundreds of people onboard, had almost certainly entered his own cabin.</p> \n<p>He tried to move rooms, but was told this wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cEvery time he coughed I was afraid,\u201d recalls Santos, who, like many workers interviewed, asked to speak under a pseudonym. The next morning his colleague was taken to hospital for treatment.</p> \n<p>Santos has since tested negative, but as he and other crew remain in quarantine, a separate cruise ship is now being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-san-francisco-cruise-ship-grand-princess\">held off the coast of San Francisco</a> after it was linked to a coronavirus death in California. A further 21 people onboard are reporting possible symptoms. It is not known if guests will be allowed to disembark.</p> \n<p>It is clear, said Santos, that passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess<strong> </strong>should have been evacuated far earlier from the ship, which became a breeding ground for the virus after it was stopped from sailing by the Japanese government. Crew, he added, should not have continued serving, cooking and cleaning while a quarantine was supposed to be underway.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were abused,\u201d said Santos. \u201cCan you imagine? The situation was alarming but they kept us working.\u201d He fears he could still develop the virus, and worries about losing work because of the crisis.</p> \n<p>Concerns were first raised about the ship when a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus on 1 February. Three days later, Japanese authorities stopped the ship from sailing. On 5 February, tighter controls were introduced and the 2,600 guests on board were told not to leave their rooms.</p> \n<p>But these measures, which some have speculated were imposed days too late, only applied to passengers. Crew continued to eat in a large mess hall, share bathroom facilities and go to guests\u2019 rooms. Some departments received protective equipment later than others. Santos says he did not receive a mask until a week after the ship had been stopped.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"851b8015226586f4717d0c0cc24cf7f63ed9aa8c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/851b8015226586f4717d0c0cc24cf7f63ed9aa8c/0_0_4836_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship on their balconies at the Daikoku Pier cruise terminal in Yokohama, Japan, during the ship\u2019s quarantine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship are seen on their balconies at the Daikoku Pier cruise terminal in Yokohama, Japan, during the ship\u2019s quarantine.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the time, Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University Hospital, an infectious disease specialist who visited the ship during the quarantine, described the procedures onboard as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=xjSR_Pdy7PU\">\u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d</a>. In a scathing video posted online, he said he had worked during Ebola and Sars outbreaks and had never worried about getting infected but, after visiting the Diamond Princess, he was afraid of catching coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Crew members described scenes of confusion and chaos, in which there was little separation between the healthy and the sick. \u201cAs a crew you don\u2019t even know who is positive \u2013 you\u2019re dealing with them and you\u2019re going around the ship, eating in the mess together,\u201d said another staff member, James Reyes, who worked in housekeeping.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are the one giving [isolated crew members] everything they need and sorting out their dirty dishes. Then one day you will notice those isolated cabins going empty because they [have tested] positive. Imagine the cross contamination.\u201d</p> \n<p>Six passengers have died as a result of the virus.</p> \n<p>Princess Cruises said in a statement that Japan\u2019s ministry of health was the lead authority \u201cdefining and executing the testing and quarantine protocols for all guests and crew\u201d, and that the ship was legally obliged to follow the country\u2019s public health and medical instructions.</p> \n<p>Japan\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement that Japan \u201cpresented a criteria of behaviour\u201d to limit infection along with equipment, but that \u201cthe responsibility for ensuring that the ship can be operated in a manner that provides a safe environment for passengers and crew rests with the ship operator\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. <b>Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.</b>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.</p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Reyes isn\u2019t sure who is to blame. He is now in quarantine with Santos, back in the Philippines, home to almost half of the Diamond Princess\u2019s crew. The country is a major source of ship workers globally and depends heavily on remittances. Though most Filipinos are employed through land-based jobs, 330,859 people were at sea as of <a href=\"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/177879/ph-seafarers-need-lifeline-or-sink-amid-global-rivals\">the end of 2018</a>. Cruise ship work, thanks to its higher pay and the job\u2019s glamorous reputation, is highly sought after.</p> \n<p>This can leave employees reluctant to speak out when they are being unfairly treated, said Professor Helen Sampson of the seafarers international research centre at Cardiff University. \u201cMost workers are employed on temporary contracts and are fearful of losing their jobs, making them extremely vulnerable to abuse of many kinds.\u201d</p> \n<p>The majority of crew members interviewed said they did not want to give their full name because they feared repercussions from Princess Cruises, or from their recruitment agency, the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation (MMC). Some crew and their relatives said they had been discouraged from sharing information about the outbreak by posting online or talking to the media. Princess Cruises said it had not stopped staff from using social media. MMC did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>Joanna Concepcion, chairperson of Migrante International, a Manila-based group that supported affected crew members, said employees wanted to stop working but felt they had no choice. \u201cIt was almost as if they were forced to pick between their health and safety, and their economic livelihood,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bddb3890afd4034f78b9cfd01bf8585b2ed44b6f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bddb3890afd4034f78b9cfd01bf8585b2ed44b6f/0_0_5547_3698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crew member at work onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crew member at work onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Messages given to crew onboard varied. In one department, crew were told in a group meeting that if they did not wish to work they must come forward and write down their names, so that their details could then be provided to human resources \u2013 an announcement perceived by some staff present to be a threat. Elsewhere, staff said they were not informed of any option not to work, and instead found their hours increasing as they were tasked with delivering food and other treats to passengers who had been confined to their rooms. Crew were also given treats and vitamins.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we [had stood down] nobody would deliver food, and [passengers] would not be able to eat,\u201d said one worker, who asked to be referred to by their initials, RCDG. Many guests were old and had underlying health conditions, making them more vulnerable to the virus, RCDG added.</p> \n<p>Photographs shared online show a flood of thank-you letters written by the ship\u2019s guests. Some passengers were frustrated by the quarantine, but most were extremely grateful to the crew, workers said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe sacrificed our health for the benefit of others. Now that the crisis is over, we feel this feeling of pride in ourself, and in what we did,\u201d RCDG said, adding that the captain and department heads were supportive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Others argue this isn\u2019t a sacrifice crew members should have been asked to make. Relatives fear that Filipinos, who pride themselves on being hardworking, felt obliged to go above and beyond what should have been expected. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer their job. It\u2019s not part of their contract,\u201d said the girlfriend of one man who worked onboard and later tested positive and remains in Japan.</p> \n<p>There is often a culture of soldiering on among crews, added Sampson. The ships provide a unique environment in which diseases can spread, and there has long been concern about the need to minimise the risk of outbreaks. \u201cOn all cruise vessels most crew, other than the very senior ranks, share cabins which are small and which are very unhelpful in regard to infection control,\u201d said Sampson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/28/world-banks-500m-coronavirus-push-too-late-for-poor-countries-experts-say\">World Bank's $500m pandemic scheme accused of 'waiting for people to die'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Across the cruise sector, staff can be more vulnerable to illnesses \u2013 shift patterns can prevent employees from visiting the onboard doctors, and some feel obliged to carry on, especially if they are worried about being sent home.

      "bodyText": "Christian Santos* remembers staying awake at night, anxiously listening to the sound of his colleague coughing. They were sleeping below deck, in one of the small rooms shared by workers on board the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. He had spent the previous two weeks serving guests who were confined to their rooms, and watching the miserable failure of disease-control measures on the vessel. Now he knew the coronavirus, which had already transmitted to hundreds of people onboard, had almost certainly entered his own cabin. He tried to move rooms, but was told this wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cEvery time he coughed I was afraid,\u201d recalls Santos, who, like many workers interviewed, asked to speak under a pseudonym. The next morning his colleague was taken to hospital for treatment. Santos has since tested negative, but as he and other crew remain in quarantine, a separate cruise ship is now being held off the coast of San Francisco after it was linked to a coronavirus death in California. A further 21 people onboard are reporting possible symptoms. It is not known if guests will be allowed to disembark. It is clear, said Santos, that passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess should have been evacuated far earlier from the ship, which became a breeding ground for the virus after it was stopped from sailing by the Japanese government. Crew, he added, should not have continued serving, cooking and cleaning while a quarantine was supposed to be underway. \u201cWe were abused,\u201d said Santos. \u201cCan you imagine? The situation was alarming but they kept us working.\u201d He fears he could still develop the virus, and worries about losing work because of the crisis. Concerns were first raised about the ship when a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus on 1 February. Three days later, Japanese authorities stopped the ship from sailing. On 5 February, tighter controls were introduced and the 2,600 guests on board were told not to leave their rooms. But these measures, which some have speculated were imposed days too late, only applied to passengers. Crew continued to eat in a large mess hall, share bathroom facilities and go to guests\u2019 rooms. Some departments received protective equipment later than others. Santos says he did not receive a mask until a week after the ship had been stopped. At the time, Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University Hospital, an infectious disease specialist who visited the ship during the quarantine, described the procedures onboard as \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d. In a scathing video posted online, he said he had worked during Ebola and Sars outbreaks and had never worried about getting infected but, after visiting the Diamond Princess, he was afraid of catching coronavirus. Crew members described scenes of confusion and chaos, in which there was little separation between the healthy and the sick. \u201cAs a crew you don\u2019t even know who is positive \u2013 you\u2019re dealing with them and you\u2019re going around the ship, eating in the mess together,\u201d said another staff member, James Reyes, who worked in housekeeping. \u201cWe are the one giving [isolated crew members] everything they need and sorting out their dirty dishes. Then one day you will notice those isolated cabins going empty because they [have tested] positive. Imagine the cross contamination.\u201d Six passengers have died as a result of the virus. Princess Cruises said in a statement that Japan\u2019s ministry of health was the lead authority \u201cdefining and executing the testing and quarantine protocols for all guests and crew\u201d, and that the ship was legally obliged to follow the country\u2019s public health and medical instructions. Japan\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement that Japan \u201cpresented a criteria of behaviour\u201d to limit infection along with equipment, but that \u201cthe responsibility for ensuring that the ship can be operated in a manner that provides a safe environment for passengers and crew rests with the ship operator\u201d. Reyes isn\u2019t sure who is to blame. He is now in quarantine with Santos, back in the Philippines, home to almost half of the Diamond Princess\u2019s crew. The country is a major source of ship workers globally and depends heavily on remittances. Though most Filipinos are employed through land-based jobs, 330,859 people were at sea as of the end of 2018. Cruise ship work, thanks to its higher pay and the job\u2019s glamorous reputation, is highly sought after. This can leave employees reluctant to speak out when they are being unfairly treated, said Professor Helen Sampson of the seafarers international research centre at Cardiff University. \u201cMost workers are employed on temporary contracts and are fearful of losing their jobs, making them extremely vulnerable to abuse of many kinds.\u201d The majority of crew members interviewed said they did not want to give their full name because they feared repercussions from Princess Cruises, or from their recruitment agency, the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation (MMC). Some crew and their relatives said they had been discouraged from sharing information about the outbreak by posting online or talking to the media. Princess Cruises said it had not stopped staff from using social media. MMC did not respond to a request for comment. Joanna Concepcion, chairperson of Migrante International, a Manila-based group that supported affected crew members, said employees wanted to stop working but felt they had no choice. \u201cIt was almost as if they were forced to pick between their health and safety, and their economic livelihood,\u201d she said. Messages given to crew onboard varied. In one department, crew were told in a group meeting that if they did not wish to work they must come forward and write down their names, so that their details could then be provided to human resources \u2013 an announcement perceived by some staff present to be a threat. Elsewhere, staff said they were not informed of any option not to work, and instead found their hours increasing as they were tasked with delivering food and other treats to passengers who had been confined to their rooms. Crew were also given treats and vitamins. \u201cIf we [had stood down] nobody would deliver food, and [passengers] would not be able to eat,\u201d said one worker, who asked to be referred to by their initials, RCDG. Many guests were old and had underlying health conditions, making them more vulnerable to the virus, RCDG added. Photographs shared online show a flood of thank-you letters written by the ship\u2019s guests. Some passengers were frustrated by the quarantine, but most were extremely grateful to the crew, workers said. \u201cWe sacrificed our health for the benefit of others. Now that the crisis is over, we feel this feeling of pride in ourself, and in what we did,\u201d RCDG said, adding that the captain and department heads were supportive. Others argue this isn\u2019t a sacrifice crew members should have been asked to make. Relatives fear that Filipinos, who pride themselves on being hardworking, felt obliged to go above and beyond what should have been expected. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer their job. It\u2019s not part of their contract,\u201d said the girlfriend of one man who worked onboard and later tested positive and remains in Japan. There is often a culture of soldiering on among crews, added Sampson. The ships provide a unique environment in which diseases can spread, and there has long been concern about the need to minimise the risk of outbreaks. \u201cOn all cruise vessels most crew, other than the very senior ranks, share cabins which are small and which are very unhelpful in regard to infection control,\u201d said Sampson. Across the cruise sector, staff can be more vulnerable to illnesses \u2013 shift patterns can prevent employees from visiting the onboard doctors, and some feel obliged to carry on, especially if they are worried about being sent home. This, in turn, also puts guests at greater risk. The lack of agreement over who had ultimate responsibility for staff members on Diamond Princess \u2013 the various companies or the Japan or Philippines government \u2013 shows how \u201ccompletely under-considered\u201d such matters are, added Sampson. \u201cPerhaps if anything positive eventually emerges from this global health crisis, it might be that cruise operators review crew working and living conditions, and upgrade these to provide for better physical and mental health, and welfare,\u201d she said. More immediately, cruise operators have cancelled and rescheduled trips, and introduced tighter health screening and staff training in an attempt to reassure passengers. The virus has wreaked havoc across the global tourism sector, with the overall economic cost yet to be seen. Workers fear they will incur a loss of income.

During the height of the outbreak, she locked herself in her son\u2019s bedroom, praying for the return of her husband and all other people onboard. \u201cThe life of my husband is more important than money,\u201d she said. * Names of workers have been changed.",

      "bodyText": "The young men carrying sticks and knives arrived around sunset on Friday last week, as the Syrian-owned restaurants of Gaziantep\u2019s busy In\u00f6n\u00fc Street were coming to life. Omar Jaber rushed to pull down the shutters of his small grocery shop as the gang drew closer, smashing up windows and parked cars. The night before, Turkish soldiers had been hit by an airstrike in the Syrian province of Idlib, an incident which left at least 33 troops dead in the biggest loss of life for the Turkish military in modern history. Jaber knew the Turkish men wanted revenge. \u201cEventually the police came and dispersed them,\u201d he said. \u201cMost shop owners here then kept our businesses closed for several days.\u201d The 61-year-old from Aleppo lost a son in 2012 who died fighting in the early days of the revolution against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. He decided to move his family to Turkey after that. \u201cThere are many good Turks who defend Syrians,\u201d Jaber said. \u201cBut generally the mood toward us is hostile.\u201d Similar scenes have played out across Turkey since Ankara launched a counteroffensive last month to repel an assault by Assad and his Russian allies on Turkish-backed rebel groups in the last opposition stronghold of Idlib. After the funeral of a Turkish soldier killed in Idlib in the southeastern town of Kahramanmara\u015f last Saturday, a large mob attacked Syrian-owned businesses in the town centre, and two foreign teenagers were beaten in the Black Sea town of Samsun on Sunday. According to 2018 UN data, Turkey hosts 63.5% of all the refugees in the world, including some 3.5 million Syrians. Over the years, an anti-refugee backlash has ebbed and flowed. While Syrians who now have Turkish citizenship have been embraced by the government as potential conservative voters, in the past year refugees have also become the definitive scapegoats for Turkey\u2019s economic woes. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, likes to portray Turkey as facing existential threats in order to whip up nationalistic sentiment. Such rhetoric is often followed by racist attacks on migrant communities. Many Syrian shops and restaurants across the country are currently shut, wary of becoming targets amid the heightened tensions. Mohammed Hadid, a teacher from Idlib living in the southern Turkish town of Antakya, usually meets friends to play backgammon and smoke nargileh several times a week, but has avoided his favourite spot since the airstrike on the Turkish soldiers. \u201cI felt too embarrassed to go. I\u2019m from a village only a few kilometres away from where they died, fighting the regime,\u201d the 35-year-old said. \u201cYesterday I saw an elderly Turkish woman approach a young Syrian man and she asked him, \u2018What are you doing here while our young men die in your country? Why don\u2019t you go fight?\u2019 The fighting in Idlib has been intense since the suspected Russian airstrike, as Turkey, a Nato member, declined to implicate Moscow and vented its fury on Assad\u2019s forces instead. The sustained drone and artillery attacks have left the Syrian army licking its wounds: four jets have been shot down and heavy weaponry, anti-aircraft systems, radar systems and dozens of tanks have been destroyed. The fierce counteroffensive has been applauded by civilians in Idlib and Syrians outside the country for finally forcing Russian president Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table after weeks of indifference to Turkish appeals from the Kremlin. Turkey\u2019s border with Syria, however, remains shut to the hundreds of thousands of families currently camped out in miserable conditions on the border. There is also widespread anger at how Turkey has manipulated at least 13,000 Syrian refugees and other migrants in travelling west to the country\u2019s EU borders. Following the strike on Turkish troops, Ankara declared it would no longer stop migrants from trying to cross into Europe \u2013 a move designed to pressure western allies to support the Turkish campaign in Idilb. On Thursday, interior minister S\u00fcleyman Soylu said Turkey would deploy an extra 1,000 police officers to the Greek border to prevent Athens from pushing people back into Turkey, effectively trapping desperate people in the border zone. \u201cThey say they want us to leave, but then if we do leave, they call us cowards,\u201d Hadid said. \u201cEvery Syrian I know would love to go home. We know at this point we will never be truly welcome anywhere else.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As the number of coronavirus cases in South Korea exceeded 6,000 this week, there was a rise, too, in complaints about information overload in the form of emergency virus text alerts that have included embarrassing revelations about infected people\u2019s private lives. Health authorities and district offices across the country are sending \u201csafety guidance texts\u201d from early morning to late at night, reminding people to wash their hands thoroughly and not to touch their faces with unwashed hands. But for many people, the texts \u2013 while intended as a public health service \u2013 are fuelling social stigma and in some cases, leading to speculation over extra-marital affairs. Much of the criticism centres on messages that trace the movements of people who have recently been diagnosed with the virus. \u201cA woman in her 60s has just tested positive,\u201d reads a typical text, \u201cClick on the link for the places she visited before she was hospitalised,\u201d it adds. Clicking on the link takes the user to the website of a district office that lists the places the patient had visited before testing positive. This avalanche of information has included some embarrassing revelations. One involved a man in his 50s who returned from Wuhan province in China \u2013 where the outbreak started \u2013 with his 30-year-old secretary. Both were infected in the early days of the epidemic. In another case, reported by the BBC, one alert said a man contracted the virus from an instructor during a sexual harassment class. As South Korean media pored over their movements, citizens looked on with a mixture of horror and fascination as their private lives were laid bare, leading to speculation that they were having an affair and that the secretary had undergone plastic surgery. In another text that captured people\u2019s imagination, a woman in her 60s reportedly went to work as normal, attended a wedding and had lunch at a hotel buffet restaurant with friends, despite having been recently hospitalised with injuries she said she had sustained in a car accident. The woman, who then tested positive for Covid-19, was accused by South Korean internet users of committing insurance fraud \u2013 allegations she denied publicly after TV reporters managed to track her down. A man in his 30s who tested positive became the target of online taunts about his sexual behaviour after authorities said in a text alert that they had been unable to track his movements after he arrived at Seoul\u2019s main railway station from the capital\u2019s airport. Since the area near the station is known for prostitution, the man, known only by his case number, was repeatedly accused on online forums of paying for sex. In fact, he had simply eaten at a restaurant in the neighbourhood, health authorities said, blaming the earlier confusion over his whereabouts on a technical glitch. The text alerts are also affecting shops and restaurants that infected people visited before their diagnosis was confirmed. While the texts do not identify the patients \u2013 other than giving their gender, age range and assigning them a case number \u2013 they do reveal the names of shops and restaurants they visited before they were tested. While restaurants that had been named closed temporarily for fumigation, they say their association with the virus could put them out of business. Fraudsters are now playing on those fears. A man claiming to be infected with Covid-19 called several restaurants in the Mapo district of Seoul warning that their business would suffer if he told health authorities he had eaten there, and demanded money in return for his silence. Police are investigating the case but have yet to locate the suspect. \u201cI find myself eavesdropping on customers\u2019 conversations these days, just in case they turn out to be a cult member or a fraudster,\u201d said Kim Na-hee, the owner of a restaurant in the capital.

      "bodyText": "Former Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion approved more than $560m worth of funding in his last few weeks in the role, leading up to the election in 2019. A Senate committee has heard Scullion also gave almost $4m to 12 projects that his department, the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) did not recommend be funded. A number of the $560m in grants were \u201cminister-initiated\u201d, the committee has been told. Of the $1.279bn in the Indigenous affairs budget for this financial year, $567m was handed out by Scullion in the six weeks from 1 March to 11 April. Of the total Indigenous budget of $1.27bn, 90% had been committed by January 1 this year, NIAAA told the committee. Scullion also declined to support 28 projects that the NIAAA recommended should be funded, including the now defunct National Congress of Australia\u2019s first peoples, several school nutrition programs for Indigenous children in remote communities, and cadetships in the NSW Legal Aid Commission named for the late Indigenous Judge, Bob Bellear. One of the grants Scullion did approve had not been applied for through formal channels. The $500,000 grant to the Alice Springs based Red Tails AFL club to help young Indigenous men in the region was developed by NIAAA because the minister told them \u201cit was who he wanted to support\u201d. Other grants handed out in that six-week period included $15.8m to Wesfarmers for an \u201cemployment parity initiative\u201d, almost $17m to the Cape York Institute for five youth programs, and $10m to the Brisbane Broncos for a girls\u2019 academy and a mentoring programs. NIAAA secretary Ray Griggs said he could not say exactly how many grants were applications by agencies, and how many were approaches by the minister but \u201cI suspect it is an admixture\u201d. The NIAAA later released details of the 12 programs Scullion funded agianst advice. Scullion maintained control over the entire budget, but NIAAA had delegation to approve grants of less than $5,000 for Naidoc activities, Griggs said. \u201cWe were not involved in the process in the minister\u2019s office,\u201d he said and, under questioning by Labor senator Tim Ayres, could not say whether the minister engaged with the prime minister\u2019s office in making the funding decisions. Only seven funding decisions, worth about $32.2m, have been made by the current minister Ken Wyatt, and they have all accorded with the advice he has received from NIAAA, Griggs said. \u201cI am just stunned that someone in the authority of a ministerial position can have no accountability with the way he spent Indigenous funds,\u201d Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy said after the hearing. \u201cI\u2019m just appalled. \u201cAnd obviously we will have a deeper look at the details of that spending, but you have a department for a reason and he was a one-man show.

      "bodyText": "The commonwealth has backed off a formal process to take over NSW\u2019s river management and instead is having \u201cgood faith\u201d negotiations with the recalcitrant state over when it will lodge 20 water-sharing plans for its rivers in the Murray-Darling. A Senate estimates committee heard on Friday that NSW was still to lodge any of its 20 water-sharing plans, while other states had lodged theirs. These plans include the detailed rules about when water can be extracted by each type of licence and when early flows and low flows are protected. They are critical to the success of the Murray-Darling Basin plan. In late January, the former water minister David Littleproud triggered a formal process to take over NSW\u2019s management of the rivers and withhold funds under the plan, noting that NSW\u2019s failure to submit is 20 plans, which were due last year, was \u201cdisappointing\u201d. \u201cIt is not my intention to approve commonwealth expenditure to New South Wales related to the basin plan until there is demonstrated progress on water resource plans,\u201d he wrote. But despite the NSW water minister, Melinda Pavey, failing to reply within the two weeks to the formal notice, triggering formal mediation, the committee heard the new federal water minister, Keith Pitt, has backed off. Bureaucrats told the committee Pitt was now in discussion with Pavey and they were \u201chopeful there would be progress\u201d. There are also discussions about whether funds would be withheld. In the past both Pavey and the NSW Nationals leader, John Barilaro, have threatened to pull out of the plan and last week Barilaro called for a royal commission into the plan. The NSW plans have all gone through a first round of community consultation but more consultation is required and there appears to be no firm timetable for finalising the plans. Federal ministers were also grilled over slow progress in passing legislation to establish the office of the Murray-Darling inspector general and to give him powers to demand information from states and irrigators, on pain of criminal sanctions. The former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty is acting in the position, but no legislation has been drafted despite being announced in July last year. Instead he is operating pursuant to a letter. The commonwealth environmental water holder, Jody Swirepik, had good news however, on the pilot project to get water into the Ramsar-listed Narran Lakes, near Lightening Ridge in NSW. She said the commonwealth had received about 10GL under an agreement with Eastern Australia Agriculture to forego taking recent flows in the Condamine-Balonne system. The exact amount of water will be verified at the end of the water year in June but she said it had been vital to rejuvenating the lakes, which are an important breeding ground for migratory birds. But she was unable to tell the committee how much water the commonwealth would receive from the overland flow licences, which the commonwealth purchased from EAA in an $80m deal in 2017. She said the licences had all been triggered and in the next few weeks she expected water to reach the lakes. She assured the committee that levees had been broken through to allow the water to reach the lakes and that it was being monitored. She said photos and video would be made available. The controversial $80m deal is now under review by the Auditor General as to whether it was value for money.",

This environmentally-charged song calls for solutions not excuses, and comes from a place of \u201cfrustration and impatience\u201d, according to L-Fresh.

Kelly refers to Sleep, Australia, Sleep as \u201ca lament in the form of a lullaby\u201d, but the song\u2019s urgency far outstrips its narcoleptic qualities, despite sounding like a waltzing bush ballad you\u2019d learn in primary school, forget by university, and never care to examine the origin of. Kelly presents his rage through a gentle sarcasm so lightly peppered that drive-by listeners won\u2019t know to look for it. Helikens our environmental indifference to the archetypal frog in a saucepan: . By the time Kelly is serenely singing about rising seas, firestorms and cyclones, and of mounting corpses, you are sure to have been lulled into a nightmare state. Kelly has an unassailable catalogue of classics: a few dozen FM staples, film soundtracks, concept albums and the greatest Australian Christmas carol since we straya-fied Jingle Bells. It\u2019s a lot to keep up with, but make sure you don\u2019t sleep on this important addition to his canon.</p> <p><strong>For more</strong>: Kelly and Paul Grabowsky will perform their new record, Please Leave Your Light On at Melbourne Recital Centre on 26 May and Sydney\u2019s City Recital Hall on 30 May.</p> <h2><strong>Methyl Ethel \u2013 Majestic AF</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of</strong>: Pulp, Radiohead, Caribou</p> <p>There\u2019s a thin line between dystopia and the dancefloor, and a lot of the most interesting electronica \u2013 New Order, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, most of the Warp catalogue \u2013 blends nostalgia with technology; club beats with the downbeat. Methyl Ethel\u2019s latest songs have an increasing hypnagogic feel to them, which may be a result of the recent focal shift from an incendiary live five-piece to what is now largely a solo outlet for producer, singer and mainstay Jake Webb. It\u2019s no small boast to name such an insular-sounding single Majestic AF, but Methyl Ethel somehow earns this title with an epic feat of creepy falsetto, snake-charmer synths, and a drumbeat that will challenge your equilibrium. Webb\u2019s voice is blessed with a charming warmth, which makes his push against the fractured, cold production of his backing track all the more disorientating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67ede2433b415d7b99d645bdd6420809de424a08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67ede2433b415d7b99d645bdd6420809de424a08/0_0_2232_1464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian musician Jake Webb, who performs as Methyl Ethel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian musician Jake Webb, who performs as Methyl Ethel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remote Control Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>For more</strong>: Methyl Ethel\u2019s EP Hurts to Laugh is out 10 April.

This latest single is just as stunning, but far more upbeat and frenetic, with a hook that lands somewhere between a schoolyard chant and a gospel choir, and a skipping rope beat that jerks over jaunty piano stabs like a Jackson 5 cut. Wameyo is a truly gifted vocalist, and fittingly, the last half-minute of this single is a vocal showcase akin to a religious experience, as Wameyo goes after the high notes with gusto, provides her own harmonies, gang vocals and interjections, and offers up many different sonic paths that she could travel down in the future. </p> <p><strong>For more</strong>: Wameyo plays various events throughout March and April, including Brunswick Music Festival on 17 March, Adelaide U Ball with Montaigne on 21 March, and Sounds of Adelaide on 5 April.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"211ca25a89553722f9b6356d5692bd09dd80d011\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211ca25a89553722f9b6356d5692bd09dd80d011/0_0_2048_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian musician Elsy Wameyo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elsy Wameyo\u2019s single Pastor is a vocal showcase akin to a religious experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Music in Exile</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Violent Soho \u2013 Lying on the Floor</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of</strong>: Superchunk, Veruca Salt, Dinosaur Jr</p> <p>The first two singles we heard from Violent Soho\u2019s forthcoming fifth album made a strong case for mediocrity. Not musically, mind \u2013 they were both impressive showcases of their strongest go-to sounds: the soft/loud grunge of Nirvana and The Pixies, and a Range Life-meets-Neil Young twang that skates by slowly, stoned and smiling. Lyrically, however, both songs pleaded for an easy respite from existential aches. New single Lying on the Floor continues this timely theme, with vocalist Luke Boerdam combating the weight of the world by simply lying on the floor. You Am I producer Greg Wales helmed this recording, and his bright, guitar-heavy production suits the band\u2019s Livid-era sensibilities to a tee. The result is perhaps the most \u201cperfect\u201d sounding Violent Soho single to date, in which all the musical parts sit together well, the riff sounds like vintage J Mascis, and everything in Mansfield remains A-OK.</p> <p><strong>For more</strong>: Violent Soho\u2019s fifth album Everything Is A-OK will be out on 3 April.</p> <h2><strong>The Smith Street Band \u2013 Big Smoke</strong></h2> <p><strong>For fans of</strong>: Saddle Creek, Bruce Springsteen, The Gaslight Anthem</p> <p>Wil Wagner built his band for stadiums, back porches, and punk clubs alike. He also built it, for better or worse, completely around his own persona as a singer-songwriter: his yearning strine, his smart syllables, sweat and sentiments peppered like shotgun shells across four albums, a handful of EPs, and a few standalone singles. The better of two Smith Street songs released last August was named Chips &amp; Gravy but sated waiting fans like a five-course feast; a rousing, urgent ode that could have slotted comfortably on the last Killers album (perhaps after a title change). Big Smoke is a similarly-sized tune, with Wagner aiming for Springsteen territory. Figuratively speaking, he lands square in Jersey on a last-chance power drive. This isn\u2019t their first attempt at a Bruce-sized sound \u2013 the band\u2019s name is a take on the E-Street Band after all \u2013 but it\u2019s by far their most successful.</p> <p><strong>For more</strong>: The Smith Street Band are touring Australia this month.

This environmentally-charged song calls for solutions not excuses, and comes from a place of \u201cfrustration and impatience\u201d, according to L-Fresh. Despite the uncanny timing, Mother was actually written three years previously, for a TED-X performance. Electronic duo Moza produced the spritely \u201990s-leaning track, while frequent collaborator Mirrah provides sunny backing vocals.

      "bodyText": "The demise of AAP has unexpectedly ignited a war of words between media companies over who is to blame. According to News Corp \u2013 one of the major shareholders who actually took the decision to close AAP \u2013 the shuttering of the vital news service is the fault of digital giants Google and Facebook \u2026 and the ABC and Guardian Australia. Wait. What? In the fallout over AAP in the last few days, News Corp has used its significant real estate to attack both media organisations, with articles appearing in the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and other Murdoch titles shifting blame to competitors. A page three story in the Australian on Friday accused Guardian Australia of \u201cgobsmacking hypocrisy\u201d for reporting that, along with the very compelling financial reasons for closing the service, News Corp and Nine told staff they no longer wanted to subsidise a breaking news service for their competitors. Neither News nor Nine have denied making the comments. The AAP chairman, Campbell Reid, fired off a statement after the Guardian report saying it was \u201cone of the very companies that slashed the amount it was prepared to pay for AAP\u201d. A senior executive for News Corp, Reid is also furious with the media union, the MEAA, for questioning News Corp\u2019s motives for suddenly closing the wire service and throwing 600 people into unemployment. \u201c[The Guardian] is one of the organisations whose decisions have contributed to the closure of AAP and it and the [Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance\u2019s] leadership should confront the bigger, tectonic forces our entire industry faces rather than trot out this arrant nonsense,\u201d Reid thundered. Guardian Australia\u2019s editor, Lenore Taylor, who was not given a right of reply by the Oz, says: \u201cWe were offered a discount by AAP when we renegotiated last year because we were using fewer services as we expanded our own reporting teams.\u201d \u201cMr Reid\u2019s statement is based on false premises,\u201d Taylor said on Twitter. \u201cNo one at Guardian Australia has ever suggested the decision to close AAP was made primarily to hurt small media organisations. We have written that it was a commercial decision. We did publish what Mr Reid TOLD staff at AAP \u2013 that as well as commercial considerations, News and Nine felt they were propping up a news wire that helped competitors.\u201d Then there was that other whipping boy, the public broadcaster. An editorial in the Daily Telegraph argued that Aunty\u2019s free content was cutting their lunch. \u201cAdditionally, AAP found itself competing with an ever-expanding ABC, which in defiance of the public good and media viability now dominates a great deal of the online realm through tax-funded content,\u201d editor Ben English editorialised. \u201cThe forthcoming loss of AAP will be a crushing blow to media diversity, brought about by behemoth organisations that care little for a plurality of sources.\u201d Climate of denial We know that News Corp is responsible for much of the climate denial published in the Australian media \u2013 no matter what Rupert Murdoch claimed \u2013 but now we have some hard data to put it in context. First the good news. Reporting on bushfires is now far more likely to mention climate change, a study by Monash University has found. The report from the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub, found that 49% of the media coverage of the recent bushfires mentioned climate change, compared with 5% of reports about Black Saturday in 2009. The researchers analysed 1% of articles between 1 September and 31 January and found only 5% of overall coverage featured climate denialism, down from 21% in 2009. But it was News Corp publications that represented 59% of all the denialist discussion of climate change. The former Fairfax papers, now owned by Nine Entertainment, made up 19% of denialism. The coverage of protests by school children and Extinction Rebellion showed that, of the 2% of articles that criticised the actions of the protesters, a whopping 84% appeared in News Corp. Return to sender The ABC wants the government to reverse its decision to impose an $84m indexation pause, an unlikely outcome with the details of cuts to staff and services due to be unveiled this month and no sign of the government softening. But before the ABC managing director, David Anderson, could make a final plea to parliamentarians on Tuesday, the delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations between the communications minister and the ABC were leaked to the papers \u2013 twice. A letter written by the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, to Anderson appeared in the pages of the Sydney Morning Herald. Fletcher had \u201cstrongly urged\u201d the ABC to consider selling its capital city offices to cope with the $84m budget cut. Anderson addressed the suggestion in Senate estimates later that day, saying the property portfolio had been examined many times and the idea was not new. He also told senators the summer bushfires added an extra $3m in emergency broadcasting costs to the ABC budget at a time when the corporation had to absorb an ongoing annual budget cut of $105.9m. That $105.9m figure represents all the cuts the Coalition has made to Aunty between 2014, when Tony Abbott promised no cuts to the ABC or SBS, and 2022, when the indexation pause ends. The next day the Australian had another leaked letter, this time from Anderson to Fletcher. Anderson said if the government reversed the cuts the corporation would find $10m to fund additional regional services. \u201cIf indexation was restored, combined with savings and efficiencies that the ABC has identified in recent months, the corporation would be in a position to commit an additional investment of up to $10m per annum to employ more journos in regional Australia and generate more content from regions for local and international stories,\u201d the MD wrote. With the defence minister, Linda Reynolds, angrily insisting it was an \u201cindexation pause\u201d and ABC executives saying it was a cut, we can\u2019t see the negotiations being successful. PM hater gets spiked The ABC\u2019s editorial director, Craig McMurtrie, was grilled at estimates about whether there had been any political interference in ABC News in relation to a report about sports rorts and another about a Rural Fire Service volunteer, Paul Parker, who told the prime minister to \u201cget fucked from Nelligen\u201d in a viral news clip. ABC\u2019s Media Watch revealed last month that a news story about Parker was filed for the ABC\u2019s 7pm bulletin but didn\u2019t run. Then the story was slated to run on News Breakfast, only that didn\u2019t run either. ABC management told Media Watch it had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with \u201caccuracy, newsworthiness and priorities\u201d. McMurtrie told senators the story didn\u2019t run on the news bulletin because it was unclear whether he had been sacked or was stood down. At the next opportunity the story wasn\u2019t run because the \u201cnews cycle had moved\u201d, he said \u201cThe important thing was that the newsroom had made the call and there was no pressure or intervention,\u201d McMurtrie said. What did emerge from the exchange was that Anderson has never had a call from Scott Morrison personally \u2013 but he has received emailed complaints from the PM\u2019s office. Anderson said the PMO emailed him about a story on the Lilli Pilli sports club, and after the story was examined it was amended and a correction published because it was based on a false assumption in a Facebook post. The story didn\u2019t meet ABC editorial standards, McMurtrie said, and it had nothing to do with political influence. \u201cOn 20 January, ABC News Online published a story that suggested the Lilli Pilli Soccer Club may have had prior knowledge of a Sport Australia grant for the second stage of the expansion of its clubhouse,\u201d the ABC correction says. The ABC accepts that was not the case.\u201d Deep-fried journalism Journalists snickered on Monday when a media release arrived in their inboxes trumpeting a world-first event: the first official KFC wedding. \u201cHaving had their first date in KFC in 2017, Kate and Harrison applied to the KFC Weddings competition in September last year and were the first lucky couple to be wed through KFC Weddings,\u201d the media release said. \u201cHaving won the competition for their take on the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme tune about their love, Kate and Harrison surprised 150 guests to the KFC Wedding complete with the KFC Food Truck, personalised buckets and Colonel themed celebrant and entertainer.\u201d However, the PR firm that sent out the release and their clients KFC had the last laugh. Multiple Australian and international outlets, including news.com.au, 7news.com.au, the Daily Telegraph, 10 Daily, Pedestrian TV, Toowoomba Chronicle, the Courier Mail and KIIS 1065 covered the stunt, complete with multiple pictures and video. Most stories had bylines, and some were even pay-walled. Expect more of this press-release journalism when AAP shutters in June. Bidet, mate! Before we leave the subject of dumb press releases the great toilet paper shortage provided some publicists with priceless opportunities to flog their clients. We heard from one PR agent on behalf of a manufacturer of bidets. She wondered if Weekly Beast would like to interview him: \u201cIn light of the toilet paper shortage over coronavirus fears I thought you might be interested in talking about bidets\u201d. The manufacturer could talk about: how bidet seats work \u2013 \u201cthey are often retrofitted on your existing toilet taking the place of the old toilet seat\u201d; how they \u201cprovide a better clean than toilet paper and how they are eco-friendly\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to read Suzanne Wrack\u2019s full match report from the ground in Orlando. And the United States have won 2-0 over England behind goals by Press and Lloyd in the SheBelieves Cup opener for both sides. 90 min+2: Relentless pressure from the US, to the last. They\u2019re desperate for a third. 90 min: The fourth official signals for three minutes of added time. 89 min: One more sub for each side as Jessica McDonald comes on for Carli Lloyd and Chloe Kelly replaces Nikita Parris. 87 min: Very ponderous play from England over the last few minutes, kicking it about casually in the back third as if they were the team ahead 2-0 and not the other way around. 85 min: The US win a corner and take it quickly, but the delivery to Lloyd at the far post is overcooked and it\u2019s out for an England throw-in. 81 min: Parris finds England in the center of the area and it\u2019s a golden chance to cut the deficit in half, but she misfires on the half volley. 79 min: Amid a forest of England defenders, Lloyd threads a tight pass to a wide-open Ertz, who pounds it past Telford into the back of the net. But her celebration is correctly muted as the flag is up. 78 min: Chelsea star Beth England enters for Ellen White. 76 min: The US win a free kick from a dangerous area, center of the pitch about 22 yards from goal. Rapinoe steps up to take it but crushes it well over the bar into the stands. England almost immediately are dispossessed and Julie Ertz has a go from distance but her shot is off target. 72 min: Lloyd creates a bit of space for herself in the area and rips a rising shot toward the upper right corner that sails over the crossbar by inches. Very nearly a third for the Americans and a double for the captain. 70 min: Two more subs for the United States and Sam Mewis and Lynn Williams enter for Tobin Heath and Rose Lavelle. England counter immediately with Toni Duggan coming on for Georgia Stanway. 67 min: Attacking center midfielder Rose Lavelle races back to her own 18-yard line to make a picturesque tackle on Hemp. The girl\u2019s a bit special. It\u2019s out for one corner then another, but England can\u2019t get anything from either. 64 min: Neville makes his first chance of the night as Jordan Nobbs enters for Jill Scott. 61 min: Stanway is on the receiving end of a hard foul and she\u2019s down in a heap, but makes it to her feet and will continue. Now the United States will make the first substitution of the night, inserting Megan Rapinoe for Christen Press. 57 min: Parris gets behind Sauerbrunn and it\u2019s a moment of genuine danger for the US, but Naeher arrives in time to swallow it up. And the Americans have doubled their pleasure through the veteran Carli Lloyd, who runs onto a perfect ball from Lindsey Horan and deposits from 10 yards for her 123rd international goal. England look washed. A superb goal by Press, who curls it into the upper right corner from 25 yards. Sensational finish. 52 min: England win a corner. It falls to Heath and she\u2019s fouled by Stanway, who appeared to yank her ponytail and is lucky to escape without discipline. 49 min: England\u2019s back four at sixes and sevens and Lloyd nearly capitalizes, only for her shot to be deflected out by Bright for a corner. Heath\u2019s deliver finds an onrushing Horan, but the midfielder\u2019s header sails over the crossbar. 46 min: And we\u2019re back under way in Orlando as England move rapidly into the final third only to be turned away by O\u2019Hara, who\u2019s been typically excellent tonight. And there\u2019s the whistle for the intermission. When these sides last crossed paths in the World Cup semi-finals, they\u2019d scored three goals by this point. They\u2019ve combined for zero tonight, but certainly not for lack of trying. Plenty of chances both ways, though the Americans have looked dominant for longer stretches. 45 min: The imperious Heath, still miffed from by the referee\u2019s decision, backs her defender into the area before ripping a shot toward the near post that Telford saves. USA get nothing from the corner as Hemp is fouled in the box. 41 min: Press finds Dunn on an overlapping run up the left side but it\u2019s swept out for a corner kick. Can the US finally break through for an opener here? They can\u2019t as Heath\u2019s delivery is partially clared by Houghton before Dunn\u2019s second effort is hauled in by the overworked Telford. 38 min: A bit of a quiet patch over the last couple of minutes, by this match\u2019s standards at least. Heath takes Greenwood on 1v1 at the edge of the area and she goes down in the box, but the referee doesn\u2019t award the penalty despite jeers from the crowd and Heath\u2019s irate protest from the ground. 32 min: Tobin Heath receives the ball in acres of space on the right edge of the area. She picks out Lloyd in the middle but her shot misses the mark. Feeling like only a matter of time before the Americans break through. 30 min: Moments after Naeher calmly saves an Ellen White effort from 25 yards, Lavelle makes a nifty move to beat Walsh and fires in a pass to Lloyd which the veteran strike can\u2019t quite deposit home. The United States continue to dominate the action with nothing to show for their efforts after a half hour. 26 min: England win a corner and Walsh\u2019s offering finds a seam in USA\u2019s zonal marking, but Parris\u2019s flick is corralled by Naeher. 23 min: Chance after chance for the world champions over the last couple of minutes. It\u2019s hard to keep up. Dunn moments ago. Horan just now after yet another poor breakdown by the England back line. Carly Telford, who makes a double save to improbably keep things level, surely earning her paycheck tonight. 20 min: England nearly open the scoring against the run of play when Walsh finds Parris in the area, but her shot is headed directly to Naeher\u2019s waiting hands. The lineswoman ruled it offside anyways. 18 min: Ertz, who\u2019s earning her 100th cap tonight, is down in a heap after a rough challenge from Houghton. After a brief pause, she makes it to her feet and stays in the game. And lest we forget the obligatory proud husband mention: 16 min: The US have been dominant so far but haven\u2019t been able to put one in. Now Crystal Dunn surges forward into the area and is taken down by a clattering challenge but the referee says play on. 12 min: USA win another corner but Heath appears to mishit it and it\u2019s easily cleared by England. A rollocking start to this one so far with no shortage of two-way action. 9 min: A marauding Hemp surges down the left and takes on O\u2019Hara, crossing in to an onrushing White. Ertz arrives in the nick of time to head it away and Naeher is there to retrieve it. 7 min: England win a corner and Greenwood\u2019s offering targets Bright on the far post, but she can\u2019t direct it on goal and it\u2019s out for a goal kick. 5 min: Lloyd, who\u2019s making her 292nd appearance tonight, runs onto a through ball and has the first scoring chance of the night as the crowd swells, but Telford is quick off her line and turns it away. The offside flag was up, so it wouldn\u2019t have counted regardless. 3 min: USA\u2019s pressure is paying early dividends and England\u2019s back four find themselves under duress in the early going. The Americans win a free kick from about 30 yards when Stanway commits a foul. Heath\u2019s left-footed delivery curves dangerously into the area but it\u2019s headed partially out before Ellen White kicks it clear. 1 min: And we\u2019re off! The USA in all-blue kits are working from left to right, the Lionesses in all-white strips attacking from right to left. Already the United States showing a high press with Lloyd and Press. The players are on the pitch. The anthems have been played. We should be under way any moment on a clear 82F (28C) evening in Orlando. England are seeking a third win in their last eight games. The USA have won 11 out of 12, conceding just three goals, and haven\u2019t lost in 14 months. USA and England are set to kick off in about 10 minutes. Our Suzanne Wrack is on the ground in Orlando and checks in with the following dispatch: In the fading light of downtown Orlando fans have begun to flow into the purple seats of the Exploria Stadium. A healthy smattering of fans braved the heat for the earlier fixture between Spain and Japan. The floodlights are on for the big one. This is the first meeting of the US and England since their World Cup semi-final encounter. There was a huge roar as the USWNT players entered the pitch to warm up. The big shock is that once again Megan Rapinoe sits this tie out. Then, it was with a hamstring strain. This time the forward is not injured but the US are being careful with the veteran star. Neville has stuck to his guns in blooding young talent with Leah Williamson and Georgia Stanway in and 19-year-old Lauren Hemp making her first start. Beth England misses out on a start, presumably because she played in the intense Continental Cup final at the weekend ... then again, so did Millie Bright and Williamson. A few days ago there were 12,000 tickets sold for this game, a fair way short of the 22,761 average achieved by MLS side Orlando City, but a leap on the 5,565 average achieved by Orlando Pride in 2019. Regardless on how full the stadium gets US Soccer have pulled out the stops outside the ground with free drinks, banner making, foot darts and more. Here\u2019s a look at tonight\u2019s teams. Megan Rapinoe will start out on the bench for the world champions, while rising Manchester City star Lauren Hemp gets her first start for the Lionesses in a signpost of Phil Neville\u2019s youth movement. USA XI: Naeher, O\u2019Hara, Dahlkemper, Sauerbrunn, Dunn, Ertz, Lavelle, Horan, Heath, Lloyd, Press Subs: Pugh, Mewis, Sullivan, Krieger, Davidson, Williams, Sonnett, Rapinoe, Harris, Short, Franch, McDonald England XI: Telford, Greenwood, Walsh, Houghton, Bright, Parris, Scott, Williamson, Stanway, White, Hemp Subs: Daly, England, Nobbs, Duggan, Stokes, Roebuck, McManus, Staniforth, Russo, MacIver, Kelly, Fisk Hello! Welcome to Orlando\u2019s Exploria Stadium for the SheBelieves Cup match between USA and England. It\u2019s the first meeting between these sides since last year\u2019s cracking World Cup semi-final (a night Ellen White won\u2019t soon forget) and the Lionesses will be out for revenge on opening night of the four-team, round-robin competition. Kickoff is just under a half hour away so we\u2019ll dispense with the throat-clearing and get to the team sheets directly. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s lookahead to today\u2019s match.",

On Friday the state\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant said a second health worker at the Dorothy Henderson aged care facility in north Sydney has been diagnosed with the virus. Four residents of the home have tested positive, including a 95 year-old woman who died. Health authorities are also contacting the families of 17 school students who visited residents of the home. Earlier in the week a doctor at Ryde hospital tested positive, with authorities trying to contact attendees of a radiology conference he attended. It follows a baby girl in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory being diagnosed with the virus on Thursday. Health authorities have said the aim is now to curb the spread of the disease rather than contain it. Meanwhile 61 staff at Sydney\u2019s Ryde Hospital were placed in self-isolation and 56 patients have been identified as close or casual contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case. At Liverpool Hospital, in the same city, 23 staff and five patients have been identified as potential close contacts of a confirmed case. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has warned the worst-case scenario for Australia was \u201cmillions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d but that the country\u2019s public health systems were well prepared if widespread outbreaks occurred. As the federal government announced new travel control measures affecting South Korea, New South Wales authorities said they were also trying to contact 70 doctors who attended a radiology conference with a man diagnosed with the virus. Public health physician Dr Nicola Spurrier said the baby in Adelaide is the daughter of a 40-year-old woman hospitalised in the Flinders Medical Centre with the virus. The woman arrived in Adelaide from Iran via Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. \u201cThe little bub, the child of the mother that is currently in Flinders Medical Centre, has tested positive but I am very pleased to report that the child is well and both mother and baby are doing well in that facility,\u201d Spurrier said. She said a 58-year-old man, from Taiwan, arrived in Adelaide on Tuesday and was taken to the Royal Adelaide hospital to be isolated on Thursday after also being diagnosed. The Northern Territory\u2019s health department is contact testing all passengers on Qantas flight QF840 which arrived in Darwin at midday on Tuesday after a 52-year-old man tested positive to the virus there. Western Australia recorded its third case of coronavirus and its first case not associated with the Diamond Princess cruise ship \u2013 a woman in her 30s who returned to the state this week after travelling to Iceland and London, and flying home via Dubai. The woman remains in home isolation. Of the cases throughout Australia, 10 have been associated with the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 15 involved direct or indirect travel to Wuhan, China, and 12 involved direct or indirect travel to Iran. Six cases involved travel to other affected countries. The source of infection is unknown in four cases, all in NSW, including the elderly woman who died. Flight details for more confirmed cases have been released by health authorities: a 36-year-old woman from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches returned from Iran on 24 February on Emirates flight EK416 from Dubai and has been admitted to hospital. A 60-year-old woman arrived in Sydney on 3 March on Cebu Pacific flight 5J39 from the Philippines. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said \u201ccontainment is likely to be an unlikely outcome, so we need to work constructively with the community to continue our effort to emphasise to the community that [controlling the virus] is a partnership \u2026 Our community has to be doing everything they can do to support us in defeating what has really become a war in defeating this coronavirus\u201d. However, authorities have said slowing any spread so that the health system is not overwhelmed would be key to Australia\u2019s response. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Thursday increased travel restrictions for South Korea as cases in the country approached 6,000. Morrison said people should reconsider travel there. Entry bans remain in place for visitors coming from China and Iran, and citizens and permanent residents returning from those countries are required to self-isolate for 14 days. Murphy, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, said the federal government \u2013 which last week enacted its pandemic preparation plan \u2013 was \u201clooking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d. \u201cWe think our health system is well prepared to cope with that, but we are making sure. Clearly the community has had some concerns about the outbreak in Sydney, the small community outbreak, but this is a very small cluster of cases. There is no other evidence of community transmission anywhere else in Australia.\u201d He added that over the coming weeks there would be extra facilities dedicated to coronavirus testing. \u201cThe labs are coping brilliantly with a load that they have but we will need the private labs if we\u2019re to do more testing as further cases emerge, so that is being finalised and sorted out over the next few days,\u201d he said. The Northern Territory is developing a remote health pandemic plan, due to be released on Monday, to help manage any potential outbreaks of Covid-19 in remote Indigenous communities. One remote community in the APY lands has already contacted minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, wanting to restrict access for outsiders to help protect against the disease, he revealed on the ABC on Thursday evening. NT chief medical officer Dianne Stephens said earlier it was unclear if any Indigenous people from remote communities were on the same plane as the tourist diagnosed with the virus, and it was impossible to determine how many people may have come into contact with the man since his arrival in the NT. Stephens acknowledged the \u201csignificant\u201d logistical problems with posing self-isolation as a response in remote communities where overcrowding in housing is a major issue. \u2022 Lorena Allam and Jack Banister contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Australian hip-hop artist Sampa the Great has made history by becoming the first person to win the Australian music prize twice. Her 2019 album The Return was announced on Friday as the latest winner of the prestigious $30,000 award \u2013 only two years after she first won for 2017 album Birds and the BEE9. It is the first time in the prize\u2019s 15-year history that an artist has won multiple times. Previous winners include Gurrumul, Augie March, Courtney Barnett and AB Original. On Friday the Melbourne-based musician thanked the judging panel for recognising an album \u201cnot written for radio play or commercial appeal\u201d that dealt with themes of migration and displacement. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m able to create my most vulnerable music and have it supported over the years has been amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank the AMP for recognising the music and stories behind The Return. \u201cIt was written to bring to light the journey of a person who began her career in a country far away from home. It was to bring to light the sense of displacement felt in that journey and in a global sense throughout the world.\u201d Born in Zambia, Sampa Tembo moved to Australia in 2014 (via the US) and broke into the music scene with her debut mixtape, The Great Mixtape. On Friday one of the music prize judgees, Phil Jamieson from the band Grinspoon, said The Return was \u201can absolute magnificent work of art\u201d in a \u201csensational shortlist\u201d. Also nominated for this year\u2019s prize were Julia Jacklin, Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds, Thelma Plum, and Amyl &amp; the Sniffers. \u201cI would like to thank everyone behind The Return,\u201d Tembo said. The executive producer \u2026 The community within the music. My parents and my family.\u201d Last year Tembo won the Aria award for best hip-hop release for single Final Form from The Return.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1) Bournemouth in </strong><strong>belly of a wounded beast</strong></h2> \n<p>Given their 22-point lead at the top, no one at Liverpool is likely to be concerned by three recent defeats in four games across three different competitions. Of course, while a win against Bournemouth would help steady the ship and halt the onset of anything approaching mild jitters, Eddie Howe\u2019s men will head to Anfield to face hosts recently derobed of what had previously resembled a cloak of invincibility. With Fabinho in poor form and Jordan Henderson still injured, Liverpool look uncharacteristically vulnerable in midfield and are crying out for on-field leadership. While it ought to come in the form of James Milner, who returned from injury during their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/03/chelsea-liverpool-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report\">FA Cup defeat at </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/03/chelsea-liverpool-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report\">Chelsea</a>, Bournemouth will still fancy their chances. There is never a good time for a relegation-threatened team to venture into the belly of the beast that is the champions-elect, but if you had to pick your moment, now seems a better one than any other. <strong>Barry Glendenning</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Liverpool v Bournemouth (Saturday, 12.30pm \u2013 all times GMT)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a481f1b2-5307-4ce7-8d6e-ca13cf868a19\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2) West Ham to stay on </strong><strong>front foot?</strong></h2> \n<p>Well used to playing in a soulless, concrete, enormo-bowl largely ill-suited for footballing purpose, West Ham ought to feel right at home at the Emirates when they ramp up their efforts to drag themselves away from the relegation zone. In victory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/west-ham-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">against Southampton last week</a>, David Moyes opted to partner two up front in Michail Antonio and S\u00e9bastien Haller, an uncharacteristically bold move that paid dividends with both strikers scoring and Antonio, in particular, causing Southampton\u2019s defence no end of problems. Away from home, Moyes could be forgiven for reverting to a more cautious approach, but the prospect of facing Arsenal is not as daunting as it used to be, the Emirates is anything but a cauldron and with Mikel Arteta\u2019s team often error-prone in defence, opting for a front-foot approach once again could yield handsome rewards. <strong>BG</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Arsenal v West Ham (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<h2>3) Will Fernandes cause United to be more attacking in derby?</h2> \n<p>United\u2019s recent home results in the Manchester derby neatly demonstrate the shifting local balance of power. In their last 10 meetings with City at Old Trafford, United have lost seven times, winning twice and just once in the league, back in 2015. They have had much more joy at the Etihad Stadium, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">a league win</a> built on sharp counter attacks and stoic defence last December. The challenge here is to be more proactive, something that has not come easily in the eight years since City overcame their own psychological block with the 6-1 rout that began their purple patch. Bruno Fernandes, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/mar/01/bruno-fernandes-makes-manchester-uniteds-midfield-function-again\">has injected confidence and creativity</a> since his arrival, could make the difference. The playmaker is not afraid to lead the attacking charge, and was a constant menace against Everton. Fernandes\u2019s bravado may help United come out of their shell and take on a City side who have won six out of their last seven away games \u2013 a run that began at Old Trafford, in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/07/manchester-united-manchester-city-carabao-cup-match-report\">League Cup semi-final</a>. <strong>Niall McVeigh</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Manchester United v Manchester City (Sunday, 4.30pm)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ce8bb4d8d435f49e3575bd970a194e5c31da37a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ce8bb4d8d435f49e3575bd970a194e5c31da37a/268_180_2937_1763/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernardo Silva scored a sublime goal for Manchester City in their last visit to Old Trafford in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernardo Silva scored a sublime goal for City in their last visit to Old Trafford in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>4) Can Everton improve against </strong><strong>leading sides?</strong></h2> \n<p>Chelsea are the highest-placed team that Everton have beaten this season, and one of only three sides in the top half against whom they have so far prevailed. On the plus side, they still have plenty of chances to improve this record: Southampton, who are due at Stamford Bridge on 18 April, are the only team currently in the bottom half that they are due to play between early February and the start of May. This is the third game of a particularly testing run (Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Leicester, Tottenham) from which they have so far taken one point. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">3-1 win over Chelsea at Goodison Park</a> three months ago was the first match under Duncan Ferguson\u2019s emotionally-charged, ballboy-bothering temporary charge, and achieved with only 30% of possession. This is Chelsea\u2019s fifth home fixture in three weeks; their next is due on 12 April. <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Chelsea v Everton (Sunday, 2pm)</em></p> \n<h2>5) Europa League places at stake at Turf Moor?</h2> \n<p>Burnley are about the last opponents an attack as depleted and blunted as Tottenham\u2019s would wish to play at the moment. Sean Dyche\u2019s side have conceded only twice in their past six games, four of which have been won and none lost. How positive Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will be in response to Spurs\u2019 latest calamitous setback, the FA Cup exit to Norwich, will be one point of intrigue in a match that might be seen as a tussle for the Europa League places. Mourinho has more attacking riches than he makes out but Burnley\u2019s parsimony at the back is complemented by their having the more in-form options going forward, with Chris Wood, Dwight McNeil, Matej Vydra Jay Rodriguez all posing a threat of late. In this context, a draw would be a decent result for Spurs but it would be unlikely to lift the angst in N17. <strong>Tom Davies</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Burnley v Tottenham (Saturday, 5.30pm)</em></p> \n<h2>6) Ings and Djenepo to return for Saints</h2> \n<p>All eyes will be on Danny Ings this week, with the striker set to return to the Saints starting XI after an injury saw him fit only for the bench in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/west-ham-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">last week\u2019s defeat at West Ham</a>. With both Nathan Redmond and Stuart Armstrong sidelined for Saturday\u2019s game with Newcastle, this is great news for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl \u2013 Ings has contributed 12 of Southampton\u2019s last 25 league goals \u2013 but the return of another forward, Moussa Djenepo will be just as welcome. The 21-year-old returned to Mali last month for his mother\u2019s funeral, and has understandably now come back to England with a heavy heart. \u201cWe are all helping him to get back to the Moussa we know because he was always the most positive guy in the squad,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said this week. Sport can often be a positive outlet for grief, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheffieldUnited/status/123373063\">Billy Sharp so eloquently explained</a> this week regarding the death of his son in 2011, and here\u2019s hoping that Djenepo can find some peace when he crosses the white line on Saturday. <strong>Michael Butler</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Southampton v Newcastle (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06b5fbbcb4a09f68c93b47c56ca950247c6da643\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b5fbbcb4a09f68c93b47c56ca950247c6da643/604_28_4361_2616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moussa Djenepo returned to Mali for his mother\u2019s funeral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moussa Djenepo returned to Mali for his mother\u2019s funeral.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>7) A close match, and goals, at Bramall Lane</strong></h2> \n<p>It is now two and a half years since the Norwich coach was delayed by traffic on its way to Bramall Lane, the Canaries won 1-0 and Chris Wilder raged in impotent fury: \u201cThere might be a bit of traffic at a football stadium when about 28,000 are turning up. Do a little bit of homework and possibly set off 10 minutes earlier.\u201d That incident, followed by the sides\u2019 battle for promotion last season and the general closeness of their recent matches \u2013 this year brings the 10th anniversary of the last game between them to have a winning margin of more than a single goal \u2013 has created a rivalry that continues to bubble however much Wilder now plays it down, insisting that he was just being \u201ca grumpy old git\u201d when riled in 2017. Expect better punctuality from the Canaries this weekend. In other news, Sheffield United have scored precisely two goals in each of their last four games against Norwich; the Canaries have scored precisely one goal in four of their last five games against the Blades; there have been only three goalless draws in 72 previous meetings, the most recent more than 20 years and 22 meetings ago. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Sheffield United v Norwich (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<h2><strong>8) The start of a horror run for ailing Brighton</strong></h2> \n<p>Brighton have taken only five points from the past 24 available, in a run of eight games where they faced four of the five teams currently beneath them and only Chelsea and Sheffield United from inside the top half. While Leicester\u2019s success in making it to the FA Cup quarter-finals mean their game against Brighton on 22 March is likely to be postponed, Graham Potter\u2019s side must face four of the top six (Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Wolves), Arsenal and elegation rivals Norwich in their next six games. It is a comparatively daunting run that begins at Molineux, continues when they host the Gunners and is then followed by a two-week break. Getting points on the board before that hiatus looks imperative for Brighton and they can take heart from the four points they took from the reverse fixtures in early December. At home against Wolves they should have been out of sight by half-time in a match that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/brighton-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">finished </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/brighton-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">2-2</a> and Potter is likely to hark back to that stirring performance as he seeks to motivate his team. <strong>BG</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Wolves v Brighton (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<h2><strong>9) Pereyra or Welbeck must step up for Watford</strong></h2> \n<p>Watford sprung the surprise of the season by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/watford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">thrashing Liverpool last week</a> and will look to continue that momentum against a Crystal Palace side that are all but safe. The Liverpool match was only the 10th this season in which Watford have been able to start their first-choice front three of Gerard Deulofeu, Troy Deeney and Isma\u00efla Sarr \u2013 the 18 points they have won in those games, which include two meetings with Liverpool as well as fixtures against Manchester United, Leicester, Tottenham and Wolves, suggest that with the trio fit they could get 68 over a full season, enough for Europa League qualification in 18 of the last 20 seasons and a Champions League place in seven of them. As it is they find themselves 17th and Deulofeu\u2019s knee ligament injury means they will not all feature again this season, so the pressure is on his replacement \u2013 either the frequently ineffective Roberto Pereyra or the often injured Danny Welbeck \u2013 to raise the team to a similar standard. Only two teams have faced the full Deulofeu-Deeney-Sarr front three and not conceded, and Palace, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/watford-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">in the goalless draw at Vicarage Road</a> in December, are one of them. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Crystal Palace v Watford (Saturday, 3pm)</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>10) How much respect should Smith show Leicester?</h2> \n<p>The swagger Leicester showed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/aston-villa-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">swatting aside Aston Villa 4-1</a> in December has rarely been seen since \u2013 with Villa among the teams to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/aston-villa-leicester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">prosper from its absence</a> in the Carabao Cup semi-finals \u2013 so this rematch offers a perfect opportunity for the Foxes to reassert their top-four credentials. Brendan Rodgers saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/leicester-city-birmingham-city-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report\">midweek FA Cup win over Birmingham</a> as a springboard. \u201cIt was important to get back to our game,\u201d he said. \u201cThese players have been absolutely incredible through the course of this season \u2013 and their honesty will get them back to their level.\u201d Villa in theory are comfortably beatable opponents, and travel on the back of four straight defeats. The last of those was the creditable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/01/aston-villa-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final-match-report\">2-1 loss to Manchester City</a> in the Carabao Cup final, which gives Dean Smith something of a tactical dilemma: keep with the four at the back to which he switched for Wembley, or revert to three central defenders? How much respect will he want to show a team who after all have vied with City for second place for much of this campaign? <strong>TD</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Leicester v Aston Villa (Monday,

      "bodyText": "1) Bournemouth in belly of a wounded beast Given their 22-point lead at the top, no one at Liverpool is likely to be concerned by three recent defeats in four games across three different competitions. Of course, while a win against Bournemouth would help steady the ship and halt the onset of anything approaching mild jitters, Eddie Howe\u2019s men will head to Anfield to face hosts recently derobed of what had previously resembled a cloak of invincibility. With Fabinho in poor form and Jordan Henderson still injured, Liverpool look uncharacteristically vulnerable in midfield and are crying out for on-field leadership. While it ought to come in the form of James Milner, who returned from injury during their FA Cup defeat at Chelsea, Bournemouth will still fancy their chances. There is never a good time for a relegation-threatened team to venture into the belly of the beast that is the champions-elect, but if you had to pick your moment, now seems a better one than any other. Barry Glendenning \u2022 Liverpool v Bournemouth (Saturday, 12.30pm \u2013 all times GMT) 2) West Ham to stay on front foot? Well used to playing in a soulless, concrete, enormo-bowl largely ill-suited for footballing purpose, West Ham ought to feel right at home at the Emirates when they ramp up their efforts to drag themselves away from the relegation zone. In victory against Southampton last week, David Moyes opted to partner two up front in Michail Antonio and S\u00e9bastien Haller, an uncharacteristically bold move that paid dividends with both strikers scoring and Antonio, in particular, causing Southampton\u2019s defence no end of problems. Away from home, Moyes could be forgiven for reverting to a more cautious approach, but the prospect of facing Arsenal is not as daunting as it used to be, the Emirates is anything but a cauldron and with Mikel Arteta\u2019s team often error-prone in defence, opting for a front-foot approach once again could yield handsome rewards. BG \u2022 Arsenal v West Ham (Saturday, 3pm) 3) Will Fernandes cause United to be more attacking in derby? United\u2019s recent home results in the Manchester derby neatly demonstrate the shifting local balance of power. In their last 10 meetings with City at Old Trafford, United have lost seven times, winning twice and just once in the league, back in 2015. They have had much more joy at the Etihad Stadium, including a league win built on sharp counter attacks and stoic defence last December. The challenge here is to be more proactive, something that has not come easily in the eight years since City overcame their own psychological block with the 6-1 rout that began their purple patch. Bruno Fernandes, who has injected confidence and creativity since his arrival, could make the difference. The playmaker is not afraid to lead the attacking charge, and was a constant menace against Everton. Fernandes\u2019s bravado may help United come out of their shell and take on a City side who have won six out of their last seven away games \u2013 a run that began at Old Trafford, in the League Cup semi-final. Niall McVeigh \u2022 Manchester United v Manchester City (Sunday, 4.30pm) 4) Can Everton improve against leading sides? Chelsea are the highest-placed team that Everton have beaten this season, and one of only three sides in the top half against whom they have so far prevailed. On the plus side, they still have plenty of chances to improve this record: Southampton, who are due at Stamford Bridge on 18 April, are the only team currently in the bottom half that they are due to play between early February and the start of May. This is the third game of a particularly testing run (Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Leicester, Tottenham) from which they have so far taken one point. The 3-1 win over Chelsea at Goodison Park three months ago was the first match under Duncan Ferguson\u2019s emotionally-charged, ballboy-bothering temporary charge, and achieved with only 30% of possession. This is Chelsea\u2019s fifth home fixture in three weeks; their next is due on 12 April. Simon Burnton \u2022 Chelsea v Everton (Sunday, 2pm) 5) Europa League places at stake at Turf Moor? Burnley are about the last opponents an attack as depleted and blunted as Tottenham\u2019s would wish to play at the moment. Sean Dyche\u2019s side have conceded only twice in their past six games, four of which have been won and none lost. How positive Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will be in response to Spurs\u2019 latest calamitous setback, the FA Cup exit to Norwich, will be one point of intrigue in a match that might be seen as a tussle for the Europa League places. Mourinho has more attacking riches than he makes out but Burnley\u2019s parsimony at the back is complemented by their having the more in-form options going forward, with Chris Wood, Dwight McNeil, Matej Vydra Jay Rodriguez all posing a threat of late. In this context, a draw would be a decent result for Spurs but it would be unlikely to lift the angst in N17. Tom Davies \u2022 Burnley v Tottenham (Saturday, 5.30pm) 6) Ings and Djenepo to return for Saints All eyes will be on Danny Ings this week, with the striker set to return to the Saints starting XI after an injury saw him fit only for the bench in last week\u2019s defeat at West Ham. With both Nathan Redmond and Stuart Armstrong sidelined for Saturday\u2019s game with Newcastle, this is great news for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl \u2013 Ings has contributed 12 of Southampton\u2019s last 25 league goals \u2013 but the return of another forward, Moussa Djenepo will be just as welcome. The 21-year-old returned to Mali last month for his mother\u2019s funeral, and has understandably now come back to England with a heavy heart. \u201cWe are all helping him to get back to the Moussa we know because he was always the most positive guy in the squad,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said this week. Sport can often be a positive outlet for grief, as Billy Sharp so eloquently explained this week regarding the death of his son in 2011, and here\u2019s hoping that Djenepo can find some peace when he crosses the white line on Saturday. Michael Butler \u2022 Southampton v Newcastle (Saturday, 3pm) 7) A close match, and goals, at Bramall Lane It is now two and a half years since the Norwich coach was delayed by traffic on its way to Bramall Lane, the Canaries won 1-0 and Chris Wilder raged in impotent fury: \u201cThere might be a bit of traffic at a football stadium when about 28,000 are turning up. Do a little bit of homework and possibly set off 10 minutes earlier.\u201d That incident, followed by the sides\u2019 battle for promotion last season and the general closeness of their recent matches \u2013 this year brings the 10th anniversary of the last game between them to have a winning margin of more than a single goal \u2013 has created a rivalry that continues to bubble however much Wilder now plays it down, insisting that he was just being \u201ca grumpy old git\u201d when riled in 2017. Expect better punctuality from the Canaries this weekend. In other news, Sheffield United have scored precisely two goals in each of their last four games against Norwich; the Canaries have scored precisely one goal in four of their last five games against the Blades; there have been only three goalless draws in 72 previous meetings, the most recent more than 20 years and 22 meetings ago. SB \u2022 Sheffield United v Norwich (Saturday, 3pm) 8) The start of a horror run for ailing Brighton Brighton have taken only five points from the past 24 available, in a run of eight games where they faced four of the five teams currently beneath them and only Chelsea and Sheffield United from inside the top half. While Leicester\u2019s success in making it to the FA Cup quarter-finals mean their game against Brighton on 22 March is likely to be postponed, Graham Potter\u2019s side must face four of the top six (Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Wolves), Arsenal and elegation rivals Norwich in their next six games. It is a comparatively daunting run that begins at Molineux, continues when they host the Gunners and is then followed by a two-week break. Getting points on the board before that hiatus looks imperative for Brighton and they can take heart from the four points they took from the reverse fixtures in early December. At home against Wolves they should have been out of sight by half-time in a match that finished 2-2 and Potter is likely to hark back to that stirring performance as he seeks to motivate his team. BG \u2022 Wolves v Brighton (Saturday, 3pm) 9) Pereyra or Welbeck must step up for Watford Watford sprung the surprise of the season by thrashing Liverpool last week and will look to continue that momentum against a Crystal Palace side that are all but safe. The Liverpool match was only the 10th this season in which Watford have been able to start their first-choice front three of Gerard Deulofeu, Troy Deeney and Isma\u00efla Sarr \u2013 the 18 points they have won in those games, which include two meetings with Liverpool as well as fixtures against Manchester United, Leicester, Tottenham and Wolves, suggest that with the trio fit they could get 68 over a full season, enough for Europa League qualification in 18 of the last 20 seasons and a Champions League place in seven of them. As it is they find themselves 17th and Deulofeu\u2019s knee ligament injury means they will not all feature again this season, so the pressure is on his replacement \u2013 either the frequently ineffective Roberto Pereyra or the often injured Danny Welbeck \u2013 to raise the team to a similar standard. Only two teams have faced the full Deulofeu-Deeney-Sarr front three and not conceded, and Palace, in the goalless draw at Vicarage Road in December, are one of them. SB \u2022 Crystal Palace v Watford (Saturday, 3pm) 10) How much respect should Smith show Leicester? The swagger Leicester showed in swatting aside Aston Villa 4-1 in December has rarely been seen since \u2013 with Villa among the teams to prosper from its absence in the Carabao Cup semi-finals \u2013 so this rematch offers a perfect opportunity for the Foxes to reassert their top-four credentials. Brendan Rodgers saw the midweek FA Cup win over Birmingham as a springboard. \u201cIt was important to get back to our game,\u201d he said. \u201cThese players have been absolutely incredible through the course of this season \u2013 and their honesty will get them back to their level.\u201d Villa in theory are comfortably beatable opponents, and travel on the back of four straight defeats. The last of those was the creditable 2-1 loss to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, which gives Dean Smith something of a tactical dilemma: keep with the four at the back to which he switched for Wembley, or revert to three central defenders? How much respect will he want to show a team who after all have vied with City for second place for much of this campaign? TD \u2022 Leicester v Aston Villa (Monday, 8pm)",

      "bodyText": "The former sports minister Bridget McKenzie has reignited the sports rorts controversy by insisting she made no changes to the brief and attachments outlining successful projects funded under the sports grants scheme after 4 April 2019. In a statement on her website, the first public intervention since stepping down from the ministry, McKenzie says: \u201cI did not make any changes or annotations to this brief or its attachments after 4 April 2019. \u201cMy expectation was that the brief would be processed in a timely and appropriate manner. Nevertheless, changes were made and administrative errors occurred in processing the brief.\u201d McKenzie does not identify who made the changes. According to constitutional expert, Anne Twomey, the revelation raises the prospect that somebody else made late changes to grants without legal authority. The Australian National Audit Office told Senate estimates this week the prime minister\u2019s office had requested a last-minute change before the documents were sent to Sports Australia at 8.46am on 11 April, which was the day parliament was prorogued for the 2019 election. But another set of changes were made later that day. \u201cFor example, when I referred to one project coming out and one project coming in, in terms of the 8.46am version, that was at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office,\u201d Brian Boyd, the ANAO\u2019s performance audit services group executive director, told estimates on Monday night. \u201cBut of the changes made later that day, for the 12.43pm version, none were evident as being at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office rather than the minister\u2019s office making the changes.\u201d In her statement McKenzie suggests that any changes made after 4 April were done without her knowledge, but she accepts ultimate responsibility for the decisions. \u201cI was the minister for sport and therefore ultimately and entirely responsible for funding decisions that were signed off under my name, including and regrettably, any changes that were made unbeknown to me.\u201d The former minister suggests she only became aware of the changes through the Senate estimates process this week. \u201cThe brief authorised approved projects for the third round this included nine new and emerging projects which, it must be emphasised, had been identified and sent to Sport Australia in March for assessment in line with program guidelines.\u201d Twomey, who believes the sports grants are unconstitutional and that McKenzie lacked legal authority to make them, said the latest revelation was \u201cbizarre\u201d because it was not clear who made the changes, if not McKenzie. Twomey told Guardian Australia that even if McKenzie had legal authority, \u201c[if] the minister wasn\u2019t actually making the decision about which of those grants were approved because she made her decision on 4 April and somebody else \u2013 whether it be people in her office or whatever \u2013 made changes, that would be problematic from a legal point of view\u201d. \u201cIf you accept the Commonwealth\u2019s view that the minister is the decision-maker: either the minister\u2019s staff as her agents made decisions to approve things after [4 April], which means she made that decision \u2026 [or] if they are asserting someone else made the decision, and that it wasn\u2019t legally her decision because they were not her agents, then these actions have been taken unlawfully.\u201d Twomey said McKenzie\u2019s claims she did not make the changes showed the \u201cenormous dysfunction\u201d of the way the government had handled sports and other grants. She renewed her calls for the government to explain the basis of its claim McKenzie had authority to approve the grants. Scott Morrison has sought to distance both himself and his office from the controversy, insisting that McKenzie was the sole decision maker and characterising the role of his office as passing on representations from MPs. But the ANAO\u2019s evidence disrupted that line of defence by identifying specific changes that were made at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office. Sport Australia, the agency administering the grants, was also forced to admit this week it had provided incomplete evidence to a Senate inquiry examining the imbroglio. The agency failed to tell the inquiry it had received a second set of instructions from McKenzie\u2019s office on 11 April. Sport Australia told estimates this week McKenzie\u2019s office had told them two versions of the funding decision were sent to the agency by email on 11 April because of errors. \u201cWe were advised at 12.43pm that there were some errors in that brief and that this was the correct brief,\u201d Luke McCann, the chief operating officer at Sport Australia, told Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThat was how it was characterised by the minister\u2019s office.\u201d Labor says the sports grants saga has become a trust issue for Morrison.

The government says the card, which quarantines up to 80% of a welfare recipient\u2019s payments for use at selected stores, has led to a reduction in violence and harm related to alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling. But on Thursday night, the Senate community affairs legislation committee heard that some merchants outside the trial sites, such as \u201ccafes, restaurants, cafeterias, diners and soda fountains\u201d, could bypass the card\u2019s restrictions under the \u201cmerchant category code\u201d system. The code system allocates a number to merchants so they are able to charge items to the card and prohibits the purchase of certain items or services \u2013 such as alcohol or gambling \u2013 from \u201cdeclared\u201d outlets based on what is known as their merchant category code. The loophole is the \u201ceating places and restaurants\u201d category code, which includes places that have alcohol on the menu and are not on the government\u2019s blocked list \u2013 meaning they can still charge alcohol purchases to the cashless welfare card, using the code 5812. Ruston described the code system as \u201ca very technical question\u201d and offered the senators, including Labor\u2019s Malarndirri McCarthy, a \u201cfull technical briefing on the issues\u201d. McCarthy then asked: \u201cDoes the merchant category code 5812 enable me to buy alcohol on my CDC?\u201d Ruston replied, \u201cAt the moment, yes\u201d but said the system would soon be replaced with a more \u201cgranular\u201d means of blocking purchases at the product level. The government said it had spent $3.4m on a product-level blocking trial that departmental officials told the committee was \u201cworking so far\u201d. It has spent $50m over five years on trails of the cashless debit card, with expenditure increasing every year since then. In 2015-16 it allocated $10.9m to the trial, and spending increased every year to 2018-19, when it allocated just over $16m on the card\u2019s rollout. The card is operated by Indue and is currently being trialled in Ceduna in South Australia, East Kimberley and the Goldfields in Western Australia and Hervey Bay in Queensland.

The government says the card is automatically accepted at about 900,000 businesses across the country, including Australia Post and big retailers where alcohol is sold, such as Woolworths and Coles. But cardholders have complained about having their cards declined at retailers that do not primarily sell these banned goods. The federal government is pushing for a nationwide rollout of the controversial policy. But critics say the card causes stigma, makes it harder for people on low incomes to buy secondhand goods and is difficult to exit. The government has set aside $128m to transition all Northern Territory welfare recipients from the current income management system, the Basics card, to the cashless debit card, if the enabling legislation is passed next month. However, independent senator Jacquie Lambie says \u201cthe government has a problem\u201d with the rollout of the card, after her fact-finding visit to the Northern Territory and Western Australia over the summer. Lambie visited several remote Aboriginal communities to \u201cget a view from the ground on how the card is functioning, before voting on the government\u2019s proposed changes for its future\u201d, she said.

      "bodyText": "Australian households should not expect Kevin Rudd-style cash payments to stimulate the economy in the wake of coronavirus, Mathias Cormann has warned. The finance minister told Sky News on Friday that the government would focus on encouraging businesses to invest in and employ workers, appearing to rule out cash payments to all individuals, although measures to help sections of the population such as pensioners are still on the table. The Morrison government is working on a stimulus package believed to include a new business investment allowance, a boost to pensioners\u2019 income via deeming rates, and measures targeted at affected industries such as tourism. Cormann said the package was expected in \u201cthe next few weeks\u201d, well ahead of the May budget, which is expected to show the budget is in deficit despite the government forecasting a surplus of $5bn as recently as December. The package comes as the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, revealed that the department was forecasting a 0.7% contraction in economic growth in the March quarter, equivalent to lost activity worth about $3.5bn. On Friday Cormann said the government wanted to \u201ckeep businesses in business and keep Australians in their jobs\u201d. \u201cObviously we are going to enter a pretty challenging period, both from a public health and from an economic point of view,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cBut we also know on the other side there will be a strong recovery and we want to be sure we put Australia in the strongest possible position to maximise the recovery.\u201d Cormann said the uncertainty and anxiety caused by the external shock of coronavirus was reducing business investment, although he also conceded investment \u201cneeded to be boosted in any event\u201d.

He said the stimulus would consist of \u201ctargeted, responsible and scaleable\u201d interventions but did not rule out relief for some individuals.

In a new report on Friday, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said Australia was \u201cvulnerable\u201d to a recession and slashed its estimate of growth for the country in 2020 by a full percentage point, from 2.2% to a miserly 1.2%.

Across the Asia-Pacific region, S&amp;P expects the outbreak to carve $211bn from the incomes of households, companies and governments. Roache said a recovery would now be later in the year than S&amp;P previously forecast \u201cdue to a harder hit to China\u2019s economy in the first quarter, viral transmission outside China, and tighter financial conditions\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said it was \u201cgood to see that minister Cormann has finally acknowledged what Labor, industry groups, the Reserve Bank and economists having being saying for months now\u201d. \u201cBusiness investment was weak before the bushfires and coronavirus having gone backwards for three consecutive quarters and has been a significant drag on economic growth.\u201d",

Not because she was a woman and I am concerned about electability. Not because I am waiting for the perfect woman to run, or that the budding octogenarian that I support is a savior. But because I truly believe that social movements and political revolution transform people, communities, and the planet - not just one built around a singular candidate. I did not want Warren to leave the race before anyone else. Naively, perhaps, I assumed that the United States had shifted significantly towards an exciting future, and the candidates would wither down to Bernie or Elizabeth. I was wrong. After Super Tuesday, I realized that many voters desperately want this country to return to normal, even though \u201cnormal\u201d is oppressive for so many of us. The biggest threat to Warren and Sanders supporters was never each other.</p> \n  <p>With this in mind, Senator Warren has a choice to make. She was one of the most innovative Democratic candidates for president in this current race, and possibly in American history. Her plans for universal childcare, significant Social Security expansion, and building a green economy would have certainly improved the lives of millions of peoples across the country. Does she believe in her vision enough to support and rally her base around Senator Sanders - the only candidate whose policies dream big about what we must make possible in this country? She absolutely must.

In a ruling that questioned attorney general William Barr\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d, the judge indicated that the court would review the report and consider what additional portions can be released to the public. Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race. She has declined to endorse either Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders refocused his efforts on Michigan, leaving the south to Joe Biden. Though he was the frontrunner before Super Tuesday, Sanders is scrambling to catch up after moderates consolidated behind Biden. The Senate approved an $8bn bill to address the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Mike Pence headed to Washington, where there have been more reported coronavirus cases than in any other state. Donald Trump answered questions in a Fox News town hall held in Biden\u2019s home town Scranton, Pennsylvania. The president said he expects to face off against Biden, not Sanders, in November. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee greeted Mike Pence with an elbow bump, welcoming the vice president and other coronavirus task force members to the state\u2019s emergency operations centers. Pence and Inslee spoke to state health officials amidst a serious outbreak in the state, where there have been reported 70 cases and 11 deaths. The Guardian\u2019s Derecka Purnell writes: Senator Warren was my second choice candidate. Not because she was a woman and I am concerned about electability. Not because I am waiting for the perfect woman to run, or that the budding octogenarian that I support is a savior. But because I truly believe that social movements and political revolution transform people, communities, and the planet - not just one built around a singular candidate. I did not want Warren to leave the race before anyone else. Naively, perhaps, I assumed that the United States had shifted significantly towards an exciting future, and the candidates would wither down to Bernie or Elizabeth. I was wrong. After Super Tuesday, I realized that many voters desperately want this country to return to normal, even though \u201cnormal\u201d is oppressive for so many of us. The biggest threat to Warren and Sanders supporters was never each other. With this in mind, Senator Warren has a choice to make. She was one of the most innovative Democratic candidates for president in this current race, and possibly in American history. Her plans for universal childcare, significant Social Security expansion, and building a green economy would have certainly improved the lives of millions of peoples across the country. Does she believe in her vision enough to support and rally her base around Senator Sanders - the only candidate whose policies dream big about what we must make possible in this country? She absolutely must. Her, and our collective future, requires it. Read the full piece here: Speaking at the Fox News town hall in Scranton, Trump said he expects to be running against Joe Biden. \u201cMentally, I\u2019m all set for Bernie,\u201d he said. But after Super Tuesday, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m running against Bernie,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very hard for him to come back.\u201d He also said that Elizabeth Warren should have dropped out earlier, echoing what some Sanders supporters had said. \u201cLook if she\u2019s a true progressive, which probably she is, she should have dropped out three days ago,\u201d Trump said. Now that Elizabeth Warren has dropped out of the presidential race, we may be seeing less of her most effective surrogate: her golden retriever Bailey. But it seems that Bailey is enjoying a break, and he\u2019s already starting to let loose now that the pressure\u2019s off. It\u2019s ruff always having to be a good boy! Following Warren\u2019s public address announcing the end of her campaign, it seems Bailey helped himself to a large burrito and gulped down a good portion of it before several people lunged into action to try to remove the remnants from his mouth. Burritos, of course, are generally considered human food not meant for doggos. Still, after a hard-fought campaign, who\u2019s to say he didn\u2019t deserve it. At the Scranton town hall, in response to a supporter who asked him to tone down his rhetoric, Donald Trump said it was important to \u201chit back\u201d. \u201cWhen they hit us, we have to hit back. I really feel that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn your cheek\u201d He also provided a positive spin on the coronavirus outbreak: \u201cI have to say, people are now staying in the United States, spending their money in the US\u2014 and I like that,\u201d he said. Donald Trump, meanwhile, is in Joe Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for a town hall hosted by Fox News. This will be his first TV town hall the 2020 elections, and a rare instance where Trump will be taking questions from the public \u2014 albeit in a friendly venue set up by his favorite network. This is also Trump\u2019s first visit this year to Pennsylvania, a swing state that he won by just 44,000 votes in 2016. Bernie Sanders has canceled a trip to Mississippi, choosing to focus his efforts in Michigan and essentially leaving the south to Joe Biden. Sanders was supposed to campaign Jackson, Mississippi, along Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, on Friday. Instead, Sanders will head to Detroit for a rally tomorrow, and Grand Rapids for another event on Sunday. Speaking to reporters from his campaign headquarters in Vermont yesterday, Sanders said that Michigan would be \u201cwhere we will spend a bit of our time,\u201d and noted that it was critical in his path to the Democratic nomination. Though Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Michigan primary, he appears to be nearly 7 points behind Biden in a Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll of likely Michigan Democratic primary voters released Tuesday. Today, Michigan\u2019s governor Gretchen Whitmer endorsed Biden. \u201cAll roads to the White House lead through my state, and I want to make sure that we\u2019ve got a strong ability to help impact where we are headed as a nation,\u201d she said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. Sanders campaigned Whitmer\u2019s primary challenger in 2018. Another judge from the same court as Judge Walton recently sentenced Roger Stone \u2014 a friend of Trump \u2014 for interfering in a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Amy Berman Jackson of the Washington district court sentenced Stone to more than three years in prison following disagreements between Barr and career prosecutors over how harsh the sentence should be. The Department of Justice has been ordered to turn over an unredacted copy of the Mueller report by 30 March, so a judge can assess what can be further released publicly. The ruling accuses the attorney general, William Barr, of misrepresenting the findings of the report before handing it over to Congress. The court decision is the result of a BuzzFeed News lawsuit seeking to reveal the contents of the report, which details the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In his opinion explaining the ruling, the federal judge Reggie Walton wrote that Barr\u2019s public comments in April 2019 about the report didn\u2019t fit with the actual findings and were misleading to the public. \u201cThe inconsistencies between Attorney General Barr\u2019s statements made at a time when the public did not have access to the redacted version of the Mueller Report to assess the veracity of his statements, and portions of the redacted version of the Mueller Report that conflict with those statements cause the Court to seriously question whether Attorney General Barr made a calculated attempt to influence public discourse about the Mueller Report in favor of President Trump despite certain findings in the redacted version of the Mueller Report to the contrary,\u201d Walton said. Walton, who was appointed by George W Bush, also delivered a hard condemnation of Barr. \u201cThese circumstances generally, and Attorney General Barr\u2019s lack of candor specifically, call into question Attorney General Barr\u2019s credibility,\u201d he wrote in the legal opinion. Facebook says it will remove misleading Trump ads that present a survey on the president\u2019s reelection campaign website as an \u201cofficial\u201d 2020 census survey. Kevin Collier reports for The Guardian: The Trump Make America Great Committee posted 2,000 iterations of an ad this week, asking users to respond to the \u201cOfficial Congressional District Census\u201d. Instead of information at the Census Bureau, however, the posts linked to a push-poll survey on the GOP fundraising site action.donaldjtrump.com, which also requests personal information for the campaign. Advocates said this could interfere with the actual census, which begins for most Americans with mailers in mid-March. A census is a once-in-a-decade event that seeks to count every person in the country, with drastic consequences for resource allocation and government representation nationwide. Hi, there! It\u2019s Maanvi \u2014 writing from the West Coast. Now that Elizabeth Warren has dropped out of the race, where do her supporters go? Second choice polling data from Moning Consult suggests that her supporters may split between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Forty-three percent of Warren supporters said they\u2019d shift support to Sanders , and 36 percent said they\u2019d go with Biden. Of course, that could change if Warren ultimately choses to endorse Sanders. As Sanders pointed out, her politics and policies align much more closely with his than Biden\u2019s. For now, Warren has held off \u2014 perhaps strategically choosing to maintain leverage and push the remaining candidates\u2019 policies. In 2016, she declined to choose between Sanders and Hillary Clinton, frustrating supporters of both candidates. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race after a disappointing Super Tuesday performance. The Massachusetts senator declined to endorse Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders today, and she said she had \u201cno regrets\u201d about her campaign. The $8 billion bill aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus passed the Senate. The proposal is now headed to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature. Markets slumped again amid growing fears about coronavirus. The Dow dropped 970 points, wiping out almost all of yesterday\u2019s gains after Biden\u2019s strong showing on Super Tuesday. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he misspoke in his comments directed at two Supreme Court justices. The New York Democrat said yesterday that Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the two justices nominated by Trump, would \u201cpay the price\u201d for their decision in an abortion rights case. Mike Bloomberg is reportedly starting a new group aimed at defeating Trump in November. The former New York mayor suspended his presidential campaign yesterday and endorsed Biden, but Bloomberg made clear he would still work to elect the eventual Democratic nominee. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Freshman congresswoman Elissa Slotkin has endorsed Joe Biden days before her home state of Michigan holds its primary. \u201cToday, I filled out my absentee ballot for Joe Biden,\u201d Slotkin said in a statement. \u201cI did so for a host of reasons, but most importantly because I hear from my constituents every day that they want an end to the all-or-nothing politics that have so polarized our country.\u201d Slotkin is one of the freshman House Democrats who flipped Republican districts in 2018, and she faces a difficult reelection in November. Her endorsement of Biden is unsurprising, considering a number of moderate Democrats have sought to distance themselves from Bernie Sanders. But the timing of the Michigan congresswoman\u2019s endorsement could be crucial, considering the state will award 125 delegates on Tuesday. The US markets dropped again today amid growing fears about the spread of coronavirus. The Dow dropped 970 points, or over 3.5%, erasing much of yesterday\u2019s gains. The markets saw an uptick yesterday as investors appeared to breathe a sigh of relief about Bernie Sanders\u2019 sinking political fortunes after Joe Biden\u2019s strong Super Tuesday performance. For more updates and analysis, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog: A national poll shows Joe Biden leading Bernie Sanders by double digits after his strong performance on Super Tuesday. According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, Biden stands at 55% nationally, while Sanders is 10 points behind at 45%. Of course, the more important polls now are those taken in states that will hold primaries later this month. On that metric, Biden also appears to be enjoying an advantage over Sanders. A poll from Michigan, which will vote on Tuesday, showed Biden leading by more than 6 points, and a new Florida poll, which will award 219 delegates on March 17, found Biden holding an astounding 49-point advantage. House speaker Nancy Pelosi held a signing ceremony for the coronavirus bill, which is now headed to Trump\u2019s desk after its passage in the Senate today. Pelosi acknowledged the $8 billion package may only mark the beginning of the US response to the health threat. \u201cWe have no idea what the scope will be,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe do recognize this may be a first step.\u201d Asked by a reporter about whether there are coronavirus test kits at the Capitol, Pelosi said she did not believe the government had the capacity for such testing. Joe Biden has picked up another endorsement from a former Obama administration official: former health and human services secretary Kathleen Sebelius. \u201cAt this time of an emerging health crisis, it\u2019s more important than ever to have an experienced leader as president who listens to the scientists, believes in health care for all, and can bring the country together to deal with the challenges ahead,\u201d Sebelius said in a statement released by the Biden campaign. \u201cThat leader is Joe Biden, and I hope you\u2019ll join me in fighting for him.\u201d Sebelius served as the governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009, and her endorsement is seen as a huge boost in the state, which will hold its presidential primary on May 2. Some of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s supporters are continuing their fight for other progressive candidates after the Massachusetts senator suspended her campaign today. The New York Times reports: Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters never turned on their candidate, or the party that rejected her candidacy. In Illinois, where Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign was scheduled to hold a post-Super Tuesday phone banking session, staff and supporters refused to cancel. They decided to use their time to support Marie Newman, the Illinois congressional candidate running against an incumbent Democrat opposed to abortion rights. Newman is challenging incumbent Democratic congressman Dan Lipinski, who she narrowly lost to in 2018. After suspending his presidential campaign, Mike Bloomberg is reportedly starting a new group aimed at defeating Trump in November. The Washington Post reports: Bloomberg has decided to form a new independent expenditure campaign that will absorb hundreds of his presidential campaign staff in six swing states to work to elect the Democratic nominee this fall. The new group, with a name that is still undisclosed because its trademark application is in process, would also be a vehicle for Bloomberg to spend money on advertising to attack President Trump and support the Democratic nominee, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. ... The new group, operating with the same potentially limitless bankroll that funded Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, could play a mayor role in shaping the race this fall. Bloomberg, who is worth more than $50 billion, has also not ruled out using the group to spend money to support Vice President Joe Biden during his primary fight against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Bloomberg dropped out of the race yesterday after a disappointing performance on Super Tuesday and immediately endorsed Joe Biden. Even though he\u2019s out of the Democratic primary, Bloomberg has continued to taunt Trump, releasing a new video today that mocks the president as a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the country. Jordan Frias reports from outside Elizabeth Warren\u2019s home in Cambridge, Massachusetts: Elizabeth Warren supporters who came to see the former candidate\u2019s press conference today included college students and neighbors, many of whom said they were too sad to speak to the media, while others wouldn\u2019t be drawn on who they might support now. Pat David, 73, came with her 2-year-old granddaughter in her stroller. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want her to endorse [Bernie Sanders],\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know who can beat this idiot in the White House ... I don\u2019t think she should necessarily endorse anyone, I think she should stay out of that sort of thing until someone decides to try to draft her in.\u201d Sarah Taylor, a neighbor of Warren\u2019s, came with her dog and a sign reading, \u201cWe are proud of you, thank you\u201d. She too is not ready to see the liberal progressive back anyone. \u201cI will support whoever the Democratic Party nominates, and I think [Sanders] has many gifts\u201d Taylor said, \u201cBut I think that the temperament that I\u2019m looking for in the president is one like Elizabeth\u2019s, and one that\u2019s more in line with [Joe Biden].\u201d In case you missed it amid the flurry of news this morning: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he misspoke when he warned two conservative Supreme Court justices would \u201cpay the price\u201d for their decision in an abortion rights case. \u201cI should not have used the words I used yesterday. They didn\u2019t come out the way I intended them to,\u201d Schumer said in a Senate floor speech this morning. \u201cI\u2019m from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language. I shouldn\u2019t have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat. I never \u2014 never \u2014 would do such a thing.\u201d Speaking to abortion rights supporters yesterday as the Supreme Court hears a case about a Louisiana law restricting access to the procedure, Schumer directed a warning at Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the two justices nominated by Trump. \u201cI want to tell you, Gorsuch; I want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cYou won\u2019t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell then accused Schumer of trying to \u201cbully our nation\u2019s independent judiciary.\u201d But it should be noted Republicans have avoided similar criticism of Trump, who has repeatedly lashed out against judges who deliver decisions that are unfavorable to his policy agenda. Even though he has dropped out of the presidential race, Mike Bloomberg is not done bashing Trump. The former New York mayor just tweeted a new video that calls Trump a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the country and ends with the message, \u201cDump Trump. Go Joe.\u201d Trump and Bloomberg repeatedly exchanged insults about each other\u2019s height and intelligence once the billionaire candidate launched his Democratic presidential campaign in November. When Bloomberg dropped out of the race yesterday after a disappointing Super Tuesday perfromance, he endorsed Joe Biden and said he would work to help get him elected. Senator Rand Paul had proposed an amendment to offset the cost of the coronavirus bill with cuts to foreign aid. When that measure failed, the Kentucky Republican voted against the $8 billion bill, making him the only senator to oppose the proposal. The only two House members to vote against the bill yesterday -- Andy Biggs and Ken Buck -- similarly objected to the bill\u2019s cost. The Senate has passed the $8 billion coronavirus bill on a vote of 96 to 1, with only Republican senator Rand Paul opposing the measure. The bill similarly advanced through the House on a resounding vote of 415 to 2. The proposal now goes to Trump, who is expected to sign the bill into law after significantly increasing the amount of requested funding to combat the heath threat. An $8.3 billion bill to release emergency funding to combat the coronavirus outbreak has won enough support for passage in the Senate, as voting continues. The bill passed in the House yesterday and is receiving bipartisan support. It is a much larger sum than the White House floated late last month and will authorize special funding for government agencies in the front line of dealing with the novel illness, as well as to boost Medicare, the government health insurance for the older population. The legislation passed almost unanimously in the House and, Reuters reported, is on its way through the Senate also with strong support. Bernie Sanders celebrated Elizabeth Warren as a progressive champion who has \u201ctaken on the most powerful corporate interests\u201d after she suspended her presidential campaign. Some of Sanders\u2019 allies have called on Warren to endorse her fellow progressive senator, but she told reporters today that she was \u201cnot ready\u201d to make an endorsement. Joe Biden, the other leading candidate remaining in the presidential primary, similarly praised Warren as \u201cthe fiercest of fighters for middle class families.\u201d At her weekly press conference, House speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed disappointment that the presidential primary has narrowed to two men. \u201cEvery time I get introduced as the most powerful woman, I almost cry because I wish that were not true,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI still wish that we had a woman president of the United States.\u201d Pelosi said she believed there was \u201can element of misogyny\u201d to the hurdles that women candidates face in politics. The speaker also dismissed the idea that Democratic voters were worried a woman candidate could not beat Trump \u201cI think anyone can beat President Trump,\u201d Pelosi said. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mourned the end of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign. The progressive congresswoman has been a top surrogate for Bernie Sanders in recent days, but unlike some of Sanders\u2019 allies, Ocasio-Cortez did not call on Warren to drop out after her disappointing Super Tuesday performance. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Elizabeth Warren has dropped out of the presidential primary, following her disappointing performance on Super Tuesday. Warren told reporters she would wait on endorsing one of her opponents, as many of Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters call on her to back her fellow progressive senator. Mitch McConnell criticized Chuck Schumer for comments he made about two conservative Supreme Court justices, accusing the Democratic leader of trying to \u201cbully our nation\u2019s independent judiciary.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Elizabeth Warren said she had a theory about the presidential primary that was proven incorrect in recent weeks. The Massachusetts senator said she was told there were \u201ctwo lanes\u201d in the primary: \u201ca progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the incumbent for and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent for.\u201d She added, \u201cI thought that wasn\u2019t right but evidently I was wrong.\u201d Elizabeth Warren acknowledged that sexism in the presidential primary impacted her campaign. \u201cIf you say, yeah, there was sexism in this race, everyone says, whiner. And if you say no, there was no sexism, about a bazillion women think, what planet do you live on?\u201d Warren said. The Massachusetts senator pledged to speak more about sexism in politics moving forward. \u201cI promise you this: I\u2019ll have a lot more to say on that subject later on,\u201d Warren said. Elizabeth Warren expressed pride in being able to vote for herself in Massachusetts\u2019 primary on Tuesady. \u201cI stood in that voting booth, and I looked down at my name on the ballot and thought, \u2018Wow kiddo, you\u2019re not in Oklahoma anymore,\u2019\u201d Warren said. The senator added she was thinking about her late parents and missing them as she cast her ballot. Elizabeth Warren addressed reporters at her Cambridge home, explaining her decision to suspend her presidential campaign. \u201cI will not be running for president in 2020, but I guarantee I will stay in the fight,\u201d Warren said. The Massachusetts senator acknowledged she was disappointed the field has narrowed to two white male candidates (with the exception of Tulsi Gabbard, who has two delegates). \u201cOne of the hardest parts of this is ... all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years,\u201d Warren said. She added that she would not be endorsing another candidate at the moment. \u201cNot today,\u201d Warren said of her potential endorsement. \u201cI need some space around this.\u201d Echoing her campaign manager Roger Lau, Warren said, \u201cI have no regrets at all. This has been the honor of a lifetime.\u201d Joe Biden applauded Elizabeth Warren after she announced her withdrawal from the presidential primary, calling the Massachusetts senator \u201cthe fiercest of fighters for middle class families.\u201d After his strong performance on Super Tuesday, Biden is looking like the frontrunner in the race, and some have speculated about what role Warren could serve in his potential administration. However, the two candidates have a number of policy differences on a wide range of issues, including healthcare and student debt. Tulsi Gabbard, who is now the only woman in the presidential race, has won two delegates from Super Tuesday. For comparison, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders each won hundreds of delegates from California and Texas on Tuesday. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s remarks to staff announcing her decision to suspend her campaign appear to end on an allusion to Ted Kennedy. \u201cOur work continues, the fight goes on, and big dreams never die,\u201d Warren told her staffers. When Kennedy ended his own presidential campaign in 1980, he said, \u201cThe work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\u201d Both Warren and Kennedy, who died in 2009, have represented Massachusetts in the Senate. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to discuss whether Elizabeth Warren could serve as his running mate. The Vermont senator added that he looked forward to talking to Warren about what role she may be able to serve in his potential administration. In her remarks to staffers, Elizabeth Warren celebrated the campaign\u2019s accomplishments and tenacity. \u201c[I]n this campaign, we have been willing to fight, and, when necessary, we left plenty of blood and teeth on the floor,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd I can think of one billionaire who has been denied the chance to buy this election.\u201d Warren landed some devastating punches against Mike Bloomberg during the Las Vegas debate, and the billionaire candidate dropped out yesterday, giving Warren bragging rights about outlasting his campaign by a day. Reporters are gathered outside Elizabeth Warren\u2019s home waiting for the Massachusetts senator\u2019s press conference. Warren\u2019s golden retriever Bailey, who has become a fixture on the campaign trail, could be spotted through a window. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign has shared her remarks to staff announcing she is dropping out of the presidential primary: I love you guys too. I want to start with the news. I want all of you to hear it first, and I want you to hear it straight from me: today, I\u2019m suspending our campaign for president. I know how hard all of you have worked. I know how you disrupted your lives to be part of this. I know you have families and loved ones you could have spent more time with. You missed them and they missed you. And I know you have sacrificed to be here. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you, for everything you have poured into this campaign. Warren also shared a story she heard from a supporter as she cast her vote in Massachusetts earlier this week: She said she has two small children, and they have a nightly ritual. After the kids have brushed teeth and read books and gotten that last sip of water and done all the other bedtime routines, they do one last thing before the two little ones go to sleep. Mama leans over them and whispers, \u2018Dream big.\u2019 And the children together reply, \u2018Fight hard.\u2019 Our work continues, the fight goes on, and big dreams never die. Elizabeth Warren is scheduled to hold a press conference in about an hour, when she is expected to announce her withdrawal from the presidential primary. The Massachusetts senator reportedly informed her staff of her decision on a conference call about 30 minutes ago. According to the New York Times, Warren is not expected to endorse Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders at the press conference. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s expected withdrawal means there are no major candidates left in the presidential race who are women. (Tulsi Gabbard remains a candidate, but she has so far only won one delegate from American Samoa.) One NBC News reporter noted that Warren\u2019s gender was often cited as a liability by voters who were nervous about nominating a woman after Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss: Trump has weighed in on Elizabeth Warren\u2019s expected withdrawal, once again using his \u201cPocahontas\u201d insult against the Massachusetts senator and accusing her of costing Bernie Sanders the nomination. Here are some snap verdicts on Elizabeth Warren\u2019s reported withdrawal from the Democratic primary: From a Daily Beast reporter: From a political science professor at George Mason University: From a Washington Post reporter: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s departure from the race followed a series of lackluster finishes in the early contests, including a demoralizing third place finish in her home state of Massachusetts. After surging to the front of the field last summer with an urgent call for \u201cbig structural change\u201d, she began to slide, squeezed from the left by Bernie Sanders and from the center by more moderate alternatives. In the final weeks of her campaign, Warren, 70, attempted to reset her campaign this winter by recasting herself as the \u201cunity candidate\u201d best positioned to unify the Democratic party after a competitive primary, but that argument failed to win over many voters. Elizabeth Warren briefly led national polls this fall, but her numbers dropped as she was scrutinized over the specifics of her Medicare for all plan. As she failed to win states in the past month, a number of Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters called on Warren to drop out in the hope of consolidating the progressive vote. Next week\u2019s primaries will give us our first sense of whether that consolidation has occurred. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s expected withdrawal from the presidential primary leaves only three candidates in the race: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. Considering Gabbard has only won one delegate so far, this is effectively a two-candidate race between Biden and Sanders. The next test for Biden and Sanders will come on Tuesday, when six states will hold primaries. Elizabeth Warren reportedly intends to drop out of the Democratic presidential primary. The Massachusetts senator was considered one of the frontrunners in the race but has failed to win a single state. The results of Super Tuesday indicated Warren\u2019s support lagged far behind that of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has taken to the Senate floor to criticize Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer for his comments about two conservative Supreme Court justices. McConnell accused Schumer of attempting to \u201cbully our nation\u2019s independent judiciary.\u201d \u201cI fully anticipate our colleague would quickly withdraw his comment and apologize,\u201d McConnell said. Schumer also received a rare rebuke from Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts yesterday over comments he directed at the two Trump-appointed justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, in response to a case focused on abortion access in Louisiana. \u201cI want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.\u201d Schumer said. \u201cYou won\u2019t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\u201d CNN has announced the moderators for the next debate, which will take place in Arizona on March 15. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, along with Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, will moderate the 11th Democratic debate. Only four candidates remain in the race -- Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard -- and Gabbard is unlikely to qualify. If Warren drops out of the race in the next week, which is possible but not certain at this point, the debate could be a two-candidate event featuring only Biden and Sanders. Trump is once again denying saying somthing he did indeed say, and this time it\u2019s something about coronavirus. Appearing on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show last night, Trump said of coronavirus, \u201cBecause a lot of people will have this and it\u2019s very mild. ... So if, you know, we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better, just by you know, sitting around and even going to work, some of them go to work, but they get better.\u201d This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. The Senate will vote later today on the $8bn bill aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus, which passed the House yesterday. The bill is expected to easily pass the Senate and advance to Trump\u2019s desk, considering it passed the House on a vote of 415 to 2. The Today show have just posted up the full six-and-a-half minute interview with Joe Biden this morning on their social channels. In the clip Biden talks about winning well on Super Tuesday without an Obama endorsement, and the kind of support he can expect from Mike Bloomberg. He also addresses the security concerns after the incident where his wife Jill Biden and senior adviser Symone Sanders protected him from two protesters who stormed the stage. Biden says it might be time for him to have Secret Service protection. \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s something that has to be considered, the more outrageous some of this becomes. I wasn\u2019t scared for me, I was worried about for Jill.\u201d \u201cThe idea of jumping on a stage is just not permissible,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe last thing we need is anybody hurt.\u201d The Secret Service, by statute, protects the president, the vice president and their families as well as some other senior government officials. It is also authorized to protect major party presidential candidates, an authority granted after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. We can expect the latest developments with the coronavirus outbreak in the US to be pretty high on the agenda today. The death toll from coronavirus climbed to 11 yesterday as California reported its first fatality, and the House of Representatives passed an $8.3bn bill to help fund containment efforts. Hallie Golden has been out and about in Seattle looking at what life is like in the Washington city at the centre of America\u2019s outbreak. The state has seen 39 cases of the virus, with a total of 10 deaths. In the city\u2019s downtown area on Wednesday, residents reported fewer people walking around, while some shops turned to cutting back on staffing in response to slow business. Local grocery stores have seen some of their shelves emptied, as residents look to stock up on essentials. In a QFC (Quality Food Centers) in downtown Kirkland, several shelves where disinfectants, bottled water and bread would normally be were almost bare. Read it here - Life in the Washington city at the center of America\u2019s coronavirus outbreak There\u2019s going to be a House Science, Space, and Technology Committee session on coronavirus this morning, starting at 9am ET. There will be some experts from the Smithsonian and Harvard among the witnesses in a session titled \u201cUnderstanding the spread of infectious diseases and mobilizing innovative solutions\u201d Watch it here - House Science, Space, and Technology Committee coronavirus hearing The AP is reporting another endorsement for Joe Biden - this time Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer, who had not been planning to endorse a 2020 candidate, says Biden \u201chas our backs.\u201d She cited his work with President Barack Obama to add health coverage for millions of people and to rescue two of the Detroit Three automakers, General Motors and Chrysler, from financial ruin. \u201cHe showed up for the people of Michigan when our health care and our auto industry were on the line,\u201d the first-term governor said in a statement released Thursday to the Associated Press. \u201cHe helped us pick ourselves up and get back to work. I know he\u2019ll do the same as president.\u201d Of the six states voting next Tuesday, Michigan is the biggest prize with 125 pledged delegates at stake. \u201cJoe Biden is the candidate we need to defeat Donald Trump in November,\u201d Whitmer said a day after hinting that she might deliver an endorsement because \u201ca lot of things have changed in the last 72 hours.\u201d She said she decided to publicly support a candidate now because \u201cwe need our party to be united\u201d to beat the Republican president. On Twitter, Whitmer confirmed she would be will be joining Biden\u2019s campaign as a co-chair. FiveThirtyEight have an endorsement tracker, which shows just how far out in front Biden is on that score. Most Democrats believe that one of the key things to defeating Donald Trump in November\u2019s election will be getting the black vote out and turning up for whoever is nominated. There is sometimes a tendency to treat that vote as a bit of a monolith, and perhaps take for granted that it will come out and swing behind whoever the Democrats pick. Kenya Evelyn in Washington has been looking at what Super Tuesday\u2019s results tell us about the black vote. Biden\u2019s strength among black communities also made the difference in narrowly winning Texas, where African Americans make up about one-fifth of the Democratic primary electorate and Biden won at least three times more of their votes than Sanders did. \u201cThose young progressives may be motivated for a movement but it\u2019s the older, moderate aunties and uncles who show up\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic strategist, ahead of Biden\u2019s victory there. Read it here - What Super Tuesday revealed about black voters\u2019 power and preferences Donald Trump Jr - who you feel is perhaps on somewhat thin ice when throwing out this kind of accusation - has just been tweeting out a Daily Caller \u2018exclusive\u2019 from yesterday about Hunter Biden. The son of the US president is suggesting that \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the whole Biden family is entity dependent on Joe holding public office?\u201d Slightly away from the election, Associated Press this morning have been running a story about visiting a shop selling unofficial President Donald Trump-themed merchandise in a suburban Philadelphia strip mall. The Trump Store in Bensalem sells t-shirts, hats, beanies, and mugs with the president\u2019s cartoon face - all designed to appeal to his biggest fans Mike Domanico, the shop\u2019s owner, got into the T-shirt business in 2017 and noticed that the 10 or so Trump shirts he offered for sale at car shows sold out fast. He opened a kiosk in a nearby mall before expanding to the store early this year. The shop does about 350 sales a day, with the average customer spending about $60. Among the top sellers is a t-shirt that has the president\u2019s signature in gold above a brick wall and says, Border Wall Construction Co. The phrases \u201cBuild the wall\u201d and \u201cDeport them all\u201d are printed underneath. Other t-shirts feature the Confederate flag and reference slavery, alongside one with a gun and a dig at former president Barack Obama. Mike Catalini reports that Bucks County, where the shop is located, is the kind of swing area that is going to be crucial in the 2020 race. It swung for the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election, but frequently votes Republican for the House. Speaking to people visiting the store, Catalini found Jim Smith, 56, a tractor-trailer driver making his second visit to the shop to stock up on T-shirts. For him, he said, they are a way to grab people\u2019s attention. Smith plans to give them out to people who are sitting on the fence politically. Its a conversation starter, he said. Other visitors to the store included Dave Russell, 75, and Ron Soto, 82, both of Levittown, Pennsylvania. Russell, an Air Force veteran who retired from construction, said he came out to buy a Veterans for Trump shirt to show his support. He said Trump was the only president he remembered keeping promises. Mike Bloomberg\u2019s 53 delegate tally might prove to be the most expensive of all time if you consider how much money the billionaire spent to obtain them. Here\u2019s a video wrap of four issues that hindered his presidential hopes. Sanders has set himself a high bar for wining the nomination, suggesting last night that if he went into a contested convention still in the race, he would concede to Biden if the former vice president was ahead on delegates, even if Biden had failed to amass a majority. Sanders told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow Show \u201cIf Biden walks into the convention, or at the end of the process, has more votes than me, he\u2019s the winner\u201d He sounded a note of caution about any process that involved superdelegates opting for somebody who hadn\u2019t won the popular vote though. \u201cIt would be a real, real disaster for the Democratic party\u201d Sanders said. \u201cPeople would say \u2018the person who won the most votes didn\u2019t get selected.\u2019\u201d Sanders also spoke at length how pleased he is that the rules around superdelegates have been modified since his unsuccessful 2016 campaign. Watch the clip - Sanders agrees: the person with the most delegates at the convention wins Talking about Sanders and 2016, there\u2019s an interesting bit of analysis over here from Zachary Wolf at CNN, which suggests that Sanders is doing better in the race in 2020, but off the back of less support than he had last time around. Read it here - CNN: 2020 Bernie Sanders is losing to 2016 Bernie Sanders Joe Biden has been on the Today show this morning, and there\u2019s a few interesting nuggets in among the questioning from Savannah Guthrie Asked about the missing endorsement from Barack Obama - who has said he won\u2019t endorse anybody at this stage - Biden says: \u201cImagine had he endorsed me and we won as big as we did, you\u2019d all be saying I won because of Barack. I\u2019m winning because of me. I\u2019m gonna earn this on my own.\u201d He was also questioned about what support he could expect from Mike Bloomberg now that the billionaire has pivtoed from running against him to backing Biden. Joe was circumspect about not mentioning the money, saying: \u201cHe talked about my character, he talked about why he supported me, and he talked about why he would be enthusiastic about it. That all by itself is a gigantic help.\u201d You can watch some of the segment here. Rep. Val Demings has been on CNN this morning to endorse Joe Biden. It\u2019s a big deal for Joe given the demographic make-up of the crucial swing state. The former police chief is a member of both the intelligence and judiciary committees and was one of the impeachment managers at Trump\u2019s trial. At the same time, Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio appears to have come out in favour of Bernie Sanders. Biden easily has more endorsements from Capitol Hill than any other candidate. It is unclear how much effect that has in turning out the popular vote in primaries, but it could certainly come in handy if the race with Sanders stays close and we end up with a contested convention and superdelegates in play. We know that on Super Tuesday California and Texas voters faced hours-long lines, once again calling into question the way that the US organises its elections. Some voters waited several hours or longer to cast their ballots in the vital primaries. And there is still the question of foreign interference in the election process hanging in the air. NPR have an interesting piece this morning rounding-up the election security situation. Philip Ewing writes: Trump and Sanders both say they want no foreign help winning in 2020. What hostile governments wants is less a certain political outcome than \u201cto cause confusion and create doubt in our system\u201d\u2026Federal, state and local officials are coordinating in a way they never have before. Big Tech platforms say they\u2019re working within their own networks to clamp down on disinformation and agitation. And political campaigns are trying to make themselves harder targets for cyberattacks than before. Read it here - NPR: What To Know About The Election Security Situation After Super Tuesday As the US wakes up we can expect a lot of reaction to a decision that has come out of the international criminal court (ICC) in the Netherlands this morning. Senior judges have authorised an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan. It also approved that the scope of the investigation should include CIA black sites operated in Poland, Lithuania, and Romania, where detainees were taken. This is likely to infuriate Donald Trump and his administration. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has previously said that Washington would revoke or deny visas to ICC staff seeking to investigate alleged war crimes and other abuses committed by US forces. The decision today over-turns a previous ruling that there would not be an investigation because the expectation was that those targeted, including the US, Afghan authorities and the Taliban, would not cooperate. Read the full report - Senior ICC judges authorise Afghanistan war crimes inquiry Joe Biden might be enjoying a moment in the sunlight back as the front-runner in the race for the Democrat\u2019s nomination, but his other political problems haven\u2019t gone away. In fact, his dominant display on Super Tuesday might bring them back to the public eye. The Hill are reporting this morning on Republican efforts on Capitol Hill to ramp up their probe into Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. \u201cThese are questions that Joe Biden has never adequately answered. And if I were a Democrat primary voter, I would want these questions satisfactorily answered before I cast my final vote\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson. Suggesting a purely political motivation to the move, Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, pushed back forcefully, saying \u201cWe already knew that Donald Trump is terrified of facing Joe Biden \u2014 because he got himself impeached by trying to force a foreign country to spread lies about the vice president on behalf of his reelection campaign.\u201d Read it here - The Hill: As Biden surges, GOP Ukraine probe moves to the forefront Less than a week ago, the conventional wisdom among American pundits and pollsters was that the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders was cruising toward the Democratic presidential nomination. Then came Super Tuesday. Joe Biden won critical states such as Texas, Virginia and North Carolina, and finished first in Massachusetts and Minnesota, where a week ago he was projected to finish fifth. Now much of the talking-head consensus is shifting toward proclaiming Biden the favorite. Do the people who pronounce on politics really know any more about what\u2019s going on than the random loudmouth in the pub or coffee shop? Director of political studies at the Niskanen Center Geoffrey Kabaservice writes for us, asking if there are more shocks ahead in the primary race. You feel that Donald Trump will be slightly disappointed that Mike Bloomberg has dropped out of the race this early. He certainly seemed to enjoy needling the billionaire on Twitter. Here\u2019s a reminder of the speech Bloomberg gave to announce that he was now backing Joe Biden My colleague Ankita Rao wrote yesterday how ultimately it was Elizabeth Warren\u2019s debate performances that effectively ended Bloomberg\u2019s White House hopes It might still be a little too early for obituaries for the Warren campaign, but that isn\u2019t stopping people writing them. The Atlantic have just published five theories about \u201cWhat Happened to Elizabeth Warren?\u201d In the piece, Amy Walter says: For voters who were looking for a liberal, Bernie Sanders\u2013like candidate but wanted a new model\u2014somebody who was not as old, not as male, not as crotchety\u2014[Warren] looked like this new great option. And for other voters, especially for a lot of women who wouldn\u2019t put themselves in the \u201cvery liberal\u201d category, there was an appeal to her because she seemed more unifying than Bernie Sanders. But both of those sides ultimately felt very unsatisfied Read it here - The Atlantic: What Happened to Elizabeth Warren? Good morning. It feels like today there\u2019s finally a bit of a lull in the Democrat campaign after the hectic events of the last few days that have seen Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and now Mike Bloomberg drop out of the race, and Joe Biden re-assert his front-runner status ahead of Bernie Sanders. Six states - Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington - will vote on Tuesday. All eyes will be on Elizabeth Warren in the meantime to see if she will continue to hang on in there. Don\u2019t forget you can always check on the latest state of play with our delegate tracker. Donald Trump has got a couple of appointments coming up. He will meet with secretary of state Mike Pompeo at 11:45am ET. The latest developments in Afghanistan are sure to be on the agenda. Less than 24 hours after the president said he had a \u201cvery good talk\u201d with a top leader, a US military drone targeted the Taliban in retaliation for an uptick in their attacks on Afghan forces. Trump is also due to take part in a Fox News campaigning town hall at 6.30pm ET. The response to coronavirus has stepped up a gear with California declaring a state of emergency over the viral outbreak. Heading up federal efforts to combat the spread, vice president Mike Pence will be in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Education secretary Betsy DeVos will testify to the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the annual budget at 10am ET. If her track record is anything to go by, it could be quite a lively session.",

If we reach the bottom of that slope, we will be a nation that doesn\u2019t know itself, with citizens prey to fake news.\u201d</p> <p>AAP was credited with providing media outlets and their audiences with \u201cbasic, reliable reporting or courts, parliament and public events\u201d, reporting that is \u201cordinary, routine\u201d and \u201cdoes not win Walkley awards but which, I think, is cumulatively even more important than the big investigative scoops\u201d.</p> <p>Sure, AAP does all this and no doubt many subscribers share this view. But from an insider\u2019s perspective, it does so much more. With my former colleagues\u2019 support, I broke the story of Williams\u2019 death through speed, a knowledge of the underworld, and a rock-solid source. I covered the 2009 Victorian Black Saturday bushfires on the ground, and the subsequent royal commission in its entirety.</p> <p>Other AAP Melbourne bureau colleagues traversed Victoria for up to a week after the Black Saturday bushfires, solo, no photographers or film crews for support, in their cars, reaching affected towns before any other media. One of those colleagues is now AAP\u2019s Northern Territory correspondent, filing underreported stories on Indigenous Australia. September 11, the London terrorist attacks, the Bali bombings, the Boxing Day tsunami \u2013 AAP was there. Foreign bureaus have included London (the oldest, dating back to 1935) Auckland, Jakarta and Port Moresby. For me, this is far from ordinary but rather extraordinary and intrepid journalism.</p> <p>While the outside view of AAP may be that it serves to provide routine and reliable content, filling a void while freeing up other media outlets\u2019 journalists to do the important investigative work, that\u2019s not how I, or colleagues I knew, operated. If we did, the copy would have been substandard and would not have adhered to the organisation\u2019s and our own personal standards of speed, accuracy, quality and creativity.</p> <p>We took immense pride in our work. In our minds, we weren\u2019t filing stories to fill the gaps in newspapers or provide routine, basic content \u2013 we were striving for the highest quality journalism in the hope we might get a byline rather than our work ripped off. We wanted to write a good yarn, to expose corruption and inequality, to entertain, to make a difference. We worked just as hard \u2013 sometimes harder \u2013 than any other journalists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/04/why-aaps-closure-is-a-brutal-hit-to-australias-concentrated-media-market\">Why AAP's closure is a brutal hit to Australia's concentrated media market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The outpouring of support for AAP from different sections of the media this week is welcome and encouraging.

It smacks of a lack of innovation and imagination in not allowing AAP to continue under a different model, but why would they want that? Because as a competitor, especially in the breaking news space, AAP would kick ass.</p> <p>While the final bell may have tolled for AAP (and only AAP staff will understand this metaphor), I still hold out hope this is not the end of the newswire\u2019s story. I\u2019ve often wondered what a more independent future model of AAP could look like. Measures recommended by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to boost philanthropy and grants for journalism are reassuring. And there are 180 creative minds who will be out of a job after 26 June who I\u2019m sure are willing to be part of an innovative solution \u2013 if they aren\u2019t snapped up elsewhere first.</p> <p>\u2022 Michelle Henderson is a Melbourne-based writer and former AAP journalist covering news, courts and the national medical round.

Margaret Simons on Tuesday encapsulated well what the death of AAP means for public interest journalism and the significance of this event to our nation. \u201cIt affects us all, threatens our democracy and requires urgent and enlightened responses from our policymakers,\u201d Simons wrote. \u201cThe AAP announcement is the latest, and one of the biggest, lurches down a slippery slope. If we reach the bottom of that slope, we will be a nation that doesn\u2019t know itself, with citizens prey to fake news.\u201d AAP was credited with providing media outlets and their audiences with \u201cbasic, reliable reporting or courts, parliament and public events\u201d, reporting that is \u201cordinary, routine\u201d and \u201cdoes not win Walkley awards but which, I think, is cumulatively even more important than the big investigative scoops\u201d. Sure, AAP does all this and no doubt many subscribers share this view. But from an insider\u2019s perspective, it does so much more. With my former colleagues\u2019 support, I broke the story of Williams\u2019 death through speed, a knowledge of the underworld, and a rock-solid source. I covered the 2009 Victorian Black Saturday bushfires on the ground, and the subsequent royal commission in its entirety. Other AAP Melbourne bureau colleagues traversed Victoria for up to a week after the Black Saturday bushfires, solo, no photographers or film crews for support, in their cars, reaching affected towns before any other media. One of those colleagues is now AAP\u2019s Northern Territory correspondent, filing underreported stories on Indigenous Australia. September 11, the London terrorist attacks, the Bali bombings, the Boxing Day tsunami \u2013 AAP was there. Foreign bureaus have included London (the oldest, dating back to 1935) Auckland, Jakarta and Port Moresby. For me, this is far from ordinary but rather extraordinary and intrepid journalism. While the outside view of AAP may be that it serves to provide routine and reliable content, filling a void while freeing up other media outlets\u2019 journalists to do the important investigative work, that\u2019s not how I, or colleagues I knew, operated. If we did, the copy would have been substandard and would not have adhered to the organisation\u2019s and our own personal standards of speed, accuracy, quality and creativity. We took immense pride in our work. In our minds, we weren\u2019t filing stories to fill the gaps in newspapers or provide routine, basic content \u2013 we were striving for the highest quality journalism in the hope we might get a byline rather than our work ripped off. We wanted to write a good yarn, to expose corruption and inequality, to entertain, to make a difference. We worked just as hard \u2013 sometimes harder \u2013 than any other journalists. The outpouring of support for AAP from different sections of the media this week is welcome and encouraging. In my experience, AAP journos could be looked down upon by our media colleagues and sometimes subject to treatment that would not have been afforded to other members of the media. If there was a pecking order, we were not at the top. Ben Butler\u2019s report that News Corp and Nine, AAP\u2019s major shareholders, did not want to subsidise the news service for competitors is a brutal reality. It smacks of a lack of innovation and imagination in not allowing AAP to continue under a different model, but why would they want that? Because as a competitor, especially in the breaking news space, AAP would kick ass. While the final bell may have tolled for AAP (and only AAP staff will understand this metaphor), I still hold out hope this is not the end of the newswire\u2019s story. I\u2019ve often wondered what a more independent future model of AAP could look like. Measures recommended by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to boost philanthropy and grants for journalism are reassuring. And there are 180 creative minds who will be out of a job after 26 June who I\u2019m sure are willing to be part of an innovative solution \u2013 if they aren\u2019t snapped up elsewhere first. \u2022 Michelle Henderson is a Melbourne-based writer and former AAP journalist covering news, courts and the national medical round. She\u2019s eternally grateful to AAP for giving her a go",

      "bodyText": "Winning the Stella prize in 2016 changed Charlotte Wood\u2019s life. The Natural Way of Things was her fifth novel, but it was the first to truly catapult her into the spotlight. \u201cI\u2019d become very comfortable with getting shortlisted for lots of things and then only making it to that point, which was totally fine. I had to suddenly readjust my thinking,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. The story, about a colony of imprisoned girls, won not only the Stella that year but the prime minister\u2019s prize for fiction, too. It was shortlisted for scores of other prizes and netted critical acclaim internationally \u2013 even being photographed in the hands of Hollywood stars Michelle Williams and Busy Phillips. Now, Wood has been shortlisted for the Stella again for her very next novel, The Weekend \u2013 a story of three longtime friends in their 70s cleaning out the beachside house of a recently deceased fourth. The book was described by Guardian critic Susan Wyndham as \u201ca more domesticated sister to its wild predecessor\u201d. Also in the shortlist for the $50,000 prize in 2020 were the novels There Was Still Love by Favel Parrett, tracing generations of a family torn apart by conflict, and The Yield, Tara June Winch\u2019s exploration of Wiradjuri language through fiction. Josephine Rowe\u2019s short story collection Here Until August rounded out the fiction entries. Non fiction shortlistees included journalist Jess Hill, for her investigation into domestic violence, See What You Made Me Do, and Caro Llewellyn for her memoir about living with debilitating illness, Diving into Glass. The Stella prize was founded to combat gender bias in Australian literary prizes. It was first awarded in 2013, to Carrie Tiffany for her novel, Mateship with Birds. Wood praised the Stella\u2019s influence on the literary landscape in the years since its launch. \u201cIn such a short time it became a really influential prize,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone was setting out to not include women. But I think the Stella brought attention to the unconscious bias that we all carry about all kinds of things.\u201d Wood said winning the Stella four years ago immediately broadened her audience: \u201cMy sales certainly tripled almost instantly.\u201d She also praised the Stella\u2019s focus on long and shortlisted authors. This year, each shortlisted writer will receive a three week writing retreat in Point Addis on the Victorian coast, along with a $2,000 cash prize in addition to their longlist prize of $1,000. \u201cThe way that the Stella has brought attention to longlists and shortlists has really raised the bar for all the prizes. The Miles Franklin certainly does a lot more work on the shortlist now, which is fantastic,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf language is a tool, or a weapon, then these writers use their skills with tremendous courage,\u201d Louise Swinn, publisher and chair of the judging panel, said of this year\u2019s shortlist. \u201cWe found a lot to be hopeful about here, too \u2013 not just at the stories being told but at the quality of the art being produced.\u201d Journalists Monica Attard and Jack Latimore, editor Zoya Patel and poet Leni Shilton were also on the judging panel. Wood said the Stella has helped change cultural attitudes to what makes a \u201cgreat Australian book\u201d. \u201cIt used to exclude the \u2018domestic\u2019; we didn\u2019t think that a big story could be really written by a woman, I don\u2019t think, whereas now we do think that. And that\u2019s an incredible achievement in under 10 years.\u201d The winner of the 2020 Stella prize will be announced in Sydney on Wednesday 8 April.",
