While the closure of the EEZ to commercial fishing aimed to reduce pressure on the reef by encouraging sustainable domestic fishing of fish like tuna, the ban has actually led to a shortage as commercial fishing vessels have moved out of Palau\u2019s waters. As a result, shops and restaurants in Palau are serving up vulnerable reef fish instead of pelagic fish like tuna. \u201cIt will be the opposite of what we wanted,\u201d said Yimnang Golbuu, chief executive of Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC) and administrator of the marine sanctuary, of reports of increased consumption of reef fish. \u201cThat\u2019s why its important to develop that constant supply [of tuna].\u201d Golbuu said that even before the marine sanctuary was created, there was not a constant supply of tuna in the restaurants and the supermarkets in Palau. He said the problem had been exacerbated after one of the commercial fishing vessel companies, Palau International Traders Corporation (PITI), announced that it would no longer conduct fishing activity in Palau\u2019s waters, as the marine sanctuary made it \u201cnot financially viable\u201d. \u201cMaybe initially it\u2019s becoming worse because all of the sudden PITI [pulled out of Palau\u2019s waters] and it\u2019s Chinese New Year and no one is fishing and maybe it is becoming a problem, hopefully as we develop the domestic fishery we will achieve our goal,\u201d said Golbuu. Following the implementation of the marine sanctuary, several restaurants in Palau have stopped offering tuna on their menus, and were either serving reef fish or imported fish like salmon and frozen basa. Tkel Etpison, owner of Drop Off, a well-known seafood restaurant whose tuna poke is a popular dish, said that they have been forced to recommend reef fish dishes to customers due to the tuna shortage, though Etpison said he had concerns about doing so. \u201cWe try to encourage eating more commercial fish than reef fish. I think that\u2019s the concern as a dive operator and bar owner that we will see less and less fish on the reef,\u201d he said. Surangel Whipps Jr., the owner of one of the biggest supermarkets in Palau, said he had been forced to stock more reef fish due to the shortage. \u201cWe were selling tuna, filleted tuna, and then now that there is no tuna, they are buying more reef fish, so we\u2019re putting more pressure on resources we are trying to protect,\u201d he said, adding that the marine sanctuary was \u201ca good initiative but we need to increase the capacity of our local fishing industry.\u201d Critics say Palau should have made sure to develop a local tuna industry before introducing the marine sanctuary. Umiich Sengebau, the minister for natural resources, environment and tourism, said efforts were being made to create a local tuna industry, \u201cbut nothing happens overnight\u201d. Sengebau said one solution was for Congress to provide subsidies to local fishermen to buy big enough vessels to take them offshore.",

      "bodyText": "Coronavirus shocks have rippled through the corporate world after a large airline imposed a hiring freeze, the world\u2019s biggest whisky maker warned on profits and a factory shutdown in Italy threatened car production across Europe. The German carrier Lufthansa has halted recruitment and is offering employees unpaid leave as part of cost-saving measures to limit the financial impact of the spread of the coronavirus. The cutbacks came as several other European companies warned that the outbreak was hurting their operations or introduced emergency measures to protect staff. Sky said its offices would bar visitors who had been in high-risk countries in order to reduce the threat of contagion for its staff, with all guests required to complete a form at reception desks. The Italian manufacturer MTA, which makes electrical parts for cars, has been forced to close its factory in Codogno after the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy. It said the closure would have a knock-on effect on production at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s plants in the country before spreading to other carmakers across Europe. The closure of the plant in the Lombardy region would immediately force Fiat to shut production lines at four plants as soon as Wednesday, MTA said. Continued closure would mean all the other Fiat plants in Europe and those of Renault, BMW and Peugeot would close from 2 March. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK\u2019s largest carmaker, and the lorry makers Iveco and CNH, would be affected if the shutdown lasted longer. Diageo, the UK-based owner of Guinness and the world\u2019s biggest whisky producer with brands such as Johnnie Walker, said Covid-19 could hit its profits by up to \u00a3200m as restaurants and bars in China stay shut. SSP Group, the British operator of restaurants and bars in airports and railway stations, said its sales across the Asia Pacific region would slump by half in February. Diageo predicted a decline in profits of \u00a3140m-\u00a3200m in the year to the end of June. Sales are expected to be down by up to \u00a3325m. Its estimates excluded the impact of the coronavirus on other markets beyond Greater China and Asia Pacific. Diageo said the majority of consumption of its products in China took place in bars and restaurants, which mostly remain closed. \u201cWe have seen significant disruption since the end of January, which we expect to last at least into March,\u201d it said. \u201cThereafter we expect a gradual improvement, with consumption returning to normal levels towards [June].\u201d The company also highlighted the impact in South Korea, Japan and Thailand, where events have been postponed, conferences and banquets have been cancelled and a drop in tourism has also had an impact on consumption in bars and restaurants. The significant drop in international air travel, especially across Asia Pacific, has also hurt Diageo\u2019s business, including sales in airports. Danone, the maker of products including Volvic and Evian bottled water, and Activia yoghurts, said it would take a \u20ac100m (\u00a384m) sales hit in the first quarter as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. The French-based company was experiencing a \u201csevere demand slowdown\u201d for its Mizone water brand in China, which is Danone\u2019s second biggest market and accounted for 10% of global sales last year. Danone employs 8,200 staff in China and has eight factories, seven of which support its water business. The company said water production resumed on 17 February except for at its factory in Wuhan, which is at the centre of the outbreak. SSP said in the Asia Pacific region, which generates 8% of group revenues, domestic and international air travel relating to China was down 90%, Hong Kong was down 70% and Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines were down 25% to 30%.

Goals have arrived in irregular bursts, his recent effort against Newcastle ending a nine-game drought, and he has recently been kept out of the Premier League side by the academy product Eddie Nketiah.</p> <p>Lacazette is likely to start in the Europa League last-32 game against Olympiakos on Thursday and, having scored a late winner to decide the first leg in Piraeus, hopes he and his team have overcome the worst of a fraught season.</p> <p>\u201cIn this moment we improve a lot, mentally and we can keep big confidence now,\u201d he said. \u201cI went through this and know I can be better now.\u201d</p> <p>Arsenal\u2019s two senior strikers were the primary topics in the pre-match press conference and the briefing held by Arteta afterwards. Arteta had spoken extensively about Aubameyang after he scored twice in Sunday\u2019s 3-2 home win over Everton, saying he thinks the 30-year-old would like to stay. Aubameyang\u2019s figures in two years at Arsenal have been remarkable, bringing 60 goals in 95 games; the TV pundit Gary Neville has been among those to suggest his quality is underrated and Arteta agreed a centre-forward\u2019s worth does not have to be measured in trophies.</p> <p>\u201cHarry Kane has scored 30 goals and never won the Premier League,\u201d he said, with a hint of mischief. \u201cThere are a lot of good examples of players that do phenomenally but unfortunately there are a lot of top teams in this country and only one win the league. So you can\u2019t have everything in life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I can say with Aubameyang is that he\u2019s right there with the best of the scorers in this league. In the last 10 years if you look at his record and what he\u2019s done it\u2019s phenomenal. In my opinion he\u2019s up there with the best.\u201d</p> <p>Arteta will name another strong side in an attempt to finish the job against Olympiakos, with consecutive Premier League wins not masking the fact Europa League success remains Arsenal\u2019s best chance of a return to the top table at this point. He will have to do without Sead Kolasinac, who was expecxted to see a specialist on Wednesday about the shoulder injury sustained against Newcastle. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult area and we are not very positive about it,\u201d he admitted.</p> <p>Bukayo Saka will probably start at left-back and Lacazette, sitting next to a manager who has attempted to calm the buzz around the 18-year-old, was effusive about his teammate. \u201cI think he\u2019s maybe the best young player in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs to improve in a few things but you can see the quality he has and he\u2019s humble.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alexandre Lacazette expects to stay at Arsenal despite reports suggesting he will be allowed to leave if the club do not qualify for the Champions League. The centre-forward who cost \u00a352.7m has two seasons remaining on his contract and there is not the same urgency to tie him down to a longer deal as there is in the case of \u2013 among others \u2013 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. It has been suggested Lacazette and club are willing to part ways in the event of an unsuccessful season but the striker said on Wednesday he had no reason to depart. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about this. I have a contract with the club, so there is no point to leave \u2013 everybody is happy with me at the club.\u201d Lacazette admitted this season had been \u201cdifficult\u201d on a personal level, with the manager, Mikel Arteta, also saying the player has been \u201ca little bit down\u201d. Goals have arrived in irregular bursts, his recent effort against Newcastle ending a nine-game drought, and he has recently been kept out of the Premier League side by the academy product Eddie Nketiah. Lacazette is likely to start in the Europa League last-32 game against Olympiakos on Thursday and, having scored a late winner to decide the first leg in Piraeus, hopes he and his team have overcome the worst of a fraught season. \u201cIn this moment we improve a lot, mentally and we can keep big confidence now,\u201d he said. \u201cI went through this and know I can be better now.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s two senior strikers were the primary topics in the pre-match press conference and the briefing held by Arteta afterwards. Arteta had spoken extensively about Aubameyang after he scored twice in Sunday\u2019s 3-2 home win over Everton, saying he thinks the 30-year-old would like to stay. Aubameyang\u2019s figures in two years at Arsenal have been remarkable, bringing 60 goals in 95 games; the TV pundit Gary Neville has been among those to suggest his quality is underrated and Arteta agreed a centre-forward\u2019s worth does not have to be measured in trophies. \u201cHarry Kane has scored 30 goals and never won the Premier League,\u201d he said, with a hint of mischief. \u201cThere are a lot of good examples of players that do phenomenally but unfortunately there are a lot of top teams in this country and only one win the league. So you can\u2019t have everything in life. \u201cWhat I can say with Aubameyang is that he\u2019s right there with the best of the scorers in this league. In the last 10 years if you look at his record and what he\u2019s done it\u2019s phenomenal. In my opinion he\u2019s up there with the best.\u201d Arteta will name another strong side in an attempt to finish the job against Olympiakos, with consecutive Premier League wins not masking the fact Europa League success remains Arsenal\u2019s best chance of a return to the top table at this point. He will have to do without Sead Kolasinac, who was expecxted to see a specialist on Wednesday about the shoulder injury sustained against Newcastle. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult area and we are not very positive about it,\u201d he admitted. Bukayo Saka will probably start at left-back and Lacazette, sitting next to a manager who has attempted to calm the buzz around the 18-year-old, was effusive about his teammate. \u201cI think he\u2019s maybe the best young player in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs to improve in a few things but you can see the quality he has and he\u2019s humble.\u201d",

That is competition, that is football. We have to improve, so we do not give them the goal we conceded.

But I think our response was brilliant. It\u2019s a really good start for us.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m done. A fascinating game, and a fantastic victory for Manchester City, who having won in Spain and with Sergio Ramos suspended for the second leg are in control of this tie. Bye! Pep Guardiola has a chat. He\u2019s asked whether he pulled off a surprise tactical masterstroke: Because we won. Important is the way we played. We tried to come here to win the game and we did it in this stadium. It\u2019s just the first part and if one team can overcome this situation it\u2019s this club. But of course it\u2019s a good result. I\u2019m so proud of course, but it\u2019s just the first step. We have another game, so it\u2019s not over. But enjoy it, of course, we spoke about that, enjoy the moment, good dinner, regeneration, on Sunday we have a final and keep going in the Premier League and prepare for the second game against Madrid. I would say [when we were at our best] we conceded a goal, that we should not have conceded, and when they were better we scored a goal. That is competition, that is football. We have to improve, so we do not give them the goal we conceded. But it\u2019s part of the game and maybe in the future we will grow. Looking at the incident again I think the Sergio Ramos sending-off was rather harsh: there was hardly any contact, and Jesus was extremely keen on going to ground. This was, in short, one of those rare matches in which Ramos didn\u2019t really deserve a red card. Still, he\u2019s owed a few. And here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s match report: Manchester City\u2019s players have missed a clutch of penalties this season. At times they have seemed cursed from the spot. And so when Kevin De Bruyne stood over a late penalty to put his team in charge of this slow-burning Champions League tie, it is safe to say that the nerves of the travelling support were jangling. De Bruyne was a snapshot of composure and when he sent Thibaut Courtois the wrong way, it was the prompt for City to feel their hopes surge. The club have won only four knockout ties in nine seasons in this competition. A fifth is now within their grasp and this result was nothing more than they deserved. Much more here: Here\u2019s Kevin de Bruyne\u2019s post-match reaction. In brief: job half done: I think it\u2019s a very good start for the first game. The first 15 minutes we struggled a bit, but you have to go through the storm, and then an even first half and I think we started the second half really well and the goal comes at a bad moment for us because I think we were dominating at the time. But I think our response was brilliant. It\u2019s a really good start for us. I think in the four years we are here with Pep we had some surprises and even the players, they don\u2019t really know until the game starts what we need to do. We had some lesser moments but in a quality game like this you\u2019re going to struggle sometimes but I think we fought really well. We\u2019re only halfway there. it\u2019s going to be an important game at home. Now we have a final on Sunday so we have to recover as quickly as possible to be ready for the final. Gabriel Jesus meanwhile says he used to play as a winger at Palmeiras, and that he doesn\u2019t mind where he plays. \u201cI have to help my teammates.\u201d Tonight\u2019s other Champions League game ended 1-0 to Lyon against Juventus. According to Uefa\u2019s stats Juve actually had 15 shots, and one was on target, but still. Several fine performances for City tonight, but Jesus was excellent in his unconventional sometime-striker-cum-wing-back role. It was not Sergio Ramos\u2019s first red card. Here\u2019s a retrospective: 90+4 mins: It\u2019s over! Manchester City lost Laporte to injury, went a goal down and then turned the game around. 90+2 mins: Chance for Real! It\u2019s a deep cross from the right, and Ferland Mendy ghosts to the far post, beyond a snoozing Mahrez, and could easily have scored had his shot been less hopeless. 90+2 mins: Mahrez runs towards the area, shimmies a bit, but then ignores Jesus and De Bruyne and runs right into Varane. 90+1 mins: There will be about three minutes of stoppage time. Sterling cuts across the edge of the penalty area, works a fine shooting chance but then sends the ball straight at Courtois. That could very easily have been three. 90 mins: This has been an excellent away performance, though City did teeter a bit after they conceded. \u201cRe: 79th minute \u2018Jesus lays both hands on Ramos\u2019 - let\u2019s hope it cures him of his general shithousery,\u201d notes Adam Harper, optimistically. 88 mins: Mahrez sends the free-kick towards goal, but it\u2019s low and central and Courtois gathers. 86 mins: Casemiro plays a poor pass towards Varane, and Jesus pokes it away and sprints clear. Ramos chases after him and puts a hand on the City player\u2019s shoulder, and Jesus throws himself to the ground just outside the penalty area. It\u2019s a foul, but only just. 86 mins: This is unravelling fast for Real Madrid! 84 mins: Real Madrid take off Isco and Modric and bring on Lucas Vazquez and Luka Jovic. De Bruyne sends Courtois the wrong way and slides the ball into the corner! Carvajal slides in on Sterling, who goes down, and the referee points to the spot! The ball was heading off the pitch anyway, and that was a horrendous tackle. 80 mins: A chance for another! Mahrez crosses from the right, and Jesus heads over from six yards! 79 mins: Jesus did lay both hands on the back of Sergio Ramos before he leapt, but with little or no force. The goal passes a VAR check. A precious equaliser! De Bruyne conjures a phenomenal cross, which dips just over Sergio Ramos and onto Jesus\u2019s forehead! 76 mins: Bale\u2019s first touch is inside City\u2019s penalty area, but the shot that follows is from an unpromising angle and anyway deflected. Ederson collects. 75 mins: Gareth Bale comes on, replacing a tiring Vinicius Junior. 73 mins: Raheem Sterling comes on for Bernardo Silva. 72 mins: Then Isco pulls back for Sergio Ramos, and Fernandinho blocks his shot as well! 71 mins: Carvajal gets into the area, cuts onto his left foot, and Benzema sprints forward in front of goal, anticipating a tap-in. But Fernandinho anticipates as well, and gets across to block! 70 mins: City, needing to freshen things up, are readying Sterling. 66 mins: Real attack and Valverde is released on the right, where he shows an impressive burst of pace. Benzema runs clear of his marker in the penalty area, but Ederson anticipates the driven cross and comes out fast to claim it. 64 mins: The scoreline massively flatters Real, who since the goal have dropped back into a defensive 4-5-1, apparently content with their slender lead. From nowhere, Real take the lead! Rodri, Otamendi and Walker all mess up to convert untroubled possession to conceding a goal in the space of a few seconds. Rodri is robbed by Modric but Walker should deal with the ball when it rolls free; he takes an unnecessary touch when he might have booted clear and Vinicius Junior dispossess and slides across to an unmarked Isco, who shoots low past Ederson! 59 mins: An excellent start to the half from City, who now win another corner. It\u2019s their fourth; Real haven\u2019t had one yet. 57 mins: Another chance! Gundogan lifts a pass from inside his own half over the entire Real Madrid team and into the path of Mahrez, but he hurries his shot, takes it when off balance and Courtois saves again. 56 mins: Mahrez surprises the Real defence by cutting outside onto his right foot, buying himself space for a shot which Courtois saves pretty easily. b Modric\u2019s next involvement is to release Vinicius Junior with a lovely pass. The Brazilian sprints into the box but takes a poor touch, loses control, and falls over in a desperate and vain search of a penalty. 53 mins: Modric stretches for the ball but is beaten to it by Mahrez, catching his opponent\u2019s ankle. He\u2019s also shown a yellow card. 50 mins: Real pass the ball around City\u2019s penalty area for a while without getting into it, and then Casemiro gives the ball away and City counter. De Bruyne carries it about 60 yards before finding Mahrez, who cuts onto his left foot and then curls a shot wide of the far post from just outside the area. 48 mins: Valverde pulls Gundogan\u2019s shoulder, and gets a booking. 46 mins: Peeeeep! City start the second half by tonking the ball down the right wing and straight out of play. The players are on their way back out. Both teams are unchanged, from the looks of things. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to sell someone on Rodri, what\u2019s the pitch?\u201d wonders Ryan Bell. \u201cHe looks like he\u2019s going to turn the ball over every time Madrid press him, has been skipped past with ease 3-4 times already, and doesn\u2019t seem to have much appetite for vertical passes either...\u201d I think he\u2019s a decent disruptor, and he\u2019s played more passes than any other City player in the Premier League (he\u2019s No2 overall, behind Virgil van Dijk). He doesn\u2019t do a lot of chance creation, but then he\u2019s not supposed to. Overall, he ain\u2019t perfect but I quite like him. 45+3 mins: Isco wins a free-kick in the right-back position with a ludicrous dive, and that\u2019s the last significant action of the half. 45+2 mins: Goalline clearance! The corner is flapped by Courtois straight to Jesus, whose volleyed shot was going wide but then Sergio Ramos miskicks his clearance so badly it would have gone in had Casemiro not been in the way! 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be a couple of minutes. City have themselves a corner. 45 mins: Bernardo Silva seems to be having a go on the right. He teases Ferland Mendy for a while, and ends up with a throw-in. 41 mins: Valverde runs into Benzema and goes down clutching his face. The referee somehow sees a City foul in this, and Mahrez did rest a palm on his shoulder a moment earlier. 38 mins: No goals, but this is being played at a remorseless pace and is really quite fun. In tonight\u2019s other Champions League game, Lyon have taken the lead against Juventus, Lucas Tousart with the opener. 35 mins: A wild few seconds in City\u2019s left-back area after Ederson passes the ball out of goal. Mendy flies into a couple of challenges, and then Rodri takes out Benzema. 34 mins: Now Gundogan is receiving treatment, after a falling Modric landed on his ankle. It looks like he\u2019ll pull through, though. 33 mins: Laporte has indeed gone off, but he is at least walking unaided as he heads towards the dressing room. 32 mins: Laporte is down and receiving treatment, and it looks like his evening is over. Fernandinho is being readied. 30 mins: Save! Real threaten the City goal for the first time, with a fine cross from Mendy on the left. Benzema heads down and back across goal and is wheeling away to celebrate when Ederson gets a hand to it and pushes it away, but only as far as Vinicius Junior, who has to stretch, slips and can\u2019t get a foot to it. 29 mins: Benjamin Mendy wins the game\u2019s first booking, for tripping Modric. 28 mins: Another chance for City! Mendy slides the ball in from the left, De Bruyne dummies and Mahrez passes back to the Belgian, whose shot is disappointingly wild. 25 mins: Ooof! Mahrez gets back well to steal the ball from Vinicius Junior but then refuses to clear it, and instead dribbles a bit and then takes a very risky fall in the area in search of a free-kick. He is very lucky the referee was feeling charitable. 23 mins: City, meanwhile, are playing with Mahrez on the right and Jesus on the left, with De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva playing as withdrawn deep-lying forward-types. It\u2019s all quite interesting, tactically. 21 mins: Chance for City! De Bruyne passes to Jesus, running behind Carvajal into the left side of the penalty area. He cuts inside and blasts a shot at goal, but it\u2019s too close to Courtoise. 20 mins: Now Karim Benzema, who should be at centre-forward, gets the ball on the left and there\u2019s nobody in the penalty area at all. Real are basically playing with a random number of strikers. 16 mins: Ramos intercepts, passes to Isco and keeps running. He then takes up the bonus centre-forward position and when the cross is headed clear it\u2019s picked up by the other supposed centre-back, Raphael Varane, who had relocated to attacking midfield. His shot flies over the bar. Real\u2019s defenders, in short, are in adventurous mood. 13 mins: Mendy and Vinicius Junior look like they\u2019re going to be a real handful for Walker tonight. Incidentally, Yash Thind wins the competition by correctly spotting Riyad Mahrez. No, JJ, it wasn\u2019t Bally McBallface. 11 mins: Isco has the ball just inside Real\u2019s half, and Carvajal, Real\u2019s right-back, runs forward and takes up a position as bonus centre-forward. Attacking full-backs are on thing, but that\u2019s taking it a bit far. He goes unfound, and eventually has to retreat. 9 mins: Ferland Mendy gets down the left for Real, but Walker steals the ball off him. Then Benjamin Mendy goes down the left for City. There is an annoying surfeit of Mendies tonight. 7 mins: Real have had the better of the opening minutes, but without any great precision to their play and City\u2019s defence has consequently been unthreatened. 4 mins: Ederson has the ball. He looks to pass to his left but Laporte is tying his shoelaces, so he stands about and waits for a while. Then he doesn\u2019t pass to his left after all, instead bashing it all the way downfield to Courtois. 1 min: The first attack sees Benjamin Mendy\u2019s poor cross poorly cleared to Bernardo Silva, but Carvajal gets across in time to block the shot. 1 min: Action! Real Madrid get the game under way! The teams are out! We\u2019re now just an anthem, some handshakes and a coin toss away from action. Real Madrid\u2019s players do some pre-match high-fiving. Luka Modric, in the foreground, appears to be high-fiving the club\u2019s new invisible midfielder. This photo can also serve as a clue to the identity of the mystery player, who nobody has correctly guessed yet. \u201cMan City have only failed to score twice in their last 32 Champions League matches, and one of those was against Spurs when they missed a penalty,\u201d notes Phil Grey. \u201cSo good chance of an away goal then, although I do wonder who\u2019d take the penalty if they got one. Who\u2019s left who hasn\u2019t missed one? Ederson?\u201d Ederson is apparently the best penalty-taker at the club in training, but then I suppose he\u2019s the only one who never has to face Ederson. Guardiola isn\u2019t keen on having his goalkeeper stranded upfield should he ever fail, so he remains untried in matches. Pep Guardiola has a brief chat with BT Sport. The headlines: Fernandinho is on the bench because he \u201cis not in top, top, top condition\u201d. Sterling, meanwhile, \u201ccould play from the beginning, but 90 minutes, I don\u2019t know\u201d. Competition time! Well, I say competition, but that word generally implies a prize. Let me be clear: the winner of this competition will receive nothing in return. Now, having established the ground rules, name that player: Here\u2019s Uefa\u2019s handy illustration of Manchester City\u2019s starting lineup: \u201cIt\u2019s the Battle of the Baldies as far as the coaches go tonight,\u201d writes Justin Kavanagh. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s more like the War of the Wage Wads on the field, I suppose.\u201d I\u2019ve been poking about the history books to investigate a bit of historic creative accounting from Manchester City, in the early years of the 20th century. Here\u2019s some pre-match reading: Here are the teams again in purely textual form. Raheem Sterling is back for Manchester City, but he makes it only as far as the bench: Real Madrid: Courtois, Carvajal, Varane, Sergio Ramos, Mendy, Valverde, Casemiro, Modric, Vinicius Junior, Benzema, Isco. Subs: Areola, Eder Militao, Kroos, Bale, Marcelo, Lucas, Jovic. Man City: Ederson, Walker, Otamendi, Laporte, Mendy, De Bruyne, Rodri, Gundogan, Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus, Bernardo Silva. Subs: Bravo, Sterling, Aguero, Silva, Fernandinho, Joao Cancelo, Foden. Referee: Daniele Orsato (Italy). The team sheets have been handed in, and these were the names on them: The view from Real Madrid\u2019s dressing room, where they somehow make every player look like they\u2019re the same height: Real Madrid come into this game on the back of a 2-2 draw at home to Celta Vigo and a 1-0 defeat to Levante, leaving them two points behind Barcelona in La Liga ahead of this Sunday\u2019s Cl\u00e1sico, a fixture looming over their future ominously like a shadowy ghost character over a popular fictional hound in Scooby-Doo. Plus, their trophy cabinet contains more European Cups/Champions Leagues than can be considered healthy, so perhaps their focus will be elsewhere. Eden Hazard will certainly be elsewhere, having picked up an injury at the weekend. \u201cI don\u2019t know if his season is over, but I hope not,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said yesterday. \u201cHe loves playing football and while I can\u2019t tell you what is in his eyes, I can see he is not happy.\u201d Raheem Sterling on the other hand will be present, having recovered from a hamstring injury. \u201cHis natural condition, his regeneration is amazing. He said to us he could have played against West Ham and Leicester but the doctor said be careful,\u201d Pep Guardiola said. \u201cBut he wanted to play and that\u2019s a good sign. He\u2019s fit, he\u2019s ready.\u201d City have won two of their last four games by two and one goals to nil, and lost the other two by two and one goals to nil, from which you can conclude pretty much nothing. Sergio Ramos thinks they might be supermotivated because of the prospect of a two-year European ban: \u201cWhen you see that this could be your last Champions League in the next few years, maybe that gives you extra motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Champions League is a special competition because of what it generates, because of its magnitude worldwide, so it is the focus for all great soccer players. It is a great place for them to shine.\u201d Guardiola however thinks that is phooey: \u201cThere is no special motivation. Even if it was the last one there would not have to be extra motivation.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s your match report. Thanks for reading. Bye! \u201cWe were second to every ball in the first half \u2013 I don\u2019t know why,\u201d the Juventus skipper has told Uefa. \u201cSomething went wrong with our approach, I could sense from before kick off that something had not switched on. We were all far from each other in the first half, making everything easy for Lyon. We need to work hard ahead of the return leg because we cannot afford another game like this in Turin.\u201d David Hytner was at the Bernabeu to see Manchester City come from behind to beat Real Madrid. Here\u2019s how he saw the match unfold ... Meanwhile in Spain: Manchester City came from behind to beat Real Madrid by the odd goal of three, in a game that marked the 26th red card of Sergio Ramos\u2019s career. Simon Burnton watched that one ... Lyon celebrate: The French side\u2019s players lap up the applause of their fans, who show no sign of leaving any time soon. They\u2019ve every right to be proud of their time, who defended very stoutly tonight. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep! For only the second time this season, Juventus are held scoreless and have a one-goal deficit to overturn in the second leg. Lyon have beaten the Italian champions for the first time in their history and go to Turin with the most slender of advantages. Lucas Tousart\u2019s goal separates the sides at half-time in this tie. 90+3 min: Ronaldo leaps to get on the end of an Alex Sandro cross at the far post. His downwards header bounces wide of the upright. He collides with Marcal in mid-air and the pair engage in a bit of \u201cafters\u201d 90+1 min: We\u2019re into five minutes of added time and Juventus have yet to have a shot on target. Lyon have defended brilliantly tonight although you could argue they\u2019ve ridden their luck at times. 89 min: Ronaldo does brilliantly to keep a Bernardeschi cross that was heading wide in play. He sends a header into the Lyon penalty area from the byline, trying to tee up Dybala. He goes he appears to be grappled to the ground by Guimaraes and appeals for a penalty but doesn\u2019t get one. I was sure Juve would get a spot-kick there. 85 min: Moments after shooting wide when he should have done better, Dybala has the ball in the Lyon net after lashing home ... only to be correctly flagged for offside. 84 min: Ronaldo tries to get on the end of a clipped Ramsey cross from deep but skims his header wide. He goes to ground, claiming to have been pushed in the back by Jason Denayer, but the referee and his video assistants are having none of it. 83 min: Incredible scenes at the Bernabeu, as Manchester City score a penalty for the first time in 3,415 attempts. Kevin De Bruyne makes it 2-1 to the visitors against Real Madrid. 82 min: Higuain tries to head a cross from Danilo goalwards, but the delivery is slightly behind him and he can\u2019t get enough power on his effort after stretching every sinew to reach it. 82 min: Maxwell Cornet is helped off by two of Lyon\u2019s backroom staff and replaced by Joachim Andersen. 80 min: Meanwhile in Spain,, Gabriel Jesus has restored parity for Manchester City against Real Madrid. It\u2019s 1-1 at the Bernabeu. 79 min: Juve corner, won by Aaron Ramsey. Moussa Dembele clears the inswinger with a header, but only as far as Paulo Dybala. He whacks it on the half-volley but his effort fizzes over the bar. 79 min: Juventus substitution: Adrien Rabiot off, Federico Bernardeschi on. 78 min: Lyon substitution: Kenny Tete on for Leo Dubois. 74 min: Lyon press and probe around the edges of the Lyon penalty area, but for the time being at least, the French side are defending in a very compact manner and offering them no way through. 72 min: Deep in Lyon territory, Ramsey is penalised for a foul on Cornet, who goes to ground holding his ankle. 70 min: Juventus substitution: Gonzalo Higuain comes on for Juan Cuadrado, who has had a quiet night. 69 min: Dybala snatches at a cross from Alex Sandro and sends the ball flashing wide of the left upright off his shin. From six yards out!!! 67 min: Lyon substitution: Ekambi, who has been a constant menace tonight goes off to a well earned round of applause from the home crowd. Martin Terrier comes on to snarl and snap around the ankles of various Juventus players. 65 min: Alex Sandro tries a shot from distance but Denayer blocks that one as well. Lyon are dropping back, defending very deep. 63 min: Ramsey gets a shot away from the edge of the Lyon penalty area, but it\u2019s smothered by Jason Denayer. 62 min: Juventus substitution: Aaron Ramsey is on, with Miralem Pjanic making way for the Welshman. Juve have not yet had a shot in target and are playing poorly by their own high standards. 61 min: Yellow card - Maxwell Cornet is booked for a foul on Paulo Dybala. He tackled him from behind and it\u2019s not his first offence either. 59 min: Meanwhile in Spain, Isco has put Real Madrid a goal up against Manchester City. 57 min: A delivery into the Lyon box from Alex Sandro is gathered comfortably by Anthony Lopes in the home side\u2019s goal. 55 min: Cornet catches Cuadrado with a kick and Juve have another free-kick on the fringe of the Lyon penalty area, between the right edge and the touchline. Dybala curls the ball into the penalty area with his left foot, but fails to clear Ekambi, the first defender. Poor from Juventus, again. 54 min: Lyon win another corner and this time it\u2019s floated into the Juve penalty area. Juventus clear. 53 min: Ronaldo and Pjanic stand over the free-kick and it\u2019s the midfielder from Bosnia and Herzogovina who takes it. Like Ronaldo before him, he hits the wall, with Moussa Dembele leaping to block his effort with his head. 51 min: Ronaldo draws a foul from Guimaraeas on the left side of the Lyon penalty area. It\u2019s in a good position ... 50 min: Lyon take the corner short and Marcel arrows the ball towards the far post from a good angle. Jeve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny screams for the ball and claims it confidently. 49 min: Lyon win a corner, Cornet\u2019s cross from the left going out off Danilo after good work down the flank from the lively Ekambi. 48 min: Marcal blocks an attempted cross from Danilo to put the ball out for a throw-in deep in Lyon territory. Nothing comes of it. 47 min: Much like the first half, Lyon dominate the very early stages of the second. Rodrigo Bentancur swings a cross into the Lyon penalty area from the left touchline, but puts too much power on his delivery, which bounces out for a throw-in on the far side. 46 min: Lyon get the ball rolling for the second half, hoping to beat Juventus for the first time ever. There are no changes in personnel on either side. Meanwhile in Spain: It\u2019s scoreless between Real Madrid and Manchester City in tonight\u2019s other game. Simon Burnton is watching that one ... Peep: The home fans plead for the half-time whistle and get their wish. Their team lead at the break courtesy of Lucas Tousart\u2019s scruffy goal on 32 minutes. Juventus have been far from convincing and have yet to trouble Anthony Lopes in the Lyon goal. 45 min: A sensational touch from Ronaldo on the edge of the Lyon penalty area forces Dubois to take him out. Free-kick for Juve, which Ronaldo will take. His effort is poor and is blocked by Dembele in the defensive wall. 43 min: Lyon advance with Akambi on the ball. With Dembele to his left, he opts not to slide the ball his teammate\u2019s way and instead have a pop himself. His shot fizzes wide. 41 min: Akambi intercepts a pass from Pjanic meant for Bonucci, outruns the veteran centre-half and fires over the bar. The Italian champions are looking less than assured at the back this evening. 40 min: Bentancur puts the ball out for another Lyon corner after a powerful run into the Juve box by Cornet. They take it short and |Juve win possession and embark on an ill-fated counter-attack. 38 min: There\u2019s a VAR check to see if Juan Cuadrado handled the ball in the Juventus penalty area. The ball hit his side and then his arm, which he was trying to move out of the way. Within seconds, the folks in Uefa\u2019s equivalent of Stockley Park, tell the ref that Lyon won\u2019t be getting a penalty on this occasion. 37 min: Danilo gets a telling-off, but no booking, for a rather agricultural challenge on Leo Dubois. Lucky boy. 35 min: Cristiano Ronaldo tries to curl a shot from the inside left around Lopes, but sends his effort wide of the far upright. 33 min: Mattijs de Ligt was off the field getting his head bandaged and returns to find his team a goal down. It wasn\u2019t the prettiest of strikes, but Lyon and their supporters won\u2019t care. The ball was crossed into the centre from the left by Houssem Aouar and Lucas Tousart leapt to shin a volley past Szczesny and inside the far post. Lyon take the lead! With Juve temporarily down to 10 men, Lyon go ahead through Lucas Tousart. 30 min: With blood pouring from a cut on his head, Mattijs de Ligt is told to go and get himself cleaned up by the referee. Replays suggest he appears to have been caught unintentionally by Moussa Dembele\u2019s boot as he lay on the floor and the Lyon striker landed after contesting a high ball. 28 min: Lyon defender Marcelo is booked for catching Dybala with an elbow as he tried to twist away from the Juventus striker. There was no malice intended, but that doesn\u2019t matter. 27 min: Alex Sandro tries his luck from distance with a left-footed surface-to-air effort that is too high and fizzes well wide of the Lyon goal. 24 min: After a dreary opening 20 minutes, things are picking up. Cristiano Ronaldo stands the ball up at the far post after good work down the left flank and with Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes missing the ball and Rodrigo Bentancur leaping for the header, Maxwell Cornet contorts his body in mid-air to clear with his own bonce. 23 min: Leo Dubois sends an excellent cross from the right into the Juve penalty area, forcing Matthijs de Ligt to head wide of his own goal for a corner under pressure from Dembele. Nothing comes from the ensuing set piece. 21 min: Juan Cuadrado gives away a corner, Lyon\u2019s first of the game. The ball\u2019s swung into the mixer by Houssem Auer and Ekambi\u2019s near post flick beats Szczesny only to hit the bar. That\u2019s a real let-off for Juve, who have been saved by the woodwork after Ekambi got in front of his marker. 20 min: Leo Dubois advances down the right wing with the ball at his feet and ends up trying a shot from distance, which is blocked. 19 min: Moussa Dembele uses his strength to outmuscle Bonucci and wins a free-kick in midfield for his troubles. 17 min: Lyon new boy Bruno Guimaraes, making only his second appearance for the club, spreads the play to the left wing for Cornet to collect, but he fails to get a cross into the Juve box. 14 min: Ronaldo is brought down from behind and wins a free-kick a few yards outside the Lyon penalty area, well right of centre. It looks to be in Paulo Dybala\u2019s range, but the left-footer doesn\u2019t take it on. Pjanic clips the ball into the box and it\u2019s put out for a corner, from which nothing comes. 13 min: Content to let Juve have the ball, Lyon are masking no effort to press their opponents in their own half. 11 min: Lyon enjoy an extended spell of possession, but do nothing of note with it before returning the ball to Juventus. Alex Sandro gives the ball back to Lyon\u2019s Leo Dubois, but he overhits his ball forward towards Karl Toko Ekambi. 8 min: Miralem Pjanic, a surprise inclusion in the Juve line-up tonight after his return from a spell on the sidelines, has settled into the game well and is spraying the ball around midfield. No chances of note to report thus far. 6 min: Moussa Dembele tries a shot at goal from distance that is deflected into the arms of Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. There\u2019s a break in play as Lyon right-back Maxwell Cornet receives medical attention after a collision with Paulo Dybala. 4 min: Cristiano Ronaldo curls a cross towards the far post that looks like it might float in to the top right-hand corner. It appears to take a deflection off Jason Denayer on its way wide, but referee Jesus Gill Manzano awards a goal kick. 3 min: An early throw-in for Lyon, who have lined up with three central defenders and two wing-backs. Juventusa are playing a 4-3-3, with Rabiot in for Aaron Ramsey and no place for Giorgio Chiellini in their match-day squad after his recent return from a serious knee injury. 2 min: Juventus dominate possession in these very early stages, They give the ball away in midfield after a series of passes, but it\u2019s quickly retrieved by Leonardo Bonucci. 1 min: Juventua, their players wearing aqua-marine shirts, shorts and socks get the ball rolling. The players of Lyon are a vision in virginal white. Not long now: The teams march out of the tunnel and line up either side of the referee and his team of match officials for the Champions League and the last of the pre-match formalities. Cristiano Ronaldo, standing proudly beneath the top-knot adorning the crown of his head, looks pumped. Lyon: Lopes, Marcelo, Denayer, Marcal, Dubois, Bruno Guimaraes, Tousart, Cornet, Toko Ekambi, Aouar, Dembele. Subs: Andersen, Terrier, Traore, Thiago Mendes, Tete, Caqueret, Tatarusanu. Juventus: Szczesny, Danilo, de Ligt, Bonucci, Alex Sandro, Bentancur, Pjanic, Rabiot, Cuadrado, Dybala, Ronaldo. Subs: De Sciglio, Ramsey, Matuidi, Higuain, Rugani, Bernardeschi, Buffon. Referee: Jesus Gil Manzano (Spain) Tonight\u2019s referee Jesus Gil Manzano, whose hand Leo Messi once refused to shake following a 2018 draw between Barcelona and Girona, is tasked with maintaining order during tonight\u2019s game. Here\u2019s hoping nobody leaves him hanging at the final whistle tonight. Maurizio Sarri speaks ... \u201cLyon are a technical team with elements of great acceleration and physicality,\u201d said Juve\u2019s manager, who is hoping to add the Champions League to the Europa League he won with Chelsea last season. They are a dangerous team so we have to put in a great performance.\u201d Asked about his star player, who has scored in nine consecutive games (bagging 13 goals in the process), Sarri was effusive in his praise. \u201cCristiano Ronaldo is a player who is appreciated all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cHis stats say enough about the state of his form. He is an enthralling player, and is well both from a physical and mental point of view. In Italy we have an obligation and responsibility to win. In Europe we are amongst ten other teams with this goal.\u201d Rudi Garcia speaks ... \u201cIt\u2019s a great challenge, a real pleasure to host them,\u201d he said of Juventus. \u201cWe\u2019re in the top 16 teams in Europe. Miralem Pjani\u0107 [former Garcia player at Roma, former Lyon player, now at Juve] is a person with great quality, incredibly skilled. He is a big strength of Juventus. We are happy to welcome Maurizio Sarri. He is a very good coach, with a lot of experience.\u201d Asked to elaborate, he had this to say of his opposite number. \u201cJuventus play the same way that Napoli and Empoli did under Sarri,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a tactically astute coach: no doubt about it.

If we are to prosper, we\u2019ll need our fans\u2019 support to find more energy and to be on our top form.\u201d Early team news Lyon have been hit hard with injuries and will be without five players, including skipper Memphis Depay, who damaged his ACL in December. Left-back Youssouf Kone, midfielder Jeff Reine-Adelaide, right-back Rafael and central defender Oumar Solet have also been ruled out. For Juventus, the evergreen Giorgio Chiellini made his come-back from a long-term knee-injury against Brescia last Sunday week, has since featured against Spal and looks likely to make his first Champions League appearance of the season tonight. Midfielder Miraelm Pjanic, who spent three years at Lyon before moving to Italy in 2011, is less likely to start and Rodrigo Betancur could get the nod instead. Sami Khedira, Merih Demiral and Douglas Costa are all sidelined. Parc Olympique Lyonnais (aka the Groupama Stadium to les bean-counters) is the venue for the latest in a series of intriguing knockout matches in this season\u2019s Champions League. Rudi Garcia\u2019s Lyon have underwhelmed on the domestic and European fronts this season and currently sit seventh in Ligue 1. They go into this tie as underdogs against the Italian champions and league leaders, who are still looking to win that elusive first European title since \u2013 and this is scarcely believable \u2013 1996. Kick-off is at 8pm (GMT), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime.",

      "body": "<p>For Manchester City it would have been easy to think this was set to be another of those frustrating Champions League matches, when the little details were against them, when their best attacking efforts came to nothing.</p> <p>Pep Guardiola\u2019s team were looking comfortable despite the loss of their key defender, Aymeric Laporte, to injury in the first half and then, out of nowhere, they were behind. The concession was grisly, with Kyle Walker guilty of losing out to Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and following a quick pass, Isco was in to finish.</p> <p>Real Madrid were flat throughout, lacking inspiration, but they are a team who know how to get the job done. They seemed ready to guard a 1-0 lead to take to the Etihad Stadium in three weeks\u2019 time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/23/sergio-ramos-19-real-madrid-red-cards\">Sergio Ramos and his 26 Real Madrid red cards: a retrospective</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet City were not finished. Far from it. They had sensed vulnerability in Real and during a glorious finale, they made their punches count. This was a victory of spirit and style and it was triggered by Gabriel Jesus, who had gone close and refused to believe he would end up on the losing side.</p> <p>Kevin De Bruyne dug out an excellent cross from the byline which evaded Sergio Ramos and asked Jesus to attack it. He did and his header eluded Thibaut Courtois. Real\u2019s cries for a foul by Jesus on Ramos were in vain.

      "bodyText": "For Manchester City it would have been easy to think this was set to be another of those frustrating Champions League matches, when the little details were against them, when their best attacking efforts came to nothing. Pep Guardiola\u2019s team were looking comfortable despite the loss of their key defender, Aymeric Laporte, to injury in the first half and then, out of nowhere, they were behind. The concession was grisly, with Kyle Walker guilty of losing out to Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and following a quick pass, Isco was in to finish. Real Madrid were flat throughout, lacking inspiration, but they are a team who know how to get the job done. They seemed ready to guard a 1-0 lead to take to the Etihad Stadium in three weeks\u2019 time. Yet City were not finished. Far from it. They had sensed vulnerability in Real and during a glorious finale, they made their punches count. This was a victory of spirit and style and it was triggered by Gabriel Jesus, who had gone close and refused to believe he would end up on the losing side. Kevin De Bruyne dug out an excellent cross from the byline which evaded Sergio Ramos and asked Jesus to attack it. He did and his header eluded Thibaut Courtois. Real\u2019s cries for a foul by Jesus on Ramos were in vain. The striker had his reward for a display of remorseless intensity. Guardiola\u2019s selection had featured several headlines, one of them being the omission of Raheem Sterling from the starting lineup. The forward, who was fit after hamstring trouble, was bitterly disappointed but having been sent on for the final push, he helped to make the difference, driving away from Dani Carvajal to be chopped down for a penalty. Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Jesus and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan have all missed from the spot for City this season and so De Bruyne accepted the responsibility. The nerves of the travelling support jangled but De Bruyne was a snapshot in composure and when he sent Courtois the wrong way, it was the prompt for City\u2019s hopes to surge. The club have won only four knock-out ties in nine seasons in this competition but the fifth is within their grasp, and the cold truth for Real was that they could already have been staring at the exit door. The team Guardiola called the kings of the Champions League had Ramos sent off towards the end for a last-man foul on Jesus, giving Riyad Mahrez the chance to score with a free-kick from the edge of the area, which he passed up.

Guardiola had surprised everyone by resting Fernandinho, Sterling and Ag\u00fcero, while his 4-4-2 system featured Jesus on the left flank, even though he played through the middle for the opening few minutes, and De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva as the central attackers. The idea was for the unlikely strike duo to set a high press, with Mahrez and Jesus making the pitch wide \u2013 to use Guardiola\u2019s description.

      "body": "<p>Sergio Ramos may have won the Champions League four times, four La Liga titles, the World Cup and two European Championships but once again the defender is in the headlines for the wrong reasons. On Wednesday night, the 33-year-old was sent off after bringing down Gabriel Jesus just outside the box in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/26/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\">Real Madrid\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Manchester City</a> in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at the Bernab\u00e9u \u2013 the 26th time in his career that he has seen red. Delve into Ramos\u2019s back catalogue here:</p> <h2>1) Espanyol 1-0 Real Madrid, La Liga, 18 September 2005</h2> <p>Two yellow cards in the 61st and 87th minutes was an appropriate beginning to Ramos\u2019s red card journey when he was sent off at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona. It began a habit of obtaining double yellows rather than straight reds and his consequent suspension paved the way for a notable debut: step forward Jonathan Woodgate.</p> <h2>2) Real Madrid 2-1 Olympiakos, Champions League, 29 September 2005</h2> <p>Just 10 days later, Ramos received the second red of his Madrid career when he was dismissed for a clash with the Olympiakos substitute Giannakis Okkas, reacting angrily to a late challenge by the Cypriot in the 91st minute. The sending-off came only minutes after a young Roberto Soldado had spared Madrid\u2019s blushes with a late winner.</p> <h2>3) Real Sociedad 2-2 Real Madrid, La Liga, 27 November 2005</h2> <p>Madrid needed two goals within the last five minutes to salvage a draw at the Anoeta after Ramos had earlier been sent off in a game where both sides were reduced to 10 men.</p> <h2>4) Real Madrid 3-3 Villarreal, La Liga, 7 May 2006</h2> <p>Zinedine Zidane\u2019s final game was marred by a straight red card for Ramos after a handball in his own box.

It seemed the experience of his fellow defenders Roberto Carlos and Fabio Cannavaro was having little impact on the young Spaniard.</p> <h2>6) Sevilla 2-0 Real Madrid, La Liga, 3 November 2007</h2> <p>Two silly tackles resulted in two yellow cards for Ramos five minutes either side of half-time. The loss relegated Madrid to third in the table, with Sevilla overtaking them.</p> <h2>7) Recreativo 2-3 Real Madrid, La Liga, 1 March 2008</h2> <p>In a hugely ill-tempered match that saw three red cards, Ramos was sent off in the 55th-minute after an elbow on the former Liverpool striker Florent Sinama-Pongolle. He had been booked following a rash double-footed challenge just five minutes earlier.</p> <h2>8) Mallorca 1-1 Real Madrid, La Liga, 5 April 2008</h2> <p>The Spaniard earned his second red card in little over two months as he was booked twice once again before receiving his marching orders. A 46th-minute handball was followed 20 minutes later by a deliberate trip. Despite dropping two points, Madrid remained top and would go on to win La Liga that season.</p> <h2>9) Real Madrid 4-3 M\u00e1laga, La Liga, 9 November 2008</h2> <p>Ramos received a straight red for a blatant step on the chest of Eliseu while the Portuguese defender was on the ground.</p> <h2>10) Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2-3 Real Madrid, La Liga, 7 November 2009</h2> <p>The Spaniard was sent off for the second time in the Madrid derby, this time earning an instant dismissal following a last-man challenge on Sergio Ag\u00fcero.</p> <h2>11) Ajax 0-4 Real Madrid, Champions League, 23 November 2010</h2> <p>After receiving a booking for throwing the ball away in the first half, he was shown a second yellow for the same time-wasting tactics in second-half injury-time. With the group won, sceptics believed Ramos\u2019 dismissal to have been deliberately earned, in order that he could serve a suspension in the dead-rubber final group game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e703673b70a600dc4fbbe2213586dbbd5813e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e703673b70a600dc4fbbe2213586dbbd5813e76/0_42_2377_1426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramos is sent off during Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League tie with Galatasaray in November 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramos is sent off during Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League tie with Galatasaray in November 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>12) Barcelona 5-0 Real Madrid, La Liga, 29 November 2010</h2> <p>A scything tackle on David Villa was met with a yellow card 20 minutes from time before Ramos then hacked down Lionel Messi in injury time. Additional handbags with Carles Puyol and Xavi ensured his first red card in el cl\u00e1sico.</p> <h2>13) Barcelona 2-2 Real Madrid, Copa del Rey, 25 January 2012</h2> <p>An initial yellow card for protesting a free-kick was followed by another for an elbow on his international team-mate Sergio Busquets. Ramos had earlier had a headed goal disallowed for a foul in the build-up on the night Madrid crashed out of the Copa at the semi-final stage.</p> <h2>14) Villarreal 1-1 Real Madrid, La Liga, 21 March 2012</h2> <p>On Ramos\u2019s 300th appearance for Madrid, he set a new record for the club as his two yellow cards meant he had been sent off in La Liga more times than any other Madrid player in history. He received his marching orders following an elbow on Nilmar, on a night the manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Mesut \u00d6zil also saw red for Madrid.</p> <h2>15) Real Madrid 4-0 Celta Vigo, Copa del Rey, 2 January 2013</h2> <p>After gaining an unneeded booking during a mild altercation with the Celta players, Ramos secured a very deserved second yellow for a challenge which possibly warranted a straight red. As they grappled for the ball, Ramos kicked out as Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez, catching him in the chest.</p> <h2>16) Real Madrid 2-0 Rayo Vallecano, La Liga, 17 February 2013</h2> <p>Ramos received two yellow cards, was sent off and scored inside the opening 20 minutes. After doubling Madrid\u2019s lead in the 12th minute, he was booked twice in a 42-second period five minutes later. First he tugged the shirt of Robert Trashorras before committing a deliberate handball.</p> <h2>17) Real Madrid 4-1 Galatasaray, Champions League, 27 November 2013</h2> <p>The Spaniard earned a 26th-minute straight red as the last line of defence following a foul on Umut Bulut. His dismissal meant Ramos has now averaged a red card every 20 games for Madrid.</p> <h2>18) Osasuna 2-2 Real Madrid, La Liga, 14 December 2013</h2> <p>The first of Ramos\u2019 two yellows, shown for a dissent after he was harshly adjudged to have fouled \u00c1lvaro Cejudo, could be considered unlucky. He could arguably have been shown a straight red card though for his second offence: a forearm swing at the face of his marker. Madrid were 2-0 down at the time of his dismissal but managed to equalise thanks to a late goal from Pepe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cced25a126b5f087465aa21adbfa195d1a666479\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cced25a126b5f087465aa21adbfa195d1a666479/0_57_3500_2371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramos is dismissed in the cl\u00e1sico after a foul on Neymar.

Neymar tumbled to the floor in the penalty box, Ramos was sent off despite his typically furious remonstrations and Lionel Messi stepped up to draw Barcelona level. Twenty minutes later the Argentinian repeated the trick from the spot to complete his hat-trick and blow the La Liga title race wide open.</p> <h2>20) Las Palmas 1-2 Real Madrid, La Liga, 13 March 2016</h2> <p>After surviving the 2014-15 season without a red card, an apparently reformed Ramos was on his way to making it two seasons in a row before a stoppage-time yellow in Gran Canaria ended that run. Having picked up a yellow card in the first half the Real Madrid captain then crunched through the back of his Las Palmas counterpart, Momo, in the dying moments to seal his 20th career red card.</p> <h2>21) Barcelona 1-2 Real Madrid, La Liga, 2 April 2016</h2> <p>His first return to action after suspension following the red card at Las Palmas came in El Cl\u00e1sico. After picking up an early booking, Ramos spent the rest of the match apparently chasing another, though it took until the 84th minute for Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez to finally reach to his pocket and and show the second yellow, when Ramos needlessly slid through the back of Luis Su\u00e1rez. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/02/barcelona-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s late winner won Real the points</a> nonetheless and reignited the title race, ending Barcelona\u2019s 39-game unbeaten streak in the process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441adcc4a5ea4f63c2db4afd62b36f0e9044be6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441adcc4a5ea4f63c2db4afd62b36f0e9044be6f/0_63_3479_2087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sergio Ramos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s red.

A wild lunge fortunately didn\u2019t fully connect with the Barcelona forward \u2013 had it done so he could have been seriously injured \u2013 but it still sent him tumbling into the air before thudding into the Bernab\u00e9u turf. The referee Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez had no hesitation in directing Ramos towards an early bath. Ten-man Real equalised through James Rodriguez but could not hold on. Messi\u2019s sumptuous injury-time goal sealed a 3-2 win for Bar\u00e7a.</p> <h2>23) Deportivo 0-3 Real Madrid, La Liga, 20 August 2017</h2> <p>Ramos earned a booking after an angry confrontation with D\u00e9por\u2019s Fabian Sch\u00e4r, who was also cautioned. The centre-back raised his hands to the Swiss defender\u2019s face after 53 minutes, and was fortunate not to receive a straight red. With the game won, Ramos picked up a second yellow card in stoppage time after using his elbow in an aerial challenge with Deportivo\u2019s Borja Valle.</p> <h2>24) Athletic Bilbao 0-0 Real Madrid, La Liga, 2 December 2017</h2> <p>After missing three matches with a broken nose, Ramos returned to the Real Madrid line-up against Athletic Bilbao wearing a face mask \u2013 and was promptly sent off for two separate incidents where he raised an arm to an opponent. Booked in the 11th minute for landing a forearm on Raul Garc\u00eda, he followed it up by catching Artiz Aduriz with his arm three minutes from time. Ramos is now La Liga\u2019s all-time record holder for red cards after picking up his 19th league dismissal.</p> <h2>25) Real Madrid 1-2 Girona, La Liga, 17 February, 2019</h2> <p>Having remarkably gone a while calendar year without seeing red in 2018, the Spain defender was back on form in February 2019. With Real Madrid losing at home to Girona, and in a desperate attempt to force an equaliser, Ramos found himself in the opposition\u2019s box and attempting to score with an overhead kick. However, having already been booked for a handball from which Girona scored a penalty, the defender was given his second yellow for a high foot in the dying minutes of the game.</p> <h2>26) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/feb/26/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-live\">Real Madrid 1-2 Manchester City</a>, Champions League 26 February 2020</h2> <p>Having amazingly gone another calendar year without seeing red, Sergio Ramos is sent off for the 26th time on the 26 February. Late in the game Casemiro played a poor pass towards Raphael Varane, and Gabriel Jesus poked it away and sprinted clear. Ramos gamely chased after Jesus and put a hand on his shoulder only to see the City player throw himself to the ground just outside the penalty area. It\u2019s a foul, but only just. Has Ramos been unlucky with this one? Has a rival player used the dark arts against him? It doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s off. Again.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sergio Ramos may have won the Champions League four times, four La Liga titles, the World Cup and two European Championships but once again the defender is in the headlines for the wrong reasons. On Wednesday night, the 33-year-old was sent off after bringing down Gabriel Jesus just outside the box in Real Madrid\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at the Bernab\u00e9u \u2013 the 26th time in his career that he has seen red. Delve into Ramos\u2019s back catalogue here: 1) Espanyol 1-0 Real Madrid, La Liga, 18 September 2005 Two yellow cards in the 61st and 87th minutes was an appropriate beginning to Ramos\u2019s red card journey when he was sent off at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona. It began a habit of obtaining double yellows rather than straight reds and his consequent suspension paved the way for a notable debut: step forward Jonathan Woodgate. 2) Real Madrid 2-1 Olympiakos, Champions League, 29 September 2005 Just 10 days later, Ramos received the second red of his Madrid career when he was dismissed for a clash with the Olympiakos substitute Giannakis Okkas, reacting angrily to a late challenge by the Cypriot in the 91st minute. The sending-off came only minutes after a young Roberto Soldado had spared Madrid\u2019s blushes with a late winner. 3) Real Sociedad 2-2 Real Madrid, La Liga, 27 November 2005 Madrid needed two goals within the last five minutes to salvage a draw at the Anoeta after Ramos had earlier been sent off in a game where both sides were reduced to 10 men. 4) Real Madrid 3-3 Villarreal, La Liga, 7 May 2006 Zinedine Zidane\u2019s final game was marred by a straight red card for Ramos after a handball in his own box. Diego Forl\u00e1n duly converted the penally before Julio Baptista scored a late equaliser for Madrid. 5) Real Madrid 1-1 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, La Liga, 1 October 2006 Ramos was sent off for the first time in a Madrid derby as two customary fouls earned him his two customary bookings. It seemed the experience of his fellow defenders Roberto Carlos and Fabio Cannavaro was having little impact on the young Spaniard. 6) Sevilla 2-0 Real Madrid, La Liga, 3 November 2007 Two silly tackles resulted in two yellow cards for Ramos five minutes either side of half-time. The loss relegated Madrid to third in the table, with Sevilla overtaking them. 7) Recreativo 2-3 Real Madrid, La Liga, 1 March 2008 In a hugely ill-tempered match that saw three red cards, Ramos was sent off in the 55th-minute after an elbow on the former Liverpool striker Florent Sinama-Pongolle. He had been booked following a rash double-footed challenge just five minutes earlier. 8) Mallorca 1-1 Real Madrid, La Liga, 5 April 2008 The Spaniard earned his second red card in little over two months as he was booked twice once again before receiving his marching orders. A 46th-minute handball was followed 20 minutes later by a deliberate trip. Despite dropping two points, Madrid remained top and would go on to win La Liga that season. 9) Real Madrid 4-3 M\u00e1laga, La Liga, 9 November 2008 Ramos received a straight red for a blatant step on the chest of Eliseu while the Portuguese defender was on the ground. 10) Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2-3 Real Madrid, La Liga, 7 November 2009 The Spaniard was sent off for the second time in the Madrid derby, this time earning an instant dismissal following a last-man challenge on Sergio Ag\u00fcero. 11) Ajax 0-4 Real Madrid, Champions League, 23 November 2010 After receiving a booking for throwing the ball away in the first half, he was shown a second yellow for the same time-wasting tactics in second-half injury-time. With the group won, sceptics believed Ramos\u2019 dismissal to have been deliberately earned, in order that he could serve a suspension in the dead-rubber final group game. 12) Barcelona 5-0 Real Madrid, La Liga, 29 November 2010 A scything tackle on David Villa was met with a yellow card 20 minutes from time before Ramos then hacked down Lionel Messi in injury time. Additional handbags with Carles Puyol and Xavi ensured his first red card in el cl\u00e1sico. 13) Barcelona 2-2 Real Madrid, Copa del Rey, 25 January 2012 An initial yellow card for protesting a free-kick was followed by another for an elbow on his international team-mate Sergio Busquets.

      "body": "<p>On its own terms, DAU. Natasha is a brutally queasy and stark picture of the life of a fictional woman who works in the staff canteen of a Stalin-era scientific research institute in Moscow, headed by theoretical physicist Lev Landau (nicknamed \u201cDau\u201d). It shows us her quarrelsome relationship with her younger assistant Olga, who waits on tables while Natasha serves at the till. Eventually, the film gives us a look inside Room 101, with all its terror and squalor.</p> <p>However, the film cannot simply be judged on its own terms, but as part of a gigantic (but mostly unseen and perhaps unseeable) whole: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/26/inside-the-stalinist-truman-show-dau-i-had-absolute-freedom-until-the-kgb-grabbed-me\">a colossal multimedia art</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/26/inside-the-stalinist-truman-show-dau-i-had-absolute-freedom-until-the-kgb-grabbed-me\"> installation project 15 years in the making</a> that has become legend. Not least, this is because of its weird similarity to the <em>folie de grandeur </em>envisaged by the fictional theatre director in Charlie Kaufman\u2019s 2008 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/15/synecdoche-new-york\">Synecdoche, New York</a>, who proposed an entire city block full of actors improvising \u201creal\u201d lives on a 24/7 basis for months and years until the director thinks the resulting dramas are ready to be shown to an audience. This film originated as a conventional biopic of Landau begun in 2006, but which director Ilya Khrzhanovsky repurposed by taking the part-replica of the Moscow institute, built already in Ukraine for location shooting purposes, and then finishing every room inside as an absolutely accurate clone of the research institute.

      "bodyText": "On its own terms, DAU. Natasha is a brutally queasy and stark picture of the life of a fictional woman who works in the staff canteen of a Stalin-era scientific research institute in Moscow, headed by theoretical physicist Lev Landau (nicknamed \u201cDau\u201d). It shows us her quarrelsome relationship with her younger assistant Olga, who waits on tables while Natasha serves at the till. Eventually, the film gives us a look inside Room 101, with all its terror and squalor. However, the film cannot simply be judged on its own terms, but as part of a gigantic (but mostly unseen and perhaps unseeable) whole: a colossal multimedia art installation project 15 years in the making that has become legend. Not least, this is because of its weird similarity to the folie de grandeur envisaged by the fictional theatre director in Charlie Kaufman\u2019s 2008 film Synecdoche, New York, who proposed an entire city block full of actors improvising \u201creal\u201d lives on a 24/7 basis for months and years until the director thinks the resulting dramas are ready to be shown to an audience. This film originated as a conventional biopic of Landau begun in 2006, but which director Ilya Khrzhanovsky repurposed by taking the part-replica of the Moscow institute, built already in Ukraine for location shooting purposes, and then finishing every room inside as an absolutely accurate clone of the research institute. It was filled with hundreds of actors who lived and \u201cworked\u201d in an ongoing improvisation there for months, cut off from the internet and the outside world, before shooting could begin, showing the many stories generated within this artificial universe.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump addressed the public on Wednesday night to discuss the government\u2019s response to coronavirus, which US health officials say has entered a new phase.</p> <p>The president had previously expressed optimismthat did not mesh with warnings from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Trump on Wednesday again tried to dispel Americans\u2019 fears: \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019re totally prepared,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Trump has complained without evidence that the news media is \u201cdoing everything possible\u201d to make coronavirus \u201clook as bad as possible\u201d, while he has praised his administration\u2019s response.

The CDC is considering expanding the testing protocol to include people traveling to the US from countries beyond mainland China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-donald-trump-us-response\">Donald Trump praises US coronavirus response while playing down impact</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">told the Guardian this week</a> the US does not have a fully mobilized response to testing for coronavirus. \u201cIt is puzzling to me that the government has been unable so far to resolve that problem, at a time when most other countries that are facing the disease have been able to do testing at a much larger scale,\u201d said Konyndyk.</p> <h2><strong>Who is in charge?</strong></h2> <p>According to the White House, the coronavirus response is in the hands of the health secretary, Alex Azar.</p> <p>During the Ebola crisis, Barack Obama\u2019s administration established a post to oversee the government\u2019s response in case the outbreak turned into a pandemic. Lawmakers and health experts have called for a similar post to be made in the Trump White House for coronavirus.</p> <p>Ronald Klain, who held the Ebola position under Obama, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">told the New York Times</a>: \u201cOne cabinet secretary cannot run an interagency response. Azar has the biggest civilian job in the American government. Is he doing this in his spare time?\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, the White House deputy press secretary, Judd Deere, said on Twitter that a report the White House is considering appointing a coronavirus czar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddPDeere45/status/1232703854791229440\">\u201cis not true!\u201d</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/us-coronavirus-budget-cuts-trump-underprepared\">In May</a>, the Trump administration scrapped a position created after Klain\u2019s departure to coordinate similar responses in the future: senior director for global health security and biothreats on the national security council (NSC). <a href=\"https://globalbiodefense.com/2020/02/19/senators-call-on-trump-administration-to-immediately-fill-global-health-security-position/\">Last week</a>, 27 senators wrote a letter to Trump asking him to quickly fill the job.</p> <p>The Pulitzer-prize-winning science writer <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/31/coronavirus-china-trump-united-states-public-health-emergency-response/\">Laurie Garrett</a> said the federal government had \u201cintentionally rendered itself incapable\u201d of responding to the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cIn numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the US government, the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIf the United States still has a clear chain of command for pandemic response, the White House urgently needs to clarify what it is \u2013 not just for the public but for the government itself, which largely finds itself in the dark.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How much money is available?</strong></h2> <p>The US is entering this phase of the coronavirus outbreak after repeated attempts by the federal government to drastically cut CDC funding.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump addressed the public on Wednesday night to discuss the government\u2019s response to coronavirus, which US health officials say has entered a new phase. The president had previously expressed optimismthat did not mesh with warnings from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Trump on Wednesday again tried to dispel Americans\u2019 fears: \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019re totally prepared,\u201d he said. Trump has complained without evidence that the news media is \u201cdoing everything possible\u201d to make coronavirus \u201clook as bad as possible\u201d, while he has praised his administration\u2019s response. Despite his rosy picture of the administration\u2019s work, serious concerns have been raised about its response so far. These were the top questions for Trump before his remarks include: How is the US monitoring the outbreak? The government distributed faulty test kits and public health experts are increasingly concerned the lack of testing is misrepresenting the spread of coronavirus in the US. Test kits have not been widely distributed to hospitals or medical labs and the kits that have been sent out must be sent back to the CDC in Atlanta to confirm results. While South Korea has tested more than 35,000 people for coronavirus, the US has tested 426 people, excluding those returned on evacuation flights, according to the Washington Post. As of now, the US recommends testing only for people who display respiratory symptoms and have recently traveled to China or had close contact with an infected person. The CDC is considering expanding the testing protocol to include people traveling to the US from countries beyond mainland China. Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, told the Guardian this week the US does not have a fully mobilized response to testing for coronavirus. \u201cIt is puzzling to me that the government has been unable so far to resolve that problem, at a time when most other countries that are facing the disease have been able to do testing at a much larger scale,\u201d said Konyndyk. Who is in charge? According to the White House, the coronavirus response is in the hands of the health secretary, Alex Azar. During the Ebola crisis, Barack Obama\u2019s administration established a post to oversee the government\u2019s response in case the outbreak turned into a pandemic. Lawmakers and health experts have called for a similar post to be made in the Trump White House for coronavirus. Ronald Klain, who held the Ebola position under Obama, told the New York Times: \u201cOne cabinet secretary cannot run an interagency response. Azar has the biggest civilian job in the American government. Is he doing this in his spare time?\u201d On Wednesday, the White House deputy press secretary, Judd Deere, said on Twitter that a report the White House is considering appointing a coronavirus czar \u201cis not true!\u201d In May, the Trump administration scrapped a position created after Klain\u2019s departure to coordinate similar responses in the future: senior director for global health security and biothreats on the national security council (NSC). Last week, 27 senators wrote a letter to Trump asking him to quickly fill the job. The Pulitzer-prize-winning science writer Laurie Garrett said the federal government had \u201cintentionally rendered itself incapable\u201d of responding to the outbreak. \u201cIn numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the US government, the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIf the United States still has a clear chain of command for pandemic response, the White House urgently needs to clarify what it is \u2013 not just for the public but for the government itself, which largely finds itself in the dark.\u201d How much money is available? The US is entering this phase of the coronavirus outbreak after repeated attempts by the federal government to drastically cut CDC funding. Congress has mostly blocked this from happening, though the Trump administration successfully cut its global epidemic work from 49 countries to 10. Among the countries where CDC efforts were scaled back were Haiti, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as China, where the agency provided technical assistance. Now, the White House has requested $1.25bn in new emergency funding and to divert another $1.25bn from existing federal programs. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, a critic of the administration\u2019s response to coronavirus, on Wednesday requested $8.5bn. Does the US have enough equipment? Azar told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the federal government had a stockpile of 30m masks but could need 300m for health workers. Stores are also reporting shortages of the N95 respirator mask, which doctors recommend for people who are sick instead of surgical-type masks. Doctors have cautioned even the N95 has limited efficacy because it needs to be fit-tested, which many people aren\u2019t qualified to handle on their own. Can the president instill confidence? Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary under George W Bush, said he didn\u2019t understand why the CDC\u2019s Tuesday announcement was made without coordination with the White House. \u201cThere should have been an Oval Office meeting, a statement by Potus about protecting people, and then a press avail by experts,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cBizarre.\u201d Amid increasingly serious messages about the outbreak, Trump has repeatedly cast an optimistic light on US preparedness. On Tuesday, he said the US was \u201cvery close\u201d to a vaccine, before the White House backtracked on the remarks and said he was referring to an Ebola vaccine approved two months ago. And while the administration appears focused on downplaying coronavirus because of its impact on the economy, the S&amp;P 500 closed down 3% on Tuesday, after its worst one-day slide in two years on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "Ministers are racing to prepare the UK for a potential sudden increase in the spread of the coronavirus, with officials fearing it could take just 72 hours for an outbreak the size of Italy\u2019s to take hold. Amid growing concerns around the world about the pace of the virus\u2019s spread, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government would launch a mass public information campaign giving advice on how to react to suspected cases and guard against infection. Updating MPs in the House of Commons, he cautioned against overreaction, but acknowledged that the government is expecting more cases in the UK. The rapid expansion of coronavirus cases in Italy \u2013 a key destination for British holidaymakers \u2013 has caused concern in recent days and officials are stepping up precautions in case a similar scenario happens in Britain. The decision to step up preparations in the UK came as the World Health Organization said that the number of new cases being officially reported outside China had overtaken the number within the country for the first time. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the steep rise in new cases around the world as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. There have been 13 cases of the virus so far in the UK, with no deaths. But Italy saw its confirmed cases rocket from just three on Friday to more than 200 by Monday and its total is now 400, with 12 deaths. On a day of global efforts to limit the spread of Covid-19: \u2022 The total number of infections in Italy represented a rise of 45% in 24 hours. Italian prosecutors opened an investigation into hospital procedures amid claims that an investigation into a so-called \u201csuper-spreader\u201d was initially delayed. \u2022 Austria, Croatia and Switzerland reported their first cases linked to the outbreak in Italy. Greece reported its first ever case, which was also linked to the country. France recorded its second death. South America and Norway reported their first cases. \u2022 Event organisers considered their plans as Italy\u2019s rugby match against Ireland in Dublin was called off and questions were raised over the Venice Biennale. \u2022 Around 160 Britons were trapped in a hotel in Tenerife which could stay in lockdown until 10 March. \u2022 52 further deaths were reported in China, the lowest number in three weeks. \u2022 The WHO warned against using the term \u201cpandemic\u201d, which it said falsely indicated that the spread could no longer be contained. It is understood that the government\u2019s public information campaign, due to be launched in the coming days, will broadcast advice about calling 111 if coronavirus is suspected. A Whitehall source said: \u201cIt\u2019s as much about winning the battle for public confidence as it is about winning the battle against the disease. There will be social media, stuff on TV, poster campaigns. It will be making sure we can reach as many people as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s making sure that people have got the right advice. At the moment it is very much about telling people to ring 111 \u2026 It will be about what people can do to help prevent the spread like handwashing and using tissues.\u201d The government has been publishing more advice to employers, schools, the travel industry and health workers, but there have been complaints about mixed messages from ministers. They have said there was no need to shut schools unless a new case is confirmed at the premises, but some 40 schools have either closed their doors or sent pupils home, and the oil giant Chevron ordered 300 traders and other staff at its office in Canary Wharf to work from home. The FTSE 100 has also plummeted on fears of the global economic impact. As well as increasing concern on UK soil, the government was faced with criticism of alleged inaction and pleas for help from Britons who remain in lockdown at a Tenerife hotel. Speaking in the Commons, Hancock said that while the government was prepared for a pandemic, it was currently in the \u201ccontain\u201d phase and its hope was that all its efforts to contain the virus would prevent that coming to pass. \u201cThe public can be assured that we have a clear plan to contain, delay, research and mitigate, and that we are working methodically through each step to keep the public safe,\u201d he said. \u201cOverreaction has its costs too, economic and social, and so we have to keep the public safe, but we also need to act in a way that\u2019s proportionate.\u201d Amid concerns about the rights of workers told to self-isolate, the health secretary said the guidance to employers included instructions that such employees were entitled to sick leave. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important message for employers and for those who can go home and self-isolate as if they were sick because it\u2019s for medical reasons,\u201d he said. He said that that 7,132 people in the UK had been tested for coronavirus. Of these, 13 had tested positive, eight of whom have since been discharged from hospital.

On Tuesday, 427 new cases were reported across 37 countries globally, compared with 411 inside China, despite nearly 97% of more than 80,000 infections occurring inside China. Earlier, the WHO had cautioned that the world was \u201csimply not ready\u201d should a pandemic break out, while major sporting events <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/26/ireland-v-italy-six-nations-match-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\">including the Six Nations rugby</a> and F1 racing have either been postponed or cancelled.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 27 February. Top stories More cases of the coronavirus are being reported outside China than inside for the first time since the outbreak began, the World Health Organisation says. On Tuesday, 427 new cases were reported across 37 countries globally, compared with 411 inside China, despite nearly 97% of more than 80,000 infections occurring inside China. Earlier, the WHO had cautioned that the world was \u201csimply not ready\u201d should a pandemic break out, while major sporting events including the Six Nations rugby and F1 racing have either been postponed or cancelled. There have been 2,715 deaths so far, but health officials have cautioned against panic, reminding that mortality rates remain around 1-2% and predominantly affect people with already weakened immunity. Australia\u2019s seven hottest days on record were in the second half of December last year. Australia is heating faster than the global average, and extreme heat days are on the rise. Scientists warn the greatest threat is an escalation in heatwaves. \u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence that [extreme heat] is killing people prematurely,\u201d says Dr Diana Egerton-Warburton in today\u2019s episode of The Frontline, a major multimedia series from Guardian Australia about the lived reality of climate change. The prime minister\u2019s office broke the law by inexplicably delaying a freedom of information request, the information watchdog has ruled, despite a $110,000 internal investigation clearing it of wrongdoing. At least three federal agencies have been found to have breached FOI law since November, despite the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner sending an all-staff missive reminding departments of their legal obligations. Experts say delays can be used as a deliberate tactic to render information useless or less explosive by the time it is released. Australia Australia must significantly accelerate its take-up of low emissions options if it is to achieve a transition to net zero emissions by 2050, new analysis by ClimateWorks Australia suggests. That means the electricity market will need to be sourced 100% from renewables by 2035, while at least half of all new cars in 10 years time will need to be electric vehicles. Meanwhile, mining giant Rio Tinto says it wants its globe-spanning operations to reach net zero by 2050 and will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon footprint. Scott Morrison and Bridget McKenzie\u2019s offices exchanged 136 emails about sports grants program, the Australian National Audit Office has revealed. Morrison has maintained that his involvement in the $100m community sport infrastructure program was limited to his office passing on representations from MPs to McKenzie\u2019s office. Julian Assange\u2019s extradition case is to hear an application on Thursday for him to leave a dock surrounded by bulletproof glass and sit with his lawyers after he complained of being as much a participant in the proceedings as \u201cwatching Wimbledon\u201d. Josh Frydenberg has warned that the far right is on the rise in Australia, echoing a speech earlier in the week where Australia\u2019s top intelligence chief warned the threat of rightwing extremism in Australia was real and growing. The world At least 24 people have been killed in the worst religious violence in Delhi in decades, with calls for army to be deployed as clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups show little sign of abating. More than 200 people were admitted to hospital, following a fourth consecutive day of clashes and mob looting. A Brazilian lawmaker has warned against a return to dictatorship, following president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s apparent endorsement of nationwide protests designed to intimidate the nation\u2019s democratic institutions. Six schools and two nurseries in Syria have been bombed by the Assad regime and its ally, Russia, killing 21, amid concerns the violence has already led to the worst humanitarian crisis in the Syrian war to date. Clive Cussler, the bestselling American author of more than 80 adventure novels, has died, aged 88. A 17-times New York Times bestseller lister, Cussler sold more than 100m books, with 25 novels starring his government agent protagonist, Dirk Pitt. Recommended reads They were penned over 3,000 years ago, but songs about powerlessness and suffering are finding a modern audience. 150 Psalms, a collection of biblical era works, is being performed at this year\u2019s Adelaide festival, but for the project\u2019s director Tido Visser the thematic resonance is \u201cas if they were written yesterday\u201d. As the coronavirus prompts doom-mongering across the global economy, what hope does Australia\u2019s domestic economy have to offer? Well, according to Greg Jericho, with the mining and construction industries slowing down, very little: \u201cthe domestic economy, which the government is relying on to see us through the international crisis, was already struggling well before the rest of the world turned ugly.\u201d Open a cookbook these days and you don\u2019t expect to find recipes for turtle soup. But for executive chef Liz Mason recipes from 1886 and 1910 are as challenging to modern sensibilities as the suffrage movement was to its contemporaries. And while her sous-chef might struggle with some of the old-fashioned techniques, next month Mason is putting \u201cRebel Soup\u201d and \u201cElection Cake\u201d back on the menu, writes Alyx Gorman. Listen Delhi is being rocked by India\u2019s worst violence in decades, with the death toll rising rapidly as mosques are set alight. On this episode of Today in Focus, Guardian\u2019s Samanth Subramanian looks at the rise of Hindu nationalism and the controversial citizenship laws that have fuelled months of escalating unrest. Sport Five-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova has announced her retirement from tennis. A top-five ranked player as recently as 2016, the 32-year-old has battled chronic shoulder injuries, and bid an emotional farewell to the sport that brought her \u201cuntold tears and unspeakable joys\u201d. Kevin Mitchell farewells a player more respected than loved. It was one of the great contests of the 80s and 90s and, ahead of Friday\u2019s bushfire relief game, a wave of AFL State of Origin nostalgia has well and truly been uncorked, Jonathan Horn writes. Media roundup The Financial Review reports that $129 billion has been wiped off Australia stock markets over the past three days due to fears over the coronavirus, with companies involved in tourism the worst affected. Maurice Blackburn are preparing a class action against the NAB, writes the Age, with new state legislation set to pass in Victoria allowing the law firm to recoup a potentially multimillion-dollar \u201ccontingency fee\u201d in the process. And, the Rugby Championship and Super Rugby could be morphed into a global competition, with private equity investors reportedly looking to invest heavily, according to the Australian. Coming up New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, arrives in Sydney ahead of a Friday meeting with Scott Morrison. Ian Thorpe will visit federal parliament to discuss concerns about the religious discrimination bill. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 \u201cDark, uncompromising and deeply divisive\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the verdict on Marmite, the one-time brewer\u2019s offcast that\u2019s now enjoying a revival in haute cuisine. \u201cLike soy sauce and Lea &amp; Perrins, it gives depth and umami \u2013 it\u2019s a great tool for layering flavours,\u201d says leading London chef Sat Bains.",

Finnegan Lee Elder, 20, and fellow student Gabriel Christian Natale-Hjorth, 19, are charged with murdering Mario Cerciello Rega in central Rome on 26 July in an incident that shocked Italians. Elder is accused of stabbing the officer after he intervened in a dispute that began over a drug deal involving the pair, police said at the time. The defendants, from San Francisco, have been held in Regina Coeli prison in Rome since their arrests. Elder was wearing a blue-plaid shirt under a jacket and mouthed \u201cI love you\u201d to his parents, who were sitting in the back row of the courtroom, which was packed with journalists.

Neither spoke on Wednesday\u2019s opening day of the trial, which will continue next month. The proceedings on Wednesday were limited to the admission of evidence and setting a timetable for future hearings. The killing led to an outpouring of public sympathy for Cerciello Rega, who had just returned from his honeymoon when he was killed. Huge crowds attended his funeral \u2013 which was broadcast live on television \u2013 where he was hailed as a hero.

Police say Cerciello Rega, unarmed and in plain clothes, was stabbed 11 times by Elder with an 18cm (7in) blade as he was trying to arrest him and Natale-Hjorth on suspicion of stealing a backpack. Elder has said he did not know that Cerciello Rega was a police officer.

He even got in a direct reference to Dominic Cummings. No one could have taken the job of chancellor with the constraints that Classic Dom and Boris had placed on him.

This was dissent, Jim, though not as we know it.</p> <p>On reflection, even, perhaps he had been making too much fuss about all this Treasury autonomy stuff.

Metro has spent the past 12 months challenging the wealth of its shareholders, consuming the energies of financial regulators, and taking ages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/metro-bank-chairman-resigns-immediately-after-torrid-year\">to defenestrate its controversial founder, Vernon Hill</a>.</p> <p>Those difficulties stem from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/23/metro-bank-shares-crash-after-loans-blunder-revealed\">a \u00a3900m loan misstatement</a> that, crucially, was revealed before the BCR handed out its prizes. The size of the award seemed to defy common sense even at the time. Metro\u2019s share price was plunging (even if it had a lot further to fall) and the smell of crisis was unmistakable.</p> <p>Now, it turns out, Metro\u2019s new chief executive, Dan Frumkin, thinks the bank can\u2019t live up to all his predecessors\u2019 promises to the BCR \u2013 hardly surprising after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/26/metro-bank-scales-back-expansion-plans-after-131m-loss\">a thumping \u00a3131m loss for 2019</a> and the need to retrench.

Its top pick for a handout a year ago was Metro Bank, which was given the mighty sum of \u00a3120m to provide stiffer competition to bigger banking beasts and improve the lot of small business customers. To say things haven\u2019t worked out as intended would be an understatement. Metro has spent the past 12 months challenging the wealth of its shareholders, consuming the energies of financial regulators, and taking ages to defenestrate its controversial founder, Vernon Hill. Those difficulties stem from a \u00a3900m loan misstatement that, crucially, was revealed before the BCR handed out its prizes. The size of the award seemed to defy common sense even at the time. Metro\u2019s share price was plunging (even if it had a lot further to fall) and the smell of crisis was unmistakable. Now, it turns out, Metro\u2019s new chief executive, Dan Frumkin, thinks the bank can\u2019t live up to all his predecessors\u2019 promises to the BCR \u2013 hardly surprising after a thumping \u00a3131m loss for 2019 and the need to retrench.

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of giving \u201cinconsistent\u201d and conflicting advice as growing numbers of schools closed over coronavirus fears and thousands of pupils were sent home. With at least 13 schools being closed across the country and another 25 sending children home into quarantine by Wednesday evening, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, sought to reassure headteachers that there was no need to close schools unless there was a confirmed case of coronavirus. Despite Hancock\u2019s advice at the Commons dispatch box and advice sent to schools reiterating that only confirmed cases required a closure, the final decision on whether to close rests with individual headteachers. Amid confusion on the best course of action, Public Health England (PHE) advised schools not to close and instead ask pupils and staff exhibiting symptoms to \u201cself-isolate\u201d. However, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, admitted closures were a possibility in order to contain the virus. This led to some headteachers deciding to take evasive action and shut down their schools for the rest of the week, deep-cleaning buildings to minimise any risk, with others telling pupils they must come in unless they had clear symptoms of the virus. Attempts to maintain hygiene in schools have been prioritised as a way to slow the spread of the virus, with official advice telling teachers to wash their hands at least nine times through the day at key points including before eating any food and after breaks. The 13 schools closed across the country ranged in location from Middlesbrough in North Yorkshire to Old Windsor in Berkshire. The 25 schools where pupils and staff had been sent home to quarantine themselves were also located across the country, from Cornwall to Northern Ireland. They included Thomas\u2019s Battersea, the primary school attended by Prince George and Princess Charlotte, where four pupils were reportedly sent home as a precautionary measure following a trip to northern Italy. But Hancock told MPs: \u201cThe message that we do not have a policy of blanket school closures is important. Unless there is specific professional advice, or until there is a positive test, schools should stay open. Overreaction has its costs too, economic and social, and so we have to keep the public safe but we also need to act in a way that\u2019s proportionate.\u201d Headteachers described late-night calls from NHS clinical services advising them to tell those who went on school trips to Italy to self-isolate, regardless of whether they were showing symptoms of being unwell. Richard Pollock, the headteacher at Cransley school in Northwich, said 29 pupils and five members of staff went on a trip to Bormio in Lombardy over half-term, and a small number of pupils and staff began showing mild flu-like symptoms on Tuesday. Pollock said that regardless of government advice stating the school should remain open to all other pupils, he decided, in discussion with senior managers and governors, to shut it down for the remainder of the week. \u201cI understand that there will be a variety of reactions to this decision amongst parents, and I hope that all families will understand the developing situation and the changing and inconsistent advice given to the school,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThere are a number of pupils and staff who have vulnerable family members and it is the school\u2019s duty of care to put in place the most secure of measures to minimise any possible infection, despite public policy. \u201cThe staff, pupils and families of Cransley are our highest concern, and whilst we understand the impact this may have on the education of the pupils and disruption to working practice of parents, we believe this decision is justified.\u201d Some parents said they had been left in the dark and felt the government\u2019s response had been \u201ctoo complacent\u201d. Kate\u2019s two daughters were sent home from their school in Middlesbrough after two students returned from a school skiing trip in northern Italy \u2013 the European region worst affected so far by the outbreak \u2013 with symptoms of coronavirus. As the school bus returned to the UK, parents were texted to say that Trinity Catholic college would be closing and undergoing a deep clean. It was due to reopen next Monday, but this has now been pushed back to Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of information across the country as a whole. It\u2019s made me paranoid. This feels like just a drop in the ocean of what we are going to see. How are the government planning to deal with it? They have been too complacent so far; this is a super-virus \u2013 how many more people have to die before they take it seriously? \u201d Kate said. Another parent, Andy Byles, raised concerns about pupils being allowed back into school on Monday despite having visited an affected area in Italy. Byles said: \u201cThirty or so kids went to school on Monday morning when they should not have done. They should not have been at school in my opinion. I don\u2019t think teachers had the correct information at that time of what they should have done.\u201d PHE maintained its advice that schools should not close unless students or staff had been to one of the specific towns identified by the Italian government. PHE\u2019s medical director, Paul Cosford, said: \u201cSchools have to take difficult decisions given the complexity of issues that they are facing.

      "bodyText": "An excellent night for Rangers, then \u2013 and those comments from Kent about feeling more relaxed seem particularly interesting. Can that casting-off of the shackles take them all the way? Thanks for all your company tonight; I\u2019ll leave you with the Champions League action that\u2019s coming right up, and we\u2019ll have a match report from this one up very soon: Ryan Jack: \u201cEveryone\u2019s been having a dig at us and rightly so, the mentality of the group has been questioned but hopefully that\u2019s something to build on this season. To a man we bought into the gameplan and it got us a result.\u201d Ryan Kent: \u201cThe boys know recently it\u2019s not been good enough. We demand more of ourselves, we went out there and showed what we are capable of doing. I missed an easy opportunity in the first half, the goal is a bonus, the fact we\u2019ve got through is special for the football club. We\u2019re the underdogs in this competition, there\u2019s less tension and expectation in our play so we play freely. Tonight we got what we deserved.\u201d There was the fear that Rangers would be punished for those first-half misses, especially Hagi\u2019s from the spot. But they defended brilliantly against a team that, given its recent form and its first-leg performance, suffered from a curious lack of ideas. Rangers always held a threat on the break and, when Kent finished coolly, the job was done. Rangers have that elusive away win in Europe and their place in the last 16! A famous night, a bit of a breakthrough in their modern history, and a richly deserved one at that! Kent scored the winner and, despite only seeing a third of the possession, Rangers really could have scored more. 90+2 min: Ojo almost adds a cherry on top by hitting an early strike that the impressive Matheus, his side\u2019s best performer, turns round the post. 90+1 min: We\u2019ll have four added minutes, as Goldson again defends consummately from a Braga corner. 89 min: Esgaio agriculturally dumps Ojo over after a lengthy spell of Braga pressure is repelled. He\u2019s booked. The job is just about done ... 88 min: Braga earn yet another flag kick. Reckon they have to score here! The ball reaches Galeno at the back stick but he slips and miscues as he tries to volley past McGregor, rather summing up Braga\u2019s night. 86 min: Now it\u2019s a bit of a barrage of Braga crosses, but Goldson and Edmundson have been towers of strength in there. 84 min: Another Braga corner, via fine tracking back from Kent, but they can\u2019t muster the goal that they need very urgently now. 82 min: Rangers are getting nearer and nearer to seeing this out in some comfort. The away fans are, as you\u2019d expect, in excellent voice. 80 min: Barisic trips Trincao as he looks to scuttle towards the box on the right \u2013 or more accurately, Trincao buys himself a free-kick with a fairly egregious dive. Rough justice if Braga score here ... and they don\u2019t, because Paulinho miscues a header when well placed and the ball zooms over. 78 min: Goal disallowed! Goldson heads a right-sided corner against the post, which would have been fine \u2013 in fact it might well be another superb save from Matheus \u2013 but Arfield is a couple of yards offside as he snaffles the rebound. Now Ojo comes on for Kamberi. 76 min: \u201cDoesn\u2019t Braga\u2019s ground feature a huge slab of natural granite at one end? You might say the home team find themselves between a rock and the hard place of elimination from the Europa League,\u201d suggests Peter Oh. 75 min: Rangers have a throw-in near the Braga byline and it is fair to say they aren\u2019t in a rush now. 72 min: Braga are certainly committing men forward now. Arfield concedes a sloppy corner and Rangers don\u2019t want to make life difficult here. They are given a huge let-off, as it happens, because they only half-clear and Esgao\u2019s cross is headed against the outside of the post by Novais when he really should score. Gerrard goes for extra legs now, by bringing on Aribo for the class act Hagi. 69 min: Goldson deals with a good Trincao ball from the right, as fears I\u2019ve applied the kiss of death heighten. 67 min: It is, as things stand, really hard to see Braga overturning this. They have been poor and really threatened very little. 65 min: The quiet Trincao bobbles a long-range shot wide when he had better options. One more change for Braga, the defender Carmo on and Barcelona loanee Abel Ruiz off. It\u2019s a patchwork defence for them now as they go for broke. Rangers earn a corner in the meantime, but it comes to nought. 63 min: That\u2019s 4-2 on aggregate, of course, so Braga must score twice. The goal came just when Braga were starting to crank up some real pressure, so the timing could not have been more perfect. And it atones for Kent\u2019s earlier sitter! Is that the one that wins it? Hagi whips a quite marvellous ball behind the defence on halfway and Kent, running through the inside-left channel, shrugs off a defender before slotting superbly into the far corner. They deserve it! 59 min: A Braga free-kick is headed behind by Tavernier. They have a corner, and once again Rangers\u2019 back line is dogged. Edmundson is playing very well. 57 min: Braga make Rangers defend a few crosses and headers, and defend them they do. 55 min: Kamberi gets to the right byline and his cutback is jabbed over by Kent. Difficult one to put away as the height was awkward. Kent\u2019s movement in off the left has been very smart though. 53 min: A second Braga swap, because they clearly aren\u2019t happy. Silva off, the more attacking Galeno on. 52 min: Rangers will be pleased. Braga have not come out raging and don\u2019t really seem to have the quality to pose many grave problems. It\u2019s a much different game to last week\u2019s. 49 min: At the other end, Arfield has a shot blocked. Good ebb and flow to these early moments. 48 min: Edmundson reads the danger after a low ball from the useful Sequeira, who had rather a lot of space on the left. 46 min: Carmo is booked for dumping the raiding Arfield on his backside. Away we go again! A Braga change: Joao Novais replaces the midfielder Paulinha. Ian Copestake has words of solace, sort of, for Ianis Hagi: \u201cIn his quite good career Gheorge Hagi managed to miss three penalties. He scored 28 though (one of those passed the mighty paws of Nigel Martyn).\u201d Half-time reading! I\u2019d have said \u201cso far, so good\u201d for Rangers, given Braga have only troubled them with a couple of headers for all their ball possession and set-pieces. But Rangers missed two great early opportunities and then, on half-time, could have plonked one foot in the last 16 with that penalty. They didn\u2019t, though \u2013 and will Braga now come back out as a different beast? What a stop that is! Hagi goes for Matheus\u2019s right and the keeper guesses, saving superbly with his left arm. The biggest chance of all, squandered! The corner isn\u2019t the best, and perhaps that confuses the defender Silva. The ball bounces up, strikes him on the outstretched hand, and VAR confirms it. What a chance this is! Hagi to take ... 44 min: Now Kent is in again but, with three teammates open and gagging for a delivery, he can\u2019t beat the first defender. It\u2019s a corner, though, and ... 42 min: A sniff now for Rangers, with Kent fizzing in a delicious low cross from the left. Kamberi seems to be on his heels a little and doesn\u2019t anticipate it for what could have been a tap-in. 41 min: Fransergio\u2019s pass sails beyond Esgaio. Braga need a bit of a rocket at half-time, it\u2019s not really happened for them. Barisic makes good ground down the Rangers left, meanwhile, sending in a cross that Viana thwacks away. 39 min: Rangers\u2019 attacking threat has diminished a touch since that first 20 minutes. The openings are there if they can find some more good possession. 36 min: Now Barisic does well to slide in and prevent another Braga move down his side. Goalless at half-time would do Rangers against opponents who are clearly handy but haven\u2019t exactly brimmed with constant danger. 34 min: Ricardo Horta gets behind Barisic on the right, the flag staying down, and should produce something better than a limp cross-shot straight at McGregor. 33 min: Bit of a scrappy phase now, with midfield turnovers aplenty. Still going to plan for Rangers, who have probably been the better side overall and have definitely had the best chances. 30 min: Oooh, Braga are getting closer. Another nice delivery comes in from the left, one attacker misses it and Fransergio \u2013 who maybe didn\u2019t know too much about his header \u2013 is off target by a whisker. 28 min: Davis fouls Fransergio and Braga try to work the free-kick towards goal, but Jack covers well near his own box. 26 min: There\u2019s a decent effort though! Sequeira crosses nicely from the left and McGregor has to tip Paulinho\u2019s header over. The resulting corner is dealt with. 24 min: Hagi seems to have got behind Braga again but can\u2019t quite beat the recovering defender. For all their possession and corners, Braga are yet to create very much. 22 min: Hagi curls it too high. None of the first-leg heroics from him just yet ... though that should have been a wonderful assist for Kent just now. 20 min: And now Kent should score! Hagi breaks free on the right with an audacious little dink over a sliding defender, pulls it back to Kent 10 yards out, but the winger drags wide! They won\u2019t regret these early misses, will they? On the plus side they look very lively indeed \u2013 and have just won a free-kick right in Hagi or Barisic range ... 19 min: But Braga\u2019s fourth corner does bring an effort on goal, Paulinho getting there first at the near post and heading wide. 18 min: Great pressing from Jack forces an error at the back from Braga but Kent can\u2019t find Davis with his scooped pass. Rangers can, after an uncertain first few minutes, consider themselves happy so far. 16 min: Kent, who has started really well, plays in Kamberi but the forward\u2019s touch just eludes him. He should have been sharper. 15 min: A third Braga corner comes to nothing but Rangers won\u2019t want to be conceding so many of those. 14 min: Rangers break away but Kamberi\u2019s cross-shot is blocked. Braga\u2019s high line and press mean there is a flood of numbers at one end and considerable space at the other. 12 min: Esgaio\u2019s raking cross flies *just* over the head of a home forward and is thudded away by Goldson. It\u2019s an engaging game so far. 10 min: Another Braga corner is subsequently cleared. Rangers might be disappointed still to be level but that chance will cheer them. They got behind the hosts very well there. 9 min: Big chance for Kamberi! Arfield beats the offside trap and hasn\u2019t got the pace to go all the way clear, but squares for Kamberi to take a free shot inside the box! He wraps his body round the ball, but the second-choice striker allows Matheus to parry. What an opportunity that way. 7 min: It\u2019s not exactly the Alamo but Rangers haven\u2019t really got a grip on things here yet. 5 min: Esgaio crosses from the right, Edmundson slips and Braga have the game\u2019s first corner. Viana wins the header from Sequeira\u2019s flag kick but McGregor is fouled as he rises to claim. 3 min: Kent tries to trick in from the left but gives away a foul. Rangers need to make sure they are calm and precise in possession here. Braga have started with purpose. 1 min: Rangers almost let Braga in within 13 seconds but manage to get the ball away. Think it was Davis being loose in possession. Can\u2019t carry on like that! Can Rangers see it through? The teams are now out in this wonderful quarry of a stadium \u2013 which, of course, has a cliff behind the goal! Nearly time to begin ... Wednesday night Europa is a bit discombobulating, isn\u2019t it? To be clear: the rest of the ties are tomorrow. Peter Van loves the Europa League. And don\u2019t we all! \u201cUnlike the CL, where the same teams play each other again and again, just look at how bonkers the round of 32 fixture list is: European titans (Porto, Ajax, Inter), mixed with clubs from Cyprus (APOEL), Sweden (Malmo) or Austria (had to look this one up - LASK). \u201cIt\u2019s also the only conceivable route to continent-wide glory for clubs like Rangers or Celtic (and, I suppose, Braga), considering the massive financial disparity brought on by the Champions League. And the football can be quite good too!\u201d So Morelos is replaced by Florian Kamberi, the winter signing who scored his first Rangers goal against St Johnstone on Sunday. Will he fire them into the last 16? Braga: Magalhaes, Viana, Carmo, Silva, Esgaio, Trincao, Fransergio, Palhinha, Sequeira, R Horta, Paulinho. Subs: Tormena, Ruiz, Sa, A Horta, Novais, Fonte, Galeno. Rangers: McGregor, Tavernier, Goldson, Edmundson, Barisic, Arfield, Davis, Jack, Hagi, Kamberi, Kent. Subs: Ojo, Foderingham, Halliday, Aribo, Kamara, Katic, Stewart. Referee: Andreas Ekberg (Sweden). This could be a historic night for modern-era Rangers. I mean, baby steps and all that, but if they can preserve or \u2013 perish the thought \u2013 see out their 3-2 advantage from the first leg they\u2019ll bring up their best European run since 2010-11. Are they on their way back to continental eminence? Perhaps not quite, but it\u2019d suggest they have a pulse. That first leg at Ibrox was a belter. After an hour the tie seemed over. By full-time Rangers had scored three times to put themselves in the driving seat, sparking pandemonium and recalling some famous nights and the old venue. At the driving seat was Ianis Hagi \u2013 yes, his dad *is* who you think he is \u2013 with two goals, even if one was heavily deflected. The playmaker is a delightful operator to watch and, with him pulling the strings, Stevie G\u2019s boys have a chance of completing the job in Portugal. They\u2019ll need to do it without their star striker Alfredo Morelos, though, as he\u2019s suspended. They\u2019ll also want to ignore the fact that their away record in Europe is distinctly non-clever: they have not won any of their last 15 games on the road, qualifiers excluded, although their last such triumph did come in Portugal \u2013 against Sporting in 2007-08. Fortunately they only need to draw tonight! Can they do it? Don\u2019t go away \u2013 we are about to find out! Kick-off: 5pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden\u2019s flailing presidential bid received a significant boost on Wednesday following the endorsement of a powerful South Carolina Democrat, hours after the former vice-president declared during a turbulent debate among the still-divided Democratic field that he would win the state. South Carolina, which votes on Saturday, is the fourth early voting state and marks the first time in the election cycle that African American voters will form a majority of the electorate. Biden, Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president, still holds a narrow lead in a state regarded as pivotal to his fortunes, against frontrunner Bernie Sanders, according to recent polls. His campaign has long targeted the state even after disappointing results in the earlier votes in Iowa and New Hampshire this month. As centrist Democrats scramble to veer the nomination away from Sanders, Biden is seeking a convincing victory in South Carolina to bring his campaign back on track ahead of the crucial Super Tuesday vote next week. A total of 16 states and territories will vote next Tuesday as Sanders looks set for a convincing victory in California and a tight race in Texas with Biden. The Democratic candidates met for a bruising debate on Tuesday evening for the last time ahead of voting. Sanders was targeted by most of his rivals over his record on gun control, his past comments on communist Cuba, and ambitious spending plans for universal healthcare provision. The debate descended into loud bickering and cross-talk at many points, a sign of the friction within the party over the best way to defeat Donald Trump in the November election. Trump himself weighed in with his own assessment of the debate on Wednesday morning, describing it as \u201ccrazy, chaotic\u201d and expressing confidence he would beat any of the major candidates. \u201cJust give me an opponent!\u201d Trump tweeted. Despite the president\u2019s confidence, national polling indicates he still falls behind all the top-tier Democratic candidates on a variety of slim margins. On Wednesday morning at an event in North Charleston, Biden received the endorsement of House Democrat Jim Clyburn, a major powerbroker in South Carolina Democratic politics and the most senior African American in the US House of Representatives. \u201cI can think of no one better suited, better prepared, I can think of no one with the integrity, no one more committed to the fundamental principles that make this country what it is than my good friend,\u201d Clyburn said as he appeared with Biden. Sharing the podium with Clyburn, Biden issued another less than subtle dig at Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist. \u201cToday, people are talking about a revolution,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut what the country\u2019s looking for are results. What they\u2019re looking for is security. What they\u2019re looking for is being able to sustain and maintain their dignity.\u201d At an event half a mile down the road, hosted by the national civil rights leader Al Sharpton, a number of the candidates sought to strike a more conciliatory tone after Tuesday\u2019s debate left the field appearing so disharmonious. As Sharpton introduced Sanders to the crowd of assembled members of his National Action Network civil rights group, he told them: \u201cWhatever you decide to do on Saturday, do not go by those who try to use the socialist tag [against Sanders] \u2026\u201d reminding the assembled members that civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King were branded the same way. \u201cIt\u2019s time for all of us to be treated fairly.\u201d Sharpton is another prominent voice in the African American community who has been courted by all the major candidates but has not yet endorsed anyone in the race. Sanders used his address to recall his active participation in the civil rights movement and remind attendees of his support for Obama. \u201cI was proud to support Barack Obama in both of his campaigns,\u201d the Vermont senator said. While reticence remains within the Democratic establishment about the prospect of a Sanders nomination, some senior Democrats have signalled, in public at least, they would be supportive should he win. \u201cI think whoever our nominee is, we will enthusiastically embrace and we will win the White House, the Senate and the House,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told reporters on Wednesday.",

Dr Doom\u201d, as he\u2019s known, reckons \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d, as the chances of a global recession rise.</p> \n  <p>Roubini argues that investors are guilty of several \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, and need to realise several things:</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Covid-19 is going to be a global pandemic, and last for longer than first thought.<br></strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The view that the economic impact will peak before the end of the first quarter now looks very shaky. The damage to China is severe, and global supply chains are being seriously disrupted, at a time when China accounts for about 20 per cent of global gross domestic product, not the tiny 4 per cent it had at the time of Sars in 2003.</p> \n   <p>Add to that an economic shock to big economies like Japan, South Korea and Italy. When the disease spreads to other developed and emerging markets, this damage will increase.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>2) China\u2019s economy will not rebound quickly, as some economists hoped:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The idea of a V-shaped recovery is nonsensical. Suppose that the best Goldilocks scenario does occur: the shock to China hits only the first quarter and the contagion is mostly contained to the country. If its output shrinks just 2 per cent in the first quarter, that is an annualised contraction of 8 per cent. A V-shaped rebound would therefore require the same annualised growth, which exceeds the 6 per cent that China managed before the virus. </p> \n   <p>Assuming that China will rebound at this rate in the final three quarters of the year \u2014 which would imply growth in 2020 of 4 per cent \u2014 is heroically optimistic. It is more likely that a V-shape shows growth returning to a pre-virus annualised level of 6 per cent from the second quarter onwards. In this case, China\u2019s calendar-year growth would be 2.5 per cent.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>3) Governments and central banks can\u2019t step in and protect their economies.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Fiscal policy will react very slowly, or not at all, given political and other constraints. Central banks are running out of bullets: how much more negative can the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and others go on interest rates?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1232607277636603904\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Markets remain complacent about coronavirus.

Just after the market closed, the software revealed that its supply chain \u201cis returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated\u201d, due to disruption in China. That means the personal computing division, including MS\u2019s Surface laptop arm, won\u2019t sell as many units as hoped. \u201cAs a result, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we do not expect to meet our More Personal Computing segment guidance as Windows OEM and Surface are more negatively impacted than previously anticipated.\u201d And that\u2019s all for tonight! GW Closing report: Wall Street couldn\u2019t hold onto its earlier gains, and has posted another loss. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 123 points, or 0.46%, at 26,957. That\u2019s a new four-month low. The broader S&amp;P 500 ended 0.38% down. The Nasdaq managed to keep its head, though, finishing a modest 0.17% up. With new cases reported in Norway, Pakistan and Georgia for the first time today, plus more cases in China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and beyond, the coronavirus is still weighing on markets. As Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist with Bruderman Asset Management, told MarketWatch. \u201cThe last couple of days have seen like an emotional reaction, as opposed to a fact-based reaction. The reality is that the data is coming in so quickly and changing so quickly,\u201d he said about the spread of the illness beyond Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to see that changing over then next three or four weeks.\u201d Reminder: our main, comprehensive, coronavirus liveblog is still running: A handy recap: Oh dear, the Wall Street rally has indeed stumbled. The Dow is now in the red, down 97 points or 0.36%, at 26,983. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the market looked to be offering value at these prices, traders are still edgy. I\u2019ll be back with the Wall Street close in a couple of hours.... Hmmmm. Wall Street may be struggling to hold onto its gains. The Dow nearly dropped into negative territory a few minutes ago, and is currently only up 0.5% today. Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz fears the market isn\u2019t strong enough for a sustained recovery: The sentiment in the markets has improved a little, says David Madden of CMC Markets, even if the Covid-19 crisis hasn\u2019t. He says: The health crisis is getting worse, but markets don\u2019t move in straight lines, so at some point there was going to be a switch in sentiment, and that\u2019s what we are seeing today.... The mood on Wall Street has turned optimistic and traders are buying back into equities in the wake of major losses earlier this week. The solid US new homes sales was a pleasant reminder there are positive aspects to the US economy, as the reading came in at 764,00, which smashed the 710,000 forecast. Despite this afternoon\u2019s late recovery, it\u2019s been a rough few days for the Footsie. Britain\u2019s blue-chip index is still 5% down this week - bad news for pension-holders and other savers. The healthcare, utility, basic materials anfd financial sectors all led the recovery in London today. But consumer-focused firms, such as housebuilders and retailers, fell. Just in! London\u2019s stock market has clawed its way back from this morning\u2019s one-year low. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK-listed shares has close 24 points higher at 7042, up 0.35%. Quite a recovery, given it was down 106 points at one stage this morning. That still leaves the index down around 5% this week, but it suggests the panic over Covid-19 may be easing. Other European markets also recovered from this morning\u2019s slump, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB gaining 1.5% (after two days of chunky falls), and France flat. Why the recovery, given the coronavirus crisis has hardly gone away? Well, there will be some bargain-hunting, with investors betting that the index has fallen too far, too fast, in recent days. Wall Street has also helped. The sight of the Dow Jones jumping by 400 points has calmed investors nerves in Europe. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: The Dow Jones rode in like something of a white knight on Wednesday afternoon, rescuing Europe from its intraday lows. The Dow added 350 points after the bell, a rebound likely born of nothing more than bargain-hunting investors sweeping in at near-4 month lows. That pushed the index above 27400 \u2013 for reference, around 1,100 points shy of its mid-February all-time highs. US equity markets are \u201cfacing this coronavirus like buffalo, with their heads into the storm and marching onwards\u201d, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. But with Wall Street up 1.5% today, this optimism may be displaced (and a reminder that even a dead cat will bounce if you drop it far enough). Here are six reasons why, in his words, the recovery looks \u201cdecidedly feline and rather deceased\u201d: Markets are still conditioned to buy on the dip - and what a dip we have had. a drop of 2000 Dow points in 2 days is plenty downside baked in already even if the economy takes a scrubbing in Q1. The market has already priced for a spread of cases in the US &amp; Europe. Donald Trump says if you\u2019re not buying you\u2019re chicken and an MSM putz. No material deterioration in the situation in the US with regards the virus (there is a lot of expected bad news already priced in). But we\u2019re only talking a few hours having passed. Several technicals were indicating oversold conditions. All moves have pullbacks, all trends have countertrends. These are by definition short-lived - or they become the trend. Despite the bounce the bulls are not yet in charge of this. Eek. More UK jobs cuts, this time at Virgin Money. That takes today\u2019s total of job losses over 2,000, following the 1,600 jobs being axed at Lloyds Banking Group and Direct Line Insurance. Today\u2019s recovery may be driven by hopes that Donald Trump calms the crisis, when he speaks this evening (6pm New York time). (spoos is the contract to buy or sell the S&amp;P 500) Tech stocks are sizzling on Wall Street, with Netflix up by 5%, NVIDIA up 4.6%, Oracle up 3.75% and Micron Technology at 3.7%. Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust, fears economic growth will be hit by measures to contain Covid-19, as it spreads beyond China. Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman is scathing about the US government\u2019s response to Covid-19: It\u2019s been a bad day for the UK labour market. Lloyds Banking Group, insurance group Direct Line and fashion chain Ted Baker have all announced job cut plans, a day after Tesco said 1,800 jobs were at risk at its supermarket bakeries. Wall Street is pushing higher.... The oil price is now recovering from today\u2019s one-year low, after US energy stocks rose by less than expected. The Energy Information Administration has reported that crude oil inventories rose by 452,000 barrels in the last week, below analyst forecasts of a 2 million-barrel rise. Stocks of gasoline and distillate fell, and by more than expected, which all suggests demand for oil was higher than thought. An encouraging signal for growth (if not for climate change). Some encouraging news -- US home sales have hit their highest level since the financial crisis, some 12 years ago. Sales of new American single-family homes jumped 7.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 764,000 units last month, the Commerce Department says. That\u2019s the highest level since July 2007, just before the credit crunch. It suggests US consumer confidence was pretty strong last month, which could help it survive the shock of the coronavirus. Virtually every sector of the New York stock market has risen in early trading, as Wall Street tries to end this week\u2019s slide. But Disney is dragging the consumer sector back. Its shares are down 1.25% after CEO Bob Iger surprisingly announced he was stepping down last night. Wall Street\u2019s recovery has dragged the London\u2019s stock market away from this morning\u2019s one-year low. The FTSE 100 just briefly turned positive, nudging back over the 7,000 point mark. Nearly every company on the Dow is up this morning -- which makes a change! Healthcare firms are leading the risers, with UnitedHealth up 2.2% and Walgreen Boots up 1.6%. Microsoft has gained 1.8%, as tech shares rebound, while credit card firm Visa (which has suffered from economic slowdown fears), is 1.7% higher. Here\u2019s the state of play regarding coronavirus infections: Newsflash: Wall Street has opened higher, as US traders try to hold their nerve after two days of wild declines. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 200 points, or 0.75%, at the start of trading. That lifts the index to 27,287, up from last night\u2019s four-month low. The broader-based S&amp;P 500 is up 0.8%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has jumped by 1%. An encouraging start. But don\u2019t forget the Dow lost 1,900 points over the last two days, so this is a very modest recovery. Some investors may be suspecting, like Royal London, that stock prices look rather attractive. But others may remember Nouriel Roubini\u2019s warning that there is worst to come, if Covid-19 becomes a full-scale global pandemic... Not every investors is hammering the sell button today. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management, says he\u2019s \u201cbuying the dip\u201d - betting that stocks will soon recover from this week\u2019s tumble. Greetham argues that the markets have over-reacted to the spread of Covid-19, and that a global recession will be avoided (especially if central banks cut interest rates to support growth, or Donald Trump cuts taxes): \u201cWe are buying the dip in our multi asset funds, moving to a high conviction overweight position in stocks. While it is impossible to know how much economic damage measures to contain the virus will cause over the next few months, markets have a strong tendency to overreact to bad news in the short term and our contrarian investor sentiment indicator is once again registering a buy signal.\u201d \u201cAs longer term investors we find it usually pays off to look on the bright side when others are panicking. Virus disruption is very unlikely to force the world economy into recession. We expect to see a large but temporary hit to economic activity followed by a bounce back later in the year that additional stimulus could make stronger than it otherwise would be. But Greetham also expects plenty of market volatility in the weeks ahead: \u201cWe are not complacent about the risks. We expect markets to remain choppy for weeks or perhaps months as investors weigh up good and bad news on the outbreak and its impact. We will look to trim equity exposure on rallies and buy on dips during this period. With inflation low, the longer term prospects for the world economy and stock markets remain positive, especially if additional stimulus is in the offing.\u201d. European stock markets appear to be recovering their earlier losses! The Italian FTSE MIB is now up 1.5% today, clawing back some of this week\u2019s losses, while the Stoxx 600 index is now flat. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down just 23 points at 6994, nudging back towards the 7,000 point mark. This recovery comes as the World Health Organisation reports there are now more new coronavirus cases outside China than inside. That suggests China may be getting to grips with Covid-19, just as it spreads faster in countries like Iran, South Korea and Italy. Greece\u2019s stock market has fallen sharply, since its first coronavirus case was reported today. The Athens stock index has slumped by over 3%, with Piraeus Bank and Aegean Airlines both down over 6%. Donald Trump will be pleased to hear that Wall Street is expected to open calmly in 90 minutes time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to rise 0.25%, or 75 points, when trading begins. The Washington Post reports that the president was furious that the Dow plunged by nearly 1,900 points, or 6.5%, during Monday and Tuesday. And apparently he blames health officials for warning US citizens to prepare for an inevitable coronavirus outbreak. The Post says Trump has cautioned aides against forecasting the impact of the virus over fears that stocks could fall further. Trump has used the US stock market rally as proof that he\u2019s doing a great job, so any crash would undermine his re-election campaign. But telling health officials to pipe down may be counterproductive, and dangerous. And as I type, the president has just tweeted that the media are to blame for tumbling markets. He\u2019s planning to hold a press conference on the \u201cCaronavirus\u201d (sic) on the issue later... Chinese microblogging site Weibo has warned that the coronavirus outbreak could wipe 20% off its revenues. It warned shareholders that its business has been \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d by the coronavirus outbreak, adding: Due to the high uncertainty of the evolving situation, we have limited visibility on the full quarter revenue impact brought upon by the epidemic. Based on our current best estimate, Weibo anticipates its first quarter of 2020 net revenues to decrease by 15% to 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This forecast reflects Weibo\u2019s current and preliminary view, which is subject to change. Weibo also reported that its net income fell sharply in the final three months of 2019, to $95.1m from $166.5m a year ago. It also reported a 3% drop in advertising and marketing revenue during the last quarter - even before the coronavirus crisis began.... After a rough morning, European stock markets are struggling back off the mat as lunchtime approaches. Most of the indices are still down, but they\u2019ve bounced off their lowest points. Italy\u2019s market has actually turned positive, after several days of heavy selling. There\u2019s still a lot of anxiety about a Covid-19 pandemic, but investors are reassured to see that Wall Street is expected to open a little higher today (after two whopping falls this week). FTSE 100: down 39 points or 0.57% at 6979 -- on track for a one-year low German DAX: down 131 points, or 1% at 12,685 French CAC: down 38 points or 0.4% at 5,641 Italian FTSE MIB: up 102 points or 0.5% at 23,195 This leave the Stoxx 600 down 0.85%, on track for its lowest close in four months. The UK stock market is on the brink of falling into a full-blown correction, due to coronavirus fears. A correction is defined as a 10% fall from a recent peak. And after this week\u2019s rout, the FTSE 100 is roughly 9% below the 7674 point level hit just five weeks ago, on 17 January. Just in: Credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has slashed its forecast for car sales in 2020, due to the economic damage caused by Covid-19. Moody\u2019s now expects global auto sale to fall by 2.5% this year -- rather worse than its previous forecast of a decline of 0.9%. That would mean 88 million new cars being sold, down from 90.2 million in 2019. Sales are expected to fall in Europe, the US and China -- a blow to the industry, which is already struggling to transition away from petrol and diesel cars towards electric. Moody\u2019s says: In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, auto sales in China likely to drop to 2.9% this year, significantly more than 1% previously expected Light vehicle sales in Western Europe likely to fall to 4% in 2020, after a surge in demand late 2019 with cars discounted to meet carbon emissions rules US sales will remain weak falling by 1.2% in 2020, then dip by another 0.6% in 2021 Japan will be the only major auto market to see unit sales growth in 2020 Senior vice-president Falk Frey says: \u201cGlobal vehicle sales will decline 2.5% in 2020, narrowing from a 4.6% drop in 2019, but worsening from the 0.9% decline that we had previously projected for this year. Sales will rebound only modestly in 2021, with growth of 1.5%,\u201d The Chinese government has attempted to calm fears over its economy. State TV are reporting that the Communist Party\u2019s Politburo has held a meeting, where they agreed that China\u2019s economic recovery is accelerating. However, they also warned that the coronavirus outbreak situation in the epicentres of Hubei province and Wuhan is still dire (Reuters reports). Greek government bonds are weakening, after Athens reports its first coronavirus case. Greece\u2019s heath ministry says a 38-year-old Greek woman who had travelled from an area of northern Italy has caught the virus. This has knocked Greek bonds, pushing up the yield (interest rate) on 10-year debt up to 1.17%, from 0.97% last night. That\u2019s still a very low bond yield, especially by Greek standards (yields soared over 20% during its debt crisis). But today\u2019s rise indicates investors are concerned that its economy could be hit by the crisis. Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel fears that central bankers lack the firepower to fight the coronavirus crisis (as Nouriel Roubini also warned). He writes: While global recessions are exceedingly difficult to forecast, the odds of one \u2013 particularly one characterised by less than 2.5% growth, a threshold set by the IMF \u2013 now seem to have risen dramatically. (Unlike advanced-economy growth, global growth rarely falls below zero because developing countries have higher average trend growth.) So far, US investors seem unconcerned about these risks. But they may be taking too much comfort from the US Federal Reserve\u2019s three interest-rate cuts last year. Should the US economy falter, there is nowhere near enough room for the Fed to cut interest rates by 500 basis points, as it has in past recessions.... The coronavirus scare reached London\u2019s financial district yesterday, when US oil company Chevron sent home about 300 workers from its Canary Wharf offices. Chevron asked traders and other staff to work from home as a precaution after an employee reported flu-like symptoms, having recently visited a country where coronavirus has been detected. The company says it acted to protect staff, while the individual is testeed. \u201cChevron continues to monitor the situation very closely, utilizing the guidance of international and local health authorities. \u201cOur primary concern is the health and safety of our employees and we are taking precautionary measures to reduce their risk of exposure.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak has forced a major trade show in Milan to be postoned. Salone del Mobile.Milano was due to start on 21 April, but instead it\u2019s been pushed back by two months. Organisers took the move after thousands of Chinese buyers were forced to cancel their trip, due to travel restrictions. More here. Salone del Mobile is said to be the world\u2019s biggest and most important furniture event, and organisers say they \u201cwon\u2019t stop\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t stop\u201d. Here\u2019s our news story on this morning\u2019s coronavirus warnings from Lufthansa, Diageo, and Danone.... Despite the heavy losses this week, global investors are too complacent about the coronavirus. So says economics professor Nouriel Roubini, in an article in the Financial Times. Dr Doom\u201d, as he\u2019s known, reckons \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d, as the chances of a global recession rise. Roubini argues that investors are guilty of several \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, and need to realise several things: 1) Covid-19 is going to be a global pandemic, and last for longer than first thought. The view that the economic impact will peak before the end of the first quarter now looks very shaky. The damage to China is severe, and global supply chains are being seriously disrupted, at a time when China accounts for about 20 per cent of global gross domestic product, not the tiny 4 per cent it had at the time of Sars in 2003. Add to that an economic shock to big economies like Japan, South Korea and Italy. When the disease spreads to other developed and emerging markets, this damage will increase. 2) China\u2019s economy will not rebound quickly, as some economists hoped: The idea of a V-shaped recovery is nonsensical. Suppose that the best Goldilocks scenario does occur: the shock to China hits only the first quarter and the contagion is mostly contained to the country. If its output shrinks just 2 per cent in the first quarter, that is an annualised contraction of 8 per cent. A V-shaped rebound would therefore require the same annualised growth, which exceeds the 6 per cent that China managed before the virus. Assuming that China will rebound at this rate in the final three quarters of the year \u2014 which would imply growth in 2020 of 4 per cent \u2014 is heroically optimistic. It is more likely that a V-shape shows growth returning to a pre-virus annualised level of 6 per cent from the second quarter onwards. In this case, China\u2019s calendar-year growth would be 2.5 per cent. 3) Governments and central banks can\u2019t step in and protect their economies. Fiscal policy will react very slowly, or not at all, given political and other constraints. Central banks are running out of bullets: how much more negative can the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and others go on interest rates? Mining giant Rio Tinto has warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt its operations. Although its iron ore order books are currently full, CEO Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques sees challenges ahead: \u201cWe are likely to see some short term impacts such as supply chains and possibly even provision of services from Chinese suppliers\u201d. Rio Tinto also outlined its plans to cut carbon emissions - more here: Helal Miah, Investment Research Analyst at The Share Centre, explains why travel companies are being pummelled: \u201cAs Coronavirus takes hold in Europe, the fear is authorities may have to resort to drastic measures like in China to contain it while travellers hold back bookings. In regards to this, the market slide has been led by the travel and leisure groups. EasyJet is down over 22% over the past week, most of the damage being done on Monday and yesterday after the weekend\u2019s news. TUI, IAG and Carnival are also off in a significant way and most sectors have been impacted to a certain degree. Bloomberg\u2019s Dani Burger has spotted that trading volumes on Wall Street were huge yesterday -- as the Dow plunged by almost 900 points. The price of oil has hit a one-year low, as fears intensify about the health of the global economy. US crude oil has fallen to just $49.88 per barrel, its weakest point since January 2019. It\u2019s down 1.3% today, and has slumped by 10% in the last week. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has fallen by 1.5% this morning to $54.11 per barrel (only a two-week low). The slide comes as San Francisco declares a state of emergency over coronavirus (although there are no cases there yet). There has also been a surge of cases in South Korea and Iran, while France has just reported its second death from the virus. George Efstathopoulos, multi asset portfolio manager at Fidelity International explains: Commodity prices took a hard hit amid concerns that the epidemic will curb global demand. Crude oil led declines with a weekly loss of about six per cent, while copper and rubber were both down as of Wednesday. A rush to safe-haven assets, on the other hand, pushed gold prices to a seven-year high this week, and the Japanese yen has rallied too. European stock markets are now sliding deeper and deeper into the red. Germany\u2019s DAX has tumbled by another 2.5%, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is now 1.5%, or 106 points, at 6910 (still a one-year low). It\u2019s turning into a really grim few days for the markets. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 index has lost over 9% since last Wednesday, falling steadily as Covid-19 infections and deaths have kept rising. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, says investors are now realising that Covid-19 will have a serious impact on corporate profits, as supply chains are hit and demand falls. European shares were also under significant pressure as several countries on the continent announce their first cases. Germany\u2019s DAX index drops 1.2%, overnight Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index was down 0.8%. The correction for equities reflects the reality that the impact of this outbreak is likely to be far-reaching and lead to pressure on company\u2019s revenue and earnings. Alcoholic drinks maker Diageo becoming the latest high-profile company to flag an impact this morning. Lufthansa has announced a hiring freeze and is offering employees unpaid leave as part of a range of cost savings measures to attempt to limit the financial impact of the spread of the coronavirus. The German airline, which has already cancelled all flights to China until the end of March, also said it will expand part-time work options and cancel flight attendant and other personnel training courses from April onwards. Those that are already on courses will not be hired. The company said it aimed to offer affected trainees \u201cemployment contracts in the longterm\u201d. Lufthansa says: \u201cIn order to counteract the economic impact of the coronavirus at an early stage, Lufthansa is implementing several measures to lower costs. It is not yet possible to estimate the expected impact of current developments on earnings.\u201d Shares in Diageo have slid by 2.5% this morning, after it warned Covid-19 could wipe out \u00a3200m of profits. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Diageo has highlighted an important issue -- sales lost during the coronavirus crisis can\u2019t always be clawed back: The problem is for the likes of Diageo is that once the consumption picks up again in affected regions in China and beyond, you don\u2019t then go and buy two bottles of Scotch instead of your normal one (most people anyway). The selloff in European markets is accelerating again. In London, the FTSE 100 has now shed another 102 points, or 1.5%, in its third day of big losses in a row. This pushes the blue-chip index down to a fresh one-year low of 6915. Other European markets are also slumping, with the Stoxx 600 index down 2% - to its lowest level since October 31. UK travel catering firm SSP Group has been hit hard by the coronavirus disruption. SSP runs restaurants and bars at airports and railway stations around the world -- so the transport restrictions imposed in Asia to combat Covid-19 are hurting sales badly. It expects to suffer a 50% plunge in sales across the Asia-Pacific region in February, which will cost it \u00a34-\u00a35m in operating profits. SSP tells shareholders that there\u2019s been a major drop in traffic levels: In terms of the impact at the airports in which we operate across the region, in China we have seen sharp declines in both domestic and international air passenger numbers, which are currently running c. 90% lower YOY( year-on-year). In Hong Kong passenger numbers are c. 70% lower YOY and across a number of our other Asia Pacific countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines, passenger numbers are between 25% and 30% lower YOY. Elsewhere, we have also seen some impact at our airports in Australia, as well as at major travel hubs in the Middle East and India, although to date this has been less severe. French food group Danone has also warned that the coronavirus crisis is hurting its business. The maker of Evian and Volvic bottled water, and Activia, expects to lose around \u20ac100m in sales, mostly at its \u201cWaters China\u201d business. That will wipe out Danone\u2019s revenue growth in the current quarter, leaving like-for-like sales \u201cbroadly flat\u201d. This has forced Danone to cut its sales growth targets - to 2-4%, down from 4-5%. CEO Emmanuel Faber says: We start this year under the uncertain clouds of the coronavirus. Our priority is on the health and safety of our employees, business partners, customers and the communities in which we operate, hand in hand with the work of authorities. I would like in particular to commend and deeply thank our teams in China for their incredible commitment to their mission serving relentlessly families, parents, babies and elderlies despite the difficult conditions. Let me express my support and empathy for the difficulties and challenges they face and my confidence that life will return to normal in China and beyond. \u575a\u5f3a, \u4e2d\u56fd Stay strong China. The FTSE 100 has now lost more than 5% of its value this week -- as it plunged to a one-year low this morning. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 share index has hit a new one-year low at the start of trading. Covid-19 worries have pushed the blue-chip index down by another 39 points, or 0.5%, to 6978. That\u2019s its lowest level since February 2019. Travel companies are leading the fallers, again, with holiday firm TUI and budget airline easyJet both losing 3%. This means the FTSE 100 has lost more than \u00a3100bn of value since the start of this week, as City investors have been spooked by the surge in coronavirus infections around the world. Newsflash: the coronavirus outbreak will hit its sales and profits at drinks giant Diageo this year. Diageo, the company behind Guinness, Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, Baileys and Talisker, has warned the City that Covid-19 will have an adverse impact on its operations this year. Diageo estimates that the ongoing crisis will knock \u00a3225m to \u00a3325m off its organic net sales this year. That will wipe between \u00a3140m to \u00a3200m off organic operating profits, it reckons. Diageo\u2019s statement outlines how business has been hit hard in Greater China in recent weeks: Bars and restaurants have largely been closed and there has been a substantial reduction in banqueting. As the majority of consumption is in the on-trade, we have seen significant disruption since the end of January which we expect to last at least into March. This disruption has now spread across the region, it adds: The outbreak in several other Asian countries, especially South Korea, Japan and Thailand, has led to events being postponed, a reduction in conferences and banquets, and a drop in tourism which have all impacted on-trade consumption. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The coronavirus selloff shows no signs of abating, as investors around the world are gripped with fears of a global pandemic -- and a major slowdown. European stock markets are heading for fresh falls today, which will drive Britain\u2019s stock market down to a one-year low. The FTSE 100 is currently being called down 60 points at 6957, a drop of almost 1%. It has already shed 5% of its value this week, after two days of heavy selling. The escalating virus crisis sparked another heavy day of losses on Wall Street last night, where the Dow fell by 879 points - on top of Monday\u2019s 1,000 plunge. Overnight, a World Health Organisation expert warned that countries outside China are \u201csimply not ready\u201d for a pandemic -- as new cases are reported in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Austria, and Croatia. WHO\u2019s Bruce Aylward warned: \u201cYou have to be ready to manage this at a larger scale \u2026 and it has to be done fast.\u201d That warning helped to trigger another day of heavy losses in Asia-Pacific markets. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index has shed another 2.3%, on fears that its economy will take a big hit from the slowdown in China. South Korea has shed another 1.5%, with China\u2019s CSI 300 down 1.2%. Our main coronavirus live blog has all the details: Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group reports that investors are rethinking how well, or badly, the global economy will perform this year. We\u2019ve now had two seismic daily declines on global stock markets. Short term traders may well choose to grit their teeth for a short-covering rally but we\u2019re getting the impression institutional investors are materially reassessing their outlook for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 have just notched up the worst 2-day decline since February 2018 with the Dow giving up over 1900 points in the process. The Nasdaq has closed in the red for the year. Alarmingly, it has been reported that Only 5 US states have the capacity to test for the coronavirus. European shares look set for a lower open with the number of cases in China moving higher again. There are some stark instances of business being affected now - Royal Caribbean has cancelled 30 cruises in Southeast Asia. Nobody\u2019s willing to \u2018catch a falling knife\u2019 with these kinds of headlines. Benchmarks in Europe look in bad shape.

The New York-based private equity firm is buying iQ from the US investment bank Goldman Sachs and the health research charity Wellcome Trust. The property firm is one of the main players in the rapidly growing UK student housing market. It owns and operates 67 student premises across the country, with more than 28,000 beds and plans to add a further 4,000. Investors such as private equity firms and Goldman have been piling into purpose-built student housing in recent years, as demand continues to outstrip the number of beds provided by 30%. Last year, 32,000 new beds were delivered across the UK of which nearly 90% were from private sector providers. A further 114,000 beds are in the pipeline. Despite the increased investment, there were fewer than 650,000 student accommodation beds for 1.8 million undergraduates and postgraduates in the UK last year. The short supply has been pushing up rents. Rents for en-suite accommodation have been at 16% above the rate of inflation since 2014, according to a recent report. High rent bills have led to student rent strikes in the past. At iQ, rents start at \u00a375 a week in Bradford, and \u00a3195 a week in London. An en-suite room in Bloomsbury in the centre of the capital costs \u00a3460 a week. Some of the iQ accommodation being built is vastly different from traditional student halls and includes studio flats or en-suite rooms, fast broadband, on-site gyms and cinemas. The firm says its rent includes wifi, access to the gym and communal areas, alongside 24-hour security, insurance and utility bills. More than half of the company\u2019s portfolio is in London, where iQ is the largest owner of student accommodation. It also offers student digs in other leading university cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Birmingham. The firm was formed in 2006 with Wellcome as one of the founding investors, and merged with Goldman Sachs\u2019 student housing business in 2016. Blackstone\u2019s first foray into luxury student dorms came in 2006 when it created Nido with the developer Generation Estates. The first Nido tower, with 1,000 beds, was opened that year in King\u2019s Cross, London, followed in 2010 by a 33-floor tower in Spitalfields, east London with a 24-hour gym and a pizza vending machine. Nido was sold to the property firm Round Hill Capital six years later. Rob Roger, iQ\u2019s chief executive, said he was looking forward to \u201cworking with a partner of Blackstone\u2019s calibre, as we continue to deliver our ambitious growth plans\u201d. \u201cWith student numbers in the UK at an all-time high, and growth set to continue in the coming years, there has never been a more exciting time to be a leading player in the student accommodation sector.\u201d The number of full-time students in the UK has reached a record level.

Retail sales were up 3%-4% last year in their 13th year of consecutive growth, the equivalent of 220m more eggs purchased than in 2018, the data shows.

      "bodyText": "The tourism industry should ready itself for a \u201crocky ride\u201d as the coronavirus spreads across Europe. The warning by data and analytics company GlobalData follows a change in Foreign Office (FCO) advice to warn against all-but-essential travel to 10 small towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto \u2013 and a warning from the World Health Organization that \u201cthe world is not ready\u201d for a pandemic. \u201cIf there was previously a temptation to view the coronavirus as a China, or Asia, issue then developments this week must force a shift in mindset,\u201d said Nick Wyatt, head of R&amp;A,Travel and Tourism at GlobalData. \u201cWith the news that 11 towns in Italy are on lockdown and countries such as Austria and Croatia announcing their first cases, it is readily apparent that the impact is likely to be felt on a more global scale than was perhaps previously envisaged.\u201d In northern Italy, 12 people have now died of the coronavirus, with the number of confirmed cases at 374. The regions of Lombardy, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna are suspending public events, and closing museums and other cultural institutions until 1 March. The Venice carnival was cut short on 23 February, Milan Fashion Week has been limiting public access to shows and 40 football matches, including four Serie A games, have been postponed, along with dozens of church services, walking tours and opera performances. This weekend five Serie A matches will be played behind closed doors \u2013 including Juventus\u2019 match at home to Inter Milan \u2013 because of the outbreak. Ireland\u2019s Six Nations game against Italy in Dublin, on 7 March, has now been postponed. In Venice, the usually crowded streets are quiet and hotels and other tourism businesses are feeling the impact. \u201cIn one way the city is more relaxed without the crowds but it\u2019s affecting the economy,\u201d said photojournalist Giacomo Cosua, who lives in Venice. Ted Wake, managing director of Kirker Holidays, said clients with trips to popular northern Italy destinations, such as Venice are taking a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach and continuing with planned trips. Wake said it was too early to say whether there would be an impact longer term. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to predict. The peak travel time is April and that\u2019s 5-6 weeks away. A lot can change in that time.\u201d Wake predicted that hotels that have fewer bookings due to a downturn in Chinese tourists will start to offer upgrades to visitors. \u201cThis week is the wrong week to launch offers for later in the year but I think we will start to see very good value from hoteliers.\u201d Elsewhere in Europe, guests have been confined to rooms at a hotel in Tenerife after an Italian doctor and one guest who stayed at the hotel tested positive for the virus; and a hotel in Innsbruck, Austria, is in lockdown after its Italian receptionist tested positive. There has also been one confirmed case in Greece and three in France, one of whom is reported to have died last night. There are no travel restrictions in place for other European destinations. The countries with the largest numbers of cases outside of China are South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. As one of Europe\u2019s most important inbound tourism markets, Europe has already begun to feel the effect of fewer visitors from China. According to travel analytics company Forward Keys, outbound travel from China to Europe fell by 41.7% in the three weeks following travel restrictions. Overall, official tourism bodies are calling for cooperation across the industry in Europe, including a measured, evidence-based response to information provided by the FCO, the World Health Organization, and other health officials. At a press conference on Wednesday at the Ministry of Health in Rome, the EU Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides, said the commission welcomed \u201ckeeping the borders open\u201d across the EU, instead of \u201cresorting to what could be considered disproportionate and inefficient measures\u201d. \u201cThis is a situation of concern but we must not give in to panic and we must be vigilant of misinformation and disinformation,\u201d she said. Airlines The majority of airlines servicing Europe have stated they are still operating routes as normal, without offering cancellations, or alterations, without a fee at present. This includes flights into northern Italy, with BA, Ryanair and easyJet. However, Aegean has released a statement offering passengers who already hold a ticket for all destinations (until 20 March) and wish to change it to a later date, the chance to do so without amendment fees. In a statement on Thursday, BA said it was cancelling some flights to and from Milan Linate due to a decrease in passenger numbers travelling to the region. \u201cTo match reduced demand due to the continuing coronavirus issue, we are merging a small number of flights to and from Milan.

Some of us, among doctors and nurses, are infected and are now fighting against the disease.\u201d</p> \n<p>The investigation comes as Italy is under pressure to get to the bottom of what triggered the sudden outbreak as it spreads across Europe and beyond, despite enacting a state of emergency in late January when the virus was first detected in two Chinese tourists from Wuhan officials believe may be the initial source. The couple, who have now recovered, are also reported to have visited Parma in the north of the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn all emergency departments across the world, doctors should always have in mind the so-called universal precautions that tend to consider every patient, at any time or anywhere, a potential spreader of disease,\u201d Walter Ricciardi, an Italian medic and member of the World Health Organization\u2019s executive board, told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes, because of the pressure of the work, these can\u2019t be entirely enforced, and I think that is what happened here. We shouldn\u2019t blame anyone, as doctors and nurses are only doing their jobs, but if there is a mistake, we need to avoid making one again. It is also difficult as we are still in the flu season and it is very difficult to distinguish between the two.\u201d</p> \n<p>Italy has carried out more than 9,000 coronavirus tests since Friday. One explanation experts give for the surge in cases is that Italy has carried out a huge number of tests, particularly among people who showed few or no symptoms and who might have recovered without even knowing they had coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The Italian government has also been criticised for hastily cancelling flights to and from China as, without coherence across Europe, people have been able to fly to other European cities and enter Italy from there.</p> \n<p>Thermal scanners were installed at some of the main airports to check the temperature of new arrivals. \u201cBut even if you checked the temperature of all the people arriving at the airport, you cannot find all the infected people,\u201d said Gloria Taliani, a doctor of infectious diseases in the Lombardy city of Piacenza. \u201cTherefore this global movement of people makes it very easy for the disease to cross borders.\u201d</p>",

As new cases were confirmed in Spain, France, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Norway and Algeria, it was reported that a hospital in Lombardy, where the bulk of the infections are located, delayed testing \u201cpatient-one\u201d, a 38-year-old man who is believed to be the first source of local transmission. The virus has so far killed 12 people in Italy, the latest victim being a 70-year-old woman in Emilia-Romagna. Cases across the country have reached more than 400 by Wednesday night, among them five children aged between four and 15. Police officers carried out overnight inspections on hospitals in the Lombardy towns of Codogno, the centre of the outbreak, Casalpusterlengo and Lodi. The investigation comes after the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, blamed an unnamed hospital for contributing to the spread of the virus by failing to adhere to proper procedures. Reporting in Italian media has focused on whether medical staff missed opportunities to identify coronavirus in patient one \u2013 identified as \u201cMattia\u201d \u2013 who remains seriously ill in hospital in Pavia, south of Milan. The man is believed to have infected his pregnant wife and a friend he went running with as well as three elderly people who frequented a bar owned by his friend\u2019s father. He has also been linked to eight other infections, among them health workers and patients at the hospital in Codogno, one of them reportedly being a 77-year-old woman who died of the illness on Sunday. The woman was suffering from pneumonia and tested positive for the virus postmortem. Critics claim that emergency health guidelines introduced in late January mean that the man should have been treated as a potential suspected case, and tested, even without clear connections to China, because of his symptoms. According to reports in the Italian media it took four contacts with doctors before the man was eventually tested for coronavirus, and then only after he had spent 36 hours at a hospital in Codogno before being put under isolation, a period during which he infected a number of other people. Some staff at the hospital have complained that even after he tested positive it still took hours before all staff were warned of the risk. According to details that have leaked out slowly in recent days in the midst of Italy\u2019s escalating coronavirus crisis, it appears that the man first complained of feeling unwell around 14 February and went to his GP \u2013 also now in hospital with coronavirus \u2013 where he was given flu medication. With his symptoms failing to improve, he then attended hospital on 16 February, returning again to A&amp;E two days later on February 18 where he was discharged again without being tested because of a lack of any links with China. On 19 February, just after 3am in the morning, the man, experiencing breathing difficulties, visited the hospital for a third time. On this occasion the man\u2019s wife recalled he may have had contact with a friend recently returned from China. Even then he was only tested for the virus 36 hours later at about 4pm on 20 February during which time he had been visited by numerous friends and family who were able to come and go freely. While Conte did not explicitly refer to the hospital in Codogno where the first man tested positive, his comments prompted a backlash from Attilio Fontana, the regional president. The head of medicine in Codogno also defended his hospital\u2019s response. \u201cWe have done our duty and we have a clear conscience,\u201d Giorgio Scanzi told Italian media. \u201cFrom the first moment of the emergency we have not left our sick even for a moment. Some of us, among doctors and nurses, are infected and are now fighting against the disease.\u201d The investigation comes as Italy is under pressure to get to the bottom of what triggered the sudden outbreak as it spreads across Europe and beyond, despite enacting a state of emergency in late January when the virus was first detected in two Chinese tourists from Wuhan officials believe may be the initial source. The couple, who have now recovered, are also reported to have visited Parma in the north of the country. \u201cIn all emergency departments across the world, doctors should always have in mind the so-called universal precautions that tend to consider every patient, at any time or anywhere, a potential spreader of disease,\u201d Walter Ricciardi, an Italian medic and member of the World Health Organization\u2019s executive board, told the Guardian. \u201cSometimes, because of the pressure of the work, these can\u2019t be entirely enforced, and I think that is what happened here. We shouldn\u2019t blame anyone, as doctors and nurses are only doing their jobs, but if there is a mistake, we need to avoid making one again. It is also difficult as we are still in the flu season and it is very difficult to distinguish between the two.\u201d Italy has carried out more than 9,000 coronavirus tests since Friday. One explanation experts give for the surge in cases is that Italy has carried out a huge number of tests, particularly among people who showed few or no symptoms and who might have recovered without even knowing they had coronavirus. The Italian government has also been criticised for hastily cancelling flights to and from China as, without coherence across Europe, people have been able to fly to other European cities and enter Italy from there. Thermal scanners were installed at some of the main airports to check the temperature of new arrivals. \u201cBut even if you checked the temperature of all the people arriving at the airport, you cannot find all the infected people,\u201d said Gloria Taliani, a doctor of infectious diseases in the Lombardy city of Piacenza. \u201cTherefore this global movement of people makes it very easy for the disease to cross borders.\u201d",

This is a problem in transatlantic trade talks because US agribusiness wants access to UK dining tables. The politics of serving food prepared to US safety standards is tricky on a number of levels. Alongside chlorinated chicken, the use of growth-promoting hormones and antibiotics in meat production are more tightly regulated in Europe than in many countries that want to export their surplus meat. After Brexit, the UK can abandon EU standards, but if it does so it will find its produce barred from continental markets.</p> <p>Eurosceptics call that protectionism, and partly it is. European food safety standards have a scientific rationale \u2013 the idea is that hygiene should be maintained all along the chain, not dealt with at the last stage by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/boris-johnson-must-examine-the-science-of-cheap-food-imports\" title=\"\">blasting</a> microbes with disinfectant. But those rules are bundled up with a system that insulates the sector from global competition. The EU subsidises farmers, recognising how destabilising it would be if a glut of cheap American produce was dumped on their markets.

      "bodyText": "Most people pay little attention to the chain of production that brings food to their plates. Americans eat tonnes of chicken every year, unaware of, or unconcerned by, the chemical rinse applied to its pre-cooked carcass. British consumers might also eat chlorine-washed chicken if they had acquired the habit, but since they haven\u2019t the idea is unappetising. This is a problem in transatlantic trade talks because US agribusiness wants access to UK dining tables. The politics of serving food prepared to US safety standards is tricky on a number of levels. Alongside chlorinated chicken, the use of growth-promoting hormones and antibiotics in meat production are more tightly regulated in Europe than in many countries that want to export their surplus meat. After Brexit, the UK can abandon EU standards, but if it does so it will find its produce barred from continental markets. Eurosceptics call that protectionism, and partly it is. European food safety standards have a scientific rationale \u2013 the idea is that hygiene should be maintained all along the chain, not dealt with at the last stage by blasting microbes with disinfectant. But those rules are bundled up with a system that insulates the sector from global competition. The EU subsidises farmers, recognising how destabilising it would be if a glut of cheap American produce was dumped on their markets. Some Eurosceptics embrace that destabilisation as an economic tonic, others deny it would happen.

      "bodyText": "Allen Hernandez, 39, has spent his life fighting against the deadliest air in America. The pollution in southern California\u2019s Inland Empire gave him life-threatening asthma attacks as a child, and now he watches his eight-year-old niece regularly go to the emergency room instead of school. Despite the lack of progress toward clean air over the decades, Hernandez recently had reason to feel hopeful: Bernie Sanders was sitting with him, listening to his story. If the Vermont senator wins the 3 March California primary and Democratic presidential nomination, it will be in part due to his campaign\u2019s aggressive outreach to communities like Hernandez\u2019s, a strategy that includes direct advocacy on hyper-local issues and collaborating with grassroots activists often ignored by their own elected representatives. \u201cNo community should have to live like this,\u201d said Hernandez, an activist who grew up in the city of Fontana, in an area long plagued by the most toxic air in the US due to a major rail yard, industrial warehouses and brutal truck traffic. \u201cThe studies show we\u2019re dying. The diesel is killing us.\u201d The Sanders campaign and Latino activists in the Inland Empire, a region straddling two counties about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, have banded together against a shared enemy \u2013 Amazon. The retail giant has been rapidly expanding its local warehouses, in the processing worsening truck pollution and offering jobs that critics say can be hazardous and exploitative. Some workers and community organizers fighting for better labor conditions and environmental protections are also canvassing for Sanders, energized by his campaign\u2019s presence in their neighborhoods. \u201cBernie has paid attention to us and thrown his voice behind our fight,\u201d said one worker at an Amazon sort center in San Bernardino, who requested anonymity for fear of losing their job. \u201cIt does bring me a lot of hope.\u201d The Sanders strategy: \u2018You can\u2019t just have a Spanish flyer\u2019 Sanders, the frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination since he won the Nevada caucuses, is betting that his campaign\u2019s strategic early investments in a California ground game will translate into votes from working-class communities typically forgotten in state and national races. Last year, Sanders was the first 2020 candidate to open an office in Riverside, an Inland Empire city. The billionaires in the race, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, later followed suit. \u201cYou have to speak to those voters. You have to organize, not just translate an English flyer into Spanish,\u201d Rafael N\u00e1var, the campaign\u2019s California director, said in a recent interview. That means partnering with, and hiring, longtime activists: \u201cThe folks who have been fighting on the ground to improve the conditions of working people can see themselves reflected in a presidential campaign that is not only committed to those values as well, but is going to lift up their individual fights.\u201d In the Inland Empire, the campaign is engaging groups taking on the industries poisoning their neighborhoods. The region was once home to the west coast\u2019s largest steel plant, a major air force base and an agricultural economy. Over time, those sectors and jobs disappeared, and in the last decade, more than 150m square feet of industrial warehouses have moved into historically rural and equestrian areas. Hubs for distribution centers and the logistics industry, with massive warehouses for Amazon, UPS, Walmart and other retailers, have taken over. \u201cThere are so many warehouses being built at such a rapid rate, it\u2019s really difficult to keep up,\u201d said Anthony Victoria, a 28-year-old local activist, while driving through the industrial corridors of his hometown, passing by new warehouses in longtime residents\u2019 backyards, truck routes adjacent to schools, and \u201cnotice of filing\u201d signs at construction sites warning of more warehouses to come. After passing a field where he used to play baseball, he gestured to a new nearby warehouse: \u201cHow many of these kids struggle to play ball now because they can\u2019t fucking breathe?\u201d Victoria\u2019s mother was originally from Honduras and his father from Mexico, and the family bought a house in Rialto in San Bernardino county in the early 2000s when real estate was affordable. Owning property was part of their American dream, he said. But they lost their home in the recession and were forced to move into a trailer park near a rail yard, an area with terrible air quality that eventually made his mother sick. She died last year at age 56 after battling cancer that was exacerbated by her health problems: \u201cIt\u2019s a slow death, the slow violence of the supply chain.\u201d He rattled off the grim statistics. In 2018, San Bernardino had 102 \u201cbad air\u201d days, meaning unhealthy smog levels that can trigger asthma attacks and cause lung problems. The region ranks as the fifth worst place in the nation to raise children and is at the top of the list for America\u2019s \u201cdeadliest\u201d air quality. Out of five women who have been central in the community organizing against warehouses in recent years, four have died of cancer and other illnesses, said Victoria: \u201cPeople are literally dying fighting this.\u201d The Sanders campaign made clear to Victoria that it took this crisis seriously \u2013 and not just by having the candidate hold a rally in the region. Fighting for Amazon workers: \u2018Bernie went to the people\u2019 Hernandez, the Fontana native, who leads an environmental justice group, said it had been easy for him to collaborate with the Sanders team: Sanders\u2019 Inland Empire campaign director is one of his mentees. Last year, Sanders and his wife met Hernandez and Victoria to discuss the scourge of the warehouses and the impact of Amazon. Sanders endorsed the coalition\u2019s fight for a \u201ccommunity benefits agreement\u201d with Amazon, which has more than a dozen warehouses in the area. Advocates have been organizing against a proposed air cargo facility in San Bernardino, which is rumored to have Amazon as its tenant. Hernandez said some of his friends who are politicians were jealous they didn\u2019t get time with the candidate: \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re elected. Bernie went to the people.\u201d Anna Bahr, Sanders\u2019 California communications director, said: \u201cThe campaign takes its political cues, its policy cues, the stands that it makes, from people on the ground, from folks who have been very vulnerable to corporations.\u201d She noted that the campaign had also offered support to striking graduate students and residents affected by wildfires. That kind of localized engagement can energize activists who are trusted in their communities to volunteer. Hernandez has hosted \u201cBernie walks\u201d in the region, encouraging his neighbors to vote for the candidate who has fought for better jobs at Amazon and other warehouses in their community. Ana Gonzalez, a 33-year-old Sanders supporter and single mother who has fought the warehouses, said voters like her were used to feeling under-represented in the local Democratic party. With Sanders, \u201cI feel like we\u2019re finally being seen. And voters are seeing organizers they know and have relationships with work with the campaign.\u201d Gonzalez, of Rialto, has knocked on hundreds of doors since meeting Sanders. \u201cThere\u2019s still this image of the \u2018Bernie bro\u2019, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reality of his supporters here,\u201d added Katherine Palomares, 27, who grew up in the Inland Empire and is now doing census outreach. The campaign seemed inclusive of people who are so often disenfranchised and trapped in bad jobs. \u201cOut here, people don\u2019t have hope. They\u2019re at the hands of their employers, very vulnerable.\u201d Some organizers aren\u2019t used to having their goals overlap with candidate platforms in the Inland Empire, where local politicians openly court warehouse developers, citing the jobs they bring. \u201cThey bend over backwards to convince the community that this is good,\u201d said Andres Garcia, 28, who previously worked at a local Amazon warehouse and is now supporting Sanders. While driving through his native San Bernardino, Garcia pointed to decaying streets and a shuttered mall. The warehouse jobs are temporary, but the negative health impacts on the community can be long-term, said Garcia, who was born with asthma: \u201cThis is environmental racism.\u201d An Amazon spokesperson said the company had created more than 15,000 jobs in the Inland Empire with \u201cindustry-leading wages, comprehensive benefits [and] safe workplaces\u2019, and noted its $15-an-hour minimum wage. The company also cited its \u201cclimate pledge\u201d and investments in renewable energy and alternate-power vehicles (though Amazon has also recently faced scrutiny for threatening to fire employees for speaking publicly about the climate crisis). For voters like Hernandez, the election is personal and the stakes are high. When he was salutatorian in high school in Fontana, his graduation speech ended up being a eulogy for his best friend who died of cancer.

Even if my opponent was physically stronger, more confident \u2013 even if just plain better \u2013 I could and did persevere.\u201d She added: \u201cIn giving my life to tennis, tennis gave me a life. I\u2019ll miss it every day. I\u2019ll miss the training and my daily routine: waking up at dawn, lacing my left shoe before my right, and closing the court\u2019s gate before I hit my first ball of the day.\u201d It has been one of the longest goodbyes in sport, one others identified way before Sharapova succumbed to the inevitable degradation in competitiveness. But no one could take away from her the indomitable spirit that compensated for any lack of flair. If she sometimes looked better than she was, it was the most artful disguise. She will be missed for the one quality she had in abundance: bloodymindedness.",

Bob Kerslake, who ran the civil service from 2011 to 2014, issued the ultimatum as head of the UK2070 commission, an independent inquiry into the deep\u2013rooted geographical inequalities within the UK. \u201cLevelling up can\u2019t just be about transport; it\u2019s about skills, research and development, education and places, as well as local economies,\u201d he said, before a report on Thursday detailing the findings of the 18-month inquiry. Though it has committed to building HS2 and what it is now calling \u201chigh-speed north\u201d \u2013 an east-west railway line across the Pennines \u2013 the government had not yet grasped the need for \u201cradical change\u201d, said Lord Kerslake, referencing the Marmot report, which earlier this week showed health inequalities have widened over the last decade, in large part due to the impact of cuts linked to the government\u2019s austerity policies. These inequalities have increased despite the Conservatives talking since 2014 of building a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, which Kerslake said needed to be \u201cbigger and bolder and more coherent and coordinated and cross-cutting\u201d. The 18-month inquiry concluded that, as climate change is \u201cthe overarching national threat\u201d, decarbonising the UK will exacerbate the imbalance between the south-east of England and everywhere else if the government does not ensure a \u201cjust\u201d transition to a carbon-free future.

In more than 10 of those, 30% of all jobs are highly carbon-intensive.

The authors suggest government investment in new green industries \u2013 such as energy supply, battery technology, car production and the construction industry \u2013 be focused \u201cin those areas with the greatest need for industrial restructuring\u201d. This is particularly important as decarbonisation will also hit hardest in the poorest households, \u201cfor whom the costs of basic services and fuel are already a disproportionate burden\u201d, the report says. Vulnerable communities will tend to experience greater adverse impacts from climate change, for example in terms of water and air quality and flood risk. The report also demands a \u201cconnectivity revolution\u201d over the next 25 years to build a network of cities, sustainable mass transit systems within all urban areas, enhanced links for \u201cmarginalised communities\u201d, particularly in coastal areas, and the reopening or upgrade of 1,800 miles of rail line.

And, to be frank, we are ready to believe this.</p> <p>In fact, I do not believe that the UK will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But Barnier also said that, if the UK is committed to high standards, it should be willing to agree common \u201cground rules\u201d with the EU. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do not believe that the UK will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames.</p> <p>What that means is it should not be a problem for the UK to agree on a number of ground rules.</p> <p>And I want to be very, very clear.</p> <p>We understand that the UK wants its own rule book. We respect that choice, the UK\u2019s sovereign choice. That was the whole point of leaving the EU ...</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Adam Fleming</strong>, the BBC\u2019s Brussels correspondent, suggests Barnier was sounding a little more accommodating towards the UK at this point than in the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/adamfleming/status/1232680841274445824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichelBarnier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MichelBarnier</a> finessed his rhetoric on the level playing field?  <br>\ud83d\udd39\u201cI don\u2019t believe \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames.\u201d<br>\ud83d\udd39\u201dWe understand \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 wants its own rulebook.\u201d<br>\ud83d\udd39\u201dLet\u2019s lay down together a number of rules building on our current high standards...\u201d</p>&mdash; Adam Fleming (@adamfleming) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamfleming/status/1232680841274445824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Barnier said a simple Canada deal was not on offer to the UK. </strong>This is what the British government is now demanding. But Barnier said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no single template. There was never, and there never will be, a single template. The UK says it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barnier explained that Canada was not an option because the UK was much closer to the EU than Canada, and its volume of trade with the EU was much bigger. That was why level playing field provisions mattered more, he said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said the EU was willing to offer the UK \u201csuper-preferential access\u201d - in return for assurances that competition would be free and fair.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are ready to offer to the UK super-preferential access to our markets - a level of access that would be unprecedented for a third country.</p> <p>Is this something we can do without firm guarantees that the UK will respect the level playing field and avoid unfair competitive advantages? The answer, I\u2019m afraid, is simple. We cannot.</p> <p>We want competition in future but it must be fair - fair and free ...</p> <p>That is why we are asking that the EU and the UK lay down together a number of rules building on our current high standards in specific areas: state aid, environmental protection and the fight against climate change, social and labour rights and taxation issues. This way we will make sure that somewhere down the road, perhaps in years to come, neither side will use unfair subsidies, nor grant derogations on industrial emissions or on labour standards to win industries from the other.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the EU would strictly enforce rules of origin checks on British goods entering the single market from 2021 - even if there is a trade deal. </strong>Explaining why, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On 1 January 2021, whatever the outcome of the negotiation, there will be checks and controls on all UK goods entering the single market as there are for any third country.</p> <p>These checks are particularly important given the UK\u2019s position as a major entry point into the single market and as part of these checks we will need to pay the greatest attention to the rules of origin that we will put in our trade agreement.</p> <p>Of course we love \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 but we must guarantee that the goods we import from the UK - tariff and quota free - really are British.</p> <p>We cannot take the risk that the UK becomes a kind of assembly hub for goods from all over the world, allowing them to enter the single market as British goods.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the EU would not allow British financial institutions to get permanent equivalence status for trading in the single market from 2021.</strong> Earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/barnier-tells-uk-dont-kid-yourself-about-financial-services-deal\">it emerged that the UK would be asking for permanent equivalence.</a> But Barnier said that, although the EU would be willing to grant equivalence (the right to do business, subject to certain conditions) in some sectors, equivalence decisions would remain temporary, and subject to EU discretion. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will do so when it is in the interests of the EU, our financial stability, our investors and our consumers. But these equivalences will never be global nor permanent, nor will they be subject to joint management with the UK. They are, and will remain, unilateral decisions.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said a \u201cpoint of concern\u201d for the EU was the extent to which the British government now seems to be \u201cdistancing\u201d itself from the commitments made on Northern Ireland border rules (in the legally binding Northern Ireland protocol) and on level playing field commitments (in the political declaration).</strong> He said the EU needed to check what the UK\u2019s intentions really were in these areas \u201cin the next few days and weeks\u201d.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbdd9aec289a8b749708dc1e48d1a97914dba853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbdd9aec289a8b749708dc1e48d1a97914dba853/0_0_2074_2851/727.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Barnier\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Barnier with his award of an honorary degree from the ESCP Business School in Brussels, which was presented to him after he gave a speech to students from the college.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T17:41:37.183Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e568b8c8f08e1332474a94e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T15:16:05.332Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After the audience all stood for the European anthem, Barnier is now being presented with an honorary degree.</p> <p>I will post a summary of his speech shortly.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5685b68f08e1332474a8ee\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T15:13:23.534Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barnier's Q&amp;A</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier has finished his speech. He is now taking questions.</p> <p><em>Q: Has anything surprised you in the Brexit negotiations so far?</em></p> <p>Barnier says what was surprising was that the PM could not reach a majority for a deal. </p> <p>He says he once asked Nigel Farage what his vision was for life after Brexit. He says Farage told him that after Brexit the EU would no longer exist. He says that showed that, for some people behind Brexit, they wanted to use it to destroy the EU.</p> <p>He says he is surprised by how far the British government has moved from its previous commitments (ie, in the Northern Irish protocol and in the political declaration). But the EU will have to check this in the coming days and weeks, he says.</p> <p><em>Q: You say you think the British government is distancing itself from the withdrawal agreement, and what it said about Ireland. Do you think Ireland could unite in the coming years, and Northern Ireland rejoin the EU that way?</em><br></p> <p>Barnier says he listens to everybody, including people from Northern Ireland and from Scotland. But he does not want to intervene in the national debate in the UK.</p> <p><em>Q: What are the changes since 1973 that led to the UK leaving the EU?</em></p> <p>Barnier says the UK joined the EEC mainly for trade reasons. But for Europeans, the EU is more than a supermarket, or a free trade zone. It has become an economic ecosystem. And that is why China and the US respect the EU, he says. That is why the EU will never let it unravel.</p> <p>He says there are specific British reasons for Brexit. But there are common popular views. There are many British regions where was is behind Brexit is \u201csocial anger\u201d, and the feeling that the EU does not protect people. Politicians must take the time to listen, to understand and to respond, he says. He says it is too late to do this in Britain, but not elsewhere.</p> <p>And he says you should not confuse this popular sentiment with populism. Populism used this sentiment, he says.</p> <p>And he says there are answers to people\u2019s concerns. </p> <p><em>Q: How will the EU make up for the loss of the UK\u2019s contribution?</em><br></p> <p>Barnier says the UK has been a net contributor to the EU budget. The loss amounts to 1% of the EU\u2019s GDP, he says. But he says there is a huge and very difficult debate about the budget. This debate has never been easier, but it has been made harder by the departure of the UK. The gap amounts to \u20ac10bn.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T15:54:16.283Z\">at 3.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5684328f08e1332474a8dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T14:49:46.367Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier says the negotiation with the UK starts on Monday.</p> <p>He says the EU has been listening to ministerial declarations from the UK, and it has seen distancing from the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>The EU wants the text of that agreement implemented to the letter.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e56822b8f086a28115b2f34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T14:43:45.835Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier says the UK is insisting a lot on its own sovereignty.</p> <p>He says nobody contests this.</p> <p>The EU respects the UK\u2019s sovereignty, he says. But it is not just a matter of sovereignty; it is a matter of pragmatism too.</p> <p>From January 2021 there will be changes in many areas, he says.</p> <p>He says the more the UK seeks to distance itself from the common rules established over years, the more the relationship will be separate, sector by sector.</p> <p>He says the EU is not proposing that the UK loses control; it is offering the UK to use its sovereignty for mutual advantage.</p> <p>The UK is leaving 600 international agreements by virtue of Brexit, he says. This will have consequences from 2021, even if there is a deal.</p> <p>He says he has three examples.</p> <p>First, from 1 January 2021 there will be checks and controls on all UK goods entering the single market, as with any third country. This will apply even if there is a deal. He says this will involve attention being paid to rules of origin. The EU loves \u201cmade in Britain\u201d, he says. But it will want to know these goods are made in Britain. Britain cannot just become an assembly hub.</p> <p>Second, from January 2021 UK financial services firms will lose the financial passport. They will not be able to offer services in all EU states based on being British. He says they might have to establish themselves in an EU country. In some sectors the EU will grant equivalences, where it is in the EU\u2019s interest. But they will \u201cnever be global and permanent\u201d, and never be subject to joint management with the EU, he says.</p> <p>As a former financial services commissioner, Barnier says the EU cannot allow the UK to keep profits, while the EU takes on the risk. The EU must take responsibility for its financial supervision, and financial responsibility.</p> <p>Third, on goods, Barnier says the UK will not be able to grant market authorisations for things like cars and pharmaceuticals for the EU market. This function must be carried out in the EU, he says.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T14:55:39.357Z\">at 2.55pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e56809a8f086a28115b2f18\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T14:35:19.122Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barnier says UK cannot get Canada trade deal because 'UK is not Canada'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier has now switched to speaking in English. </p> <p>He says trade is about more than boosting economic performance.

Johnson says he has higher standards, he says.

It was not a Geoffrey Howe-style sabotage mission by any stretch of the imagination, and the tone of his remarks \u2013 and of Boris Johnson\u2019s response \u2013 implied that a return to government at some point in the future may well be an option. But Javid did deliver two messages that sounded like polite but firm warnings about the direction in which Johnson is leading his government.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Javid said Johnson should not try to stop his ministers \u201cspeaking truth to power\u201d. </strong>Javid resigned in the reshuffle because Johnson said he could only stay at the Treasury if he agreed to sack some of his advisers and replace them with officials jointly appointed by No 10. Javid said he thought that was unreasonable. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has always been the case that advisers advise, minsters decide and minsters decide on their advisers. I couldn\u2019t see why the Treasury, with the vital role that it plays, should be the exception to that.</p> </blockquote> <p>More importantly, Javid suggested that Johnson would not be able to govern properly if he was not exposed to independent advice from his ministers. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A chancellor, like all cabinet ministers, has to be able to give candid advice so he is speaking truth to power. I believe that the arrangement proposed would significantly inhibit that and it would not have been in the national interest.</p> <p>So while I was grateful for the continued trust of the prime minister in wanting to reappoint me, I am afraid that these were conditions that I could not accept in good conscience.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Javid made it clear that he held Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, responsible for what happened. </strong>He made this point by means of a joke. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now I don\u2019t intend to dwell further on all the details and the personalities ... the Cummings and goings if you will.</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps that line also contains a hint that Javid was expressing a hope that Cummings himself would be going quite soon. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Javid backed Rishi Sunak, his successor.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I very much hope that the new chancellor will be given space to do his job without fear or favour. And I know that [Sunak] is more than capable of rising to the challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the day of his resignation Javid said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/13/politics-live-cabinet-reshuffle-set-to-get-underway-live-news?page=with:block-5e4580488f0811db2faf72cd#block-5e4580488f0811db2faf72cd\">\u201cany self-respecting minister\u201d would reject the conditions imposed by Johnson</a>, implying that Sunak was not a self-respecting minister. Javid did not use the same line today, and his complimentary comments about Sunak sounded genuine.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Javid said it would be a mistake for Johnson to water down the commitments given in the Tory manifesto about reducing the national debt.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister has won a huge mandate to transform our country and already he is off to a great start - ending the parliamentary paralysis, defeating the radical left, getting Brexit done, a points-based immigration system and an infrastructure revolution.</p> <p>We need a resolute focus on long-term outcomes and delivery, not short-term headlines. The Treasury as an institution, as an economic ministry should be the engine that drives this new agenda.</p> <p>But the Treasury must also be allowed to play its role as a finance ministry with the strength and credibility that it requires.</p> <p>You see, I\u2019m a proud, low-tax Conservative and I always will be. Already our tax burden is the highest it has been in 50 years.</p> <p>It is fair to say not everyone at the centre of government always feels the pressure to balance the books. It was ever thus.</p> <p>But the Treasury has a job to do. It is the only tax-cutting ministry. Every other department has an in-built incentive to seek and to spend ever more money ...</p> <p>At a time when we need to do much to level up across generations it would not be right to pass the bill for our day-to-day consumption to our children and grandchildren.</p> <p>And unlike the US, we don\u2019t have the fiscal flexibility that comes with a reserve currency, so that\u2019s why the fiscal rules that we are elected on are critical.</p> <p>To govern is to choose, and these rules crystallise the choices that are required to keep spending under control, to keep taxes low, to root out waste and to pass that fitness test that was rightfully set in stone in our manifesto on debt being lower at the end of the parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>This passage was a reference to speculation that Johnson and his new chancellor may abandon the fiscal rules announced by Javid during the general election. The Tory manifesto specifically said that under the Conservatives \u201cdebt will be lower at the end of the parliament \u2013 rather than spiralling out of control under Labour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52e99123c21983920b6345276c6011fa9746861f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e99123c21983920b6345276c6011fa9746861f/29_0_1757_1054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid delivering his personal statement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid delivering his personal statement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: House of Commons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T13:41:41.165Z\">at 1.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5669de8f08e1332474a7ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T12:55:29.786Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hancock is now responding to Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary.</p> <p>Hancock thanks Ashworth, and other MPs, for taking a responsible and proportionate approach.</p> <p>There are plans in place in case of the virus becoming pandemic, he says.

The BBC says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More than 28,000 people in the UK were recorded sleeping rough in 12 months, research by the BBC has suggested.</p> <p>In England five times as many rough sleepers were seen by councils in the year than reported in official figures, which are a one-night snapshot ...</p> <p>New official figures will be released on Thursday but the data <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-47059450\">for 2018 showed 4,677</a> people slept rough in England on the one night the snapshot survey was taken, down 2% on the year before but 165% up on 2010.</p> <p>However council responses to the BBC showed nearly 25,000 people were recorded sleeping rough at least once in England during the latest year on record.</p> </blockquote> <p>Healey has asked the UK Statistics Authority to investigate. In a letter to Sir David Norgrove, its chair, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government\u2019s own figures, as published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in the latest publication \u2018Rough Sleeping Statistics: Autumn 2018, England\u2019, declare that the total number of people counted or estimated to be sleeping rough was just 4,677. You\u2019ll be aware that this data is gathered each year on a single night in the autumn.</p> <p> In light of the new figures published today, it is clear that the use of the government\u2019s own figures as the sole official measure of rough sleeping is seriously misleading as it dramatically undercounts the number of people sleeping rough.</p> <p>You will know the longstanding concern about the government\u2019s rough sleeping statistics, including from expert organisations and charities. For example, in 2018 the charity Crisis commissioned research which calculated that the number of people sleeping rough in England is more than double what government statistics suggest. </p> <p>The UKSA\u2019s own work in this area confirmed in 2015 that these rough sleeping statistics do not meet the standards required of national statistics \u2013 trustworthiness, quality and value.</p> <p>The government\u2019s rough sleeping statistics are the sole statistics produced by government on rough sleeping so they are naturally and inevitably assumed by the public to be an accurate portrayal of the scale of rough sleeping. This is clearly not the case, as the statistics are an unreliable undercount and are an unsound basis for public policy-making or debate. I would be grateful if you would investigate the flaws in these figures and how the government\u2019s statistics could be improved so they better capture the level of rough sleeping in our country.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e676a026396ed0c0cd458d0e9eca6143990f3a94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e676a026396ed0c0cd458d0e9eca6143990f3a94/0_83_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Healey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Healey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T12:17:26.721Z\">at 12.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5654eb8f08e1332474a6da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T11:32:48.445Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sajid Javid</strong> is expected to make a statement to MPs following his resignation as chancellor, and it is likely to come just after PMQs, according to Labour whips.</p> <p>By convention ministers who resign from cabinet are allowed to make statements to the Commons.

Theoretically, the government could opt for all three. My colleague <strong>Richard Partington</strong> has written up the IFS\u2019s assessment here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/26/ifs-urges-rishi-sunak-to-raise-taxes-in-budget-to-fund-spending-spree\">IFS urges Rishi Sunak to raise taxes in budget to fund spending spree</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The IFS analysis also illustrates quite how severe the cuts to public spending have been over the past decade. It says that day-to-day non-NHS public spending per head is 26% lower than it was at its peak in 2010, and that welfare cuts currently in the pipeline are set to take colossal sums away from some low-income families. Here is an extract (bold type from the IFS original).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Outside of health, day-to-day public service spending per person remains 26% below its 2010 peak. </strong>\u00a354bn would be required just to return to real 2010 levels.</p> <p><strong>No department will see cuts in 2020\u201321. </strong>Beyond that there are commitments to increase spending on the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid. Simply to avoid any further real-terms cuts elsewhere over the following three years the chancellor would need to find an additional \u00a33bn by 2023\u201324. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Maintaining spending on unprotected services as a share of national income would require an additional \u00a36.5bn.</strong></p> <p><strong>This would still leave cuts to means-tested support for low-income families with children slowly working their way through the system</strong>. The removal of an additional tax credit payment for the first child will eventually lead to around 3.2 million households getting \u00a3550 per year less than they would have received, while the two-child limit in means-tested benefits will eventually lead to around 750,000 households losing an average of \u00a33,600 per year.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what <strong>John McDonnell,</strong> the shadow chancellor, is saying about the IFS analysis. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This analysis shows the damage done by a decade of decline under Conservative governments, and the scale of investment needed even just to get back to 2010 spending levels.</p> <p>Ten years of Tory rule have brought 10 years of chaotic and erratic economic policy, with 16 fiscal targets proposed and ripped up and productivity growth plummeting.</p> <p>Despite all the hype about this budget turning a page, it risks setting in train five years of disappointment. Labour will continue to call for the fair taxation and investment needed to end austerity and tackle our social and climate emergencies.</p> </blockquote> <p>This may, or may not, come up at PMQs later.

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has said the UK should be willing to agree common \u201cground rules\u201d with the Brussels as part of a trade deal given Boris Johnson\u2019s claim to be committed to high standards. In a speech in Brussels (full text here), Barnier said that he believed Johnson did not want to turn the UK into a deregulated \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d. But he also said that a trade deal would have to include rules to guarantee fair competition and that the UK could not have an off-the-peg Canada-style deal because \u201cthe UK is not Canada\u201d. (See 4.39pm.) The former chancellor Sajid Javid has delivered a sharp indictment of the government, saying plans to centralise the team of advisers serving No 10 and the Treasury were \u201cnot in the national interest\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has castigated Boris Johnson for not having visited any communities affected by floods, accusing him in parliament of being \u201ca part-time prime minister\u201d. A YouGov poll of Labour members for Sky News suggests Sir Keir Starmer is on course to win with 53% of first-preference votes. Rebecca Long-Bailey is on 31%, the poll suggests, and Lisa Nandy on 16%. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has signalled another U-turn on law and order with the return of Whitehall-set targets to cut crime and warned police there will be no excuses for failure. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has clarified advice on travel to Italy following the coronavirus deaths in the north of the country after he was accused of creating confusion for British tourists. The government has rejected calls for a public inquiry into the UK flooding disaster, arguing that it has the crisis under control. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, faces a tough choice at next month\u2019s budget between raising taxes, entrenching austerity or abandoning Tory manifesto promises on government borrowing, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is the Guardian\u2019s latest Politics Weekly podcast. Rowena Mason is joined by Marie Le Conte, Karin Robinson, Raoul Ruparel and Tim Bale to discuss turmoil in Whitehall, the US Democrats\u2019 Super Tuesday, and the upcoming EU trade talks. Here are the main points from Michel Barnier\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A. Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said that he accepted Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that he does not want to turn the UK into a deregulated \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d. He said: Of course we have heard Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s assurances that the UK would never engage in a race to the bottom, that it would not seek to undermine European standards, that the UK would in fact maintain higher standards than the EU. And, to be frank, we are ready to believe this. In fact, I do not believe that the UK will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames. But Barnier also said that, if the UK is committed to high standards, it should be willing to agree common \u201cground rules\u201d with the EU. He said: I do not believe that the UK will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames. What that means is it should not be a problem for the UK to agree on a number of ground rules. And I want to be very, very clear. We understand that the UK wants its own rule book. We respect that choice, the UK\u2019s sovereign choice. That was the whole point of leaving the EU ... Adam Fleming, the BBC\u2019s Brussels correspondent, suggests Barnier was sounding a little more accommodating towards the UK at this point than in the past. Barnier said a simple Canada deal was not on offer to the UK. This is what the British government is now demanding. But Barnier said: There is no single template. There was never, and there never will be, a single template. The UK says it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada. Barnier explained that Canada was not an option because the UK was much closer to the EU than Canada, and its volume of trade with the EU was much bigger. That was why level playing field provisions mattered more, he said. He said the EU was willing to offer the UK \u201csuper-preferential access\u201d - in return for assurances that competition would be free and fair. He said: We are ready to offer to the UK super-preferential access to our markets - a level of access that would be unprecedented for a third country. Is this something we can do without firm guarantees that the UK will respect the level playing field and avoid unfair competitive advantages? The answer, I\u2019m afraid, is simple. We cannot. We want competition in future but it must be fair - fair and free ... That is why we are asking that the EU and the UK lay down together a number of rules building on our current high standards in specific areas: state aid, environmental protection and the fight against climate change, social and labour rights and taxation issues. This way we will make sure that somewhere down the road, perhaps in years to come, neither side will use unfair subsidies, nor grant derogations on industrial emissions or on labour standards to win industries from the other. He said that the EU would strictly enforce rules of origin checks on British goods entering the single market from 2021 - even if there is a trade deal. Explaining why, he said: On 1 January 2021, whatever the outcome of the negotiation, there will be checks and controls on all UK goods entering the single market as there are for any third country. These checks are particularly important given the UK\u2019s position as a major entry point into the single market and as part of these checks we will need to pay the greatest attention to the rules of origin that we will put in our trade agreement. Of course we love \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 but we must guarantee that the goods we import from the UK - tariff and quota free - really are British. We cannot take the risk that the UK becomes a kind of assembly hub for goods from all over the world, allowing them to enter the single market as British goods. He said the EU would not allow British financial institutions to get permanent equivalence status for trading in the single market from 2021. Earlier this month it emerged that the UK would be asking for permanent equivalence. But Barnier said that, although the EU would be willing to grant equivalence (the right to do business, subject to certain conditions) in some sectors, equivalence decisions would remain temporary, and subject to EU discretion. He said: We will do so when it is in the interests of the EU, our financial stability, our investors and our consumers. But these equivalences will never be global nor permanent, nor will they be subject to joint management with the UK. They are, and will remain, unilateral decisions. He said a \u201cpoint of concern\u201d for the EU was the extent to which the British government now seems to be \u201cdistancing\u201d itself from the commitments made on Northern Ireland border rules (in the legally binding Northern Ireland protocol) and on level playing field commitments (in the political declaration). He said the EU needed to check what the UK\u2019s intentions really were in these areas \u201cin the next few days and weeks\u201d. After the audience all stood for the European anthem, Barnier is now being presented with an honorary degree. I will post a summary of his speech shortly. Barnier has finished his speech. He is now taking questions. Q: Has anything surprised you in the Brexit negotiations so far? Barnier says what was surprising was that the PM could not reach a majority for a deal. He says he once asked Nigel Farage what his vision was for life after Brexit. He says Farage told him that after Brexit the EU would no longer exist. He says that showed that, for some people behind Brexit, they wanted to use it to destroy the EU. He says he is surprised by how far the British government has moved from its previous commitments (ie, in the Northern Irish protocol and in the political declaration). But the EU will have to check this in the coming days and weeks, he says. Q: You say you think the British government is distancing itself from the withdrawal agreement, and what it said about Ireland. Do you think Ireland could unite in the coming years, and Northern Ireland rejoin the EU that way? Barnier says he listens to everybody, including people from Northern Ireland and from Scotland. But he does not want to intervene in the national debate in the UK. Q: What are the changes since 1973 that led to the UK leaving the EU? Barnier says the UK joined the EEC mainly for trade reasons. But for Europeans, the EU is more than a supermarket, or a free trade zone. It has become an economic ecosystem. And that is why China and the US respect the EU, he says. That is why the EU will never let it unravel. He says there are specific British reasons for Brexit. But there are common popular views. There are many British regions where was is behind Brexit is \u201csocial anger\u201d, and the feeling that the EU does not protect people. Politicians must take the time to listen, to understand and to respond, he says. He says it is too late to do this in Britain, but not elsewhere. And he says you should not confuse this popular sentiment with populism. Populism used this sentiment, he says. And he says there are answers to people\u2019s concerns. Q: How will the EU make up for the loss of the UK\u2019s contribution? Barnier says the UK has been a net contributor to the EU budget. The loss amounts to 1% of the EU\u2019s GDP, he says. But he says there is a huge and very difficult debate about the budget. This debate has never been easier, but it has been made harder by the departure of the UK. The gap amounts to \u20ac10bn. Barnier says the negotiation with the UK starts on Monday. He says the EU has been listening to ministerial declarations from the UK, and it has seen distancing from the withdrawal agreement. The EU wants the text of that agreement implemented to the letter. Barnier says the UK is insisting a lot on its own sovereignty. He says nobody contests this. The EU respects the UK\u2019s sovereignty, he says. But it is not just a matter of sovereignty; it is a matter of pragmatism too. From January 2021 there will be changes in many areas, he says. He says the more the UK seeks to distance itself from the common rules established over years, the more the relationship will be separate, sector by sector. He says the EU is not proposing that the UK loses control; it is offering the UK to use its sovereignty for mutual advantage. The UK is leaving 600 international agreements by virtue of Brexit, he says. This will have consequences from 2021, even if there is a deal. He says he has three examples. First, from 1 January 2021 there will be checks and controls on all UK goods entering the single market, as with any third country. This will apply even if there is a deal. He says this will involve attention being paid to rules of origin. The EU loves \u201cmade in Britain\u201d, he says. But it will want to know these goods are made in Britain. Britain cannot just become an assembly hub. Second, from January 2021 UK financial services firms will lose the financial passport. They will not be able to offer services in all EU states based on being British. He says they might have to establish themselves in an EU country. In some sectors the EU will grant equivalences, where it is in the EU\u2019s interest. But they will \u201cnever be global and permanent\u201d, and never be subject to joint management with the EU, he says. As a former financial services commissioner, Barnier says the EU cannot allow the UK to keep profits, while the EU takes on the risk. The EU must take responsibility for its financial supervision, and financial responsibility. Third, on goods, Barnier says the UK will not be able to grant market authorisations for things like cars and pharmaceuticals for the EU market. This function must be carried out in the EU, he says. Barnier has now switched to speaking in English. He says trade is about more than boosting economic performance. It is also about maintaining and promoting high standards, he says. He says the EU has heard Boris Johnson\u2019s assurances about planning to never engage in a race to the bottom. Johnson says he has higher standards, he says. And Barnier says he believes Johnson on this. He says that means it should be possible for the two sides to agree on ground rules. The UK wants to be sovereign, Barnier says. He says the EU accepts that. But he says trade deals are about opening up markets. There is no single template that could apply for a trade deal with the UK, he says. He says the UK says it wants a Canada-style deal. \u201cBut the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada,\u201d he says. He says you can fly from Brussels to London in 70 minutes. The flight to Ottawa takes more than 10 hours, he says. And he says trade with the UK is worth more than 10 times more than trade with Canada. He says because the UK is on the EU\u2019s doorstep, the EU will insist on a level playing field. Competition must be free and fair, he says. That is why they want level playing field provisions, he says, covering state aid, environmental protection, climate change, social and labour rights and taxation. Barnier says the EU had a complex negotiation with Boris Johnson to ensure no return of a hard border in Ireland. The UK has now left. But a transitional period applies, he says. Boris Johnson has said \u201cagain and again\u201d that he will not request an extension to the transition, Barnier says. So both sides have to make the best use of the limited time available. The withdrawal agreement must be implemented, he says. He says this is a matter of trust. Barnier is recalling the referendum held in France in the early 1970s to decide whether Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway should be allowed to join what was then the EEC. He says he voted yes, even though he was a Gaullist and General de Gaulle was opposed. He says an interviewer recently asked why he was negotiating a new Brexit agreement, when he had already spent three years negotiating Brexit. Brexit is a divorce, he says. And all divorces have consequences. These consequences were poorly explained, he says. He says no one has been able to show him the added value of Brexit, even Nigel Farage. But where the risk is the highest is in Ireland, he says. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking now. The event he is attending is mainly about the European green deal, but the chair said that Barnier would be talking about the Brexit negotiations. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is giving a speech in the chamber of the European parliament this afternoon for an event run by the ESCP Business School. There is a live feed here. Barnier is one of several speakers, but I will cover what he says in detail when he starts. Here is the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush on Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation statement. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has described Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation statement (see 1.37pm) as an attempt by Javid to position himself as the leader of a Thatcherite Tory faction fighting for low taxation. In a statement McDonnell said: Sajid Javid\u2019s statement is not only a damning attack on Dominic Cummings\u2019 dominance of the Johnson administration but also an unashamed leadership bid to the group of Thatcherite backbenchers committed to resisting tax rises for the wealthiest and big business. Choppy waters are ahead for Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson. Here are the key points from Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation statement. It was not a Geoffrey Howe-style sabotage mission by any stretch of the imagination, and the tone of his remarks \u2013 and of Boris Johnson\u2019s response \u2013 implied that a return to government at some point in the future may well be an option. But Javid did deliver two messages that sounded like polite but firm warnings about the direction in which Johnson is leading his government. Javid said Johnson should not try to stop his ministers \u201cspeaking truth to power\u201d. Javid resigned in the reshuffle because Johnson said he could only stay at the Treasury if he agreed to sack some of his advisers and replace them with officials jointly appointed by No 10. Javid said he thought that was unreasonable. He said: It has always been the case that advisers advise, minsters decide and minsters decide on their advisers. I couldn\u2019t see why the Treasury, with the vital role that it plays, should be the exception to that. More importantly, Javid suggested that Johnson would not be able to govern properly if he was not exposed to independent advice from his ministers. He said: A chancellor, like all cabinet ministers, has to be able to give candid advice so he is speaking truth to power. I believe that the arrangement proposed would significantly inhibit that and it would not have been in the national interest. So while I was grateful for the continued trust of the prime minister in wanting to reappoint me, I am afraid that these were conditions that I could not accept in good conscience. Javid made it clear that he held Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, responsible for what happened. He made this point by means of a joke. He said: Now I don\u2019t intend to dwell further on all the details and the personalities ... the Cummings and goings if you will. Perhaps that line also contains a hint that Javid was expressing a hope that Cummings himself would be going quite soon. Javid backed Rishi Sunak, his successor. He said: I very much hope that the new chancellor will be given space to do his job without fear or favour. And I know that [Sunak] is more than capable of rising to the challenge. On the day of his resignation Javid said that \u201cany self-respecting minister\u201d would reject the conditions imposed by Johnson, implying that Sunak was not a self-respecting minister. Javid did not use the same line today, and his complimentary comments about Sunak sounded genuine. Javid said it would be a mistake for Johnson to water down the commitments given in the Tory manifesto about reducing the national debt. He said: The prime minister has won a huge mandate to transform our country and already he is off to a great start - ending the parliamentary paralysis, defeating the radical left, getting Brexit done, a points-based immigration system and an infrastructure revolution. We need a resolute focus on long-term outcomes and delivery, not short-term headlines. The Treasury as an institution, as an economic ministry should be the engine that drives this new agenda. But the Treasury must also be allowed to play its role as a finance ministry with the strength and credibility that it requires. You see, I\u2019m a proud, low-tax Conservative and I always will be. Already our tax burden is the highest it has been in 50 years. It is fair to say not everyone at the centre of government always feels the pressure to balance the books. It was ever thus. But the Treasury has a job to do. It is the only tax-cutting ministry. Every other department has an in-built incentive to seek and to spend ever more money ... At a time when we need to do much to level up across generations it would not be right to pass the bill for our day-to-day consumption to our children and grandchildren. And unlike the US, we don\u2019t have the fiscal flexibility that comes with a reserve currency, so that\u2019s why the fiscal rules that we are elected on are critical. To govern is to choose, and these rules crystallise the choices that are required to keep spending under control, to keep taxes low, to root out waste and to pass that fitness test that was rightfully set in stone in our manifesto on debt being lower at the end of the parliament. This passage was a reference to speculation that Johnson and his new chancellor may abandon the fiscal rules announced by Javid during the general election. The Tory manifesto specifically said that under the Conservatives \u201cdebt will be lower at the end of the parliament \u2013 rather than spiralling out of control under Labour.\u201d Hancock is now responding to Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. Hancock thanks Ashworth, and other MPs, for taking a responsible and proportionate approach. There are plans in place in case of the virus becoming pandemic, he says. But he says the government is still working on the basis of plans to contain the virus. He says people should only travel to the quarantined areas in Italy if their travel is essential. He says it is important that the government is not advising the blanket closure of schools. Testing sites are available at all A&amp;E facilities in England, he says, but the NHS also wants to introduce home testing for the virus. That will allow the government to roll out testing for a much wider group of people, he says. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a Commons statement now on coronavirus. He says there have been 13 cases of the virus in the UK. Eight of those people have been discharged, he says. But the government expects more cases to arise, he says. He says the government has a four-point strategy for dealing with this: contain, delay, research and mitigate. He says the government will be rolling out a publicity campaign soon. Yesterday advice for travellers coming back to the UK from northern Italy and some other countries was published. He says the government is coordinating with its international partners to ensure it is ready for all eventualities. Boris Johnson, intervening on a point of order, thanks Javid for his contribution and says Javid should know \u201che has friends and admirers\u201d on all sides of the Commons. Javid says he is a proud low-tax Conservative. But the tax burden is the highest it has been for 50 years. Not everyone in government is committed to keeping taxes down, he says. He says the Treasury is the only tax-cutting department in government. He says the government should not pass down debt to our grandchildren. And he says, unlike the US, the UK does not have a reserve currency. He says that is why he supports the rule that debt should be falling by the end of this parliament. The Tories have the chance to implement wholesale renewal, he says. And they can put social justice at the heart of a more human capitalism. He says the PM has the tenacity to see this through. Boris Johnson has his full support, he says. Javid says he wants to explain why he resigned. He thanks MPs who have supported him, and he thanks his family. He came into politics to give something back, he says. He says he hopes he has more to contribute to public life. He ran four departments, he says. Each taught him something. He never took a decision that he did not think to be in the national interest, he says. He says this country is strong because of its institutions. Conservatives believe that no one person has a monopoly on good ideas, he says. He says there is no one model for the No 10/No 11 relationship. That relationship should depend on \u201cmutual trust\u201d, he says. It should be the case that \u201cadvisers advise, ministers decide, and ministers decide on their advisers\u201d. He says the chancellor must be able to give candid advice to the PM, and to \u201cspeak truth unto power\u201d. He says he could not stay as chancellor because the conditions imposed by the PM would not make this possible. He will not dwell any more on this \u2013 on \u201cthe Cummings and goings, if you will\u201d, he jokes. He says the new chancellor must be allowed to do his job. Rishi Sunak is capable of rising to the challenge, he says. Sajid Javid says it is eight years since he last spoke as a backbencher. He is proud to represent the people of Bromsgrove, he says. And he will champion the causes he believes in most - but from outside government. He says he had hoped to stay in government longer. Labour\u2019s Ian Mearns asks about the Marmot report and health inequalities affecting Gateshead. What will the PM do to ensure that people in Gateshead can live as long as people in Johnson\u2019s constituency? Johnson says he has enormous respect for Prof Marmot. He worked with him as London mayor. But there is more to be done, he says. That is why the government believes in levelling up. Daniel Kawczynski, a Conservative, asks about flooding in Shrewsbury. Johnson says the environment department will do what is necessary. The SNP\u2019s David Linden asks about religious intolerance in India. Will the PM meet him to discuss this? Johnson says this is a crucial issue. He is particularly keen to defend religious freedom, and to protect those of a Christian faith. Marco Longhi, a Conservative, asks about plans for a university campus in Dudley. Johnson says he will look at this. Labour\u2019s Gerald Jones asks whether the PM will give Wales the funding it needs to recover from flooding. Johnson says this is a devolved matter. But the government will work flat-out to make sure Wales gets the cash it needs. Theresa Villiers, the former environment secretary, asks the PM to resist the selling-out of fishing communities. Johnson says he \u201cwill indeed\u201d. He says the SNP would hand back control of fishing to Brussels. Boris Johnson was able to rouse a cheer from the Tory benches with his final answer to Jeremy Corbyn, which involved a rumbustious but badly aimed rant about Labour (no one in the opposition is arguing for the UK to rejoin the EU), but it could not disguise the fact that by then he had been comprehensively clobbered over his decision to go Awol last week when the country was under water. Corbyn was not especially witty or forensic, but he was saying what many people think (which is enough) and his comments about Johnson being a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d and only \u201cpretending to care\u201d will register. No 10 types have been briefing that the row about the PM\u2019s extended absence last week was a Westminster bubble controversy that does not matter to voters. But that\u2019s the sort of thing spin doctors always say when they are on the defensive, and it does not sound very plausible. Next time flooding strikes I expect Johnson will be searching for his wellies ... Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says immigration is crucial for the Scottish economy. The Scottish government\u2019s plans for a Scottish visa system have been welcomed by business and even Scottish Tories. Does the PM accept it was a mistake to reject the plan? Johnson says this idea was rejected by the migration advisory committee. He says under the government\u2019s plan, firms will be able to get the workers they need. Blackford says the PM is \u201cdelusional\u201d. He says the care sector will suffer, the GMB union says firms could be tipped over the edge, and the Scottish Tourism Alliance says the immigration plans will be devastating for the sector. Do Scottish businesses matter? Of course Scottish businesses matter, says Johnson. He says SNP plans for tax rises would penalise them. Corbyn says he has learned a lot from visiting victims of flooding. The PM should try it. He says people cannot get insurance. Isn\u2019t it time the PM found an urgent solution to this problem? Just imagine what it must be like. People are looking to the government for help. Johnson says there are problems with insurance. But the government scheme has helped many households. He says he is looking at what can be done to protect homes that cannot get insurance. He says any government led by Corbyn would not be able to help. Corbyn says the Welsh Labour government has done what it can. He says Johnson often goes Awol. He was on holiday when the London riots happened, he was away when the Iranian general was assassinated, and he was away last week. He says Johnson is a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d. Last night Johnson was schmoozing Tory donors instead of helping flood victims. Johnson says the government has stopped the early release of terrorists, and it is hiring more police officers. He says it can do this because it has a strong economy. The opposition is jabbering away because they cannot decide whether they want to be in the EU. The hottest topic in Labour is what job Corbyn should have in the shadow cabinet. The government is delivering on the people\u2019s communities, he says. Corbyn says no Cobra has been called. Is Johnson just \u201cpretending to care\u201d? Johnson says there has been a stream of ministerial meetings. He says he has been directing things. He says Cobra is Cabinet Office briefing room A. It is not the only place where meetings can take place. Corbyn says people need help, not \u201ctrite answers like that\u201d. Does Johnson agree with the Tory MP Philip Davies who says the government has done little to protect people from floods. Johnson says the government is doing a lot to protect homes. Jeremy Corbyn says his thoughts are with those suffering from coronavirus. He says he hopes the health services will get the resources they need. He pays tribute to the work of those helping flooding victims. Does the PM agree with the Conservative leader of Derbyshire county council that he has turned his back on flooding victims? Johnson says the government has been working to ensure the victims get the help they need. Corbyn quotes the Tory council leader. He says he visited flood victims. But the PM was silent, sulking in his grace and favour mansion at Chevening. When will the PM stop hiding and show he cares? Or is he too busy doing something else? If he is, he could send Dominic Cummings. Johnson says there has been \u201ca constant stream of ministerial activity\u201d on this. He says 200,000 households have been protected from flooding by government measures. Philip Dunne, a Conservative, says Storm Dennis has brought record high water levels. Over 100 properties in his Ludlow constituency have been flooded. Will the government spend more on flood defences? Johnson says it will. The government is investing \u201cmassively\u201d in flood defences, he says. Boris Johnson starts by expressing condolences to the family and friends of those killed in the recent storms. According to the Evening Standard, Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation speech will be \u201cdramatic\u201d. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Labour is demanding an investigation into claims that the level of rough sleeping in England is five times as high as official figures say. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, has been prompted to act by this BBC story, which is based on freedom of information requests to councils. The BBC says: More than 28,000 people in the UK were recorded sleeping rough in 12 months, research by the BBC has suggested. In England five times as many rough sleepers were seen by councils in the year than reported in official figures, which are a one-night snapshot ... New official figures will be released on Thursday but the data for 2018 showed 4,677 people slept rough in England on the one night the snapshot survey was taken, down 2% on the year before but 165% up on 2010. However council responses to the BBC showed nearly 25,000 people were recorded sleeping rough at least once in England during the latest year on record. Healey has asked the UK Statistics Authority to investigate. In a letter to Sir David Norgrove, its chair, he says: The government\u2019s own figures, as published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in the latest publication \u2018Rough Sleeping Statistics: Autumn 2018, England\u2019, declare that the total number of people counted or estimated to be sleeping rough was just 4,677. You\u2019ll be aware that this data is gathered each year on a single night in the autumn. In light of the new figures published today, it is clear that the use of the government\u2019s own figures as the sole official measure of rough sleeping is seriously misleading as it dramatically undercounts the number of people sleeping rough. You will know the longstanding concern about the government\u2019s rough sleeping statistics, including from expert organisations and charities. For example, in 2018 the charity Crisis commissioned research which calculated that the number of people sleeping rough in England is more than double what government statistics suggest. The UKSA\u2019s own work in this area confirmed in 2015 that these rough sleeping statistics do not meet the standards required of national statistics \u2013 trustworthiness, quality and value. The government\u2019s rough sleeping statistics are the sole statistics produced by government on rough sleeping so they are naturally and inevitably assumed by the public to be an accurate portrayal of the scale of rough sleeping. This is clearly not the case, as the statistics are an unreliable undercount and are an unsound basis for public policy-making or debate. I would be grateful if you would investigate the flaws in these figures and how the government\u2019s statistics could be improved so they better capture the level of rough sleeping in our country. Sajid Javid is expected to make a statement to MPs following his resignation as chancellor, and it is likely to come just after PMQs, according to Labour whips. By convention ministers who resign from cabinet are allowed to make statements to the Commons. In the past some of these interventions (eg, Geoffrey Howe\u2019s) have been devastating, but mostly ex-ministers tend not to make these resignation statements now and, when they do, their content tends to be quite measured. According to Politico, Javid plans to be \u201cconstructive and positive\u201d. George Eustice, the environment secretary, held a press conference at the National Farmers\u2019 Union conference in Birmingham where he was speaking this morning. As ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt reports, Eustice defended the PM\u2019s decision not to visit areas recently flooded, even though he did visit flood victims during the general election campaign last year. Eustice said the PM felt he had to get involved last year because the purdah period in force during the election meant that, without his intervention, Whitehall was slow to get a grip on the crisis. Turning back to the budget, here are three related stories from today\u2019s papers. Christopher Hope in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) says 18 Conservative MPs from the party\u2019s blue collar group have written to the chancellor expressing concern about reports that fuel duty could rise. Hope says: Eighteen MPs from the blue collar group of Conservative MPs caucus \u2013 14 of whom were elected for the first time in 2019 in north and Midlands of England \u2013 wrote to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d the fuel duty freeze will be scrapped. A small increase would raise an extra \u00a34bn worth of funding for the Treasury. Fuel duty could rise by up to two pence which will see overall petrol and diesel costs increase, according to reports. However in the letter the group says: \u201cWe are writing to express our deep concern following reports that you are considering scrapping the fuel duty freeze at this year\u2019s budget. \u201cIf the decision was taken to raise taxes on fuel, hard-working people and businesses in blue-collar communities \u2013 many of which lent us their support at the general election for the first time in generations \u2013 will suffer.\u201d Francis Elliott and Steven Swinford in the Times (paywall) say the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to cut subsidies for a type of diesel used by off-road vehicles and machinery instead of ending the fuel duty freeze. They say: The chancellor is shifting more of the cost of meeting climate change targets from consumers to business as he finalises the budget, say allies. They suggest that he is cooling on ending the 10-year freeze on fuel duty amid a mounting backlash from Tory MPs. Instead, he is preparing new environmental taxes, including heavy restrictions on the use of so-called red diesel. Matt Dathan in the Sun says Sunak is considering raising almost \u00a31bn by closing two inheritance tax loopholes. He says: The Sun understands the chancellor is mulling closing two tax reliefs rich families use to funnel money through ghost companies and farmland before they die. Rich Brits cut down the amount of inheritance tax they have to pay by setting up a business or buying land, which can be passed on to their family after death. Agricultural relief and business property relief can protect between 50% and 100% of money invested from inheritance tax. Ending business relief would raise the Treasury an estimated \u00a3480m a year and stopping agricultural relief would bring in \u00a3320m. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is making a Commons statement on coronavirus after 12.30pm. Here is Jack Blanchard\u2019s take on Sir Keir Starmer getting Sadiq Khan\u2019s endorsement from the London Playbook briefing. It\u2019s a big boost for Starmer\u2019s campaign, though probably comes as no great surprise to Labour Kremlinologists, given Khan and Starmer are both London-based lawyers with closely aligned political outlooks, and actually go back years (Khan used to brief Starmer when he was a human rights solicitor). But a public endorsement from Labour\u2019s most powerful elected politician will nevertheless give further credence to Starmer\u2019s status as the clear frontrunner. And Sir Keir Starmer has responded to the news he has been endorsed by Sadiq Khan. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has announced that he is voting for Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, for Labour leader. Kit Malthouse, the minister for the police, has been giving interviews this morning. Here are three of the lines that emerged. Malthouse played down reports that his boss, the home secretary, Priti Patel, bullied civil servants. Asked whether she was a bully, he replied: I haven\u2019t witnessed any of that. To be honest with you, I\u2019m totally focused on crime. Everybody in the Home Office is focused on that, rather than on the sort of soap opera, I\u2019m afraid. He claimed there was no longer a rift between Patel and Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office permanent secretary whom Patel was reportedly trying to remove. Asked about this, Malthouse said: [Rutnam] and the home secretary have put out a joint statement showing, I think, glutinous harmony, as the prime minister would call it. Hopefully now we can get on with the mission. Malthouse said it was up to the House of Lords to decide whether Tom Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, was fit to receive a peerage in the light of the role he played in publicising false claims about Westminster figures being involved in child abuse. Asked whether Watson should go to the Lords, Malthouse said: There is a process of the House of Lords now that is independent that will have a look at whether he should or he shouldn\u2019t, as it would with all nominees. I don\u2019t really want to interfere with that. Jeremy Corbyn has reportedly nominated Watson for a peerage in the forthcoming dissolution honours. On universal credit, Paul Johnson says some people will gain a lot, and some people will lose a lot. Some of the cuts are still working their way through the system, he says. Q: Where will the money come from? Johnson says there has been talk of cutting pension tax relief for high-earners. But this will hit people earning between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000 \u2013 exactly the group that Boris Johnson promised to help when he was standing for Tory leader, Johnson says. He says council tax could be reformed to raise tax on higher-value properties. And he suggests that the entrepreneurs\u2019 tax relief could go. Only a small number of people benefit from it, he says. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is now being interviewed on Sky\u2019s All Out Politics about the IFS budget assessment out today. (See 9.09am.) He says this could be \u201ca really big moment\u201d for the British economy. Last year was the first year without a budget since the 1800s. And previous budgets were minor, because the government did not have a proper majority. So this will be the first major budget for years, he says. He makes the IFS point about the government having to choose between raising taxes, continuing with austerity, or breaking its rules on borrowing. He says, outside of infrastructure, the government did not make many promises on spending in the Conservative manifesto. But reversing the cuts of the last 10 years would be very expensive, he says. He says we will see in the budget whether the government is serious about reversing those cuts. Boris Johnson replaced his chancellor in the reshuffle two weeks ago but changing the underlying economic outlook facing the country is not so straightforward and, as the Institute of Fiscal Studies points out in an analysis today, the government faces difficult choices in the budget. \u201cRaise taxes, entrench austerity or break a fiscal rule,\u201d as the IFS puts it in the headline of its press release. Theoretically, the government could opt for all three. My colleague Richard Partington has written up the IFS\u2019s assessment here. The IFS analysis also illustrates quite how severe the cuts to public spending have been over the past decade. It says that day-to-day non-NHS public spending per head is 26% lower than it was at its peak in 2010, and that welfare cuts currently in the pipeline are set to take colossal sums away from some low-income families. Here is an extract (bold type from the IFS original). Outside of health, day-to-day public service spending per person remains 26% below its 2010 peak. \u00a354bn would be required just to return to real 2010 levels. No department will see cuts in 2020\u201321. Beyond that there are commitments to increase spending on the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid. Simply to avoid any further real-terms cuts elsewhere over the following three years the chancellor would need to find an additional \u00a33bn by 2023\u201324. Maintaining spending on unprotected services as a share of national income would require an additional \u00a36.5bn. This would still leave cuts to means-tested support for low-income families with children slowly working their way through the system. The removal of an additional tax credit payment for the first child will eventually lead to around 3.2 million households getting \u00a3550 per year less than they would have received, while the two-child limit in means-tested benefits will eventually lead to around 750,000 households losing an average of \u00a33,600 per year. And this is what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is saying about the IFS analysis. This analysis shows the damage done by a decade of decline under Conservative governments, and the scale of investment needed even just to get back to 2010 spending levels. Ten years of Tory rule have brought 10 years of chaotic and erratic economic policy, with 16 fiscal targets proposed and ripped up and productivity growth plummeting. Despite all the hype about this budget turning a page, it risks setting in train five years of disappointment. Labour will continue to call for the fair taxation and investment needed to end austerity and tackle our social and climate emergencies. This may, or may not, come up at PMQs later. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies publishes its assessment of the options for next month\u2019s budget. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12.30pm: Sajid Javid is expected to make a statement to MPs following his resignation as chancellor. 2pm: Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, gives a speech in Brussels. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "body": "<p>I read your report (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/austerity-blamed-for-life-expectancy-stalling-for-first-time-in-century\" title=\"\">Austerity linked to stalling life expectancy</a>, 25 February) with interest but no surprise. Life in substandard, insecure accommodation, with insufficient money for basics, permanent indebtedness, going hungry to feed your children etc is bound to damage your health. There have been a succession of eminent reports saying the same thing over the last 40 years. In the late 70s a Labour government commissioned <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Report\" title=\"\">the Black report</a> to examine why, even with a free NHS, poorer people\u2019s lives were shorter than those of the wealthy.</p> <p>The report was ready as Margaret Thatcher came to power and only published on a bank holiday in 1980 with minimum publicity and a firm rejection of its findings and proposals by the government. Then there was the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-inquiry-into-inequalities-in-health-report\" title=\"\">Acheson report</a>, published in 1998. This did influence the new Labour government and for a brief time innovations such as the Sure Start programme, reasonable benefit levels (no cap, no bedroom tax, less inhumane fit-for-work tests), and less harsh tenancy rules helped support families, people with disabilities, older people and so on. Sadly, what headway was made has been thrown to the winds by successive Tory governments.</p> <p>Sir Michael Marmot adds to the weight of argument about the life-shortening effects of \u201cstraitened circumstances and poor life chances\u201d unsurprisingly linked to austerity. But now we have \u201clevelling up\u201d. Matt Hancock promises \u201cworld-leading plans to improve children\u2019s health\u201d. Has anyone seen details of these policies? I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re world-leading or not; I\u2019d just be grateful if they got the job done \u2013 at last.<br><strong>Susan Hofsteede</strong><br><em>Bangor, Gwynedd </em></p> <p>\u2022 Sir Michael Marmot reminds us that healthy lives depend on a number of factors, including \u201cearly child development, education \u2026adequate income and a healthy and sustainable community\u201d. As chair of governors of an inner-city primary school and children\u2019s centre in a disadvantaged area, I commend staff\u2019s work against the effects of austerity, adding a food bank, a clothing bank, subsidised fruit and vegetables and a major holiday feeding programme to their catalogue of support for families.</p> <p>Our pupil population hasn\u2019t changed, but we are deeply conscious of the pernicious effects of changes to benefits and specifically the rollout of universal credit and the lowered threshold for entitlement to free school meals (FSM), from about \u00a316,000 a year to under \u00a38,000, affecting mostly the working poor. Our FSM figures have fallen from 75% to 55% in two years. For our reception intake of 54 children in September, the figure is 16%. The impact on pupil premium funding, based as it is on historical FSM figures, will be deep and lasting, and pupils will be doubly disadvantaged.</p> <p>Marmot reports the deepest funding cuts falling on the most deprived local authorities such as Liverpool. The school feels the effects of those cuts particularly in support for special educational needs and support from social services. Liverpool has, miraculously, managed to preserve its children\u2019s centres, but we fear for the future. We need more research evidence of this quality to argue for our children, families and communities. <br><strong>John Murphy</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 You quote Ian Hudspeth, chair of the LGA\u2019s community wellbeing board, as saying \u201ccouncils want to work with government on closing this gap [in life expectancy] by focusing on the social causes of ill-health, such as early years development\u201d.</p> <p>Mr Hudspeth should know all about these social causes and arguably contributed to them. As leader of Oxfordshire county council, he oversaw the closure in 2016 of virtually all of the county\u2019s 44 Sure Start children\u2019s centres. They offered free stay-and-play facilities for pre-school children, skilled support for disadvantaged families in difficulty, a non-judgmental venue for meeting and sharing experiences with other families, and parenting guidance free of the stigma for many families associated with statutory social intervention. Children\u2019s centres undoubtedly helped to \u201cnarrow the gap\u201d for the most disadvantaged children across the country, yet Conservative-led Oxfordshire was among the first shire councils in England to close its children\u2019s centres as a cost-cutting measure, in defiance of government statutory guidance at the time and vigorous local opposition.</p> <p>I wish a reformed Mr Hudspeth better luck in working with the Johnson government to tackle these social causes than he had with the May one, but I\u2019m not holding my breath.<br><strong>Robin Gill</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 Michael Marmot authoritatively documents the human costs of the lost decade since the financial crisis, especially for poorer women and children. Most countries of Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa suffered worse for most of a 20-year period, from 1980 to 2000.</p> <p>In the name of austerity policies to tackle debt, incomes often fell, education and health worsened, GNP per capita sharply slowed in Latin America and fell seriously in SSA. As a Unicef report showed, a reverse shock-absorber effect was operating. The poorest countries generally suffered most and, within them, the poorest families and, within them, the women and children \u2013 a truly negative multiplier. The British government could and should have learned from this experience. Let\u2019s hope they now will \u2013 but it will take the adoption of clearer human objectives, new policies, regular monitoring and a shift of focus from GNP growth to human development. <br><strong>Sir Richard Jolly</strong><br><em>Institute of Development Studies</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

      "bodyText": "I read your report (Austerity linked to stalling life expectancy, 25 February) with interest but no surprise. Life in substandard, insecure accommodation, with insufficient money for basics, permanent indebtedness, going hungry to feed your children etc is bound to damage your health. There have been a succession of eminent reports saying the same thing over the last 40 years. In the late 70s a Labour government commissioned the Black report to examine why, even with a free NHS, poorer people\u2019s lives were shorter than those of the wealthy. The report was ready as Margaret Thatcher came to power and only published on a bank holiday in 1980 with minimum publicity and a firm rejection of its findings and proposals by the government. Then there was the Acheson report, published in 1998. This did influence the new Labour government and for a brief time innovations such as the Sure Start programme, reasonable benefit levels (no cap, no bedroom tax, less inhumane fit-for-work tests), and less harsh tenancy rules helped support families, people with disabilities, older people and so on. Sadly, what headway was made has been thrown to the winds by successive Tory governments. Sir Michael Marmot adds to the weight of argument about the life-shortening effects of \u201cstraitened circumstances and poor life chances\u201d unsurprisingly linked to austerity. But now we have \u201clevelling up\u201d. Matt Hancock promises \u201cworld-leading plans to improve children\u2019s health\u201d. Has anyone seen details of these policies? I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re world-leading or not; I\u2019d just be grateful if they got the job done \u2013 at last. Susan Hofsteede Bangor, Gwynedd \u2022 Sir Michael Marmot reminds us that healthy lives depend on a number of factors, including \u201cearly child development, education \u2026adequate income and a healthy and sustainable community\u201d. As chair of governors of an inner-city primary school and children\u2019s centre in a disadvantaged area, I commend staff\u2019s work against the effects of austerity, adding a food bank, a clothing bank, subsidised fruit and vegetables and a major holiday feeding programme to their catalogue of support for families. Our pupil population hasn\u2019t changed, but we are deeply conscious of the pernicious effects of changes to benefits and specifically the rollout of universal credit and the lowered threshold for entitlement to free school meals (FSM), from about \u00a316,000 a year to under \u00a38,000, affecting mostly the working poor. Our FSM figures have fallen from 75% to 55% in two years. For our reception intake of 54 children in September, the figure is 16%. The impact on pupil premium funding, based as it is on historical FSM figures, will be deep and lasting, and pupils will be doubly disadvantaged. Marmot reports the deepest funding cuts falling on the most deprived local authorities such as Liverpool. The school feels the effects of those cuts particularly in support for special educational needs and support from social services. Liverpool has, miraculously, managed to preserve its children\u2019s centres, but we fear for the future. We need more research evidence of this quality to argue for our children, families and communities. John Murphy Liverpool \u2022 You quote Ian Hudspeth, chair of the LGA\u2019s community wellbeing board, as saying \u201ccouncils want to work with government on closing this gap [in life expectancy] by focusing on the social causes of ill-health, such as early years development\u201d. Mr Hudspeth should know all about these social causes and arguably contributed to them. As leader of Oxfordshire county council, he oversaw the closure in 2016 of virtually all of the county\u2019s 44 Sure Start children\u2019s centres. They offered free stay-and-play facilities for pre-school children, skilled support for disadvantaged families in difficulty, a non-judgmental venue for meeting and sharing experiences with other families, and parenting guidance free of the stigma for many families associated with statutory social intervention. Children\u2019s centres undoubtedly helped to \u201cnarrow the gap\u201d for the most disadvantaged children across the country, yet Conservative-led Oxfordshire was among the first shire councils in England to close its children\u2019s centres as a cost-cutting measure, in defiance of government statutory guidance at the time and vigorous local opposition. I wish a reformed Mr Hudspeth better luck in working with the Johnson government to tackle these social causes than he had with the May one, but I\u2019m not holding my breath. Robin Gill Oxford \u2022 Michael Marmot authoritatively documents the human costs of the lost decade since the financial crisis, especially for poorer women and children. Most countries of Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa suffered worse for most of a 20-year period, from 1980 to 2000. In the name of austerity policies to tackle debt, incomes often fell, education and health worsened, GNP per capita sharply slowed in Latin America and fell seriously in SSA. As a Unicef report showed, a reverse shock-absorber effect was operating. The poorest countries generally suffered most and, within them, the poorest families and, within them, the women and children \u2013 a truly negative multiplier. The British government could and should have learned from this experience. Let\u2019s hope they now will \u2013 but it will take the adoption of clearer human objectives, new policies, regular monitoring and a shift of focus from GNP growth to human development.

It was always a source of great pride and pleasure to be able to tell people: \u2018We publish Clive Cussler\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Born in Illinois in 1931, Cussler served in the US air force during the Korean war. Upon his return, he went into copywriting and advertising, becoming an award-winning producer of radio and television commercials. He began writing novels in 1965. The Mediterranean Caper, his first book starring his most famous creation, Dirk Pitt \u2013 a marine engineer, government agent and adventurer named after his then infant son \u2013 was published in 1973; Pitt would go on to star in 25 books.</p> <p>His other heroes included detective Isaac Bell, husband-and-wife treasure hunters Sam and Remi Fargo, and Juan Cabrillo, an ex-CIA agent who leads a mysterious maritime crew for hire called The Corporation.</p> <p>Frequently reimagining moments in history and myth, such as Abraham Lincoln being kidnapped instead of assassinated, or the existence of Atlantis, Cussler\u2019s adventures mostly revolved around villains and heroes racing to track down long-lost artifacts or secret locations, setting the stage for later writers such as James Patterson and Dan Brown.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, Cussler agreed to work with co-authors at the request of his US publisher Simon and Schuster, in order to publish more frequently; in 2017 alone, he published four novels. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn,\u201d he said in a 2015 interview, in reply to criticism of the move. \u201cI never had a highfalutin view of what I write. It\u2019s a job. I entertain my readers. I get up in the morning and I start typing \u2026 I want it to be easy to read. I\u2019m not writing exotic literature. I like snappy dialogue and short descriptions and lots of action.\u201d</p> <p>Cussler wrote himself and his loved ones into his novels. The author usually appeared as a helpful character who would give his hero some much-needed assistance or information, and whose identity was often not revealed until his protagonist mused over his strange name. His novel The Tombs sees a cameo from his first wife Barbara, while many significant events in his novels happened on his birthday, 15 July.</p> <p>An enthusiastic underwater explorer, Cussler also helped discover more than 60 shipwreck sites with his organisation the National Underwater and Marine Agency, named after the fictional agency that employs Pitt. Numa finds include the RMS Carpathia, one of the first ships to come to the aid of Titanic survivors and the HL Hunley, the first submarine to successfully sink an enemy vessel, from the American civil war.</p> <p>An avid car collector and scuba diver, Cussler continued to write until his death. In a 2015 interview with Publishers Weekly, he laughed at suggestions he would retire from either. \u201cHell, no. I\u2019m not quitting,\u201d he said, joking that \u201cthey may find me behind the computer, just bones and cobwebs.\u201d</p> <p>The unnamed, 15th book in his Oregon Files series is due to be published later this year.</p>",

On Twitter on Wednesday, Cussler\u2019s wife Janet announced that the author died on Monday. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I share the sad news that my husband Clive passed away Mon,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt has been a privilege to share in his life. I want to thank you his fans &amp; friends for all the support. He was the kindest most gentle man I ever met. I know, his adventures will continue.\u201d The cause of death was not announced. Rowland White, publishing director at Cussler\u2019s UK publisher Michael Joseph said it was \u201can honour\u201d to work with him. \u201cLike his legions of readers we will miss him and the wonderful entertainment he provided. It was always a source of great pride and pleasure to be able to tell people: \u2018We publish Clive Cussler\u2019,\u201d he said. Born in Illinois in 1931, Cussler served in the US air force during the Korean war. Upon his return, he went into copywriting and advertising, becoming an award-winning producer of radio and television commercials. He began writing novels in 1965. The Mediterranean Caper, his first book starring his most famous creation, Dirk Pitt \u2013 a marine engineer, government agent and adventurer named after his then infant son \u2013 was published in 1973; Pitt would go on to star in 25 books. His other heroes included detective Isaac Bell, husband-and-wife treasure hunters Sam and Remi Fargo, and Juan Cabrillo, an ex-CIA agent who leads a mysterious maritime crew for hire called The Corporation. Frequently reimagining moments in history and myth, such as Abraham Lincoln being kidnapped instead of assassinated, or the existence of Atlantis, Cussler\u2019s adventures mostly revolved around villains and heroes racing to track down long-lost artifacts or secret locations, setting the stage for later writers such as James Patterson and Dan Brown. In the early 2000s, Cussler agreed to work with co-authors at the request of his US publisher Simon and Schuster, in order to publish more frequently; in 2017 alone, he published four novels. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn,\u201d he said in a 2015 interview, in reply to criticism of the move. \u201cI never had a highfalutin view of what I write. It\u2019s a job. I entertain my readers. I get up in the morning and I start typing \u2026 I want it to be easy to read. I\u2019m not writing exotic literature. I like snappy dialogue and short descriptions and lots of action.\u201d Cussler wrote himself and his loved ones into his novels. The author usually appeared as a helpful character who would give his hero some much-needed assistance or information, and whose identity was often not revealed until his protagonist mused over his strange name. His novel The Tombs sees a cameo from his first wife Barbara, while many significant events in his novels happened on his birthday, 15 July. An enthusiastic underwater explorer, Cussler also helped discover more than 60 shipwreck sites with his organisation the National Underwater and Marine Agency, named after the fictional agency that employs Pitt. Numa finds include the RMS Carpathia, one of the first ships to come to the aid of Titanic survivors and the HL Hunley, the first submarine to successfully sink an enemy vessel, from the American civil war. An avid car collector and scuba diver, Cussler continued to write until his death. In a 2015 interview with Publishers Weekly, he laughed at suggestions he would retire from either. \u201cHell, no. I\u2019m not quitting,\u201d he said, joking that \u201cthey may find me behind the computer, just bones and cobwebs.\u201d The unnamed, 15th book in his Oregon Files series is due to be published later this year.",

The Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) was due to meet a government minister on Wednesday afternoon to discuss how the regulator, which was set up to extend the life of the North Sea, could play a part in tackling the climate crisis. Andy Samuel, the OGA\u2019s chief executive, told delegates at an industry conference that the watchdog was considering how it could help the UK meet its climate targets and would open a consultation on how to redefine the OGA\u2019s strategy within the coming months. \u201cWe will be discussing this with a minister this afternoon,\u201d he said. The overhaul follows a pledge by Ofgem, the energy regulator, to play a bigger role in helping to meet the government\u2019s climate targets, after coming under fire for failing to prioritise the climate emergency. The OGA was established five years ago by the government to extend the life of the North Sea, after the oil price crash cast doubt over the future of the UK\u2019s ageing oil basin. Since then, the statutory duty has raised questions over whether it is compatible with the government\u2019s commitment to tackling the climate crisis. The regulator\u2019s new strategy is expected to align its work safeguarding North Sea jobs and investment with the UK\u2019s legally binding ambition to cut carbon emissions virtually to zero by 2050. This is likely to pile pressure on North Sea firms to shrink their carbon footprints by reducing flaring and methane leaks, and even use renewable energy to run the rigs. The OGA is also likely to push for companies to collaborate on big investments in carbon capture technology and clean hydrogen production, which could help the UK meet its net zero targets. The strategy may also mean the North Sea produces fewer barrels of oil if companies shift their portfolios from oil towards gas in line with future demand forecasts. Bob Ward, a director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, welcomed the OGA\u2019s attempt to \u201creconcile the UK\u2019s target for net zero emissions by 2050 with its strategy for maximising economic recovery\u201d from the North Sea. \u201cIf the world is serious about achieving the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal, it should mean a global decline in demand for oil and gas.

      "body": "<p>Environmental campaigners have issued a legal case against the government to try to halt the release of more than 50m non-native game birds this summer, saying the birds could damage Britain\u2019s most important wildlife sites.</p> <p>Wild Justice, a campaign group led by the environmentalists Chris Packham, Mark Avery and Ruth Tingay, said the annual release of 47m pheasants and 10m red-legged partridges was \u201cunlawful\u201d without a proper assessment of the ecological impacts the animals have on protected areas.</p> <p>At their peak, these birds, mainly imported from France, Belgium, Spain and Poland, represent half of the UK\u2019s total bird biomass. Wild Justice lawyers have asked for a judicial review because they believe the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) could be in breach of the EU habitats directive by allowing the release of these birds in the countryside.</p> <p>Although game birds are not allowed to be directly released at Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), they are allowed to be released nearby. Wild Justice believes this indirectly affects rare and protected wildlife.</p> <p>Defra has three weeks from 24 February to file papers with the court. Then a judge will decide whether this issue should go to court and how long it should take.</p> <p>Avery said: \u201cPheasants go wherever they want. They turn up on nature reserves where they\u2019ve never been released \u2026 This is a very serious ecological assault on the countryside which government is failing to assess and regulate.\u201d</p> <p>Only 30% of recreational game birds are shot, killed and retrieved. The others die of other causes and provide winter food for scavengers such as foxes, carrion crows and rats, whose populations remain artificially high as a result. Conservationists are concerned that these scavengers will eat more vulnerable species such as curlews and lapwings nesting at nearby nature sites.</p> <p>Avery said: \u201cThese non-native game birds go around gobbling up insects, other invertebrates and even snakes and lizards, they peck at vegetation, their droppings fertilise sensitive habitats which no farmer would be allowed to fertilise, and they provide prey and carrion that swell the populations of predators that then go on to prey on other threatened species.\u201d</p> <p>Tingay described the lack of regulation on released game birds as staggering. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t seem to know or care how many are released each year and even the figure of 60m game birds may well be an underestimate.\u201d</p> <p>Defra has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/defra-review-release-game-birds-legal-threat\">previously acknowledged</a> that the release of game birds might require assessment and has pledged to review the way it measures the birds\u2019 impact. It said it would not carry out an assessment this year as it was neither \u201creasonable nor realistic to expect measures to be taken before summer/autumn 2020\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Wild Justice are calling for immediate action, however. Packham said: \u201cDefra has been dragging its feet on this issue since we first raised it. It is time to sort this out and Wild Justice is fully prepared for a court battle on behalf of UK wildlife.\u201d</p> <p>Defra declined to comment on the latest legal action, but said it was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defra-sets-out-review-into-releasing-gamebirds-on-protected-sites\">reviewing the number of game birds</a> released and their impact on protected sites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2e8c0591f38aecf9596c6196b1f7b4d6bd27743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2e8c0591f38aecf9596c6196b1f7b4d6bd27743/789_366_4275_2565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grey partridges (Perdix perdix).

      "bodyText": "Environmental campaigners have issued a legal case against the government to try to halt the release of more than 50m non-native game birds this summer, saying the birds could damage Britain\u2019s most important wildlife sites. Wild Justice, a campaign group led by the environmentalists Chris Packham, Mark Avery and Ruth Tingay, said the annual release of 47m pheasants and 10m red-legged partridges was \u201cunlawful\u201d without a proper assessment of the ecological impacts the animals have on protected areas. At their peak, these birds, mainly imported from France, Belgium, Spain and Poland, represent half of the UK\u2019s total bird biomass. Wild Justice lawyers have asked for a judicial review because they believe the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) could be in breach of the EU habitats directive by allowing the release of these birds in the countryside. Although game birds are not allowed to be directly released at Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), they are allowed to be released nearby. Wild Justice believes this indirectly affects rare and protected wildlife. Defra has three weeks from 24 February to file papers with the court. Then a judge will decide whether this issue should go to court and how long it should take. Avery said: \u201cPheasants go wherever they want. They turn up on nature reserves where they\u2019ve never been released \u2026 This is a very serious ecological assault on the countryside which government is failing to assess and regulate.\u201d Only 30% of recreational game birds are shot, killed and retrieved. The others die of other causes and provide winter food for scavengers such as foxes, carrion crows and rats, whose populations remain artificially high as a result. Conservationists are concerned that these scavengers will eat more vulnerable species such as curlews and lapwings nesting at nearby nature sites. Avery said: \u201cThese non-native game birds go around gobbling up insects, other invertebrates and even snakes and lizards, they peck at vegetation, their droppings fertilise sensitive habitats which no farmer would be allowed to fertilise, and they provide prey and carrion that swell the populations of predators that then go on to prey on other threatened species.\u201d Tingay described the lack of regulation on released game birds as staggering. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t seem to know or care how many are released each year and even the figure of 60m game birds may well be an underestimate.\u201d Defra has previously acknowledged that the release of game birds might require assessment and has pledged to review the way it measures the birds\u2019 impact. It said it would not carry out an assessment this year as it was neither \u201creasonable nor realistic to expect measures to be taken before summer/autumn 2020\u201d. Lawyers for Wild Justice are calling for immediate action, however. Packham said: \u201cDefra has been dragging its feet on this issue since we first raised it. It is time to sort this out and Wild Justice is fully prepared for a court battle on behalf of UK wildlife.\u201d Defra declined to comment on the latest legal action, but said it was reviewing the number of game birds released and their impact on protected sites. Alexander Lees, a senior lecturer in biodiversity working at Manchester Metropolitan University, said it was important to interrogate the ecological impacts of releasing large numbers of non-native birds. However, he said game management could benefit wildlife. Lees said: \u201cThe rapid rise in the number of pheasants and red-legged partridges released follows the collapse of populations of native lowland game birds like grey partridges \u2013 species decimated by agricultural intensification and habitat loss. If shooting interests can refocus on recovering populations of our native game species through habitat restoration \u2026 then they would find many more allies among conservationists.\u201d Until December, the UK government has to abide by the EU\u2019s habitat directive. \u201cWe are afraid that some of this protection will be diminished in the future [when the UK\u2019s Brexit transition period ends],\u201d he said. The conservationists\u2019 legal action follows a successful challenge made by the campaign group last year to get the government to reassess the \u201cgeneral licences\u201d system that allowed people to shoot \u201cpest species\u201d of birds.

      "bodyText": "BIG CUP, BIG BOTHER It\u2019s been a very disappointing week for English clubs in Big Cup. Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s dismantling at the hands of Bayern Munich on their own patch means that Johnny Foreigner has won three out of three against representatives of The Best League In The World\u2122 in first-leg games in the knockout stages, with our brave boys failing to score a goal between them across 270 minutes of football. After Tuesday night\u2019s humiliation, Chelsea medical staff prepared for a busy day spent untwisting the blood of Cesar Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso and Reece James, while Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard admitted his side have a long way to go before challenging the elite. \u201cIt was a harsh lesson, a reality for the players of the levels we want to get to,\u201d sighed Lampard, as a confused looking Ross Barkley wandered past seeming even more dazed than that time he got blindsided by a cowardly punch in a trendy Liverpool nightspot. \u201cThis is [Big Cup] football and we haven\u2019t been fighting in the knockout stages, getting through to the back-end of it, for some years and this is the reality of what it takes.\u201d And as somebody more clever than The Fiver once observed, reality is the leading cause of stress among those in touch with it. Of course not everyone is in touch with reality, as any number of tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists on the internet regularly go out of their way to prove. While The Fiver would like to be more specific about who we\u2019re talking about, we are unable to do so without receiving permission from fellow agenda-peddlers on the pertinent, increasingly well-documented and totally non-existent WhatsTok group. Tasked with restoring the honour of English clubs in Big Cup, Manchester City go into Wednesday\u2019s match against Real Madrid with no shortage of motivation to drive them on. Enraged by entirely accurate reports that their club has been handed a two-year Big Cup ban for breaking financial fair play rules, their fans are ready to stick it to Uefa, the media and everyone else who is out to do these humble underdogs down. Meanwhile, their double-denim players are fired up by the knowledge that this season could mark their last chance to participate in Big Cup until next season, when they may well have abandoned ship and gone to play for other European heavyweights. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Nick Ames from 5pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Braga 1-1 Rangers (agg: 3-4) in Big Vase, before Big Cup at 8pm and Real Madrid 2-1 Manchester City with Simon Burnton, plus Lyon 1-3 Juventus with Barry Glendenning. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019ve got no complaint at all about passion. I played like that, I manage like that, I like personality. I like character, I like a winning mentality and if there is an argument at full-time then it will boil down to the fact we didn\u2019t win the game\u201d \u2013 Cardiff City manager Neil Harris attempts to play down the altercation between Callum Paterson and Leandro Bacuna at full-time of Tuesday\u2019s 1-0 Championship defeat at home to Nottingham Forest.

And that work will be done.\u201d</p> <p>In response the company, which is part of Swiss conglomerate Nestl\u00e9 and advertises its coffee as ethically sourced, has launched a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d into its farms in Guatemala and suspended all purchases from the problem plantations.</p> <p>\u201cNespresso has zero tolerance of child labour,\u201d said Guillaume Le Cunff, the Nespresso CEO, in a statement. </p> <p>\u201cIt is unacceptable.

It has no place in our supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>Despite numerous corporate-led and third-party audit visits to Nespresso\u2019s coffee farms in Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Uganda and other supplying countries, only two cases of child labour were reported in 2019, according to Nespresso.

      "bodyText": "George Clooney has said he is \u201csurprised and saddened\u201d by the alleged discovery of child labour on farms used by coffee giant Nespresso, the brand for which he has long served as ambassador. The Oscar-winning actor and director, who during school holidays worked on his own family\u2019s tobacco farm in Kentucky, vowed that \u201cwork will be done\u201d to improve conditions after a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary, due to air next week, filmed children picking coffee beans and hauling sacks on six Guatemalan farms believed to supply Nespresso. \u201cHaving grown up working on a tobacco farm from the time I was 12, I\u2019m uniquely aware of the complex issues regarding farming and child labour,\u201d said Clooney in a statement. \u201cClearly this board and this company still have work to do. And that work will be done.\u201d In response the company, which is part of Swiss conglomerate Nestl\u00e9 and advertises its coffee as ethically sourced, has launched a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d into its farms in Guatemala and suspended all purchases from the problem plantations. \u201cNespresso has zero tolerance of child labour,\u201d said Guillaume Le Cunff, the Nespresso CEO, in a statement. \u201cIt is unacceptable. Where there are claims that our high standards are not met, we act immediately. \u201cAny issues we uncover will be dealt with diligently and firm action will be taken. We work with Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade International to reinforce good working practices and fair treatment of workers, including education on the dangers of child labour. \u201cWe will continue to do all we can to stamp child labour out. It has no place in our supply chain.\u201d Despite numerous corporate-led and third-party audit visits to Nespresso\u2019s coffee farms in Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Uganda and other supplying countries, only two cases of child labour were reported in 2019, according to Nespresso. Fifteen cases were reported over the past four years, although none of them were in Guatemala, and each one was \u201ceffectively resolved\u201d, the company said. However, Le Cunff admitted that its coffee suppliers are given \u201ca day or two days\u201d advanced notice when spot checks take place. In his statement, Clooney, who has been the public face of the coffee company for the past 14 years and sits on Nespresso\u2019s sustainability advisory board alongside the NGO Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade International, and the Fair Labour Association, said he was \u201cenormously proud of the success of [Nespresso\u2019s] efforts\u201d in \u201cimprov[ing] the lives and livelihoods of farmers all around the world\u201d. But he admitted that investigative journalism played an \u201cimperative\u201d role in pointing out Nespresso\u2019s failures and that more needed to be done to bring the company in line with its ethical standards. \u201cThe check and balance of good corporate responsibility lies not just with the company itself but also independent journalists like [Dispatches reporter Anthony] Barnett to hold everyone\u2019s promise to account.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s apparent endorsement of protests designed to cow Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions has sparked outrage across the political spectrum with one lawmaker warning of a return to the dark days of dictatorship if the demonstrations are not opposed. Hardcore supporters of Brazil\u2019s far-right president are planning nationwide protests on 15 March and have been flooding social media with propaganda videos and fliers attacking members of Congress \u2013 and even proposing a return to military rule under Bolsonaro. One advert for the #SomosTodosBolsonaro (We\u2019re all Bolsonaro) rallies urges Bolsonaristas to pile pressure on lawmakers by attending what it calls \u201cFuck You Day\u201d. Bolsonaro, a notorious admirer of authoritarian rulers such as the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, appeared to sanction the protests this week, sharing one such video with friends and associates on his personal WhatsApp account. In the video Bolsonaro followers are told: \u201cHe is fighting the corrupt and murderous left for us. He endures smears and lies because he\u2019s doing his best for us \u2026 Let\u2019s show that we support BOLSONARO and reject the enemies of Brazil.\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s promotion of the anti-democratic mobilization \u2013 which some suspect is designed to undermine or intimidate Congress ahead of a potential attempt to impeach him \u2013 sparked fury in a country that only emerged from two decades of dictatorship in 1985. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil\u2019s president from 1995 to 2002, said that if Bolsonaro was promoting protests against Brazilian democracy the country faced \u201can extremely serious institutional crisis\u201d. \u201cTo remain silent would be to concur,\u201d Cardoso tweeted. \u201cWe must shout while we still have a voice.\u201d Another former president, Bolsonaro\u2019s leftwing nemesis Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, urged citizens and politicians to take an urgent stance against the \u201cauthoritarian act\u201d. \u201cBolsonaro has never gotten on with democracy. He\u2019s a false patriot who is surrendering our sovereignty to the US and condemning the people to poverty,\u201d Lula tweeted. S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s rightwing governor, Jo\u00e3o Doria, denounced Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cdeplorable\u201d move: \u201cBrazil fought so hard to rescue its democracy. We must vehemently reject any act that disrespects this country\u2019s democratic institutions and pillars.\u201d Marcelo Freixo, a leftist politician from Rio de Janeiro, warned: \u201cThe last time they closed Congress we got 21 years of torture, rape, murder, squeezed wages, debt and a regime that broke the country. We will not allow a repeat of this tragedy.\u201d On Wednesday Bolsonaro \u2013 who is currently battling fresh revelations about his family\u2019s ties to a recently slain hitman \u2013 dismissed the criticism as an attempt to \u201cdisrupt the republic\u201d. His politician son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, further fanned the flames, tweeting: \u201cIf an H-bomb landed on congress do you really think the people would shed any tears?\u201d Vera Magalh\u00e3es, the journalist who first reported Bolsonaro\u2019s sharing of the video, said his latest attack on democracy was of \u201cunheard-of severity\u201d.

By turning in an incisive, honest, well-honed set, he could single-handedly reverse the tide of bad press. It has happened before: John Mulaney used The Comeback Kid to catapult himself from a failed sitcom star to the world\u2019s best standup; Aziz Ansari used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/20/aziz-ansari-netflix-special\">Right Now to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/20/aziz-ansari-netflix-special\">reset his career after allegations of sexual assault</a>; Patton Oswalt\u2019s Annihilation saw the comic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/10/patton-oswalt-bereavement-without-daughter-drinking-would-have-been-problem\">come to terms with the death of his wife</a> through pure catharsis. Alive From New York is the best chance that Davidson will ever have to reframe a narrative that he appears to be lumbered with.</p> <p>And in that regard, there is good news and bad news. The bad news is that this special just isn\u2019t that special. This is a loosely formed and oddly brief set, delivered to a crowd that is semi-appreciative at best.

We get a This Is What Drugs Are Like joke. We get a This Is What Babies Are Like joke. We get a This Is What Sex Is Like joke. They are punishingly rote and delivered without conviction. If the entire special was made up of moments like these, Alive From New York would be dead in the water.</p> <p>However, Davidson has one thing working for him, and he sporadically manages to harness it in a way that cuts through. It is that he is Pete Davidson and his experiences are not exactly common. When he uses this power for good \u2013 when he gives his life and career the sort of examination they deserve \u2013 the special picks up a handful of notches. His story about how Louis CK tried to get him fired from SNL, and his subsequent glee at CK\u2019s #MeToo revelations, has a focus that snowballs into some of the biggest laughs of the set. His stuff about his engagement to Grande, <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a21772250/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-penis/\">and her public description of his penis</a>, are intimate in a way that few other comedians would emulate.</p> <p>By the end of the special, when he\u2019s describing how his father died in 9/11, and how the stories told about his dad changed from childhood to adulthood, you\u2019re fully on Davidson\u2019s side.

      "bodyText": "If ever there was a time for Pete Davidson to release a career-defining standup special, it\u2019s now. Because, as things stand, Davidson\u2019s work as a writer and actor has been fully eclipsed by the fact that he is rarely out of the tabloids. You know about his endless high-profile romances, with figures such as Ariana Grande and Kate Beckinsale. You know about his struggles with mental health and substance abuse and self-harm. You know about his running battle with Saturday Night Live, the show he barely turns up for, openly wishes to leave and yet still inexplicably sticks with. You know the rumours about his penis that spawned the phrase \u201cbig dick energy\u201d. You know all this because Pete Davidson: The Walking Headline is much more interesting than Pete Davidson: The Man Who Tells Jokes for a Living. So Davidson\u2019s new Netflix special Alive From New York is a perfect way to redress the balance.

And these rules crystallise the choices that are required: to keep spending under control, to keep taxes low, to root out waste, and to pass the litmus test, rightly set in stone in our manifesto, of debt being lower at the end of the parliament.\u201d However, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman repeatedly refused to rule out changing the fiscal rules that Javid unveiled at the election. He would only say that the UK would \u201ccontinue to have a clear fiscal framework\u201d, giving a clear hint that borrowing rules could be loosened at the budget in defiance of Javid\u2019s warnings.",

The story of Jeanne Lanvin has recently lain dormant, however, after five years of creative and financial turmoil at a house that was once the pinnacle of Parisian fashion. The Lanvin brand\u2019s latest incarnation, under the French designer Bruno Sialelli, is starting to feel more solid, with a third confident collection delivered on the catwalk in Paris on Wednesday. A phalanx of bourgeoise ladies walked down the catwalk, an idea delivered with irony, with frilled rose pink dresses, pistachio argyle knits, sweeping camel coats, 1960s-style abbreviated button-down leather capes and neat double-breasted peacoats.

But we\u2019ve got to focus on this competition, then the league on Sunday [at Everton], then the FA Cup [at Derby].\u201d</p> <p>United are unbeaten in six matches and have won their past two league matches. \u201cYou need many, many attributes to play the perfect game or be the perfect team,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cWe want the swagger and confidence \u2013 not arrogance, but to be able to go out and believe in yourself. You\u2019ve got to work harder and earn the right to win.</p> <p>\u201cI played with Beckham, Giggs, and one of the biggest compliments we had, with a team full of quality, was that we worked harder than others. I want my team to be one of the hardestworking teams in the league. That\u2019s the attitude you need, that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d</p> <p>Solskj\u00e6r believes the requisite personality can be developed. \u201cThey can blossom more with confidence and by me speaking to them, managing them. As a player you want to be free, have courage, bravery but you want to have a bit of fear in you, want that taste: I don\u2019t want to lose that game but you still want no worries, I\u2019ll sort it out if I make a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fine balance between arrogance, confidence, being humble. It is difficult to sit here and say in two minutes; you could speak about it for two or three hours.\u201d</p> <p>Bruno Fernandes has impressed since signing in January and has the character Solskj\u00e6r wants. \u201cHe has that swagger. And his imagination, the pictures he sees, is a couple of seconds ahead of many players. One of his strengths is knowing what to do when he gets it. He can change his mind in a split second, if that picture doesn\u2019t work. Bruno gives us that little bit of a different flavour. He likes to play penetrative, forward passes, likes to take risks like a Man United player should do.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony Martial has scored in United\u2019s past three matches and, with only Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford injured, Solskj\u00e6r believes his squad is a different proposition from earlier in the season.</p> <p>\u201cWe feel we\u2019ve added some X factor and quality with Bruno, definitely. Also, with Anthony coming back \u2013 he was out for a couple of months [injured], getting used to playing No 9, getting used to the demands \u2013 Scot McTominay has developed, Nemanja Matic fantastic, Fred as well. We want to develop that X factor.\u201d</p> <p>Luke Shaw is enjoying a run of impressive form, having missed four finals at United because of injuries and not being selected. \u201cIt is a massive ambition for me to play in the Europa League final,\u201d the left-back said, before referencing United\u2019s 2017 triumph against Ajax. \u201cThe feeling, even though I wasn\u2019t on the pitch, was a feeling I have not felt and I wanted more of.\u201d</p> <p>Brugge are without Emmanuel Bonaventure, who scored in the first leg, and the captain Ruud Vormer because of injury. \u00c9der Balanta is suspended.</p>",

But we\u2019ve got to focus on this competition, then the league on Sunday [at Everton], then the FA Cup [at Derby].\u201d United are unbeaten in six matches and have won their past two league matches. \u201cYou need many, many attributes to play the perfect game or be the perfect team,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cWe want the swagger and confidence \u2013 not arrogance, but to be able to go out and believe in yourself. You\u2019ve got to work harder and earn the right to win. \u201cI played with Beckham, Giggs, and one of the biggest compliments we had, with a team full of quality, was that we worked harder than others. I want my team to be one of the hardestworking teams in the league. That\u2019s the attitude you need, that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r believes the requisite personality can be developed. \u201cThey can blossom more with confidence and by me speaking to them, managing them. As a player you want to be free, have courage, bravery but you want to have a bit of fear in you, want that taste: I don\u2019t want to lose that game but you still want no worries, I\u2019ll sort it out if I make a mistake.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a fine balance between arrogance, confidence, being humble. It is difficult to sit here and say in two minutes; you could speak about it for two or three hours.\u201d Bruno Fernandes has impressed since signing in January and has the character Solskj\u00e6r wants. \u201cHe has that swagger. And his imagination, the pictures he sees, is a couple of seconds ahead of many players. One of his strengths is knowing what to do when he gets it. He can change his mind in a split second, if that picture doesn\u2019t work. Bruno gives us that little bit of a different flavour. He likes to play penetrative, forward passes, likes to take risks like a Man United player should do.\u201d Anthony Martial has scored in United\u2019s past three matches and, with only Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford injured, Solskj\u00e6r believes his squad is a different proposition from earlier in the season. \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve added some X factor and quality with Bruno, definitely. Also, with Anthony coming back \u2013 he was out for a couple of months [injured], getting used to playing No 9, getting used to the demands \u2013 Scot McTominay has developed, Nemanja Matic fantastic, Fred as well. We want to develop that X factor.\u201d Luke Shaw is enjoying a run of impressive form, having missed four finals at United because of injuries and not being selected. \u201cIt is a massive ambition for me to play in the Europa League final,\u201d the left-back said, before referencing United\u2019s 2017 triumph against Ajax. \u201cThe feeling, even though I wasn\u2019t on the pitch, was a feeling I have not felt and I wanted more of.\u201d Brugge are without Emmanuel Bonaventure, who scored in the first leg, and the captain Ruud Vormer because of injury. \u00c9der Balanta is suspended.",

For Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison the impact on the economy was just as important to highlight as that of the health concerns.</p> <p>For a government that has placed so much store in achieving a budget surplus, the news was not good, but for the broader economy the news was worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/25/morrison-steps-away-from-surplus-pledge-amid-unknown-global-shock-of-coronavirus\">Morrison steps away from surplus pledge amid 'unknown global shock' of coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrison suggested \u201cthe Australian economy will depend a lot more on its domestic elements\u201d. This is true because clearly the virus affects our exports, especially to China, but he also noted \u201cbusiness as usual can be maintained here in Australia within our domestic economy\u201d.</p> <p>That is a problem because the current business as usual in our domestic economy is pretty dire.</p> <p>On Wednesday the bureau of statistics released <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/8755.0Main+Features1Dec%202019?OpenDocument\">the latest construction figures</a>. These reflect the level of investment in the economy and are also important because the construction sector is one of our largest employers. Nine per cent of all employees work in construction, as does 17% of all men working full-time.</p> <p>So when construction work falls, the economy generally struggles. And it has been struggling for a long time \u2013 and importantly was doing so before the impact of the bushfires and the coronavirus occurred.</p> <p>In the December quarter of last year, the volume of construction work fell 1.4% in trend terms \u2013the sixth consecutive quarter of falling work:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Value of construction work done (volume) - quarterly growth\">  <iframe title=\"Value of construction work done (volume) - quarterly growth\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3xLcv/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the recent past the reason for the overall fall has been the end of the mining boom and the huge engineering construction done to build mines.

And the housing construction boom that began when the Reserve Bank cut rates at the end of 2011 is well and truly over.</p> <p>Last year the volume of new residential construction fell in every state except for Tasmania, and even there the growth of 1% was well down on its recent peak of 40% growth in 2018:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"New residential construction - annual growth\">  <iframe title=\"New residential construction - annual growth\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nmwhH/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big concern is the decline in New South Wales.

      "bodyText": "As the impact of the coronavirus outbreak continues to wreak havoc on the world\u2019s economy, the problem for Australia is that it has come at a time when our government has been more worried about the budget surplus than the actual economy. And now with the surplus almost certainly gone, the weak domestic economy is laid bare for all to see. On Tuesday the prime minister, treasurer and health minister all fronted the media to deliver the bad news about the impact of Covid-19. For Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison the impact on the economy was just as important to highlight as that of the health concerns. For a government that has placed so much store in achieving a budget surplus, the news was not good, but for the broader economy the news was worse. Morrison suggested \u201cthe Australian economy will depend a lot more on its domestic elements\u201d. This is true because clearly the virus affects our exports, especially to China, but he also noted \u201cbusiness as usual can be maintained here in Australia within our domestic economy\u201d. That is a problem because the current business as usual in our domestic economy is pretty dire. On Wednesday the bureau of statistics released the latest construction figures. These reflect the level of investment in the economy and are also important because the construction sector is one of our largest employers. Nine per cent of all employees work in construction, as does 17% of all men working full-time. So when construction work falls, the economy generally struggles. And it has been struggling for a long time \u2013 and importantly was doing so before the impact of the bushfires and the coronavirus occurred. In the December quarter of last year, the volume of construction work fell 1.4% in trend terms \u2013the sixth consecutive quarter of falling work: In the recent past the reason for the overall fall has been the end of the mining boom and the huge engineering construction done to build mines. But now the fall is as much about a decline in buildings being constructed: In 2019 the volume of engineering construction fell 6.8%, but almost as large was the 6.5% fall in the construction of buildings. Around 65% of buildings constructed in Australia are residential \u2013 either apartments and flats or houses. And the housing construction boom that began when the Reserve Bank cut rates at the end of 2011 is well and truly over. Last year the volume of new residential construction fell in every state except for Tasmania, and even there the growth of 1% was well down on its recent peak of 40% growth in 2018: The big concern is the decline in New South Wales. In 2019 new residential construction fell 23% \u2013 the biggest fall since 2001 when construction plummeted after people had rushed to build homes before the GST came into effect in 2000. The decline of construction in NSW and Victoria highlights just how greatly those two states have been the centre of the boom. At the start of 2010 the volume of new residential construction in those two states was roughly equal to that in the rest of the nation. By the middle of 2018 the amount of residential building in NSW and Victoria had doubled, while in the rest of the nations it had increased just 2%: The mining construction and residential building booms are over. So what now? Interest rate cuts started the last housing boom, but that was when the cash rate was 4.75% and the average discounted mortgage rate was 7.15%; now the cash rate is 0.75% and the discounted average mortgage rate is 4.15%. Sure, there might be people waiting to build a home for when the Reserve Bank cuts rates one more time, but I suspect not a lot. The market however still expects the RBA to cut the cash rate to 0.5% by July. Three months ago when the last construction figures came out, the market expected that would be as low as the cash rate would go. Now after the horror summer and Covid-19, the market believes there is a 50:50 chance that the RBA will do a further cut to 0.25%: But even that suggests little real stimulus to come from the RBA. And so we could look to the government. It is clear that the public sector has not helped fill the gap left by the private sector. In the past year construction work done by the public sector has fallen. In effect it has accentuated the impact of the declining private sector at a time when it should be doing the opposite: There has been a slight increase in public sector construction work in the past few months, but clearly not enough. Morrison suggested on Tuesday: \u201cI can assure taxpayers ... we\u2019re not a government that engages in extreme fiscal responses.\u201d Alas they appear not to be a government of any fiscal response. And what the latest construction figures make quite clear is that the domestic economy, which the government is relying on to see us through the international crisis, was already struggling well before things around the rest of the world turned ugly. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister\u2019s department broke the law by inexplicably delaying a freedom of information request about allegations the former public service commissioner improperly aided the rightwing Institute of Public Affairs. Findings delivered by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) in November found the department had failed to process the FOI in legal timeframes, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. It was a recurring problem at the department in 2017/18. The OAIC found the department met the legally-imposed deadlines in just 35% of FOIs that year. The information watchdog told the department to audit and improve its handling of requests within three months, and send out an all-staff missive reminding employees of their legal obligations. The finding, though, is in stark contrast to a separate $110,000 internal investigation the department conducted into its handling of the same FOI request, in which it cleared itself of wrongdoing. At least three federal agencies have now been found to have breached FOI law since November. The department of human services and Australian federal police were also found to have breached FOI law late last year. In all three cases, the information watchdog found government agencies were inexplicably delaying FOI decisions. FOI experts say delays can be used as a deliberate tactic to render information useless or less explosive by the time it is released. The FOI lodged with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet requested documents about the former public service chief, John Lloyd, after reports that he acted improperly in his contact with the IPA. Lloyd was later found by the merit protection commissioner to have breached the public service code of conduct by \u201cfailing to uphold the good reputation\u201d of his agency when he passed research about \u201cgenerous\u201d public service employment provisions to the IPA. The FOI was lodged in January 2018 and a decision was due to be made by 26 February 2018. But no such decision was made and the OAIC said \u201cno steps were taken to process the complainant\u2019s request\u201d by the time the 26 February deadline arrived. Action was only taken when the information watchdog was asked to review the case, and the department eventually released some documents in late April. It was a common occurrence within the department that year. In 2017-18, the OAIC found statutory timeframes were not met in the \u201cmajority\u201d of FOIs the department received. A subsequent complaint to the OAIC prompted an investigation, which culminated in five recommendations, including that the department audit itself and report back to the watchdog on its \u201ccompliance with statutory timeframes\u201d and the training of senior executives. The department was also told to improve its FOI guidance to staff within three months to improve \u201csearch and retrieval timeliness\u201d, among other things. In a statement to the Guardian, the department said it had fully cooperated with the OAIC investigation and \u201cwelcomed, accepted and implemented\u201d the recommendations. \u201cImportantly, the Australian Information Commissioner acknowledged the steps taken by the department to implement a variety of strategies to support Departmental officers to comply with the statutory timeframes in the FOI Act, and that those strategies are already having a demonstrable positive impact on the Department\u2019s ability to meet its statutory timeframes,\u201d the department said. The department\u2019s handling of FOIs has improved dramatically since 2017-18, a year that was also complicated by its receipt of 87 FOI requests on the second last day before the Christmas shutdown period. It now has no overdue FOI requests and has a 100% compliance rate with statutory timeframes for requests received since January. \u201cOf all requests finalised by active decision of the Department between 1 July 2019\u201323 February 2020, 90.2% were finalised on time,\u201d the department said. There is no real punishment for breaching the FOI act, aside from negative findings and recommendations by the OAIC. The OAIC\u2019s investigation was complicated by the department\u2019s repeated delays in providing submissions. Documents seen by the Guardian show the department repeatedly failed to meet deadlines to provide the OAIC with submissions between December 2018 and February 2019, and had to be prompted time and again to do so. The department told the Guardian the OAIC had raised no concern about the delay.",

The seven banks providing Intu with its revolving credit facility have agreed to a new four-year \u00a3440m overdraft, conditional upon the firm raising at least \u00a31.3bn in a rights issue. Intu is struggling with a \u00a34.7bn debt burden and its share price has crashed almost 90% over the last 12 months. The company confirmed it would be issuing an emergency cash call to investors alongside its full-year results, which are due on 5 March. It had previously declined to name a figure. Matthew Roberts, Intu\u2019s chief executive, said the overdraft extensionwas a key milestone towards addressing the company\u2019s short-term refinancing needs. \u201cFixing the balance sheet remains our number one priority and we remain engaged with shareholders and potential new investors in relation to the intended equity raise,\u201d he said. The new overdraft facility has less headroom than the one it replaces, which was worth \u00a3600m and was due to expire in October 2021. Rob Virdee, an analyst at the property consultancy Green Street Advisors, said the lower amount being lent by banks suggested they did not want to increase their exposure to Intu. He said even if Intu raised the \u00a31.3bn mandated by the overdraft agreement it would not be enough to resolve the company\u2019s debt issues. \u201cIt is not enough to draw a line under any concerns about financial distress that prospective investors have,\u201d he said. The announcement briefly bolstered Intu\u2019s shares, but they were still trading at close to record lows on Wednesday, just above 14p, valuing the company at \u00a3186m. That is just a fraction of the \u00a38bn at which its properties are officially valued, although analysts expect arevaluation to show their assets are now worth substantially less. Intu has faced difficulties as some of its biggest tenants, including Debenhams, House of Fraser, and Topshop\u2019s owner, Arcadia, have undergone emergency restructurings, closed stores or requested rent reductions. The move to online shopping, the rising costs of running stores for retailers and weaker consumer spending have led to a high-street crisis at national chains, and lower rents and higher vacancies at Intu centres. The shopping centre owner has been selling some of its assets to raise cash and lower its debt, but few analysts believe a \u00a31bn cash call will be enough and think Intu will need to take more drastic action to shore up its finances.",

      "body": "<p>Rereleased as part of special screenings for all of director Phil Grabsky\u2019s Great Composer series, this 2014 documentary is a studious, attentive resum\u00e9 of the genius Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 one European aristocrat liked to call \u201cChopski\u201d. What it lacks in the kind of central episodic hook much favoured by the modern biopic, or visual virtuosity, it doubly pays backs in informed piano-side commentary by top pianists \u2013 including Daniel Barenboim, Leif Ove Andsnes and Ronald Brautigam \u2013 that gets to the essence of the music.</p> <p>Chopin himself, a teenage prodigy in his native Warsaw, was chary about simply giving this away. He gave only 30 public concerts in his short life (he died of tuberculosis aged 39 in 1849); his preferred method of musical communion was more intimate salon recitals that suited the existential keyboard pieces to which he dedicated himself once he arrived in Paris in the early 1830s. As Grabsky traces the pianist\u2019s progress across Europe, Juliet Stevenson provides an appropriately dulcet narration, while David Dawson reads the composer\u2019s surprisingly chipper correspondence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMRwaQ4DeA4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KMRwaQ4DeA4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The biopic moment would have been Chopin\u2019s \u201codd couple\u201d liaison with George Sand, the cross-dressing literary powerhouse who was the most famous woman in France. Grabsky gives the affair a decent eyeballing, but his real emotion is reserved for the composer\u2019s musical dynamics, on which the film is excellent. We learn early on that his groundbreaking fluidity and expressiveness on the piano was thanks to early input from Wojciech \u017bywny, a violin specialist. More than once, modern interpreters say they feel uncomfortable playing him because the notes are so soul-baring, it feels intrusive.</p> <p>In Search of Chopin seems less concerned with making a case for his broader influence and legacy than simply defining this quintessence. The pianist and actor Hershey Felder, who has played Chopin on stage and makes a number of colourful appearances here, nails it with a shrug: \u201cPerhaps the only answer is that such a thing comes from God.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 In Search of Chopin is released in the UK on 1 March.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rereleased as part of special screenings for all of director Phil Grabsky\u2019s Great Composer series, this 2014 documentary is a studious, attentive resum\u00e9 of the genius Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 one European aristocrat liked to call \u201cChopski\u201d. What it lacks in the kind of central episodic hook much favoured by the modern biopic, or visual virtuosity, it doubly pays backs in informed piano-side commentary by top pianists \u2013 including Daniel Barenboim, Leif Ove Andsnes and Ronald Brautigam \u2013 that gets to the essence of the music. Chopin himself, a teenage prodigy in his native Warsaw, was chary about simply giving this away. He gave only 30 public concerts in his short life (he died of tuberculosis aged 39 in 1849); his preferred method of musical communion was more intimate salon recitals that suited the existential keyboard pieces to which he dedicated himself once he arrived in Paris in the early 1830s. As Grabsky traces the pianist\u2019s progress across Europe, Juliet Stevenson provides an appropriately dulcet narration, while David Dawson reads the composer\u2019s surprisingly chipper correspondence. The biopic moment would have been Chopin\u2019s \u201codd couple\u201d liaison with George Sand, the cross-dressing literary powerhouse who was the most famous woman in France. Grabsky gives the affair a decent eyeballing, but his real emotion is reserved for the composer\u2019s musical dynamics, on which the film is excellent. We learn early on that his groundbreaking fluidity and expressiveness on the piano was thanks to early input from Wojciech \u017bywny, a violin specialist. More than once, modern interpreters say they feel uncomfortable playing him because the notes are so soul-baring, it feels intrusive. In Search of Chopin seems less concerned with making a case for his broader influence and legacy than simply defining this quintessence. The pianist and actor Hershey Felder, who has played Chopin on stage and makes a number of colourful appearances here, nails it with a shrug: \u201cPerhaps the only answer is that such a thing comes from God.\u201d \u2022 In Search of Chopin is released in the UK on 1 March.",

It said it was concerned about his appointment, claiming it had represented a number of members who suffered bullying at Samaritans by former members of its management team.</p> <p>After trustees had been locked in talks for days, a Samaritans spokesperson said on Wednesday: \u201cIn light of events over the past week, the board of trustees has decided that it cannot proceed with the appointment of Jeremy Hughes as CEO, which was due to start in May. This decision is not in any way based on the allegations themselves, which Samaritans is not in a position to judge. It will begin a new CEO recruitment process in due course.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, the Guardian revealed the existence of an 11-page whistleblower complaint, made to the Charity Commission in February 2018, which warned the NDAs could be seen as an attempt to silence staff at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. Despite the serious nature of the allegation that hundreds of thousands of pounds had been spent to silence staff who signed NDAs, the watchdog did nothing to investigate the complaint \u2013 an oversight it now admits was a mistake.</p> <p>Separately, a former senior staff member at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society said Hughes had an \u201cexplosive temper\u201d and displayed bullying behaviour towards staff, including shouting and undermining them.</p> <p>Before Samaritans\u2019 announcement, Unite regional officer Peter Storey said on Wednesday that the allegations about Hughes were \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the fact that the Samaritans is in the very early stages of recovering from a toxic bullying culture which has damaged the lives of many of its staff, Unite does not believe that Mr Hughes is the right person to heal the problems the charity has experienced,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cUnite believes it is incumbent on the trustees at the Samaritans to rescind the appointment of Mr Hughes as its chief executive and instead appoint someone who has a track record in tackling a toxic bullying culture.\u201d</p> <p>The Alzheimer\u2019s Society claims the \u00a3750,000 figure for settlements is inaccurate but has declined to give its own sum. It said it only used settlements for \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d. The charity\u2019s director of people and organisational development, Corinne Mills, said previously: \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the experience of the two ex-employees quoted. All complaints raised with us are taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly.\u201d</p> <p>She said the charity had \u201czero tolerance of bullying and discrimination \u2013 our evidence shows we have not and do not use settlement agreements or non-disclosure agreements to stop anyone reporting any whistleblowing, harassment or discrimination complaints\u201d.</p> <p>In an internal email sent by the charity\u2019s chief operating officer, Kathryn Smith, to staff on Monday, Hughes \u2013 who is still in post as the society\u2019s CEO \u2013 was quoted as saying: \u201cI am deeply concerned by the allegations. I have always been determined to ensure everyone at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society has a positive working experience. Everything I do is in order to make the biggest difference for people affected by dementia.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Samaritans have abandoned the appointment of their new CEO after a Guardian investigation revealed claims that the Alzheimer\u2019s Society paid out as much as \u00a3750,000 to staff who signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) during his tenure there. Jeremy Hughes will no longer be taking the helm at the suicide prevention charity following whistleblower allegations that he displayed bullying behaviour to staff and presided over a toxic culture at the dementia charity. The decision comes after two ex-Alzheimer\u2019s Society employees who signed NDAs and received settlements after complaining of bullying and discrimination came forward on Monday to say Hughes should not take up the post at Samaritans, which he was due to start in May. Earlier on Wednesday, the country\u2019s biggest union, Unite \u2013 which has 50 members at Samaritans \u2013 joined calls for Hughes not to get the job. It said it was concerned about his appointment, claiming it had represented a number of members who suffered bullying at Samaritans by former members of its management team. After trustees had been locked in talks for days, a Samaritans spokesperson said on Wednesday: \u201cIn light of events over the past week, the board of trustees has decided that it cannot proceed with the appointment of Jeremy Hughes as CEO, which was due to start in May. This decision is not in any way based on the allegations themselves, which Samaritans is not in a position to judge. It will begin a new CEO recruitment process in due course.\u201d Last week, the Guardian revealed the existence of an 11-page whistleblower complaint, made to the Charity Commission in February 2018, which warned the NDAs could be seen as an attempt to silence staff at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. Despite the serious nature of the allegation that hundreds of thousands of pounds had been spent to silence staff who signed NDAs, the watchdog did nothing to investigate the complaint \u2013 an oversight it now admits was a mistake. Separately, a former senior staff member at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society said Hughes had an \u201cexplosive temper\u201d and displayed bullying behaviour towards staff, including shouting and undermining them. Before Samaritans\u2019 announcement, Unite regional officer Peter Storey said on Wednesday that the allegations about Hughes were \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d. \u201cGiven the fact that the Samaritans is in the very early stages of recovering from a toxic bullying culture which has damaged the lives of many of its staff, Unite does not believe that Mr Hughes is the right person to heal the problems the charity has experienced,\u201d he said. \u201cUnite believes it is incumbent on the trustees at the Samaritans to rescind the appointment of Mr Hughes as its chief executive and instead appoint someone who has a track record in tackling a toxic bullying culture.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Society claims the \u00a3750,000 figure for settlements is inaccurate but has declined to give its own sum. It said it only used settlements for \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d. The charity\u2019s director of people and organisational development, Corinne Mills, said previously: \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the experience of the two ex-employees quoted. All complaints raised with us are taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly.\u201d She said the charity had \u201czero tolerance of bullying and discrimination \u2013 our evidence shows we have not and do not use settlement agreements or non-disclosure agreements to stop anyone reporting any whistleblowing, harassment or discrimination complaints\u201d. In an internal email sent by the charity\u2019s chief operating officer, Kathryn Smith, to staff on Monday, Hughes \u2013 who is still in post as the society\u2019s CEO \u2013 was quoted as saying: \u201cI am deeply concerned by the allegations. I have always been determined to ensure everyone at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society has a positive working experience. Everything I do is in order to make the biggest difference for people affected by dementia.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With drummers pounding out samba rhythms through the rain, this might almost have been just another one of the hundreds of street parties of Rio\u2019s world-famous carnival. But nobody at the I\u2019m Full of Love Samba Street Party on Copacabana beach was drunk or in costume, few bystanders were dancing \u2013 and the group on the sound truck was singing about Jesus. Evangelical Christians, a large and increasingly assertive demographic in Brazil, played a key role in the election of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose wife Michelle is the most famous congregation member at Rio\u2019s Attitude Baptist church, the organizers of the party. And, where once they would leave town during carnival, they are increasingly visible during the annual celebrations, said Attitude\u2019s pastor, Josu\u00e9 Valandro Jr. \u201cThe city was delivered up to immorality, drinking sprees, crimes, bad things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe carnival revelry lasts four days but Jesus\u2019s happiness is eternal.\u201d His congregation was here to save souls \u2013 and sign up new members. \u201cIt\u2019s evangelism. The aim is to bring Jesus to people who are enjoying carnival,\u201d said Larissa Rocha, 23, an educational assistant who plays in the church\u2019s drum corps. One recent survey found around a third of Brazilians are evangelicals \u2013 up from 9% in 1991 - compared to around half who are Catholic. Valandro called the first lady \u201ca woman of God\u201d for her work with deaf people and blamed leftist governments for a moral and economic decline now being reversed under Bolsonaro. \u201cThe president is a man of strong character, with strong convictions,\u201d he said. Although Catholic, Bolsonaro was baptised by an evangelical preacher in the River Jordan in 2016. Many evangelicals voted for him, unconcerned by his history of homophobic remarks, racist descriptions of indigenous people and praise for Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. Since taking office, Bolsonaro has prioritised appearances at evangelical events. \u201cThe state is secular, but the president is Christian,\u201d he told a cheering audience of tens of thousands at a recent Rio evangelical event whose orderly, restrained atmosphere contrasted vividly with the noisy, anarchic hedonism of carnival. \u201cHe is an exemplary president. He is rescuing what the country lost: the family,\u201d said Hilquias Pereira, 34, an accountant from another evangelical samba group run by the First Baptist church of Trindade, in nearby S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo. Some evangelicals eschew Rio\u2019s official carnival parade because of the association between many samba schools and Afro-Brazilian religions. On Tuesday, Brazil\u2019s minister for women, family and human rights attacked carnival during a debate on religious freedom at the UN HQ in Geneva, the UOL site reported. During a debate on religious freedom, Damares Alves \u2013 who is also an evangelical pastor \u2013 said: \u201cWhat we are seeing in the carnival parties, unfortunately, is an affront and a disrespect to the Christian faith. We are seeing objects of the Christian faith being ridiculed in a vile way in Brazil.\u201d Alves promised a new government campaign to protect religious expression. The previous night the Mangueira samba school presented Jesus as black, homeless and indigenous in a parade which included criticisms of Bolsonaro and the police oppression critics say he has encouraged. \u201cIt is Jesus that is on the side of the poor, the oppressed and against injustice,\u201d said Henrique Vieira, the actor and evangelical pastor who played Jesus as homeless in the parade. V\u00edtor Costa, 18, an unemployed carnival reveler dressed as Jesus in a white flowing robe, said the government\u2019s alliance with evangelicals concerned him. \u201cPolitics affects everyone but not everyone is religious,\u201d he said. Attitude church members said they felt evangelicals face prejudice and described carnival as an expensive, drunken, promiscuous, crime-ridden mess they would love to reinvent. \u201cWe would only sing songs about family, about friendship, about goodness and God. There would no alcoholic drinks nor drugs consumed. And everyone would be sober,\u201d Pastor Valandro said. \u201cThat would be my dream carnival.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At this point, The Bachelor\u2019s formula has become so rigid that even a monkey could draw you the rough shape of an average season. Across 24 seasons, not including spin-offs like The Bachelorette, Bachelor Pad and Bachelor in Paradise, we\u2019ve watched the same beats get hit time and time again. Roses. Dates. Catty, desperate woman. A man who looks like a retired astronaut who\u2019s forced to front a series of STI commercials. Premature declarations of love. The waking nightmare that is the Fantasy Suite. Three months of post-show press and then an ugly breakup. The Bachelor, sad to say, is getting old.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/25/love-is-blind-netflixs-hit-is-dating-tv-at-its-most-awful-and-compelling\">Love Is Blind: Netflix's hit is dating TV at its most awful \u2013 and compelling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But The Bachelor seems to know this, and has responded by, well, getting old. On Tuesday ABC\u2019s head of reality, Robert Mills, put out <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/entertainment/senior-bachelor/index.html\">a casting call</a> for what might be The Bachelor\u2019s most exciting season in a decade. \u201cNOW CASTING SENIORS LOOKING FOR LOVE,\u201d it read. A follow-up post from another producer clarified exactly the sort of person ABC was looking for: \u201cAre you entering your golden years and looking for romance? The producers of The Bachelor are looking for active and outgoing single men and women age 65 and up for a new exciting dating show.\u201d That\u2019s right, get ready for The Bachelor: Oldie Edition.</p> <p>So far, aside from Mills seemingly rubber-stamping a tweet suggesting that the series be set in Boca Raton, that\u2019s all we know. But that\u2019s enough. Because a senior version of The Bachelor \u2013 at least the version that currently exists in my mind \u2013 is the perfect tool with which to wipe away the crimes of its parent show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B71ixtVH7_H/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "At this point, The Bachelor\u2019s formula has become so rigid that even a monkey could draw you the rough shape of an average season. Across 24 seasons, not including spin-offs like The Bachelorette, Bachelor Pad and Bachelor in Paradise, we\u2019ve watched the same beats get hit time and time again. Roses. Dates. Catty, desperate woman. A man who looks like a retired astronaut who\u2019s forced to front a series of STI commercials. Premature declarations of love. The waking nightmare that is the Fantasy Suite. Three months of post-show press and then an ugly breakup. The Bachelor, sad to say, is getting old. But The Bachelor seems to know this, and has responded by, well, getting old. On Tuesday ABC\u2019s head of reality, Robert Mills, put out a casting call for what might be The Bachelor\u2019s most exciting season in a decade. \u201cNOW CASTING SENIORS LOOKING FOR LOVE,\u201d it read. A follow-up post from another producer clarified exactly the sort of person ABC was looking for: \u201cAre you entering your golden years and looking for romance? The producers of The Bachelor are looking for active and outgoing single men and women age 65 and up for a new exciting dating show.\u201d That\u2019s right, get ready for The Bachelor: Oldie Edition. So far, aside from Mills seemingly rubber-stamping a tweet suggesting that the series be set in Boca Raton, that\u2019s all we know. But that\u2019s enough. Because a senior version of The Bachelor \u2013 at least the version that currently exists in my mind \u2013 is the perfect tool with which to wipe away the crimes of its parent show. In an idealised form, The Bachelor: Senior has the potential to be both sweet and eye-opening. By featuring nothing but contestants in the autumn of their years, the show might be able to take a step back from the skeezy youthful insincerity of The Bachelor proper.

      "body": "<p>How does a well-loved novel become a stage production without incurring the wrath of book lovers and theatre audiences alike? For Patrick Marber, adaptation is akin to a \u201cransacking\u201d that turns one form into another. Sally Cookson has called it a \u201cwrestling process\u201d. Whatever the answer, turning great books into great plays is riven with risk, as director Katie Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/nov/11/theatre.stage\">pointed out in 2006</a> when adapting Virginia Woolf\u2019s The Waves<em>. </em>\u201cAny attempt to dramatise a famous novel is perilous,\u201d said Mitchell, who is now bringing a second Woolf novel, Orlando, to the Barbican, in London, this April.</p> <p>She is not the only one braving difficult book-to-stage transformations.

Alice has really worked with time. It goes at the speed of the book and historical periods jump like lightning from one period to the next.\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, the central sex change in the novel \u2013 when Orlando wakes up to discover he is no longer a man but a woman \u2013 is staged without any technological aids but told matter-of-factly, just as in the book, says Mitchell.<strong> </strong>As<strong> </strong>Woolf writes: \u201cOrlando had become a woman \u2013 there is no denying it. But in every other respect, Orlando remained precisely as he had been.\u201d Mitchell and Birch wanted to retain this tone: \u201cHe wakes up as a she and gets on with life. The character absorbs the new female body and carries on living,\u201d says Mitchell.</p> <p>The contemporary resonances in the novel\u2019s exploration of gender fluidity made it appealing to stage. Gender is unfixed in the play, with women in the cast playing men\u2019s roles and vice versa. \u201cIt\u2019s great that a conversation from then [the book was published in 1928] can still have a lively conversation with what\u2019s going on now.\u201d</p> <p>Theresa Heskins found her own contemporary echoes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/01/angela-carter-far-from-fairytale-edmund-gordon\">Angela Carter</a>\u2019s 1979 revisionist retelling of Little Red Riding Hood, which she felt was newly relevant and ripe for reinterpretation to a post #MeToo generation. She is adapting and directing The Company of Wolves, the story of a fearless young woman who is forced to bargain with a murderous wolf. She undresses for him in the hope of saving her life but ends up transforming into a wolf herself. \u201cIt is the classic story about not straying off the path, and also about a woman who wants to live as a wolf. She is an anarchist and rule-breaker. That\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting for us,\u201d says Heskins.</p> <p>There are scenes of sex and violence in the original that are tinged with Carter\u2019s distinct brand of magical realism as well as narrative ambivalence and baroque writing. How to transform such a tricksy story that is only nine pages long to a full-scale theatrical production? And how to present its central, vulpine transformation visually?</p> <p>Heskins has used Carter\u2019s own dramatised radio version of the story as her starting point, adapting it slightly and adding a scene. \u201cI wanted to stay faithful to Carter. I think she\u2019s an amazing writer and I wanted to collaborate with her on this and preserve her authorial voice,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Like Mitchell\u2019s, Heskins\u2019s production creates its own theatrical language, but this show is based more on traditional techniques. She says the audience\u2019s creative collaboration is more vital in bringing the fantastical story alive on stage than any technology: \u201cTheir imagination is the CGI and it is our biggest asset. You can do all sorts of things as long as you invite them to imagine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09662f96400695d6a983193fd29f969c5da3ed81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09662f96400695d6a983193fd29f969c5da3ed81/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rakhee Sharma as Cathy and Alex Austin as Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights at the Royal Exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ferocious and feral \u2026 Rakhee Sharma as Cathy and Alex Austin as Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights at the Royal Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chinese poles become visual symbols for the tree-filled forest and supernatural aspects are reflected in aerial silks and circus skills.

      "bodyText": "How does a well-loved novel become a stage production without incurring the wrath of book lovers and theatre audiences alike? For Patrick Marber, adaptation is akin to a \u201cransacking\u201d that turns one form into another. Sally Cookson has called it a \u201cwrestling process\u201d. Whatever the answer, turning great books into great plays is riven with risk, as director Katie Mitchell pointed out in 2006 when adapting Virginia Woolf\u2019s The Waves. \u201cAny attempt to dramatise a famous novel is perilous,\u201d said Mitchell, who is now bringing a second Woolf novel, Orlando, to the Barbican, in London, this April. She is not the only one braving difficult book-to-stage transformations. Several formally complex fictions are currently being reimagined on the boards, from Angela Carter\u2019s magical realist short story The Company of Wolves, opening at the New Vic in Newcastle-under-Lyme in May, to Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights, currently at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. With The Waves, Mitchell began creating her own theatrical language, which would take audiences inside her characters\u2019 heads. Now she has applied those techniques to Orlando. Produced by the Schaub\u00fchne in Berlin and adapted by her long-time collaborator, Alice Birch, the play uses technology to recreate a story in which the central adventuring hero travels across several centuries and changes sex. \u201cWe have tried to do as much as the original ambition of the book. We are using live camera techniques: a film is being shot on ground level with a screen above it so the audience is watching a film plus the [live] shooting of the film.\u201d The production encompasses the same historical scope \u2013 nearly 400 years \u2013 and to conjure the sense of time passing on stage, there are more than 90 costume changes and the use of body doubles. \u201cIt has all the energy of the novel. Alice has really worked with time.

      "bodyText": "The Queen\u2019s granddaughter Zara Phillips and her husband, former England rugby player Mike Tindall, will not be self-isolating after returning from a skiing trip in northern Italy, where a coronavirus outbreak has been spreading. Phillips and Tindall have come back from a trip to Bormio, a town in the Lombardy region of the Alps in northern Italy. The couple\u2019s management said the pair were following government guidelines and medical advice, and as they currently did not have any symptoms of the infection they would not be going into self-isolation. Earlier this week a school in Nantwich, Cheshire, closed over fears that pupils who had been on a ski trip to the same resort, were displaying flu-like symptoms. The British government updated its guidance on Tuesday morning, with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, saying that those returning from anywhere north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini would need to stay indoors if they had symptoms, however mild. New guidance also said those returning from any quarantined towns would have to immediately go into self-isolation even if they had developed no symptoms of the virus. The couple\u2019s management confirmed that they did not visit any of the quarantined towns. The Italian authorities implemented measures on 22 February, and the latest reported coronavirus death toll there had risen to 12, with the number of confirmed cases at 374. Eleven towns have been in lockdown and sporting events have been played to empty stadiums. The Venice Carnival was also cancelled early due to concerns about the infection spreading. Despite telling Britons returning from northern Italy to self-isolate if they develop coronavirus symptoms, the FCO has not advised against travel to the country. On Wednesday, Hancock said there had been 13 cases of the virus in the UK. Eight of those people had been discharged, he added, noting that the government expected more cases to arise. He said the government would be rolling out a publicity campaign soon and coordinating with its international partners to ensure it is ready for all eventualities. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 February 2020 to clarify some details about the trip made by Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall to Italy.",

As we won 3-0, I suppose I will now have to wear this formal outfit for every game henceforth. Seeing our third goal go in was a highlight.

The first on that list was Lady <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/antonia-fraser\" title=\"\">Antonia Fraser</a>\u2019s life of Cromwell.

If they got there from private school, I am scornful; if they came from state school, I feel great admiration. But apart from that there really is a lot to be annoyed with about these people if you don\u2019t happen to be one of them. There is the way they slip the words Oxford or Cambridge into conversation within minutes of first meeting you. Also, they speak of what they \u201cread\u201d rather than what they studied. And then there is the way they talk about which actual college they were at, as if anyone else knows or cares what the difference is between any of them.</p> <p>And here I was shuffling around uncertainly amid the begowned throng. The master of Balliol, Dame Helen Ghosh, was pointed out to me. Before I knew it, she was striding in my direction, smiling at someone I assumed was standing behind me.

Although the accused denies killing Birbeck, 47, the jury at Preston crown court were told on Wednesday that he accepted responsibility for moving her body to a nearby cemetery in a blue wheelie bin. In a statement provided to police on 30 August, which was read to the court, the defendant, who has autism and a learning disability, said he had been approached by a man he did not know in the area to \u201cget rid of a body\u201d for him. \u201cHe said that he would pay me a lot of money when everything was clear,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cHe showed me where the body was and he went away straight away.\u201d David McLachlan QC, prosecuting, told the jury that on the day she had disappeared, Birbeck, a \u201ckeep-fit enthusiast\u201d, had gone for a walk to a woodland area behind her home on Burnley Road just after 4pm. CCTV images seen by jurors showed the defendant walking towards the area where Birbeck was last seen around an hour and a half before she left home, and then leaving the area near the coppice about two hours later. Birbeck\u2019s estranged husband reported her to the police as missing from home shortly after midnight on 13 August, hours after she had failed to keep an arrangement to make dinner for their daughter and her boyfriend. After a community-led effort to find her, Birbeck\u2019s naked body was found in a shallow ditch by a dog walker in Accrington cemetery 12 days after she went missing. Clear plastic sheeting and plastic bags covering her body were found to be \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from those seized from the defendant\u2019s home, McLachlan told the court. A postmortem found she had died from neck injuries that were so severe they may have been caused by \u201cstamping, kicking or kneeling on the front of the neck\u201d. The court heard that the teenager had taken a wheelie bin to the area on the day that he is alleged to have killed Birbeck, but had not moved her body until 17 August, when he was seen by witnesses dragging the bin. Hair found inside the bin was found to match DNA samples from Birbeck, and her shoes were found in a skip in the cemetery. The trial continues.",

New plantations are already causing an outcry with the Woodland Trust last week pledging to remove saplings planted on a wildflower meadow full of orchids in Cumbria. The placing of sitka spruce plantations on Scottish highlands and across the peat bogs of the Flow Country in the 1970s and 1980s was a \u201ctragedy\u201d, Studholme admitted.

I feel fine but I\u2019m stuck at home</strong><strong>. Will I still be paid?</strong></h2> <p>You don\u2019t have to be, says Sarah Evans, an employment expert and partner at JMW Solicitors. Some people will come to an arrangement with their employer to work at home and they will be paid as normal. \u201cIncreasingly, lots of employees can and will work at home. However, the problem comes if you work in a shop or a warehouse that requires your presence. The hard truth is that in this case your employer can send you home and is under no obligation to pay you. For a small company, having an unproductive member of staff sitting a home doing nothing on full pay will be a huge burden.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon the health Secretary Matt Hancock, said guidance has been sent to UK employers telling them staff who are asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave.<br>Hancock told the Commons medical advice on self-isolation should be considered \u201csickness for employment purposes\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>How does that advice change things?</strong></h2> <p>Previously the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\u2019s (Acas) advice was employers should treat such a scenario as sick leave, or agree for the time to be taken off as holiday, says Martha McKinley, an employment specialist at the law firm Stephensons.</p> <p>Acas recommends that if someone is told not to come into work, for example if they have returned from China, they should get their usual pay. The chief executive, Susan Clews, said employers had increasingly been getting touch with the service to ask how such cases should be treated.</p> <h2><strong>My children have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-fears-grow-as-more-cases-found-across-europe\">sent home from school</a> to self-isolate. Can I ask for time off, and will I be paid?</strong></h2> <p>Sarah Evans says employees could ask for emergency time off in such a situation. The employer would have to grant this, she says, but again would be under no obligation to pay the employee. In reality, most people would again just work from home. Most employers would probably allow the person to take the time off as holiday, which in most cases is still paid, says McKinley, but they are under no obligation to do so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-wuhan-china-covid-19\">What is coronavirus and what should I do if I have symptoms?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>I have the virus and am off sick. What will be paid?</strong></h2> <p>If you are sick or have symptoms you qualify for at least statutory sick pay, or whatever your contract may provide over and above that. Most employers will allow a certain number of days a year on full pay. After that employees are entitled to <a href=\"https://www.acas.org.uk/checking-sick-pay/statutory-sick-pay-ssp?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqNPyBRCjARIsAKA-WFyVQvXh8vIaMMPUu1GjJx_JWpFIsC2S_zyN49Cdu-oYH9L-ph19oHsaAhi7EALw_wcB\">statutory sick pay (SSP)</a> of \u00a394.25 per week, which will be paid for up to 28 weeks. It is paid from the fourth day of sickness. A doctor\u2019s note may not be necessary, although employees can self-certify with symptoms of flu without seeing a doctor, says Evans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>I\u2019m self-employed \u2013 what do I get?</strong></h2> <p>Nothing, and you are not entitled to SSP either, says McKinley. \u201cOne of the biggest downsides of being self-employed is that in most cases you will not be paid if you do not turn up for work. If the virus spirals out of control, those in the gig economy will be adversely affected and face significant loss of wages.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Can I claim benefits instead?</strong></h2> <p>In theory, yes, but be prepared for a long wait.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve just returned from an affected part of northern Italy. I feel fine but I\u2019m stuck at home. Will I still be paid? You don\u2019t have to be, says Sarah Evans, an employment expert and partner at JMW Solicitors. Some people will come to an arrangement with their employer to work at home and they will be paid as normal. \u201cIncreasingly, lots of employees can and will work at home. However, the problem comes if you work in a shop or a warehouse that requires your presence. The hard truth is that in this case your employer can send you home and is under no obligation to pay you. For a small company, having an unproductive member of staff sitting a home doing nothing on full pay will be a huge burden.\u201d On Wednesday afternoon the health Secretary Matt Hancock, said guidance has been sent to UK employers telling them staff who are asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave. Hancock told the Commons medical advice on self-isolation should be considered \u201csickness for employment purposes\u201d. How does that advice change things? Previously the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\u2019s (Acas) advice was employers should treat such a scenario as sick leave, or agree for the time to be taken off as holiday, says Martha McKinley, an employment specialist at the law firm Stephensons. Acas recommends that if someone is told not to come into work, for example if they have returned from China, they should get their usual pay. The chief executive, Susan Clews, said employers had increasingly been getting touch with the service to ask how such cases should be treated. My children have been sent home from school to self-isolate. Can I ask for time off, and will I be paid? Sarah Evans says employees could ask for emergency time off in such a situation. The employer would have to grant this, she says, but again would be under no obligation to pay the employee. In reality, most people would again just work from home. Most employers would probably allow the person to take the time off as holiday, which in most cases is still paid, says McKinley, but they are under no obligation to do so. I have the virus and am off sick. What will be paid? If you are sick or have symptoms you qualify for at least statutory sick pay, or whatever your contract may provide over and above that. Most employers will allow a certain number of days a year on full pay. After that employees are entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) of \u00a394.25 per week, which will be paid for up to 28 weeks. It is paid from the fourth day of sickness. A doctor\u2019s note may not be necessary, although employees can self-certify with symptoms of flu without seeing a doctor, says Evans. I\u2019m self-employed \u2013 what do I get? Nothing, and you are not entitled to SSP either, says McKinley. \u201cOne of the biggest downsides of being self-employed is that in most cases you will not be paid if you do not turn up for work. If the virus spirals out of control, those in the gig economy will be adversely affected and face significant loss of wages.\u201d Can I claim benefits instead? In theory, yes, but be prepared for a long wait. The Department for Work and Pensions has confirmed that people who are prevented from working because of a risk to public health are able to claim universal credit. They may also be entitled to contributory employment and support allowance, which helps with living costs for people who cannot work because of a health condition. Universal credit is paid monthly in arrears, so you will have to wait one calendar month from the date you submitted your application before your first payment is made. This is called your assessment period. You then have to wait up to seven days for the payment to reach your bank account.",

      "body": "<p>Not since Henry VIII first got that glint in his eye has such fuss been made over an urge to start chopping, but here we are: critics the world over are wringing their hands over the length of Hilary Mantel\u2019s much anticipated The Mirror &amp; the Light, which is due out next week.</p> <p>\u201cEven professed admirers of Mantel may find it hard to finish,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/mante-review-cromwell-wolf-hall-mirror-light-review\">Prospect\u2019s review read</a>, suggesting that people who have waited eight years for the third book in a trilogy may not be invested enough. Many other reviews have also suggested (politely, and often underneath glowing praise) that the book, longer than Wolf Hall and double the size of Bring Up the Bodies at roughly 900 pages, needed more of an edit. I say roughly \u2013 almost every review has made mention of the page count and somehow also come up with a different figure to marvel at: <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/hilary-mantel-new-book-mirror-light-review-wolf-hall-trilogy-thomas-cromwell-a9356806.html\">863 pages in the Independent</a>, 912 in the Telegraph and \u201calmost 900\u201d nearly everywhere else, while the New York Times weighed the US edition as a mere \u201cnearly 800 pages\u201d.</p> <p>Regardless of heft, pre-orders in the UK for The Mirror &amp; the Light have long passed Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, showing what an event it is with readers, though Mantel\u2019s willingness to write expansively has won her both prizes and detractors. James Naughtie, chair of the Booker judging panel the year Mantel won for Wolf Hall, later said the decision to give it the award was \u201cbased on the sheer bigness of the book\u201d, whereas Susan Bassnett claimed that she was \u201cyet to meet anyone outside the Booker panel who managed to get to the end of this tedious tome\u201d. But Mantel has also since sold more than 5m copies of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, and was also the first ever Booker winner to make it to the top 10 of the PLR, which ranks public library loans.</p> <p>There is a line of arguments that, after just a few years of being exposed to the evils of 24-hour news and Candy Crush, human beings have rapidly devolved to become distracted, gibbering wrecks with hobbled attention spans. (Notice how this argument is most often made by a) snobs and b) people who talk loudly about the Golden Age of Television and somehow find hours and brains in each day for Netflix.) Interestingly, research has also shown that books are also getting longer.</p> <p>If you struggle to finish big books, there is plenty of advice out there. US librarian and critic Nancy Pearl once laid out the \u201cRule of 50\u201d: if you\u2019re 50 years old or younger, give a book at least 50 pages before giving up on it; if you\u2019re over 50, subtract your age from 100 and use that number instead. (Pearl seems to believe senior citizens may feel more anxious than young whippersnappers about unread books as mortality looms.) But for those who want to conquer long books <a href=\"https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2016/06/17/henry-viiis-last-war/\">like an English king conquering Boulogne</a>, here are some tried and tested tips for sticking with a doorstopper.</p> <p><strong>1 Set goals \u2013 but do take breaks<br></strong>Haruki Murakami once wrote a short story called Sleep, about a woman who discovers she no longer needs it and uses her extra time to finally bash through Anna Karenina. We can\u2019t do that \u2013 but we can dedicate the time by setting a daily goal, even if it seems small to you, say 20 pages. That way, you\u2019re never so far away from it that you lose track of the plot and then your interest. Read after me: it is OK to not read books like an excited tween on a Harry Potter release date.</p> <p><strong>2 Love your phone? Put your book on it<br></strong>Print lovers, stay with me here \u2013 lugging a big hardback around is not tempting for everyone. If you tend to stare at your phone a lot, you can also stare at a book; handily, you can combine the two by installing an ebook app. I tackled Lucy Ellmann\u2019s 1,000-pager Ducks, Newburyport as a PDF and while it took me two months to finish on my commute, I did do it \u2013 and all without blaming it for putting <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/reading-ducks-newburyport-is-mentally-taxing--and-physically-exhausting/2019/09/10/6d34146c-d405-11e9-9610-fb56c5522e1c_story.html\">\u201cundue stress on my upper musculature\u201d</a>, as one Washington Post critic did. And my print copy looks pristine on my shelf.</p> <p><strong>3 Accept that not all books are for everyone<br></strong>Often, people marvel to me that they couldn\u2019t finish The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton or Moby-Dick after spending weeks with them, but got through Patrick Rothfuss\u2019s Kingkiller Chronicles or The Lord of the Rings in a few days. That you couldn\u2019t get to the end of \u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the patience for a long book \u2013 it just means it wasn\u2019t for you. That\u2019s fine. But don\u2019t blame Proust.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Not since Henry VIII first got that glint in his eye has such fuss been made over an urge to start chopping, but here we are: critics the world over are wringing their hands over the length of Hilary Mantel\u2019s much anticipated The Mirror &amp; the Light, which is due out next week. \u201cEven professed admirers of Mantel may find it hard to finish,\u201d Prospect\u2019s review read, suggesting that people who have waited eight years for the third book in a trilogy may not be invested enough. Many other reviews have also suggested (politely, and often underneath glowing praise) that the book, longer than Wolf Hall and double the size of Bring Up the Bodies at roughly 900 pages, needed more of an edit. I say roughly \u2013 almost every review has made mention of the page count and somehow also come up with a different figure to marvel at: 863 pages in the Independent, 912 in the Telegraph and \u201calmost 900\u201d nearly everywhere else, while the New York Times weighed the US edition as a mere \u201cnearly 800 pages\u201d. Regardless of heft, pre-orders in the UK for The Mirror &amp; the Light have long passed Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, showing what an event it is with readers, though Mantel\u2019s willingness to write expansively has won her both prizes and detractors. James Naughtie, chair of the Booker judging panel the year Mantel won for Wolf Hall, later said the decision to give it the award was \u201cbased on the sheer bigness of the book\u201d, whereas Susan Bassnett claimed that she was \u201cyet to meet anyone outside the Booker panel who managed to get to the end of this tedious tome\u201d. But Mantel has also since sold more than 5m copies of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, and was also the first ever Booker winner to make it to the top 10 of the PLR, which ranks public library loans. There is a line of arguments that, after just a few years of being exposed to the evils of 24-hour news and Candy Crush, human beings have rapidly devolved to become distracted, gibbering wrecks with hobbled attention spans. (Notice how this argument is most often made by a) snobs and b) people who talk loudly about the Golden Age of Television and somehow find hours and brains in each day for Netflix.) Interestingly, research has also shown that books are also getting longer. If you struggle to finish big books, there is plenty of advice out there. US librarian and critic Nancy Pearl once laid out the \u201cRule of 50\u201d: if you\u2019re 50 years old or younger, give a book at least 50 pages before giving up on it; if you\u2019re over 50, subtract your age from 100 and use that number instead. (Pearl seems to believe senior citizens may feel more anxious than young whippersnappers about unread books as mortality looms.) But for those who want to conquer long books like an English king conquering Boulogne, here are some tried and tested tips for sticking with a doorstopper. 1 Set goals \u2013 but do take breaks Haruki Murakami once wrote a short story called Sleep, about a woman who discovers she no longer needs it and uses her extra time to finally bash through Anna Karenina. We can\u2019t do that \u2013 but we can dedicate the time by setting a daily goal, even if it seems small to you, say 20 pages. That way, you\u2019re never so far away from it that you lose track of the plot and then your interest. Read after me: it is OK to not read books like an excited tween on a Harry Potter release date. 2 Love your phone? Put your book on it Print lovers, stay with me here \u2013 lugging a big hardback around is not tempting for everyone. If you tend to stare at your phone a lot, you can also stare at a book; handily, you can combine the two by installing an ebook app. I tackled Lucy Ellmann\u2019s 1,000-pager Ducks, Newburyport as a PDF and while it took me two months to finish on my commute, I did do it \u2013 and all without blaming it for putting \u201cundue stress on my upper musculature\u201d, as one Washington Post critic did. And my print copy looks pristine on my shelf. 3 Accept that not all books are for everyone Often, people marvel to me that they couldn\u2019t finish The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton or Moby-Dick after spending weeks with them, but got through Patrick Rothfuss\u2019s Kingkiller Chronicles or The Lord of the Rings in a few days. That you couldn\u2019t get to the end of \u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the patience for a long book \u2013 it just means it wasn\u2019t for you. That\u2019s fine. But don\u2019t blame Proust.",

His coffin was pulled by horse-drawn carriages alongside a procession led by his sons Gamal and Alaa Mubarak and the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, flanked by military top brass and leading religious figures. \u201cA military funeral will be held \u2026 for the former president, on the orders of president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi,\u201d Mubarak\u2019s lawyer and longtime spokesman, Farid el-Deeb, told local news outlet Al-Masry Al-Youm. \u201cThis is evidence that president Sisi is loyal and wise.\u201d Egyptian institutions paid tribute to Mubarak, focusing on his record as a war hero during the 1973 war against neighbouring Israel, as the government carefully managed the former dictator\u2019s legacy to avoid any comparisons with Sisi\u2019s rule. A statement from the Egyptian presidency called Mubarak \u201cone of the leaders and heroes,\u201d of the war against Israel. Egypt\u2019s military also released a statement lauding Mubarak\u2019s record during his time in the Egyptian air force. Mubarak\u2019s 30-year rule was the longest presidency in Egypt\u2019s history, and until his overthrow in 2011 he was the only ruler that many young Egyptians had ever known. Rising through the ranks of the military, he came to power following the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981 and maintained his grip on office through a crackdown on political opposition, routinely running for re-election unopposed and stifling free speech. His rule appeared unshakeable for many Egyptians, despite the contrast between growing poverty and corruption at home and images of Mubarak enjoying a luxurious lifestyle in his many palaces and villas. The former president courted international powers, receiving annual donations of American military aid as a reward for maintaining a \u201ccold peace\u201d with Israel, and winning tacit acceptance from western leaders, who saw him as a driver of regional peace and stability. Mubarak\u2019s overthrow in 2011 was a political earthquake for Egypt and the wider Middle East, part of a wave of Arab tyrants swept from power by popular protests against corruption and repression. The end of his reign came as many seemingly immovable regimes of the region crumbled in the face of popular dissent, causing Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee and resulting in the killing of Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi. But unlike others deposed during 2011, Mubarak remained in the country that rose up against him and stood trial, charged with complicity of the deaths of hundreds during the uprising and on a range of corruption charges. He was initially served a life sentence in 2012 for protester deaths, and later acquitted in 2017, allowing him to walk free. Repeated trials for both him and his sons on a range of corruption and embezzlement charges also eventually resulted in all three being acquitted. Political science professor Rabab El Mahdi who took part in the 2011 revolt that toppled Mubarak, said his death was \u201ca reminder of the failures of the revolution. It\u2019s the end of a chapter with no closure,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of history will be buried with him, with no accountability.\u201d Mubarak\u2019s death comes months after Egyptian security services repressed brief anti-corruption protests against Sisi\u2019s leadership, arresting thousands in order to stifle further dissent. Sisi swept to power in a military coup in 2013, buoyed by a military and security establishment determined to ensure that the popular protests of 2011 never happened again. Aida Seif El-Dawla, of the Nadeem Centre for Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture and Violence, who has worked with victims of torture under both Sisi and Mubarak, said the latter \u201cleft behind someone who will outlive us,\u201d in reference to Sisi. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s nostalgia, but compared with the nightmare we\u2019re living now \u2026 during Mubarak it was tough, torture was rampant and people were in prison. But he and his entourage were political, so sooner or later they had to submit a little.\u201d She described life under Sisi\u2019s rule as \u201crevenge for having revolted against Mubarak\u201d.",

The man is believed to have infected five people and has also been linked to eight other infections, among them health workers and patients at a hospital in Lombardy. According to reports in the Italian media, it took four contacts with doctors before the man was eventually tested for coronavirus, and then only after he had spent 36 hours in the hospital \u2013 a period during which he infected a number of other people.

In France, a second person infected with the coronavirus died late on Tuesday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. The death was one of three new cases in France this week, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 17. Ten cases of the virus have been detected across Spain in the past 36 hours and hundreds of guests and workers remain in quarantine in a hotel in Tenerife after four Italian guests tested positive for coronavirus.

      "body": "<p>The home secretary has signalled another U-turn on law and order with the return of Whitehall-set targets to cut crime and warned police there will be no excuses for failure.</p> <p>Priti Patel told the annual conference of police chiefs that the addition of 20,000 officers over three years as promised by government meant forces should rigorously \u201cinvestigate every type of crime\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThis extra injection of taxpayers\u2019 cash must deliver the crime cuts the public desperately want. In three years\u2019 time when the 20,000 additional officers are through the door, people must see a difference. Less crime, safer streets, no excuses. The public won\u2019t accept them and neither should we.\u201d</p> <p>Patel said a national policing board and a new crime and policing performance board would set \u201coutcomes\u201d on cutting serious crime and other offences. She also promised a cut in bureaucracy.</p> <p>Police chiefs see this as the return of nationally set targets introduced under New Labour and then derided by the Conservatives when they came to power in coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010.</p> <p>The Tories at that time said local communities should set priorities through elected police and crime commissioners rather than Whitehall. Police believed targets were too rigid and could skew priorities.</p> <p>Patel accepted confidence in the criminal justice system had fallen and there were fewer police visible on the streets. Charging rates had halved in four years, to 8% in 2018/9, she noted, and one police watchdog had said the public had \u201crumbled\u201d that police were not investigating crimes such as car thefts, lower-level assaults and burglaries.</p> <p>Patel said: \u201cWe need to investigate every type of crime with the rigour the public expect.\u201d</p> <p>She said the government had given police an unprecedented boost in resources and also new powers, and would back them in fighting crime.</p> <p>The government would demand reductions in murders, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, and improvements in victim satisfaction and diversity in the ranks, she told the conference. \u201cThese outcomes will be non-negotiable and I will be unapologetic about holding you to account.\u201d</p> <p>Some of those listening criticised Patel. Labour\u2019s Sophie Linden, the London deputy mayor for policing, who oversees the Metropolitan police, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the return of nationally set targets. It\u2019s the return of \u2018Whitehall knows best\u2019. We know from previous experience they skewed the way police can operate. They can be dangerous. They damaged public safety and confidence. She also forgot she was a member of the party that cut policing and she voted for the cuts.\u201d</p> <p>Paddy Tipping, the Labour police and crime commissioner for Nottinghamshire, said the home secretary did not have the powers to order police what to do. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to targets. The legal powers belong to chiefs and PCCs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Tom Winsor, addressing the conference after Patel, attacked the Conservatives\u2019 record of cuts, which he said had blighted the police, courts and prisons and had left justice \u201cextinguished in some cases\u201d.</p> <p>Prisons were in chaos, the prosecution service plagued by \u201cdisgraceful\u201d delays and courts hit by decay and left empty, he said. \u201cSo why did the criminal justice system come to this state. Funding cuts are the basic answer.\u201d</p> <p>Dave Thompson, the West Midlands chief constable, said local services had been decimated, leaving police to pick up the pieces, especially in mental health. He said police had come \u201cclose to emptying the bins\u201d instead of preventing or detecting crime as services were cut.</p> <p>Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said the courts and prosecution service were under such strain that adding more police officers may fail to deliver big cuts in crime.</p> <p>\u201cWe can all see it\u2019s [the criminal justice system] not coping now. It\u2019s creaking and in places it\u2019s breaking. More importantly, it\u2019s letting down victims and leaving criminals to walk free,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout serious change, more policing won\u2019t mean more justice. And more policing without more justice is a recipe for corroding legitimacy \u2013 both in us as the police and in all parts of the system.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary has signalled another U-turn on law and order with the return of Whitehall-set targets to cut crime and warned police there will be no excuses for failure. Priti Patel told the annual conference of police chiefs that the addition of 20,000 officers over three years as promised by government meant forces should rigorously \u201cinvestigate every type of crime\u201d. She said: \u201cThis extra injection of taxpayers\u2019 cash must deliver the crime cuts the public desperately want. In three years\u2019 time when the 20,000 additional officers are through the door, people must see a difference. Less crime, safer streets, no excuses. The public won\u2019t accept them and neither should we.\u201d Patel said a national policing board and a new crime and policing performance board would set \u201coutcomes\u201d on cutting serious crime and other offences. She also promised a cut in bureaucracy. Police chiefs see this as the return of nationally set targets introduced under New Labour and then derided by the Conservatives when they came to power in coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010. The Tories at that time said local communities should set priorities through elected police and crime commissioners rather than Whitehall. Police believed targets were too rigid and could skew priorities. Patel accepted confidence in the criminal justice system had fallen and there were fewer police visible on the streets. Charging rates had halved in four years, to 8% in 2018/9, she noted, and one police watchdog had said the public had \u201crumbled\u201d that police were not investigating crimes such as car thefts, lower-level assaults and burglaries. Patel said: \u201cWe need to investigate every type of crime with the rigour the public expect.\u201d She said the government had given police an unprecedented boost in resources and also new powers, and would back them in fighting crime. The government would demand reductions in murders, serious violence and neighbourhood crime, and improvements in victim satisfaction and diversity in the ranks, she told the conference. \u201cThese outcomes will be non-negotiable and I will be unapologetic about holding you to account.\u201d Some of those listening criticised Patel. Labour\u2019s Sophie Linden, the London deputy mayor for policing, who oversees the Metropolitan police, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the return of nationally set targets. It\u2019s the return of \u2018Whitehall knows best\u2019. We know from previous experience they skewed the way police can operate. They can be dangerous. They damaged public safety and confidence. She also forgot she was a member of the party that cut policing and she voted for the cuts.\u201d Paddy Tipping, the Labour police and crime commissioner for Nottinghamshire, said the home secretary did not have the powers to order police what to do. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to targets. The legal powers belong to chiefs and PCCs,\u201d he said. The chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Tom Winsor, addressing the conference after Patel, attacked the Conservatives\u2019 record of cuts, which he said had blighted the police, courts and prisons and had left justice \u201cextinguished in some cases\u201d. Prisons were in chaos, the prosecution service plagued by \u201cdisgraceful\u201d delays and courts hit by decay and left empty, he said. \u201cSo why did the criminal justice system come to this state. Funding cuts are the basic answer.\u201d Dave Thompson, the West Midlands chief constable, said local services had been decimated, leaving police to pick up the pieces, especially in mental health. He said police had come \u201cclose to emptying the bins\u201d instead of preventing or detecting crime as services were cut. Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said the courts and prosecution service were under such strain that adding more police officers may fail to deliver big cuts in crime. \u201cWe can all see it\u2019s [the criminal justice system] not coping now. It\u2019s creaking and in places it\u2019s breaking. More importantly, it\u2019s letting down victims and leaving criminals to walk free,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout serious change, more policing won\u2019t mean more justice. And more policing without more justice is a recipe for corroding legitimacy \u2013 both in us as the police and in all parts of the system.\u201d",

The person could not immediately provide specific details about the length of the hunger strike or whether medical staff needed to intervene. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The mass shooting was brought up several times during the Democratic debate in Charleston on Tuesday evening, ahead of this Saturday\u2019s primary contest in the state. Democratic candidates for the party\u2019s nomination debated about the lack of success in achieving federal gun control legislation in the US in recent years, despite the plethora of devastating mass shootings around the country, in schools, houses of worship and other public gathering places. The debate was taking place, as former vice-president and candidate Joe Biden noted, very close to the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, where Roof was welcomed as a stranger into a Bible study meeting on 17 June 2015 but without warning opened fire on those gathered. Last month he appealed his convictions and death sentence, arguing that he was suffering from schizophrenia and other psychological disorders when he represented himself at his capital trial. Earlier this month, Roof wrote in his letter to the AP that he went on the hunger strike to protest against the treatment he received from a Bureau of Prisons disciplinary hearing officer over earlier complaints that he was refused access to the law library and access to a copy machine to file legal papers. Roof\u2019s 13 February letter indicated he was already \u201cseveral days\u201d into a hunger strike, and he wrote in a follow-up letter that the protest ended a day later after corrections officers forcibly tried to take his blood and insert an IV into his arm, causing him to briefly pass out. \u201cI feel confident I could have gone much, much longer without food,\u201d Roof wrote in the 16 February follow-up letter. \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth being murdered over.\u201d The allegations could not immediately be verified and a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons said the agency had no comment on Roof\u2019s allegations, citing privacy concerns.

As Leach says, this approach is \u201cthe opposite of gender-blind or colourblind or disability-blind casting: when you embrace people\u2019s actual identity, it just brings so much richness to things\u201d. It suggests a cultural shift that appeals as much to imagination as it does to inclusion. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a creative thing then the possibilities are endless, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of theatre.\u201d Oliver Twist is at Leeds Playhouse, 28 February-21 March.

Their vigilante auxiliaries attacked Muslims with impunity, and the Delhi police, which reports to the home minister (and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s right-hand man), Amit Shah, either looked on as goons rioted, arrived after Muslims had been attacked, or actually participated in the violence against people demonstrating against Modi\u2019s discriminatory citizenship law.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7aae4f19-e3dc-4d50-becd-2d1a229b093f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The new citizenship law provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities who have immigrated into India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 31 December 2014.

      "bodyText": "Since Sunday violent mobs in north-east Delhi have killed 21 people including a police constable, injured hundreds of others, burned motor vehicles, set fire to shops and homes, assaulted journalists, vandalised places of worship and destroyed a shrine. The time-honoured convention for reporting on communal violence in India is to not name names. In news reports it is always \u201cviolent members of one religious community\u201d attacking violent members of another. This anonymising ritual has the distorting effect of turning unequal violence into a symmetrical tug of war. It is important, then, to specify that the places of worship vandalised were two mosques and a sufi shrine, that the majority of identified dead people were Muslims, that the thugs frisking reporters, confiscating their phones and beating them up were in every instance Hindu supremacist goons, and that the shops and homes burned nearly always belonged to Muslims. There were occasions when Muslims burned cars, there is video evidence of a man identified as Muslim who fired a gun, and several instances of stone-throwing by Muslims. But the organising impresarios of this devastation were local politicians affiliated to the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), India\u2019s ruling party. They made the incendiary speeches that triggered the violence. Their vigilante auxiliaries attacked Muslims with impunity, and the Delhi police, which reports to the home minister (and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s right-hand man), Amit Shah, either looked on as goons rioted, arrived after Muslims had been attacked, or actually participated in the violence against people demonstrating against Modi\u2019s discriminatory citizenship law. Delhi has not seen this kind of violence for decades \u2013 but it has been worse: in 1984 the Indian National Congress party used the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguard as an excuse for organising a pogrom in which thousands of Sikhs were murdered. The violence in Delhi is not yet a pogrom but a pattern of police complicity, and the political patronage extended to vigilante mobs suggests a continuing public-private partnership designed to violently subdue opposition to the BJP\u2019s Hindu supremacist project. The cutting edge of this majoritarian project is a radical two-pronged assault on Indian citizenship. First, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which is designed to fast-track non-Muslim migrants from carefully chosen Muslim majority countries into citizenship, has created, by implication, a religious test for citizenship. This new law is to be followed by the compilation of a national register of citizens (NRC) that will compel Indians to document their Indianness. Non-Muslims who fail to satisfy the NRC\u2019s tribunals might be able to use the loophole created by the amended citizenship law to find a path to citizenship. Muslims who fail the test will have no recourse: they will be cast into the kind of limbo that the Rohingya experienced in Rakhine before they were violently purged from that province. This statutory, institutional subversion of Muslim citizenship would be a great prize for a majoritarian party like the BJP. It would be, if you like, a halfway house between the voter suppression tactics of the Republican party in the US and the Nuremberg laws of Nazi Germany: less covert than the first but less explicitly bigoted than the second. The CAA/NRC two-step is an existential threat to both Muslim citizenship and India\u2019s now threadbare claim to being a secular, pluralist state. It has provoked an extraordinary pan-Indian campaign of civil disobedience led by Muslims, specifically Muslim women, and university students. After winning a second parliamentary majority in 2019, Modi\u2019s BJP government had seemed unstoppable. The reduction of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into federally governed territories, by stripping it of its constitutionally enshrined autonomy; the supreme court\u2019s judgment ruling that the site of a mosque razed by a Hindu mob in 1992 in Ayodhya could be rebuilt as a Hindu temple, encouraged Modi and Shah to believe that they could spring their citizenship trap without opposition. To be publicly thwarted by a nonviolent movement fronted by Muslims that refuses to use a religious idiom, that invokes India\u2019s constitution and its secular guarantees as holy writ, that wraps itself in the national flag and affirms Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Dalit architect of India\u2019s constitution as its inspiration, has been intensely frustrating for this government. The violent standoff in Delhi between the supporters of the new citizenship law and its opponents has been misleadingly described as a religious clash for a simple reason. The burden of defending secular citizenship has been shouldered disproportionately by Muslims. At the heart of all the sit-ins are Muslim women, and they are mostly located in Muslim neighbourhoods. These sit-ins have become rallying points for a large, vibrant movement in which non-Muslims participate enthusiastically but there are no mainly non-Muslim sit-ins. The BJP government and India\u2019s pliant television news channels have battened on this to paint the protestors as seditious sectarians determined to thwart Modi\u2019s electoral mandate.

If a doctor suspects a person has the virus, they will swab the person\u2019s nose and throat and, if they are able to produce sputum, get a sputum sample and send these to a Public Health England laboratory. Scientists then amplify genetic material called RNA in the samples and look for sections that match the virus\u2019s RNA. The test takes 24 to 48 hours. Once the result is available it is sent back to the clinician who informs the person whether they tested positive or not. When should I keep my children away from school?

Aren\u2019t we all queer now?</p> <p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d he says in his US west coast croak. \u201cI wish! It\u2019s true there might be more traffic in that direction. There\u2019s certainly more tolerance.\u201d His films have surely played their part, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/21/drama\">I\u2019m Not There</a> with Cate Blanchett as one of six physically dissimilar Bob Dylans, the melodrama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/mar/07/artsfeatures2\">Far from Heaven</a> and the lesbian love story <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/26/carol-film-review-cate-blanchett-todd-haynes-rooney-mara\">Carol</a> (Blanchett again, this time falling for Rooney Mara). In particular, Velvet Goldmine, which begins with the infant Oscar Wilde arriving in Dublin by flying saucer, looks now like a manifesto for queerness, though it took years to find its audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"808be1558da0ec9618439906e1080c08e96871c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/808be1558da0ec9618439906e1080c08e96871c0/0_305_2161_1296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Rhys Myers and Toni Collette in Velvet Goldmine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All queer now? \u2026 Jonathan Rhys Myers and Toni Collette in Velvet Goldmine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will the same fate befall his new film Dark Waters? This disturbing real-life conspiracy thriller follows the corporate defence lawyer Rob Bilott, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-ruffalo\">Mark Ruffalo</a>, as he switches sides to expose the misconduct of the industrial giant, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/dupont\">DuPont</a>. For decades, the company had been dumping the unregulated chemical PFOA \u2013 which caused birth defects and cancer \u2013 in Parkersburg, West Virginia; it poisoned the land and livestock and thousands of people.</p> <p>The headline of the 2016 New York Times article on which the film is based says it all: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html\">The lawyer who became DuPont\u2019s worst nightmare</a>.\u201d Bilott is stonewalled, misled and threatened by DuPont but persists doggedly in his fight for justice over more than two decades. No wonder Ruffalo looks exhausted on screen. Hunched, jowly and unsmiling, he resembles a tortoise overburdened by its shell. Watching Dark Waters, you know how he feels.</p> <p>Bilott\u2019s struggle is undeniably heroic, but there is no Erin Brockovich-style reassuring uplift, and the movie closes with a sobering statistic: PFOA, part of the Teflon coating manufactured since the 1950s by DuPont, is now in 99% of life on the planet. It\u2019s a \u201cforever chemical\u201d, which means it never leaves the bloodstream. The horror isn\u2019t just up there on the cinema screen; it\u2019s inside us.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYbNONsH2ck\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jYbNONsH2ck?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYbNONsH2ck\">Watch a trailer for Dark Waters</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Was Haynes aware of the risk of making his audience feel the battle is already lost? \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a sadness in the film,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there are also these feelings about systems of power and how they get challenged and how change occurs. It\u2019s never a silver-bullet solution, and we don\u2019t eliminate the problem. We become aware of it and we do what we can and we keep getting back in the ring and taking those steps forward. And that\u2019s what you see Rob doing. It\u2019s naive to think we\u2019re going to get rid of capitalism or patriarchy or PFOA, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t call these things out and look at specific abuses and the costs to wellbeing. What\u2019s the alternative? To not be bothered?\u201d</p> <p>These sound like the words of an activist, and no wonder: Haynes has been one for as long as he has been making films. In the late 80s, just as he was gaining notoriety for his featurette <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x363le1\">Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story</a>, which used Barbie dolls to stage the life of the Carpenters singer who died of anorexia, he was also closely involved with the highly effective Aids activism group Act-Up and its artists\u2019 collective <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/01/how-aids-was-branded-looking-back-at-act-up-design/251267/\">Gran Fury</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a case of remarkable and very specific change that happened because of direct political action. It had immediate goals that it succeeded in achieving in an expedient amount of time. The idea was, say, to petition and demonstrate outside the National Institute of Health until they change [Aids drug] AZT dosages and costs \u2013 and they did it. We kept going back to DC and doing civil disobedience and getting arrested and it all had a direct effect. It felt like the more specific the issue you were targeting, the better chance you had of affecting it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cbe7c648aba3d4073e2020e8ff78cdbb30cc5d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cbe7c648aba3d4073e2020e8ff78cdbb30cc5d1/111_372_2999_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eerie masterpiece \u2026 Julianne Moore in Safe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eerie masterpiece \u2026 Julianne Moore in Safe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sony Pictures Classics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Dark Waters resembles any of Haynes\u2019s previous work, it would be Safe, his eerie 1995 masterpiece starring Julianne Moore as a middle-class housewife who becomes mysteriously allergic to her environment. The new picture feels like a sequel in spirit \u2013 think of it as Safe 2: This Time It\u2019s Real \u2013 and Haynes indicates as much when he shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anne-hathaway\">Anne Hathaway</a>, as Rob\u2019s wife Sarah, pruning the roses in a precise duplicate of an image of Moore from the earlier movie.</p> <p>Any conversation with this film-maker will range playfully over his past work and its multiple layered allusions, but he seems less keen today to apply that movie-buff approach to Dark Waters. Of course, he will happily discuss the inspiration he took from 70s US cinema: his movie begins, after all, with a prologue set in 1975 and influenced by that year\u2019s big hit, Jaws, except that in this case it\u2019s the water itself rather than any shark that poses a threat to nocturnal skinny-dippers.</p> <p>And the picture\u2019s oppressive, jaundiced visual style deliberately echoes the trilogy of 70s conspiracy thrillers (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067309/\">Klute</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071970/\">The Parallax View</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074119/\">All the President\u2019s Men</a>) directed by Alan J Pakula and shot by Gordon Willis. \u201cI wanted to enter the vernacular and the tradition of the tense, brooding whistleblower films that make us look at systems of power and the instability of capitalist life,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a basic presumption of corruption that so many movies from that era inherited from the late 1960s.\u201d</p> <p>He also tells me that one scene in Dark Waters was shot in the same diner where Blanchett and Mara stop off during their road trip in the 50s-set Carol, and that he regrets missing the opportunity for a spot of self-homage: \u201cWe should have had these two elderly lesbians, much older versions of Cate and Rooney, walking out past the camera,\u201d he laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"077f950d3f03d247f12a4df84c5f91468d7438ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/077f950d3f03d247f12a4df84c5f91468d7438ae/0_0_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Ruffalo in Dark Waters: \u2018a tortoise overburdened by its shell\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Ruffalo in Dark Waters: \u2018a tortoise overburdened by its shell\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/FOCUS FEATURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It quickly transpires that inviting him to riff on what the housewife from Safe would make of Dark Waters or where he imagines that character might be today, as I had planned to do, would be impertinent. And, though I had come to our meeting armed with theories about how contamination has always been at the core of his work \u2013 his 1991 feature debut was even called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_(film)\">Poison</a> \u2013 I soon realise that this isn\u2019t that sort of interview. The material has demanded from him a new seriousness, even solemnity. Dark Waters is as fastidious as any of his films, and not at all the journeyman job that some had predicted, but in discussing it he makes it clear that this isn\u2019t, for once, about him.</p> <p>There\u2019s a deep sorrow, for example, when he reflects on the voting habits of West Virginians. These people who were hit hardest by DuPont\u2019s pollution, and the fallout from deregulated industry, were also the ones who gave Donald Trump the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/west-virginia\">highest vote share of any state </a>(68.5%) in the 2016 election. \u201cI think it\u2019s a grievance position,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t been convinced that the Trump voter is policy-motivated. There\u2019s a lashing-out here, a cultural sense of retaliation against an elite which they feel minimised and overlooked by, and a professional class of experts and know-it-alls. It\u2019s sad, and there seems to be something comparable in the UK:<strong> </strong>this anti-immigrant sensibility and feeling of contempt for an identified \u2018other\u2019 who can be used as scapegoats.</p> <p>\u201cLook, that\u2019s always been available; it\u2019s not like some political skill. People talk about Trump\u2019s savviness. Even people who hate him will say, \u2018Oh, but he can really read the culture. He really knows how to manipulate.\u2019 No! You just go to the lowest common denominator. It\u2019s easy! And it\u2019s always been an option. What\u2019s really frightening is how global it is.\u201d<br><br>About the forthcoming US election he is sure of one thing: the need to fight at all costs. \u201cWhat I can abide the least is when liberal friends of mine have this almost sophisticated defeatism about Trump.\u201d He affects a languid drawl: \u201c\u2018Oh yeah, of course he\u2019s gonna win again.\u2019 And I\u2019m, like, \u2018No. <em>No</em>. You cannot even say that. You can\u2019t think that.\u2019 It becomes in some ways collaborationist. You are letting it happen. You have to work and believe and stand up for every last thing.\u201d</p> <p>What part does cinema play in this? \u201cTo me, there\u2019s a political motivation in all the films I\u2019ve made. I just don\u2019t necessarily believe there\u2019s always a direct correlation; I don\u2019t know that movies change the world. With Dark Waters the idea was to make you look at the world suspiciously again. To say: this is what it feels like to live with your eyes open.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Dark Waters is released in the UK on 28 February and in Australia on 5 March.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Todd Haynes was promoting his glam-rock fantasy Velvet Goldmine in 1998, he knew exactly what he wanted. \u201cWe have a very modest goal for this film,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s just to turn every gay person straight and every straight person gay.\u201d Sitting opposite the 59-year-old director in a London hotel room, I point out that his mission is accomplished. Aren\u2019t we all queer now? \u201cNot quite,\u201d he says in his US west coast croak. \u201cI wish! It\u2019s true there might be more traffic in that direction. There\u2019s certainly more tolerance.\u201d His films have surely played their part, among them I\u2019m Not There with Cate Blanchett as one of six physically dissimilar Bob Dylans, the melodrama Far from Heaven and the lesbian love story Carol (Blanchett again, this time falling for Rooney Mara). In particular, Velvet Goldmine, which begins with the infant Oscar Wilde arriving in Dublin by flying saucer, looks now like a manifesto for queerness, though it took years to find its audience. Will the same fate befall his new film Dark Waters? This disturbing real-life conspiracy thriller follows the corporate defence lawyer Rob Bilott, played by Mark Ruffalo, as he switches sides to expose the misconduct of the industrial giant, DuPont. For decades, the company had been dumping the unregulated chemical PFOA \u2013 which caused birth defects and cancer \u2013 in Parkersburg, West Virginia; it poisoned the land and livestock and thousands of people. The headline of the 2016 New York Times article on which the film is based says it all: \u201cThe lawyer who became DuPont\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d Bilott is stonewalled, misled and threatened by DuPont but persists doggedly in his fight for justice over more than two decades. No wonder Ruffalo looks exhausted on screen. Hunched, jowly and unsmiling, he resembles a tortoise overburdened by its shell. Watching Dark Waters, you know how he feels. Bilott\u2019s struggle is undeniably heroic, but there is no Erin Brockovich-style reassuring uplift, and the movie closes with a sobering statistic: PFOA, part of the Teflon coating manufactured since the 1950s by DuPont, is now in 99% of life on the planet. It\u2019s a \u201cforever chemical\u201d, which means it never leaves the bloodstream. The horror isn\u2019t just up there on the cinema screen; it\u2019s inside us. Was Haynes aware of the risk of making his audience feel the battle is already lost? \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a sadness in the film,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there are also these feelings about systems of power and how they get challenged and how change occurs. It\u2019s never a silver-bullet solution, and we don\u2019t eliminate the problem. We become aware of it and we do what we can and we keep getting back in the ring and taking those steps forward. And that\u2019s what you see Rob doing. It\u2019s naive to think we\u2019re going to get rid of capitalism or patriarchy or PFOA, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t call these things out and look at specific abuses and the costs to wellbeing. What\u2019s the alternative? To not be bothered?\u201d These sound like the words of an activist, and no wonder: Haynes has been one for as long as he has been making films. In the late 80s, just as he was gaining notoriety for his featurette Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, which used Barbie dolls to stage the life of the Carpenters singer who died of anorexia, he was also closely involved with the highly effective Aids activism group Act-Up and its artists\u2019 collective Gran Fury. \u201cThat was a case of remarkable and very specific change that happened because of direct political action. It had immediate goals that it succeeded in achieving in an expedient amount of time. The idea was, say, to petition and demonstrate outside the National Institute of Health until they change [Aids drug] AZT dosages and costs \u2013 and they did it. We kept going back to DC and doing civil disobedience and getting arrested and it all had a direct effect. It felt like the more specific the issue you were targeting, the better chance you had of affecting it.\u201d If Dark Waters resembles any of Haynes\u2019s previous work, it would be Safe, his eerie 1995 masterpiece starring Julianne Moore as a middle-class housewife who becomes mysteriously allergic to her environment. The new picture feels like a sequel in spirit \u2013 think of it as Safe 2: This Time It\u2019s Real \u2013 and Haynes indicates as much when he shows Anne Hathaway, as Rob\u2019s wife Sarah, pruning the roses in a precise duplicate of an image of Moore from the earlier movie. Any conversation with this film-maker will range playfully over his past work and its multiple layered allusions, but he seems less keen today to apply that movie-buff approach to Dark Waters. Of course, he will happily discuss the inspiration he took from 70s US cinema: his movie begins, after all, with a prologue set in 1975 and influenced by that year\u2019s big hit, Jaws, except that in this case it\u2019s the water itself rather than any shark that poses a threat to nocturnal skinny-dippers. And the picture\u2019s oppressive, jaundiced visual style deliberately echoes the trilogy of 70s conspiracy thrillers (Klute, The Parallax View, All the President\u2019s Men) directed by Alan J Pakula and shot by Gordon Willis. \u201cI wanted to enter the vernacular and the tradition of the tense, brooding whistleblower films that make us look at systems of power and the instability of capitalist life,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a basic presumption of corruption that so many movies from that era inherited from the late 1960s.\u201d He also tells me that one scene in Dark Waters was shot in the same diner where Blanchett and Mara stop off during their road trip in the 50s-set Carol, and that he regrets missing the opportunity for a spot of self-homage: \u201cWe should have had these two elderly lesbians, much older versions of Cate and Rooney, walking out past the camera,\u201d he laughs. It quickly transpires that inviting him to riff on what the housewife from Safe would make of Dark Waters or where he imagines that character might be today, as I had planned to do, would be impertinent. And, though I had come to our meeting armed with theories about how contamination has always been at the core of his work \u2013 his 1991 feature debut was even called Poison \u2013 I soon realise that this isn\u2019t that sort of interview. The material has demanded from him a new seriousness, even solemnity. Dark Waters is as fastidious as any of his films, and not at all the journeyman job that some had predicted, but in discussing it he makes it clear that this isn\u2019t, for once, about him. There\u2019s a deep sorrow, for example, when he reflects on the voting habits of West Virginians. These people who were hit hardest by DuPont\u2019s pollution, and the fallout from deregulated industry, were also the ones who gave Donald Trump the highest vote share of any state (68.5%) in the 2016 election. \u201cI think it\u2019s a grievance position,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t been convinced that the Trump voter is policy-motivated. There\u2019s a lashing-out here, a cultural sense of retaliation against an elite which they feel minimised and overlooked by, and a professional class of experts and know-it-alls. It\u2019s sad, and there seems to be something comparable in the UK: this anti-immigrant sensibility and feeling of contempt for an identified \u2018other\u2019 who can be used as scapegoats. \u201cLook, that\u2019s always been available; it\u2019s not like some political skill. People talk about Trump\u2019s savviness. Even people who hate him will say, \u2018Oh, but he can really read the culture. He really knows how to manipulate.\u2019 No! You just go to the lowest common denominator. It\u2019s easy! And it\u2019s always been an option. What\u2019s really frightening is how global it is.\u201d About the forthcoming US election he is sure of one thing: the need to fight at all costs. \u201cWhat I can abide the least is when liberal friends of mine have this almost sophisticated defeatism about Trump.\u201d He affects a languid drawl: \u201c\u2018Oh yeah, of course he\u2019s gonna win again.\u2019 And I\u2019m, like, \u2018No. No. You cannot even say that. You can\u2019t think that.\u2019 It becomes in some ways collaborationist. You are letting it happen. You have to work and believe and stand up for every last thing.\u201d What part does cinema play in this? \u201cTo me, there\u2019s a political motivation in all the films I\u2019ve made. I just don\u2019t necessarily believe there\u2019s always a direct correlation; I don\u2019t know that movies change the world. With Dark Waters the idea was to make you look at the world suspiciously again. To say: this is what it feels like to live with your eyes open.\u201d \u2022 Dark Waters is released in the UK on 28 February and in Australia on 5 March.",

Alex Haebe of the Fairmont St Andrews in Scotland even uses the spread in his traditional German sourdough. \u201cDuring the bread production, this process can be used to increase the salt content without crushing the fresh yeast,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect base for dough production.\u201d Meanwhile, if I hadn\u2019t told you Bains has long basted his meat in Marmite butter, you would never have known. Therein lies its strength, Bains says. \u201cI\u2019d never have Marmite on toast, but reducing it down into a concentrate and mixing it with butter \u2013 it\u2019s like a veal stock, really.\u201d Marmite\u2019s makers have clocked this. \u201cWe have found some Marmite haters, who hate the strong umami taste of Marmite on toast, find it much more palatable when used as an ingredient in a recipe,\u201d says Williamson. The foray into pot noodles and peanut butter might not pull in purists \u2013 \u201cthe equivalent of BBQ-flavoured crisps\u201d is how one \u201clover\u201d described Marmite spin-offs \u2013 but it could well tempt those who have knowingly or accidentally enjoyed it as an ingredient. And there\u2019s more to this than marketing \u2013 or even taste. \u201cMarmite also taps into certain wider trends in the food world,\u201d says Shokofeh Hejazi, the senior trend analyst at The Food People. These include concerns about food waste (Marmite is made from leftover brewer\u2019s yeast; at Alchemilla in Nottingham, the chef Alex Bond makes his own from leftover sourdough) and the rise in plant-based diets, to which the spread brings a delicious and nutritious counterpoint. \u201cMarmite is rich in vitamin B12 \u2013 a vitamin naturally found mostly in animal products,\u201d Hejazi says, \u201cand it is packed full of umami and salty flavour.\u201d As my Marmite-fan friend Emily enthuses: \u201cIf you\u2019re a meat-eater turned vegetarian, it should be top of your shopping list.\u201d Used well \u2013 either by chefs or by Marmite themselves in sprouts, nut butters and noodles \u2013 \u201cit has all the complexity of an eight-hour slow-cooked, Maillard-reacted, charred-yet-tender prime cut of beef distilled into a gooey, caramel-textured liquor\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 February 2020. An earlier version wrongly referred to Alex Haebe as Andrew Haebe. This has now been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>George RR Martin is celebrating after a palaeontologist, who named a new genus of pterosaur after the dragons of House Targaryen, agreed with him that dragons should have two, rather than four, legs.</p> <p>The fossilised bones of <em>Targaryendraco wiedenrothi</em>, which lived 130m years ago, were discovered by Kurt Wiedenroth in 1984 in northern Germany. The specimen was originally classified within the <em>Ornithocheirus</em> group of pterosaurs, as <em>Ornithocheirus wiedenrothi</em>, but<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08912963.2019.1690482?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true\"> the toothy pterosaur has now been reassigned to the new genus </a><em><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08912963.2019.1690482?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true\">Targaryendraco</a></em>. Six other already known pterosaurs were also found to be closely related to the group, which features pterosaurs with wingspans between 10 and 26 feet, and narrow snouts.</p> <p>\u201cAll these species are from shallow coastal environments and probably fed on fish,\u201d study leader Rodrigo P\u00eagas, a palaeontologist at Federal University of ABC in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/11/new-pterosaur-species-named-for-targaryen-game-of-thrones-dragons/\">told National Geographic</a>. \u201cThe slenderness of jaw is the main feature they share \u2026 it\u2019s the most extreme slenderness in the jaws of any toothed pterosaurs.\u201d</p> <p>The wings, he added, \u201cwere elongate and narrow, and this shape is specific for modern birds and bats that fish on the wing\u201d.</p> <p>Martin <a href=\"https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/\">called the decision to name the genus</a> after the former royal house from his Game of Thrones books \u201creally too cool\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI am delighted, needless to say. Especially by the kind words of the discoverer, paleontologist Rodrigo P\u00eagas, who is solidly on my side about dragons having two legs, not four,\u201d he said.</p> <p>P\u00eagas and his co-authors chose the name because the oddly dark fossils reminded them of the black bones of the dragons from Martin\u2019s fantasy series, and because \u201cpterosaurs have inspired some biological aspects of the dragons\u201d, they write.</p> <p>Dragons are often depicted with four legs and two wings \u2013 \u201cbut this doesn\u2019t make any biological sense,\u201d P\u00eagas <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/11/new-pterosaur-species-named-for-targaryen-game-of-thrones-dragons/\">told National Geographic</a> \u2013 whereas Martin\u2019s versions have two hind legs and two wings. \u201cI always thought this was very nice, especially because I work on pterosaurs,\u201d said P\u00eagas, adding that he was \u201ca big nerd and a big fan of Game of Thrones\u201d.</p> <p>According to biologists, however, Martin\u2019s dragons would not have been able to fly. \u201cSome estimates suggest that the biggest pterosaurs were at the limit of the weight of viable flying animals and yet the dragons have smaller wings, smaller muscles and none of the weight saving in the bones, legs or tail. They would have been grounded even before we take into account the full sizes that these animals are supposed to get to (capable of swallowing a horse apparently!),\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/23/biology-would-leave-the-game-of-thrones-dragons-grounded\">wrote Dr Dave Hone in the Guardian</a>, after analysing the possibilities.</p> <p>Martin said there was, sadly, \u201cno evidence that the real-life <em>Targaryendraco wiedenrothi</em> actually breathed fire\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo evidence\u2026 yet,\u201d added the novelist, who is working on the sixth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "George RR Martin is celebrating after a palaeontologist, who named a new genus of pterosaur after the dragons of House Targaryen, agreed with him that dragons should have two, rather than four, legs. The fossilised bones of Targaryendraco wiedenrothi, which lived 130m years ago, were discovered by Kurt Wiedenroth in 1984 in northern Germany. The specimen was originally classified within the Ornithocheirus group of pterosaurs, as Ornithocheirus wiedenrothi, but the toothy pterosaur has now been reassigned to the new genus Targaryendraco. Six other already known pterosaurs were also found to be closely related to the group, which features pterosaurs with wingspans between 10 and 26 feet, and narrow snouts. \u201cAll these species are from shallow coastal environments and probably fed on fish,\u201d study leader Rodrigo P\u00eagas, a palaeontologist at Federal University of ABC in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, told National Geographic. \u201cThe slenderness of jaw is the main feature they share \u2026 it\u2019s the most extreme slenderness in the jaws of any toothed pterosaurs.\u201d The wings, he added, \u201cwere elongate and narrow, and this shape is specific for modern birds and bats that fish on the wing\u201d. Martin called the decision to name the genus after the former royal house from his Game of Thrones books \u201creally too cool\u201d. \u201cI am delighted, needless to say. Especially by the kind words of the discoverer, paleontologist Rodrigo P\u00eagas, who is solidly on my side about dragons having two legs, not four,\u201d he said. P\u00eagas and his co-authors chose the name because the oddly dark fossils reminded them of the black bones of the dragons from Martin\u2019s fantasy series, and because \u201cpterosaurs have inspired some biological aspects of the dragons\u201d, they write. Dragons are often depicted with four legs and two wings \u2013 \u201cbut this doesn\u2019t make any biological sense,\u201d P\u00eagas told National Geographic \u2013 whereas Martin\u2019s versions have two hind legs and two wings. \u201cI always thought this was very nice, especially because I work on pterosaurs,\u201d said P\u00eagas, adding that he was \u201ca big nerd and a big fan of Game of Thrones\u201d. According to biologists, however, Martin\u2019s dragons would not have been able to fly. \u201cSome estimates suggest that the biggest pterosaurs were at the limit of the weight of viable flying animals and yet the dragons have smaller wings, smaller muscles and none of the weight saving in the bones, legs or tail. They would have been grounded even before we take into account the full sizes that these animals are supposed to get to (capable of swallowing a horse apparently!),\u201d wrote Dr Dave Hone in the Guardian, after analysing the possibilities. Martin said there was, sadly, \u201cno evidence that the real-life Targaryendraco wiedenrothi actually breathed fire\u201d. \u201cNo evidence\u2026 yet,\u201d added the novelist, who is working on the sixth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m not sure what I expected a collector of hyper-realistic baby dolls to look like, but Kellie Eldred isn\u2019t it. On the frigid midwinter morning that I arrive at her Ithaca, New York, home, she greets me brightly in leggings and a cropped sweatshirt branded with the logo of a local Pilates studio. Her ink-black hair is pulled into a pert bun behind the most perfectly straight bangs I\u2019ve ever seen. She just finished working out, she tells me, as she leads me past her husband and a trio of friendly spaniels into a spotless kitchen. A squeaky toy appears at my feet; its four-legged owner barks for a reaction.</p> \n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Eldred scolds the spaniel. To me, apologetically, she says: \u201cShe\u2019s just a little crazy.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cA little crazy\u201d is the same way Eldred describes the vast network of doll buyers, sellers, creators and collectors she belongs to. From Sydney to Manchester, Tokyo to San Jose, its members spend upwards of $20,000 for one doll to add to their nurseries. Some of these collectors, like Eldred, have children of their own; many don\u2019t. Most are women. They meet in web forums and on Facebook, through YouTube channels and, of course, in the niche online marketplaces of Etsy and eBay.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73d6ad37181d7faf65aa30d887deedd6033a4a02\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73d6ad37181d7faf65aa30d887deedd6033a4a02/0_0_4240_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kellie Eldred outside the nursery she built for her reborn doll.

Eldred bought her first doll on eBay in 1999.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was on eBay, way back in 1999, that Eldred found the doll that would change her life. Stripped of its factory-made features, this doll had been remodeled by an artist \u2013 or, in the parlance of collectors, <em>reborn</em> \u2013 to better resemble an actual infant. Its torso had been weighted with flour; Crayola box approximations of flesh tones were painted over in the bruised pulp palate of living human skin. In the shape of its eyes, the doll bore a striking resemblance to Eldred\u2019s daughter Lexi as a baby.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d never seen or heard of anything like it,\u201d she recalls. Though she agonized over its $100 price tag, she couldn\u2019t get the doll out of her head. While she\u2019s bought and sold dozens of other reborns<strong> </strong>since, she still has her first.</p> \n<p>In the more than two decades since Eldred discovered these dolls, the rise of social media has expanded the number of worldwide collectors by an order of magnitude. Today, more than 30,000 people subscribe to her YouTube channel, where videos of her cuddling, changing and talking about dolls have amassed more than 14,450,000 views.</p> \n<p>The proliferation of these lifelike dolls has led to innovations in the dolls\u2019 creation. Many of the latest dolls are custom-shaped from proprietary silicone blends and poured into molds that, in some instances, have been sculpted in the likeness of real newborns. The current star of Eldred\u2019s YouTube channel, a reborn named Monroe, was made by a husband and wife team of dollmakers whose unique silicone feels remarkably like skin to the touch.</p> \n<p>\u201cSee how, if you press down on her arm, it takes a second for the skin to settle?\u201d asks Eldred. I press, gently, to feel the skin yield beneath my fingertips. <em>Squeez</em><em>y, </em>I think. Like a memory foam stress ball. Like a fat baby\u2019s face.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"786c2012-290c-4723-bb56-f2ea323d11a2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yP09Gm5rp9I?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Monroe is one of two dolls currently on display in the powder pink nursery where Eldred shoots her videos (she now has some misgivings about the color choice; \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always film too well,\u201d she admits). There\u2019s a rocking chair and a crib, a changing table and a dresser. Scallop-collared ensembles by the French children\u2019s clothier Jacadi hang on tiny hangers. When I timidly ask about a baby bottle \u2013white with what appears to be formula \u2013 perched alongside a tube of diaper ointment and talc, I\u2019m assured that they\u2019re all just props. \u201cThere are collectors that love to role-play,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not that collector.\u201d</p> \n<p>Deeply entrenched as she is in the online spaces, this is a hobby she keeps mostly to herself offline. She doesn\u2019t take the dolls out in public, like some collectors do. And, though she says her two adult daughters aren\u2019t fussed by her collecting \u2013 she\u2019s been into the hobby for most of their lives \u2013 her husband will occasionally let slip a derisive remark during disagreements.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause of the hobby, and the misunderstanding, not really getting why we love the hobby so much, I think it\u2019s hard for family members at times and it becomes an easy target,\u201d says Eldred <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzTM1Aj4bmM\">in a 2019 video</a>. Coping with outside judgment is a recurring topic on her YouTube channel, and one that\u2019s echoed by other doll creators and collectors online.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"36d304f3bca8ca0d9b78ca8ca3a079ab77e11855\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d304f3bca8ca0d9b78ca8ca3a079ab77e11855/0_0_4240_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The current star of Eldred\u2019s YouTube channel, a reborn named Monroe, was made by a husband and wife team of dollmakers whose unique silicone feels remarkably like skin to the touch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The current star of Eldred\u2019s YouTube channel, a reborn named Monroe, was made by a husband and wife team of dollmakers whose unique silicone feels remarkably like skin to the touch.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By and large, however, Eldred thinks that finger-pointing from outsiders may have waned in recent years. If nothing else, the community\u2019s increased exposure on social media has made more people familiar with it. But Eldred can\u2019t imagine a future in which her hobby is accepted by the mainstream.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrying to explain to a non-doll collector this emotional attachment to an inanimate object, people don\u2019t get it,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBSDMOWH3gY&amp;t=717s\">says</a> in one of her YouTube videos. Its title: \u201cWhy Our Hobby Isn\u2019t Mainstream\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p>What are we to make of grown women playing mommy with these dolls?</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a question that Emilie St Hilaire, a humanities PhD student at Concordia University in Montreal, has spent the last three years looking into. Her research concerns the \u201cqueer and uncanny\u201d aspects of reborns as a subcultural phenomenon. She\u2019s especially interested in the questions the hobby raises around non-reproductive mothering, adult modes of play and, concurrently, relationships with non-human surrogates. This means she often bumps up against the widely held assumption that reborn collectors are substituting dolls for children. It\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the hobby that belies deep-seated beliefs about a woman\u2019s role in society.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you really try to unpack why a childless woman, particularly one who has something that looks like a fake baby, is threatening, then we start to get to what we see as the role of women: a successful woman is a successful mother,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>St Hilaire points out that, of the dozens of reborn collectors that she\u2019s surveyed worldwide, none think of their dolls as \u201creal\u201d babies. (And, contrary to what many assume about collectors, she estimates that half of them already have children of their own.) Instead, St Hilaire has observed that the dolls tend to satisfy an imaginative itch in collectors, whether they\u2019re making reborns from kits and online tutorials or merely choosing how to dress them. In her view, the dolls aren\u2019t child substitutes so much as companionate props in something like a large-scale roleplaying game.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me want to have babies, at all,\u201d says Stephanie Ortiz, a maker and collector in her mid-30s. She and her wife Jackie ship the reborns they create in their Fresno, California, kitchen \u2013 where doll arms, legs and heads of all hues hang on the walls like surrealist cabinetry \u2013 to buyers in the US, the UK, Australia, Germany, Canada and New Zealand. The YouTube channels where they show off their wares have about 400,000 subscribers altogether.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5f76dabf52895b294f81c4c4565232bfa6b7cfe8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5616_3744&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F3e91d2376246f0680cbf32cf4513f61af830be25%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5616_3744&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F5f76dabf52895b294f81c4c4565232bfa6b7cfe8%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5616_3744&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F3e91d2376246f0680cbf32cf4513f61af830be25%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5616_3744&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\">.</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Stephanie Ortiz puts the finishing touches to a new doll. Photograph: Tom Silverstone / The Guardian\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With her forthcoming manner and faux-hawk, Ortiz describes herself as a lifelong tomboy. But for as long as she can remember, she\u2019s had a fascination with dolls. \u201cI remember when I was a kid, I just wanted the most realistic baby [doll] I could have,\u201d she recalls. \u201cEven as I was beating up my cousins who were boys.\u201d To her, the dolls are about indulging her inner child and having fun; kids are a responsibility. As she wryly points out, a doll \u201cdoesn\u2019t turn into a teenager who wants an iPhone 11\u201d.</p> \n<p>St Hilaire has found that some collectors get a kick from bringing their dolls into public spaces and watching strangers mistake them for real babies. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a secret,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Recent pop cultural depictions tell a different story. An episode of the HBO series High Maintenance chronicles a woman\u2019s descent into quasi-maternal delusion after buying a silicone reborn she names \u201cBaby Nico\u201d and whose care and companionship become increasingly central to her life (to the chagrin of her baffled, yet supportive, husband). She changes the doll\u2019s diapers, talks to it, takes it out. When the woman and her husband forget Baby Nico\u2019s stroller outside a hardware store, its dollness gets a heartbreaking and very public reveal \u2013 and becomes a proxy for the woman\u2019s unspoken loss and regret.</p> \n<p>The new Apple TV+ series Servant serves up a much less oblique indictment of reborn collectors\u2019 psychological states. In it, a couple take in a doll they name Jericho and treat as a human baby, replete with a mysterious live-in nanny. Turns out \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 that the couple is mourning the recent death of their actual baby (also named Jericho), and the doll is the bereft mother\u2019s only guard against a grief-induced state of catatonia.</p> \n<p>Though the fake baby trope is wildly misleading, it\u2019s true that reborn collectors don\u2019t see their reborns as merely toys. Most, says St Hilaire, echo Eldred\u2019s emotional attachment to their dolls. St Hilaire describes this dynamic as \u201ca kind of synthetic relationship\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fe57d838774b8acd8f304e55bcfb85d5e8022bcec%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5616_3744&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F1184b6d3693b171c85958d88748a9f233b5a3821%3Fcrop%3D0_0_5616_3744&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Lucenda Plancarte and her husband sit with their reborn doll, Joseph.

In reborn relationships, St Hilaire sees promising implications for the future of artificial intelligence and forms of non-human or humanoid companionship.</p> \n<p>Then, there\u2019s the biological response that\u2019s triggered when handling a realistically proportioned, lifelike baby doll. Studies suggest that doll therapy can reinforce feelings of attachment and emotional wellbeing in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4001059/\">some patients</a> with dementia. Many reborn collectors similarly point to the therapeutic benefits of their dolls for managing mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s comfort in cuddling and physically holding something that feels like a baby, even though it\u2019s not a baby,\u201d says St Hilaire. \u201cIt can release some of the same endorphins.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Lucenda Plancarte, who is a friend of Ortiz and a reborn collector in her early 30s, the hobby\u2019s therapeutic benefits are twofold.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have polycystic ovarian syndrome and stage four endometriosis,\u201d she explains from her home in Compton, California. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been proven infertile. I\u2019ve already had multiple treatments, surgeries, seen different doctors. [Having children is] just not in my cards.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6719346ab8596ba2f9a61f2eed4ef3f9cdba9011\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6719346ab8596ba2f9a61f2eed4ef3f9cdba9011/0_0_4240_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monroe is one of two dolls currently on display in the powder pink nursery where Eldred shoots her videos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monroe is one of two dolls currently on display in the powder pink nursery where Eldred shoots her videos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Stripped of her plans for biological motherhood, Plancarte fell into a deep depression. She couldn\u2019t walk past the baby departments of her local Target and Walmart without being reminded of her unlucky draw. But, as fate would have it, a solution emerged in 2012. And in an unexpected place: An episode of the TLC reality series My Strange Addiction<em>. </em>The show had featured a reborn collector; Plancarte says she was \u201cintrigued\u201d. It was her husband\u2019s idea that she buy one for herself, despite the $120 price tag.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen she arrived, and it was the most magical experience ever,\u201d says Plancarte. \u201cI was in love. It was amazing. I was like, how in the world have I never owned a reborn before? And it gave me a sense of purpose.\u201d</p> \n<p>Plancarte loves being able to shop for her dolls in the same baby departments that were once a reminder of the things she was missing out on. Caring for them, she says, is a \u201ccoping mechanism\u201d.</p> \n<p>Plancarte knows she\u2019s risking confrontation when she takes her dolls out in public. \u201cIt comes with the territory,\u201d she says. When people ask questions, she answers: the dolls are objects of art, and they make her feel good. They\u2019re not replacements for children.</p> \n<p>\u201cRight now, fostering and adoption \u2013 it\u2019s not the right time for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when it is, then I\u2019ll pursue that path. But right now, my path is collecting reborns, minding my own business, and sharing it with the world on Instagram and YouTube.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>This article was amended on 26 February 2020 to correct the name of Stephanie Ortiz\u2019s wife.</p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m not sure what I expected a collector of hyper-realistic baby dolls to look like, but Kellie Eldred isn\u2019t it. On the frigid midwinter morning that I arrive at her Ithaca, New York, home, she greets me brightly in leggings and a cropped sweatshirt branded with the logo of a local Pilates studio. Her ink-black hair is pulled into a pert bun behind the most perfectly straight bangs I\u2019ve ever seen. She just finished working out, she tells me, as she leads me past her husband and a trio of friendly spaniels into a spotless kitchen. A squeaky toy appears at my feet; its four-legged owner barks for a reaction. \u201cPlease,\u201d Eldred scolds the spaniel. To me, apologetically, she says: \u201cShe\u2019s just a little crazy.\u201d \u201cA little crazy\u201d is the same way Eldred describes the vast network of doll buyers, sellers, creators and collectors she belongs to. From Sydney to Manchester, Tokyo to San Jose, its members spend upwards of $20,000 for one doll to add to their nurseries. Some of these collectors, like Eldred, have children of their own; many don\u2019t. Most are women. They meet in web forums and on Facebook, through YouTube channels and, of course, in the niche online marketplaces of Etsy and eBay. It was on eBay, way back in 1999, that Eldred found the doll that would change her life. Stripped of its factory-made features, this doll had been remodeled by an artist \u2013 or, in the parlance of collectors, reborn \u2013 to better resemble an actual infant. Its torso had been weighted with flour; Crayola box approximations of flesh tones were painted over in the bruised pulp palate of living human skin. In the shape of its eyes, the doll bore a striking resemblance to Eldred\u2019s daughter Lexi as a baby. \u201cI\u2019d never seen or heard of anything like it,\u201d she recalls. Though she agonized over its $100 price tag, she couldn\u2019t get the doll out of her head. While she\u2019s bought and sold dozens of other reborns since, she still has her first. In the more than two decades since Eldred discovered these dolls, the rise of social media has expanded the number of worldwide collectors by an order of magnitude. Today, more than 30,000 people subscribe to her YouTube channel, where videos of her cuddling, changing and talking about dolls have amassed more than 14,450,000 views. The proliferation of these lifelike dolls has led to innovations in the dolls\u2019 creation. Many of the latest dolls are custom-shaped from proprietary silicone blends and poured into molds that, in some instances, have been sculpted in the likeness of real newborns. The current star of Eldred\u2019s YouTube channel, a reborn named Monroe, was made by a husband and wife team of dollmakers whose unique silicone feels remarkably like skin to the touch. \u201cSee how, if you press down on her arm, it takes a second for the skin to settle?\u201d asks Eldred. I press, gently, to feel the skin yield beneath my fingertips. Squeezy, I think. Like a memory foam stress ball. Like a fat baby\u2019s face. Monroe is one of two dolls currently on display in the powder pink nursery where Eldred shoots her videos (she now has some misgivings about the color choice; \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always film too well,\u201d she admits). There\u2019s a rocking chair and a crib, a changing table and a dresser. Scallop-collared ensembles by the French children\u2019s clothier Jacadi hang on tiny hangers. When I timidly ask about a baby bottle \u2013white with what appears to be formula \u2013 perched alongside a tube of diaper ointment and talc, I\u2019m assured that they\u2019re all just props. \u201cThere are collectors that love to role-play,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not that collector.\u201d Deeply entrenched as she is in the online spaces, this is a hobby she keeps mostly to herself offline. She doesn\u2019t take the dolls out in public, like some collectors do. And, though she says her two adult daughters aren\u2019t fussed by her collecting \u2013 she\u2019s been into the hobby for most of their lives \u2013 her husband will occasionally let slip a derisive remark during disagreements. \u201cBecause of the hobby, and the misunderstanding, not really getting why we love the hobby so much, I think it\u2019s hard for family members at times and it becomes an easy target,\u201d says Eldred in a 2019 video. Coping with outside judgment is a recurring topic on her YouTube channel, and one that\u2019s echoed by other doll creators and collectors online. By and large, however, Eldred thinks that finger-pointing from outsiders may have waned in recent years. If nothing else, the community\u2019s increased exposure on social media has made more people familiar with it. But Eldred can\u2019t imagine a future in which her hobby is accepted by the mainstream. \u201cTrying to explain to a non-doll collector this emotional attachment to an inanimate object, people don\u2019t get it,\u201d she says in one of her YouTube videos. Its title: \u201cWhy Our Hobby Isn\u2019t Mainstream\u201d. \u2022\u2022\u2022 What are we to make of grown women playing mommy with these dolls? It\u2019s a question that Emilie St Hilaire, a humanities PhD student at Concordia University in Montreal, has spent the last three years looking into. Her research concerns the \u201cqueer and uncanny\u201d aspects of reborns as a subcultural phenomenon. She\u2019s especially interested in the questions the hobby raises around non-reproductive mothering, adult modes of play and, concurrently, relationships with non-human surrogates. This means she often bumps up against the widely held assumption that reborn collectors are substituting dolls for children. It\u2019s a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the hobby that belies deep-seated beliefs about a woman\u2019s role in society. \u201cIf you really try to unpack why a childless woman, particularly one who has something that looks like a fake baby, is threatening, then we start to get to what we see as the role of women: a successful woman is a successful mother,\u201d she says. St Hilaire points out that, of the dozens of reborn collectors that she\u2019s surveyed worldwide, none think of their dolls as \u201creal\u201d babies. (And, contrary to what many assume about collectors, she estimates that half of them already have children of their own.) Instead, St Hilaire has observed that the dolls tend to satisfy an imaginative itch in collectors, whether they\u2019re making reborns from kits and online tutorials or merely choosing how to dress them. In her view, the dolls aren\u2019t child substitutes so much as companionate props in something like a large-scale roleplaying game. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me want to have babies, at all,\u201d says Stephanie Ortiz, a maker and collector in her mid-30s. She and her wife Jackie ship the reborns they create in their Fresno, California, kitchen \u2013 where doll arms, legs and heads of all hues hang on the walls like surrealist cabinetry \u2013 to buyers in the US, the UK, Australia, Germany, Canada and New Zealand. The YouTube channels where they show off their wares have about 400,000 subscribers altogether. With her forthcoming manner and faux-hawk, Ortiz describes herself as a lifelong tomboy. But for as long as she can remember, she\u2019s had a fascination with dolls. \u201cI remember when I was a kid, I just wanted the most realistic baby [doll] I could have,\u201d she recalls. \u201cEven as I was beating up my cousins who were boys.\u201d To her, the dolls are about indulging her inner child and having fun; kids are a responsibility. As she wryly points out, a doll \u201cdoesn\u2019t turn into a teenager who wants an iPhone 11\u201d. St Hilaire has found that some collectors get a kick from bringing their dolls into public spaces and watching strangers mistake them for real babies. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a secret,\u201d she says. Recent pop cultural depictions tell a different story. An episode of the HBO series High Maintenance chronicles a woman\u2019s descent into quasi-maternal delusion after buying a silicone reborn she names \u201cBaby Nico\u201d and whose care and companionship become increasingly central to her life (to the chagrin of her baffled, yet supportive, husband). She changes the doll\u2019s diapers, talks to it, takes it out. When the woman and her husband forget Baby Nico\u2019s stroller outside a hardware store, its dollness gets a heartbreaking and very public reveal \u2013 and becomes a proxy for the woman\u2019s unspoken loss and regret. The new Apple TV+ series Servant serves up a much less oblique indictment of reborn collectors\u2019 psychological states. In it, a couple take in a doll they name Jericho and treat as a human baby, replete with a mysterious live-in nanny. Turns out \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 that the couple is mourning the recent death of their actual baby (also named Jericho), and the doll is the bereft mother\u2019s only guard against a grief-induced state of catatonia. Though the fake baby trope is wildly misleading, it\u2019s true that reborn collectors don\u2019t see their reborns as merely toys. Most, says St Hilaire, echo Eldred\u2019s emotional attachment to their dolls. St Hilaire describes this dynamic as \u201ca kind of synthetic relationship\u201d. \u201cThe feeling that you get from that,\u201d she says, \u201cisn\u2019t so different from a real relationship\u201d\u2013 that is, one with a human counterpart. Across social media, collectors speak openly of the special bond one can develop with certain reborns, as well as the grieving period that sometimes follows once a doll is let go (as with many collecting hobbies, reborns are commonly bought then sold or swapped out, changing hands within the community). In reborn relationships, St Hilaire sees promising implications for the future of artificial intelligence and forms of non-human or humanoid companionship. Then, there\u2019s the biological response that\u2019s triggered when handling a realistically proportioned, lifelike baby doll. Studies suggest that doll therapy can reinforce feelings of attachment and emotional wellbeing in some patients with dementia. Many reborn collectors similarly point to the therapeutic benefits of their dolls for managing mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. \u201cThere\u2019s comfort in cuddling and physically holding something that feels like a baby, even though it\u2019s not a baby,\u201d says St Hilaire. \u201cIt can release some of the same endorphins.\u201d For Lucenda Plancarte, who is a friend of Ortiz and a reborn collector in her early 30s, the hobby\u2019s therapeutic benefits are twofold. \u201cI have polycystic ovarian syndrome and stage four endometriosis,\u201d she explains from her home in Compton, California. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been proven infertile. I\u2019ve already had multiple treatments, surgeries, seen different doctors. [Having children is] just not in my cards.\u201d Stripped of her plans for biological motherhood, Plancarte fell into a deep depression. She couldn\u2019t walk past the baby departments of her local Target and Walmart without being reminded of her unlucky draw. But, as fate would have it, a solution emerged in 2012. And in an unexpected place: An episode of the TLC reality series My Strange Addiction. The show had featured a reborn collector; Plancarte says she was \u201cintrigued\u201d. It was her husband\u2019s idea that she buy one for herself, despite the $120 price tag. \u201cThen she arrived, and it was the most magical experience ever,\u201d says Plancarte. \u201cI was in love. It was amazing. I was like, how in the world have I never owned a reborn before? And it gave me a sense of purpose.\u201d Plancarte loves being able to shop for her dolls in the same baby departments that were once a reminder of the things she was missing out on. Caring for them, she says, is a \u201ccoping mechanism\u201d. Plancarte knows she\u2019s risking confrontation when she takes her dolls out in public. \u201cIt comes with the territory,\u201d she says. When people ask questions, she answers: the dolls are objects of art, and they make her feel good. They\u2019re not replacements for children. \u201cRight now, fostering and adoption \u2013 it\u2019s not the right time for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when it is, then I\u2019ll pursue that path. But right now, my path is collecting reborns, minding my own business, and sharing it with the world on Instagram and YouTube.\u201d This article was amended on 26 February 2020 to correct the name of Stephanie Ortiz\u2019s wife.",

Almost two weeks ago, when Uefa announced that its investigation had found City guilty, the club released a statement describing the process as \u201cflawed\u201d. \u201cWith the prejudicial process now over,\u201d they said, \u201cthe club will pursue an impartial judgment as quickly as possible.\u201d</p> <p>In August 1905, after City\u2019s Billy Meredith had been found guilty of bribery following a Football Association investigation, the Guardian reported remarks made by the forward. \u201cLeague officials, he asserts, are jealous of the [club\u2019s] growing success,\u201d we wrote, \u201cbut he thought the whole country would demand such an unjust decision being reversed by the whole question being reopened at once.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/19/forgotten-story-ray-freeman-british-manager-brann-norway\">The forgotten story of ... Ray Freeman, the \u2018madman\u2019 manager and trailblazer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The whole question was indeed reopened, at which point a range of misdemeanours spilled out of the club, offences that appear so eerily familiar to those following their latest scandal it is as if some ribbon of DNA runs through the club. In 1906 they were found, in essence, to be funnelling money through secret accounts to circumvent rules designed to stop wealthy individuals from pouring their money into clubs, skewing the market and gaining an unfair sporting advantage.</p> <p>City hid their misdemeanours well, and in 1906 there were no Portuguese computer hackers to uncover them. In all likelihood they would have remained undiscovered had a player called Sandy Turnbull not one day thrown a punch.</p> <p>The 1904-05 season was coming to a breathless conclusion, with City, Everton and Newcastle fighting for the title in the final fortnight. Fighting was the appropriate word, with two of City\u2019s last three fixtures \u2013 a 2-0 win at home to Everton that pretty much ended the beaten team\u2019s chances of topping the table, and a 3-2 last-day defeat at Aston Villa that did the same to City \u2013 marred by violence on and off the pitch. Everton\u2019s Tom Booth was seen as being the chief aggressor in the first game but at Villa it was Turnbull.</p> <p>\u201cThe game as a whole was most unpleasant,\u201d wrote Athletic News. \u201cHynds, Meredith, Turnbull and Livingstone were all guilty of acts which footballers of their class should be the first to discountenance. On one occasion Turnbull struck [Alex] Leake, who is without doubt the merriest footballer of the day, and when the Villa half-back quite jocularly, and with a smiling face, asked \u2018What is that for?\u2019 Turnbull struck him again.\u201d There may have been some provocation, as other reports describe Leake hitting Turnbull with a fistful of soil and a couple of sly slaps, and the Guardian wrote that \u201cit is not certain that Turnbull was more to blame than Leake\u201d. After the game it seems Turnbull was bundled into Villa\u2019s dressing room and assaulted, while City\u2019s players \u2013 who were asked to leave by a side entrance but refused \u2013 were pelted with missiles when they left the ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The FA launched an inquiry, which resulted in Booth, Turnbull, and both match referees being suspended for a month. But among those giving evidence was an unnamed man who, according to reports, \u201cholds a responsible position in Birmingham municipal life\u201d and \u201chad overheard a most interesting conversation\u201d in which Meredith had apparently offered Leake \u00a310 to make sure Villa lost. Based on this mysterious testimony the player, one of the stars of his day, was found guilty of bribery, and banned for an entire season.</p> <p>Both players eventually admitted that such a conversation had taken place, and though Leake said he \u201cregarded it more as a joke than anything to be taken seriously\u201d there was surely more to it than that. But the idea that an individual player might be behind an attempt to buy off another entire team, and for a sum so trivial, seems entirely ridiculous. \u201cI was,\u201d Meredith insisted, \u201conly the spokesman of others equally guilty.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60e1bf26994d463f941d3679d5d764810142790f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60e1bf26994d463f941d3679d5d764810142790f/0_0_2737_1643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City\u2019s Billy Meredith (left) charges down the wing during the 1904 FA Cup final against Bolton Wanderers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City\u2019s goalscorer Billy Meredith (left) charges down the wing during their 1-0 win over Bolton Wanderers in the 1904 FA Cup final at Crystal Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EMPICS Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The FA\u2019s refusal to say who reported the bribery, or name any of its witnesses, added to a widespread perception of unfairness.

As a man who claims the privilege of thinking for himself, and of judging on FACTS for himself, I am not convinced that he is guilty.\u201d Some talked about conspiracy, one unnamed source saying that \u201cManchester City is becoming too popular to suit some other clubs\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/apr/26/the-forgotten-story-of-carlos-kaiser-footballs-greatest-conman\">The forgotten story of ... Carlos Kaiser, football's greatest conman | Rob Smyth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, the ban stood, and Meredith should have had nothing to do with City the following season. Instead he turned up for most home games, was often in the dressing room, and frequently in the club\u2019s offices, asking for money. This was noticed by Tom Hindle, an accountant employed by the FA to scrutinise City\u2019s books, who clearly thought it suspicious. Eventually, City reported Meredith to the FA and made mention of of the board\u2019s \u201crefusal to lend itself to any illicit or illegal practices\u201d and \u201crigid observation of the rules\u201d. The FA opened another investigation.</p> <p>This time, Meredith was really annoyed. So he started to talk, and eventually all of City\u2019s secrets came out. There was at the time a \u00a34-a-week maximum wage for players, designed primarily to stop clubs assembling all-star squads (for context, the average wage in Great Britain was about \u00a370 a year) but it transpired that City had been flouting it on an epic scale. The FA had suspected as much, parsing the books in 1904 after the club, bankrolled by the newspaper magnate Edward Hulton, assembled a suspiciously good team that came second in the league and won the FA Cup. On that occasion it found some minor problems \u2013 banning a few directors and imposing a \u00a3250 fine \u2013 but no evidence that anyone was being overpaid, and in 1906 they found out why.</p> <p>Meredith had been on \u00a36 for years and said that \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any member of our team was paid less than I was\u201d. In 1903-04 the club also paid out bonuses totalling \u00a3681 12s 6d, in line with the seasons before and after, and every penny illegal. \u201cThe club literally bought the English Cup,\u201d wrote Athletic News in a stinging editorial after the judgment (even more notable because Hulton, who had bankrolled City\u2019s spending, owned Athletic News at the time). The FA\u2019s report concluded that \u201cit is now proved that the club had for years systematically broken the rules by very unscrupulous means\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"62fb80aa2e58677b0702753c6cf6678b0d44784a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62fb80aa2e58677b0702753c6cf6678b0d44784a/0_0_4096_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City\u2019s 1904 FA Cup winning team line up with club officials: (Back row, from left) J.

      "bodyText": "In May 2019, with Manchester City facing several investigations including one by Uefa regarding the alleged breaching of financial fair play regulations, the Guardian reported remarks made by the club\u2019s chairman, Khaldoon Mubarak. \u201cWith success there is a certain level of jealousy, envy, whatever you call it,\u201d he said. Almost two weeks ago, when Uefa announced that its investigation had found City guilty, the club released a statement describing the process as \u201cflawed\u201d. \u201cWith the prejudicial process now over,\u201d they said, \u201cthe club will pursue an impartial judgment as quickly as possible.\u201d In August 1905, after City\u2019s Billy Meredith had been found guilty of bribery following a Football Association investigation, the Guardian reported remarks made by the forward. \u201cLeague officials, he asserts, are jealous of the [club\u2019s] growing success,\u201d we wrote, \u201cbut he thought the whole country would demand such an unjust decision being reversed by the whole question being reopened at once.\u201d The whole question was indeed reopened, at which point a range of misdemeanours spilled out of the club, offences that appear so eerily familiar to those following their latest scandal it is as if some ribbon of DNA runs through the club. In 1906 they were found, in essence, to be funnelling money through secret accounts to circumvent rules designed to stop wealthy individuals from pouring their money into clubs, skewing the market and gaining an unfair sporting advantage. City hid their misdemeanours well, and in 1906 there were no Portuguese computer hackers to uncover them. In all likelihood they would have remained undiscovered had a player called Sandy Turnbull not one day thrown a punch. The 1904-05 season was coming to a breathless conclusion, with City, Everton and Newcastle fighting for the title in the final fortnight. Fighting was the appropriate word, with two of City\u2019s last three fixtures \u2013 a 2-0 win at home to Everton that pretty much ended the beaten team\u2019s chances of topping the table, and a 3-2 last-day defeat at Aston Villa that did the same to City \u2013 marred by violence on and off the pitch. Everton\u2019s Tom Booth was seen as being the chief aggressor in the first game but at Villa it was Turnbull. \u201cThe game as a whole was most unpleasant,\u201d wrote Athletic News. \u201cHynds, Meredith, Turnbull and Livingstone were all guilty of acts which footballers of their class should be the first to discountenance. On one occasion Turnbull struck [Alex] Leake, who is without doubt the merriest footballer of the day, and when the Villa half-back quite jocularly, and with a smiling face, asked \u2018What is that for?\u2019 Turnbull struck him again.\u201d There may have been some provocation, as other reports describe Leake hitting Turnbull with a fistful of soil and a couple of sly slaps, and the Guardian wrote that \u201cit is not certain that Turnbull was more to blame than Leake\u201d. After the game it seems Turnbull was bundled into Villa\u2019s dressing room and assaulted, while City\u2019s players \u2013 who were asked to leave by a side entrance but refused \u2013 were pelted with missiles when they left the ground. The FA launched an inquiry, which resulted in Booth, Turnbull, and both match referees being suspended for a month. But among those giving evidence was an unnamed man who, according to reports, \u201cholds a responsible position in Birmingham municipal life\u201d and \u201chad overheard a most interesting conversation\u201d in which Meredith had apparently offered Leake \u00a310 to make sure Villa lost. Based on this mysterious testimony the player, one of the stars of his day, was found guilty of bribery, and banned for an entire season. Both players eventually admitted that such a conversation had taken place, and though Leake said he \u201cregarded it more as a joke than anything to be taken seriously\u201d there was surely more to it than that. But the idea that an individual player might be behind an attempt to buy off another entire team, and for a sum so trivial, seems entirely ridiculous. \u201cI was,\u201d Meredith insisted, \u201conly the spokesman of others equally guilty.\u201d The FA\u2019s refusal to say who reported the bribery, or name any of its witnesses, added to a widespread perception of unfairness. Tityrus, Athletic News\u2019 venerable football correspondent, wrote that \u201cthe method seems un-English, most autocratic and arbitrary\u201d and insisted that \u201canyone who knows the careful life and thrift which has characterised Meredith will feel confident that he never proffered such a sum out of his own pocket ... As a man who claims the privilege of thinking for himself, and of judging on FACTS for himself, I am not convinced that he is guilty.\u201d Some talked about conspiracy, one unnamed source saying that \u201cManchester City is becoming too popular to suit some other clubs\u201d. Still, the ban stood, and Meredith should have had nothing to do with City the following season. Instead he turned up for most home games, was often in the dressing room, and frequently in the club\u2019s offices, asking for money. This was noticed by Tom Hindle, an accountant employed by the FA to scrutinise City\u2019s books, who clearly thought it suspicious. Eventually, City reported Meredith to the FA and made mention of of the board\u2019s \u201crefusal to lend itself to any illicit or illegal practices\u201d and \u201crigid observation of the rules\u201d. The FA opened another investigation. This time, Meredith was really annoyed. So he started to talk, and eventually all of City\u2019s secrets came out. There was at the time a \u00a34-a-week maximum wage for players, designed primarily to stop clubs assembling all-star squads (for context, the average wage in Great Britain was about \u00a370 a year) but it transpired that City had been flouting it on an epic scale. The FA had suspected as much, parsing the books in 1904 after the club, bankrolled by the newspaper magnate Edward Hulton, assembled a suspiciously good team that came second in the league and won the FA Cup. On that occasion it found some minor problems \u2013 banning a few directors and imposing a \u00a3250 fine \u2013 but no evidence that anyone was being overpaid, and in 1906 they found out why. Meredith had been on \u00a36 for years and said that \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any member of our team was paid less than I was\u201d. In 1903-04 the club also paid out bonuses totalling \u00a3681 12s 6d, in line with the seasons before and after, and every penny illegal. \u201cThe club literally bought the English Cup,\u201d wrote Athletic News in a stinging editorial after the judgment (even more notable because Hulton, who had bankrolled City\u2019s spending, owned Athletic News at the time). The FA\u2019s report concluded that \u201cit is now proved that the club had for years systematically broken the rules by very unscrupulous means\u201d. It turned out that a percentage of the gate money, instead of going into the club\u2019s coffers, was being funnelled straight into the private accounts of club directors, held at different banks and from there off-the-books payments went to the players. They also found evidence that Meredith had been promised his entire salary for his season of suspension, just as soon as Hindle could be got rid of. Every player implicated, 17 in all, was fined, suspended, and banned from playing for City again. Two directors were banned for life, two others for a year, and the remainder ordered to resign. Meredith and Turnbull were among a number of squad members who ended up at Manchester United (Meredith, nearly 32 when the judgment was made, made an improbable return to City 15 years later, making his final top-level appearance in an FA Cup semi-final when four months short of his 50th birthday; Turnbull was banned for life for match-fixing in 1915).

It is certainly not for any of us to downplay the importance of Black History Month and any related tribute but a heavyweight boxing match is one of the things it\u2019s unwise to put said tribute before. Other such things may include an oncoming freight train, an advancing tsunami, the onset of blitzkrieg in the Ardennes in May 1940, or a simple 20,000-strong cavalry charge. Those are some of the things your outfit has to play second fiddle to. Anything else is going to end up being a false economy.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, given his team threw in the towel, is it wise for Wilder to blame an outfit at all? Wilting under the weight of one\u2019s own clothes is a distinctly Monty Burns vibe. The essential weakness of Springfield\u2019s local mogul has been shown in many ways down the years. There\u2019s one time he tries to crush an ant under his shoe, only for the insect to resist, push back and eventually topple him over, prompting Burns to howl \u201cTake my wallet and leave me alone!\u201d at his vanquisher. On another occasion, a sponge is placed on Mr Burns\u2019s stomach in the bath, causing him to plunge beneath the surface and nearly drown. These and other incidents may be an acceptable look for an evil town tycoon. Whether it is an optimal one for a heavyweight boxer feels more debatable.</p> \n<p>Either way, other experts are dialling in, such as Melissa Anglesea, the creative director of the label that designed Fury\u2019s ring-walk costume. Melissa, who acts as if she analyses the impact of Black History Month costumes on prizefighters all day long, says of Wilder\u2019s look that \u201ca three-stone costume makes absolutely no ounce of difference\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98bc402b96927c23d400f6a10387be4314d02cff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98bc402b96927c23d400f6a10387be4314d02cff/0_0_3500_2285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fury arrives on his throne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fury arrives on his throne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For his part, the victorious Fury conserved his energy by declining to use his legs at all when being borne to the ring on a throne \u2013 technically known as the Mariah Carey approach.

Back to Wilder, though, who has more detail on the troublesome costume. \u201cI wanted my tribute to be great for Black History Month,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be good and I guess I put that before anything.\u201d Before a \u00a360m heavyweight boxing match? It is certainly not for any of us to downplay the importance of Black History Month and any related tribute but a heavyweight boxing match is one of the things it\u2019s unwise to put said tribute before. Other such things may include an oncoming freight train, an advancing tsunami, the onset of blitzkrieg in the Ardennes in May 1940, or a simple 20,000-strong cavalry charge. Those are some of the things your outfit has to play second fiddle to. Anything else is going to end up being a false economy. Furthermore, given his team threw in the towel, is it wise for Wilder to blame an outfit at all? Wilting under the weight of one\u2019s own clothes is a distinctly Monty Burns vibe. The essential weakness of Springfield\u2019s local mogul has been shown in many ways down the years. There\u2019s one time he tries to crush an ant under his shoe, only for the insect to resist, push back and eventually topple him over, prompting Burns to howl \u201cTake my wallet and leave me alone!\u201d at his vanquisher. On another occasion, a sponge is placed on Mr Burns\u2019s stomach in the bath, causing him to plunge beneath the surface and nearly drown. These and other incidents may be an acceptable look for an evil town tycoon. Whether it is an optimal one for a heavyweight boxer feels more debatable. Either way, other experts are dialling in, such as Melissa Anglesea, the creative director of the label that designed Fury\u2019s ring-walk costume. Melissa, who acts as if she analyses the impact of Black History Month costumes on prizefighters all day long, says of Wilder\u2019s look that \u201ca three-stone costume makes absolutely no ounce of difference\u201d. For his part, the victorious Fury conserved his energy by declining to use his legs at all when being borne to the ring on a throne \u2013 technically known as the Mariah Carey approach. Mariah, a Proper Celebrity, is frequently wheeled to the stage on which she is appearing. For her Las Vegas appearances in 2017, she spent a significant part of the actual concert being borne aloft by six male dancers on a chaise longue, from which supine position she can still somehow hit her five-octave range. It\u2019s a look that says to one\u2019s fans: \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I don\u2019t get up, do you?\u201d You wouldn\u2019t catch Mariah approaching any Vegas arena exceeding her baggage allowance \u2013 indeed, as someone who famously doesn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d stairs and has an assistant to put her straw into her mouth, it\u2019s very noble of her to hold her own microphone at all. As for Wilder, he\u2019s still insisting he\u2019ll trigger the rematch with Fury. So in the spirit of artistes learning from other artistes, perhaps he could take tips from Mariah when that event comes to pass? \u2022 Marina Hyde wins two SJA awards in landmark achievement",

      "body": "<p>The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is attempting to prevent publication of two family court judgments involving his two children with his ex-wife, Princess Haya of Jordan, the court of appeal in London has been told.</p> <p>At the opening of a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday, Lord Justice Underhill read out a public statement explaining that the case \u201craises matters of public interest beyond the particular issue in the wardship proceedings\u201d.</p> <p>In the two-page statement read out before the public were excluded from the hearing, Underhill said the case began in the UK courts in May last year. The media were allowed to remain during the private session but cannot immediately report on the rest of the proceedings.</p> <p>The case has been heard up to now before Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the family division of the high court. He has already delivered two judgments on questions decided in advance of the welfare hearing but they have not been published.</p> <p>\u201cThe first concerned certain disputed factual issues; the second concerned issues arising out of the special position of the father as the sovereign and head of government of a foreign state,\u201d Underhill explained.</p> <p>Princess Haya was present at the hearing in the court of appeal, sitting beside her solicitor, Lady Shackleton.</p> <p>Last month McFarlane decided that the two judgments and reports of the related hearings should be published, Underhill said. \u201cThe father [Sheikh Mohammed] contends that that decision was wrong in law and that the judgments should not be published, if at all, in advance of the welfare hearing.</p> <p>\u201cThe appeal is opposed by the mother, the independent guardian appointed by the court to represent the children\u2019s interests and by a number of media organisations [including the Guardian]. It raises questions both about what is in the best interests of the children and about how to balance that, if necessary, against the rights of the press to report matters of public interest and the decisions of the courts.\u201d</p> <p>The case is being heard in the court of appeal by Lord Justice Underhill, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Bean.</p> <p>The billionaire Sheikh Mohammed, 70, is the vice-president and prime minister of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/united-arab-emirates\">United Arab Emirates</a> and the ruler of Dubai. He is also the founder of the successful Godolphin horse racing stable and last year received a trophy from the Queen after one of his horses won at Royal Ascot.</p> <p>Princess Haya Bint al-Hussein, 45, is the daughter of the former King Hussein of Jordan and half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan. She was Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s sixth wife and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/dubais-ruler-battles-wife-in-uk-court-after-she-fled-emirate\">reportedly fled Dubai</a> last year.</p> <p>The princess is close to the British royal family and owns an \u00a385m house near Kensington Palace in central London. She married Sheikh Mohammed in 2004.</p> <p>Educated at private schools in the UK and Oxford University, where she studied philosophy, politics and economics, she has served on the International Olympic Committee and has been a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations World Food Programme.</p> <p>Among those who have already given evidence in the case are DCI Beck, formerly of Cambridgeshire police, who led an investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/dec/15/jamiewilson.stuartmillar1\">disappearance of Princess Shamsa</a> in the UK in 2000, and Tiina Jauhiainen, a friend of Princess Latifa who helped her escape Dubai in 2018. Princesses Shamsa and Latifa are both daughters of Sheikh Mohammed by another wife. </p>",

At the opening of a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday, Lord Justice Underhill read out a public statement explaining that the case \u201craises matters of public interest beyond the particular issue in the wardship proceedings\u201d. In the two-page statement read out before the public were excluded from the hearing, Underhill said the case began in the UK courts in May last year. The media were allowed to remain during the private session but cannot immediately report on the rest of the proceedings. The case has been heard up to now before Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the family division of the high court. He has already delivered two judgments on questions decided in advance of the welfare hearing but they have not been published. \u201cThe first concerned certain disputed factual issues; the second concerned issues arising out of the special position of the father as the sovereign and head of government of a foreign state,\u201d Underhill explained. Princess Haya was present at the hearing in the court of appeal, sitting beside her solicitor, Lady Shackleton. Last month McFarlane decided that the two judgments and reports of the related hearings should be published, Underhill said. \u201cThe father [Sheikh Mohammed] contends that that decision was wrong in law and that the judgments should not be published, if at all, in advance of the welfare hearing. \u201cThe appeal is opposed by the mother, the independent guardian appointed by the court to represent the children\u2019s interests and by a number of media organisations [including the Guardian]. It raises questions both about what is in the best interests of the children and about how to balance that, if necessary, against the rights of the press to report matters of public interest and the decisions of the courts.\u201d The case is being heard in the court of appeal by Lord Justice Underhill, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Bean. The billionaire Sheikh Mohammed, 70, is the vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Dubai. He is also the founder of the successful Godolphin horse racing stable and last year received a trophy from the Queen after one of his horses won at Royal Ascot. Princess Haya Bint al-Hussein, 45, is the daughter of the former King Hussein of Jordan and half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan. She was Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s sixth wife and reportedly fled Dubai last year. The princess is close to the British royal family and owns an \u00a385m house near Kensington Palace in central London. She married Sheikh Mohammed in 2004. Educated at private schools in the UK and Oxford University, where she studied philosophy, politics and economics, she has served on the International Olympic Committee and has been a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations World Food Programme. Among those who have already given evidence in the case are DCI Beck, formerly of Cambridgeshire police, who led an investigation into the disappearance of Princess Shamsa in the UK in 2000, and Tiina Jauhiainen, a friend of Princess Latifa who helped her escape Dubai in 2018. Princesses Shamsa and Latifa are both daughters of Sheikh Mohammed by another wife.",

      "body": "<p>In fiction, the imaginary friend lives where fantasy, mental illness and the supernatural meet, and it is often intriguingly hard to tell just where it belongs. Children\u2019s imaginary friends are often endearing, as seeen in the countless stories about favourite toys that come to life. But once the protagonist is adult, the imaginary friend can become a sinister presence \u2013 a warning that something is wrong. Sometimes it is the relationship itself that is imagined, in fiction as in reality, as when a stalker is convinced they share a special bond with their prey. There is also the eerie notion that a reader\u2019s sense of closeness to a fictional character is a form of imaginary friendship as well.</p> <p>My debut novel, <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1116855/you-let-me-in/9781787633162.html\">You Let Me In</a>, is about Cassandra, whose whole life has been influenced by her invisible friend, Pepper-Man. He can provide comfort and protection, but he can also be dangerous, to Cassandra herself and to people around her. It is not so easy, however, to figure out exactly who, or <em>what</em>, Pepper-Man is. He could be a fairy from the forest, as Cassandra firmly believes, or a creature that lives solely in Cassandra\u2019s mind, as her psychiatrist is just as convinced.</p> <p>I am far from the only one to be inspired by imaginary friends, so here is a list of stories from the borderland where the self ends and something else \u2013 somehow \u2013 begins.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/alice-s-adventures-in-wonderland-9781406370706.html\">Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll</a><br></strong>This classic children\u2019s novel from 1865, takes a tumble down the rabbit hole to a surreal land of make believe. Here Alice encounters a whole cast of imaginary beings \u2013 some more friendly than others \u2013 from the white rabbit that sets it all in motion, to a mad hatter and a vanishing cat. She ends up in the court of the despotic Queen of Hearts, who commands a whole deck of animated playing cards. Even though Alice\u2019s adventures are revealed to be a dream, the story leaves behind a lingering sense of doubt.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/01/pisces-melissa-broder-review-merman\">The Pisces by Melissa Broder</a><br></strong>Lucy, a PhD candidate with mental health issues, goes to Los Angeles to house-sit for her sister. While there, she meets and falls in love with a merman, and as Lucy believes that only a man can save her from herself, he seems to be the answer to her troubles. This might have led to happily ever after in another kind of novel, but their relationship meets some challenges, with the merman being a fish and all. This novel is gritty, sad and surreal, but also very funny.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/vladimirnabokov\">Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov</a><br></strong>Posing as a posthumously published poem by the fictional poet John Shade, with commentary by his neighbour Dr Charles Kinbote, this masterpiece of novel is not what is seems. Through the increasingly disturbing and fantastical commentary, it soon becomes evident that Kinbote is <em>not well</em>. His identity is a slippery thing, and he nurtured an unhealthy obsession with Shade. This novel is a puzzle of a story, brilliantly written and utterly baffling.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/among-others-9781472106537.html\">Among Others by Jo Walton</a><br></strong>Fifteen-year-old Mori is sent to boarding school after her twin sister dies in a crash involving their mentally ill mother. Two things helps Mori get through the days: her books and the bond she has \u2013 or <em>believes</em> she has \u2013 with nature\u2019s fairies.

I may not find the novel as philosophically interesting as many others do, but I think it is a highly entertaining take on an unravelling mind. Joe is a <em>very</em> unreliable narrator, and I questioned absolutely everything by the end, which is just the sort of thing I like.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/03/the-good-people-by-hannah-kent-review\">The Good People by Hannah Kent</a><br></strong>Not so much a novel about imaginary friends as imaginary foes. Based on a true story, it tells the story of N\u00f3ra who lives with her disabled grandson in a rural village in 1820s Ireland. After N\u00f3ra\u2019s husband dies suddenly, people start whispering about fairies, and suggest that the boy is a changeling, responsible for everything that goes wrong in their community. The novel explores the dangers of ignorance and the power of belief, and how those things combined can make good people do unthinkable things.</p> <p><strong> 7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-other-9781590175835.html\">The Other by Thomas Tryon</a><br></strong>This classic horror novel about a pair of twin boys is set in 1930s Connecticut and is hard to discuss without giving away the twist. Niles and Holland Perry may look the same, but they are very different boys. Holland is outgoing and adventurous, sometimes even cruel, while Niles is the thoughtful and compassionate one. When horrible events start taking place, it is obvious who is responsible \u2013 or is it? The lush, atmospheric writing is a stark contrast to the chilling events it records.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-345-53653-2\">The Boy Who Could See Demons by Carolyn Jess-Cooke</a><br></strong>Child psychiatrist Anya Molokova meets 10-year-old Alex after his mother\u2019s fifth suicide attempt. Alex is a normal boy, but his best friend, Ruen, is a 9,000-year-old, shape-shifting demon. Anya naturally assumes that Alex is mentally unwell, but during the course of his treatment, Alex tells her things he could not possibly know. The novel courts the supernatural without ever losing its grip on reality, which is part of what makes it so enticing.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-tall-man-9781472249258.html\">The Tall Man by Phoebe Locke</a><br></strong>Possibly inspired by the slender man myth, this novel is about mother and daughter, Sadie and Amber Banner, and how their lives are affected by Sadie\u2019s teen entanglement with a group of girls obsessed with a local legend. Told from different timelines and from different points of view, the novel describes the horrible events that lead up to Amber becoming a murder suspect. The Tall Man is a fast-paced mystery with a touch of whodunnit that may, or may not, have a supernatural monster at its core.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/28/top-10-ghost-stories\">Top 10 ghost stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/22/shirley-jackson-america-queen-gothic-noir\">The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson</a><br></strong>This is my all-time favourite, and I felt strange for a week after reading it for the first time.

      "bodyText": "In fiction, the imaginary friend lives where fantasy, mental illness and the supernatural meet, and it is often intriguingly hard to tell just where it belongs. Children\u2019s imaginary friends are often endearing, as seeen in the countless stories about favourite toys that come to life. But once the protagonist is adult, the imaginary friend can become a sinister presence \u2013 a warning that something is wrong. Sometimes it is the relationship itself that is imagined, in fiction as in reality, as when a stalker is convinced they share a special bond with their prey. There is also the eerie notion that a reader\u2019s sense of closeness to a fictional character is a form of imaginary friendship as well. My debut novel, You Let Me In, is about Cassandra, whose whole life has been influenced by her invisible friend, Pepper-Man. He can provide comfort and protection, but he can also be dangerous, to Cassandra herself and to people around her. It is not so easy, however, to figure out exactly who, or what, Pepper-Man is. He could be a fairy from the forest, as Cassandra firmly believes, or a creature that lives solely in Cassandra\u2019s mind, as her psychiatrist is just as convinced. I am far from the only one to be inspired by imaginary friends, so here is a list of stories from the borderland where the self ends and something else \u2013 somehow \u2013 begins. 1. Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll This classic children\u2019s novel from 1865, takes a tumble down the rabbit hole to a surreal land of make believe. Here Alice encounters a whole cast of imaginary beings \u2013 some more friendly than others \u2013 from the white rabbit that sets it all in motion, to a mad hatter and a vanishing cat. She ends up in the court of the despotic Queen of Hearts, who commands a whole deck of animated playing cards. Even though Alice\u2019s adventures are revealed to be a dream, the story leaves behind a lingering sense of doubt. 2. The Pisces by Melissa Broder Lucy, a PhD candidate with mental health issues, goes to Los Angeles to house-sit for her sister. While there, she meets and falls in love with a merman, and as Lucy believes that only a man can save her from herself, he seems to be the answer to her troubles. This might have led to happily ever after in another kind of novel, but their relationship meets some challenges, with the merman being a fish and all. This novel is gritty, sad and surreal, but also very funny. 3. Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov Posing as a posthumously published poem by the fictional poet John Shade, with commentary by his neighbour Dr Charles Kinbote, this masterpiece of novel is not what is seems. Through the increasingly disturbing and fantastical commentary, it soon becomes evident that Kinbote is not well. His identity is a slippery thing, and he nurtured an unhealthy obsession with Shade. This novel is a puzzle of a story, brilliantly written and utterly baffling. 4. Among Others by Jo Walton Fifteen-year-old Mori is sent to boarding school after her twin sister dies in a crash involving their mentally ill mother. Two things helps Mori get through the days: her books and the bond she has \u2013 or believes she has \u2013 with nature\u2019s fairies. Among Others is a fantasy novel, but the magic is so subtle and intertwined with reality that it is hard to say where one thing ends and the other begins \u2013 or if the magic is there at all. 5. Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk Most people are familiar with Joe, his enigmatic friend Tyler Durden and their secret basement clubs, if not from Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s book then from the 90s movie starring Brad Pitt. I may not find the novel as philosophically interesting as many others do, but I think it is a highly entertaining take on an unravelling mind. Joe is a very unreliable narrator, and I questioned absolutely everything by the end, which is just the sort of thing I like. 6. The Good People by Hannah Kent Not so much a novel about imaginary friends as imaginary foes. Based on a true story, it tells the story of N\u00f3ra who lives with her disabled grandson in a rural village in 1820s Ireland. After N\u00f3ra\u2019s husband dies suddenly, people start whispering about fairies, and suggest that the boy is a changeling, responsible for everything that goes wrong in their community.

The Boy Who Could See Demons by Carolyn Jess-Cooke Child psychiatrist Anya Molokova meets 10-year-old Alex after his mother\u2019s fifth suicide attempt. Alex is a normal boy, but his best friend, Ruen, is a 9,000-year-old, shape-shifting demon. Anya naturally assumes that Alex is mentally unwell, but during the course of his treatment, Alex tells her things he could not possibly know.

Told from different timelines and from different points of view, the novel describes the horrible events that lead up to Amber becoming a murder suspect. The Tall Man is a fast-paced mystery with a touch of whodunnit that may, or may not, have a supernatural monster at its core. 10.

      "body": "<p>Don\u2019t blame gentrification for pushing the poor out of inner cities. That\u2019s the message of this plausible investigative documentary from Swedish journalist Fredrik Gertten, who zooms out to take a global view of rising rents. The real villain in the affordable-housing crisis, his argument goes, is not avocado-eating young creatives but the financial elites. And Gertten does a decent job of delivering an economics lesson, explaining the complexities of the \u201cfinancialisation\u201d of residential real estate; most politicians, apparently, just don\u2019t get it.</p> <p>At the heart of the film is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/leilani-farha\">Leilani Farha</a>, a Canadian human rights lawyer working as the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on adequate housing. With her hippy haircut and activist approach of getting stuck in, she flies around the world talking to people affected by rising housing costs. In London, she meets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">Grenfell survivors</a> and takes a tour of a former council estate torn down to make way for new luxury housing, which has been sold to investors in Hong Kong and Singapore. In Berlin, a baker has his rent put up by \u20ac600 a month.</p> <p>A depressingly similar pattern emerges in countries from Sweden to Canada: a faceless company buys up undervalued properties where the poor live, fixes them up and hikes rents. In the US, Farha meets a guy whose new landlord put his rent up to 90% of his paycheck.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not intrinsically evil, they are intrinsically amoral,\u201d says the economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephstiglitz\">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, with a grim smile, talking about the hedge funds and pensions funds maximising their wealth at the expense of people\u2019s dignity. What can be done about it?</p> <p>Farha faces an uphill battle to get anyone to listen. In what is perhaps the most heart-sinking scene she addresses a sparsely attended conference at the UN. No one is listening to her; the camera zooms in on one guy shopping for a luxury watch on his phone. So no happy endings here, but perhaps the beginnings of an international scandal?</p> <p>\u2022 Push is released in the UK on 28 February.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iLWpuZrd-I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2iLWpuZrd-I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Don\u2019t blame gentrification for pushing the poor out of inner cities. That\u2019s the message of this plausible investigative documentary from Swedish journalist Fredrik Gertten, who zooms out to take a global view of rising rents. The real villain in the affordable-housing crisis, his argument goes, is not avocado-eating young creatives but the financial elites. And Gertten does a decent job of delivering an economics lesson, explaining the complexities of the \u201cfinancialisation\u201d of residential real estate; most politicians, apparently, just don\u2019t get it. At the heart of the film is Leilani Farha, a Canadian human rights lawyer working as the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on adequate housing. With her hippy haircut and activist approach of getting stuck in, she flies around the world talking to people affected by rising housing costs. In London, she meets Grenfell survivors and takes a tour of a former council estate torn down to make way for new luxury housing, which has been sold to investors in Hong Kong and Singapore. In Berlin, a baker has his rent put up by \u20ac600 a month. A depressingly similar pattern emerges in countries from Sweden to Canada: a faceless company buys up undervalued properties where the poor live, fixes them up and hikes rents. In the US, Farha meets a guy whose new landlord put his rent up to 90% of his paycheck. \u201cThey are not intrinsically evil, they are intrinsically amoral,\u201d says the economist Joseph Stiglitz, with a grim smile, talking about the hedge funds and pensions funds maximising their wealth at the expense of people\u2019s dignity. What can be done about it? Farha faces an uphill battle to get anyone to listen. In what is perhaps the most heart-sinking scene she addresses a sparsely attended conference at the UN. No one is listening to her; the camera zooms in on one guy shopping for a luxury watch on his phone. So no happy endings here, but perhaps the beginnings of an international scandal? \u2022 Push is released in the UK on 28 February.",

      "body": "<p>Netflix keeps insisting their new series Love is Blind is more than reality programming \u2013 it is a scientific experiment. We as an audience are simply allowed to observe as the experiment\u2019s contestants/test subjects (conventionally attractive men and women who have job titles like \u201ccontent creator\u201d and \u201cbusiness owner\u201d) are placed in cozy upholstered \u201cpods\u201d and forced into conversation with potential mates they cannot see. They are only let out once marriage is proposed and accepted, and after a quick reveal of what their life partner actually looks like, the couples are swept away to a whole new series of sterile laboratory environments, like a resort getaway in \u201cMexico\u201d, condos in Atlanta with all-white walls and furnishings, and a nondescript, nondenominational wedding venue.</p> <p>It is an experiment designed to answer the eternal question: are straight people OK?</p> <p>We might not like the answers we find, and like the other great experiments of our time, such as the Stanford Prison Experiment or the MKUltra mind control and LSD experiments funded by the CIA, if we accidentally end up creating <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/06/harvard-and-the-making-of-the-unabomber/378239/\">another Unabomber</a>, we will only have ourselves to blame.</p> <p>And who better to guide us through this quandary about what role physical embodiment plays in the mystery we call love than boy band veal calf turned reality programming stud farm bull Nick Lachey, who has now married multiple women who have been bronzed, toned, contoured, highlighted, veneered, sculpted and denied caloric intake into the same bland but pleasing prettiness. They prance their marriage around the contestants, seemingly to prove to them the authentic blindness of their love. They would probably stay together even if Vanessa gained more than three pounds, I\u2019m sure of it.</p> <p>It is all unbearably heterosexual, without even the usual nod toward diversity like a cute lesbian couple in the background shyly holding hands or whatever. The only couple who made it all the way through the proposal process but ended things before the wedding day was broken up by the man\u2019s confession of having had male sexual partners in the past. We next see the woman in a series of contemplative poses \u2013 staring out at the ocean alone, staring into the swimming pool alone, sitting in her enormous resort bed alone \u2013 before she decides she can\u2019t live with this revelation and they both pack up their carry-on sized roller bags and disappear into separate airport shuttles.</p> <p>Each contestant is in some way a victim of heterosexual indoctrination. Jessica falls in love with Barnett unseen while trapped in a pod, but she must sit and wait to see if he will propose to her (he won\u2019t, and she\u2019ll say yes to the next man who asks). Barnett struggles to express his emotions, seemingly because he\u2019s not sure he actually has any. Lauren is under considerable pressure by her mother to marry and have children before her \u201ceggs dry up\u201d. Most of the women, despite the men\u2019s inability to see them, show up in the pod with uncomfortable looking body-con dresses, heels, blow-outs and fake eyelashes.</p> <p>Each subject is a portrait of the particular form of loneliness compulsory heterosexuality contains. While the men mostly speak of their search for a spouse as a quest to acquire the next prize in their quest for adulthood \u2013 saying things like, well, I have a house now so I guess it would be nice to have a wife to put in it \u2013 the women suffer from their lack of emotional intimacy and company that the romantic partner is supposed to provide. One woman in her 20s declares she doesn\u2019t think she could survive if the wedding is called off, as she is unable to live through another romantic disappointment. One subject\u2019s mother talks of the number of years her daughter has been \u201cyearning\u201d for a partner. One woman who travels a lot for work explains that \u201ccoming home is the worst part\u201d, because it is always to an empty home.</p> <p>Their lack of cynicism in this process would be refreshing if it weren\u2019t so baldly sad. Told their whole lives by their society, family and social circles that marriage and family will complete them or fix them, each seems to have reached a point of desperation that leaves them open to manipulation and experimentation.</p> <p>It does feel like an experiment, although like the Milgram experiment, the true data set seems to be something other than what they are actually telling the test subjects. Although here it isn\u2019t whether people will willingly cause others pain simply because they\u2019re told to. (Or is it?) Rather than proving whether or not \u201clove is blind\u201d, the true experiment is about forcing people into a more and more extreme form of heterosexuality to see if they are capable of breaking from a lifetime of conditioning.</p> <p>Will you, as a man who been told your whole life it is important to your masculinity to be a good provider balk at taking on a joint bank account with a freeloader with a shopping habit and a five-figure student loan and habitual Sephora binge debt? Will you as a woman who has been told it is more important to be an object of desire than to feel your own desire take as a lifelong monogamous sexual partner a man you clearly are not attracted to?</p> <p>The stimuli of the experiment are always the same. Each \u201cromantic evening\u201d includes red rose petals scattered on various flat surfaces. Each bachelor and bachelorette party is identical, with a stripper for the ladies and gambling and shots of whiskey for the men. Each wedding will be constructed from the same elements, with all of the women choosing form-fitting white frilly dresses from the same shop, the ceremonies following an established template, and each couple\u2019s vows sounding basically like an echo of the couple that wed in the same room before them.

      "bodyText": "Netflix keeps insisting their new series Love is Blind is more than reality programming \u2013 it is a scientific experiment. We as an audience are simply allowed to observe as the experiment\u2019s contestants/test subjects (conventionally attractive men and women who have job titles like \u201ccontent creator\u201d and \u201cbusiness owner\u201d) are placed in cozy upholstered \u201cpods\u201d and forced into conversation with potential mates they cannot see. They are only let out once marriage is proposed and accepted, and after a quick reveal of what their life partner actually looks like, the couples are swept away to a whole new series of sterile laboratory environments, like a resort getaway in \u201cMexico\u201d, condos in Atlanta with all-white walls and furnishings, and a nondescript, nondenominational wedding venue. It is an experiment designed to answer the eternal question: are straight people OK? We might not like the answers we find, and like the other great experiments of our time, such as the Stanford Prison Experiment or the MKUltra mind control and LSD experiments funded by the CIA, if we accidentally end up creating another Unabomber, we will only have ourselves to blame. And who better to guide us through this quandary about what role physical embodiment plays in the mystery we call love than boy band veal calf turned reality programming stud farm bull Nick Lachey, who has now married multiple women who have been bronzed, toned, contoured, highlighted, veneered, sculpted and denied caloric intake into the same bland but pleasing prettiness. They prance their marriage around the contestants, seemingly to prove to them the authentic blindness of their love. They would probably stay together even if Vanessa gained more than three pounds, I\u2019m sure of it. It is all unbearably heterosexual, without even the usual nod toward diversity like a cute lesbian couple in the background shyly holding hands or whatever. The only couple who made it all the way through the proposal process but ended things before the wedding day was broken up by the man\u2019s confession of having had male sexual partners in the past. We next see the woman in a series of contemplative poses \u2013 staring out at the ocean alone, staring into the swimming pool alone, sitting in her enormous resort bed alone \u2013 before she decides she can\u2019t live with this revelation and they both pack up their carry-on sized roller bags and disappear into separate airport shuttles. Each contestant is in some way a victim of heterosexual indoctrination. Jessica falls in love with Barnett unseen while trapped in a pod, but she must sit and wait to see if he will propose to her (he won\u2019t, and she\u2019ll say yes to the next man who asks). Barnett struggles to express his emotions, seemingly because he\u2019s not sure he actually has any. Lauren is under considerable pressure by her mother to marry and have children before her \u201ceggs dry up\u201d. Most of the women, despite the men\u2019s inability to see them, show up in the pod with uncomfortable looking body-con dresses, heels, blow-outs and fake eyelashes. Each subject is a portrait of the particular form of loneliness compulsory heterosexuality contains. While the men mostly speak of their search for a spouse as a quest to acquire the next prize in their quest for adulthood \u2013 saying things like, well, I have a house now so I guess it would be nice to have a wife to put in it \u2013 the women suffer from their lack of emotional intimacy and company that the romantic partner is supposed to provide. One woman in her 20s declares she doesn\u2019t think she could survive if the wedding is called off, as she is unable to live through another romantic disappointment. One subject\u2019s mother talks of the number of years her daughter has been \u201cyearning\u201d for a partner. One woman who travels a lot for work explains that \u201ccoming home is the worst part\u201d, because it is always to an empty home. Their lack of cynicism in this process would be refreshing if it weren\u2019t so baldly sad. Told their whole lives by their society, family and social circles that marriage and family will complete them or fix them, each seems to have reached a point of desperation that leaves them open to manipulation and experimentation. It does feel like an experiment, although like the Milgram experiment, the true data set seems to be something other than what they are actually telling the test subjects. Although here it isn\u2019t whether people will willingly cause others pain simply because they\u2019re told to. (Or is it?) Rather than proving whether or not \u201clove is blind\u201d, the true experiment is about forcing people into a more and more extreme form of heterosexuality to see if they are capable of breaking from a lifetime of conditioning. Will you, as a man who been told your whole life it is important to your masculinity to be a good provider balk at taking on a joint bank account with a freeloader with a shopping habit and a five-figure student loan and habitual Sephora binge debt? Will you as a woman who has been told it is more important to be an object of desire than to feel your own desire take as a lifelong monogamous sexual partner a man you clearly are not attracted to? The stimuli of the experiment are always the same. Each \u201cromantic evening\u201d includes red rose petals scattered on various flat surfaces. Each bachelor and bachelorette party is identical, with a stripper for the ladies and gambling and shots of whiskey for the men. Each wedding will be constructed from the same elements, with all of the women choosing form-fitting white frilly dresses from the same shop, the ceremonies following an established template, and each couple\u2019s vows sounding basically like an echo of the couple that wed in the same room before them. The subjects are prevented from expressing any individual or original desire, need or impulse, deftly showing that in our heteronormative culture, acquiescence to the couple format is more important than the unique qualities of the people who make it up. Will the pressure to conform prove to be too much, forcing them to recognize their own humanity and individuality, freeing them from the heterosexual paradigm? Or will they strive to make their way through the impossible maze of dating and mating only to be rewarded with a small cube of cheese? The final results are not yet in, but in the preview to the finale we do get a shot of a woman in white dress and veil running down a road screaming about how she \u201ccan\u2019t do this\u201d. Whoever this is ultimately revealed to be is clearly the only winner of the experiment. Good for her.",

The CDC has said an outbreak of Covid-19 in the US could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans, despite Trump\u2019s assertion that the virus is \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d. Home alone. A young boy in China\u2019s Hubei province was found alone at home after watching his grandfather die from the virus, because of state restrictions intended to halt its spread. India: 21 dead amid worst religious violence for decades At least 21 people are dead in Delhi following sectarian clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups, the worst spate of religious violence in the Indian capital for decades. The violence, which began with attacks on mosques by Hindu mobs, was sparked by protests over a law passed in December that grants citizenship for refugees of every major south Asian religion except Muslims. Trump visit. The violence began during Trump\u2019s visit to India this week, a trip designed to stoke nationalism in both nations, says Ankita Rao. Trump and Narendra Modi, leaders of the world\u2019s biggest democracies, are undermining their own countries\u2019 founding values, says Michael H Fuchs. With Weinstein in prison, spotlight turns on his enablers As he awaits his sentencing for rape and sexual assault on 11 March, Harvey Weinstein is to join the 7,000 inmates at New York\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail. In the meantime, the focus may shift to the associates who helped enable his abuses and silence his accusers. With 105 women having levelled accusations against him, writes Ed Pilkington, how Weinstein managed to avoid trouble for decades is a burning issue. \u2018No perfect victim\u2019. Weinstein\u2019s former assistant Rowena Chiu, who accused him of trying to rape her at a Venice hotel in 1998, has called for greater empathy towards rape survivors, saying: \u201cThe thing that we\u2019ve learned from the trial is there is no such thing as the perfect rape victim.\u201d Cheat sheet Bob Iger, the Disney CEO who masterminded the company\u2019s acquisitions of Marvel, Star Wars and the 20th Century Fox Studio, has abruptly stepped down after 15 years in charge of the world\u2019s most successful entertainment brand. The Welsh singer Aimee Duffy \u2013 who recorded as Duffy before her retreat from the public eye several years ago \u2013 has said in an Instagram post that she was drugged, raped and held captive by an unidentified person. The 11-time world champion surfer Kelly Slater is leading a project to construct the world\u2019s largest rideable, open-barrel, manmade wave at a new hotel complex in La Quinta, in the southern California desert. A former White House doctor has admitted he attempted to improve Trump\u2019s infamously unhealthy diet by sneaking cauliflower into the president\u2019s mashed potato and \u201cmaking the ice cream less accessible\u201d. Must-reads How lead is poisoning America\u2019s poorest children After her young son was diagnosed with autism, Shanaya Ball learned he had dangerous lead levels in his blood, caused by the crumbling paint in their Philadelphia home. The toxin endangers hundreds of thousands, reports Nina Lakhani, but parents whose children are most at risk may never be warned. Amazon debuts first checkout-free supermarket The first bricks and mortar Amazon Go Grocery store opened on Tuesday in Seattle, where sensors and cameras record everything in shoppers\u2019 baskets and charge them automatically \u2013 so you can walk out without waiting in line at checkout. Hallie Golden pays a visit. The college QB leading Trump\u2019s \u2018deep state\u2019 purge Johnny McEntee, the 29-year-old White House director for presidential personnel, is the person responsible for leading the administration\u2019s purge of those thought to harbour anti-Trump sentiments. Tom McCarthy profiles a baby-faced assassin. Is Gmail hiding Bernie\u2019s emails from you? Everyone knows Facebook and Twitter customise their news feeds. But Gmail\u2019s email curation could prove just as consequential in 2020, with some candidates\u2019 campaign mailouts proving more spam-prone than others, as a report by The Markup reveals. Opinion Michael Bloomberg\u2019s digital campaign is deliberately poisoning online discourse with doctored videos and fabricated quotes. It\u2019s a cynical approach with toxic side-effects, says Julia Carrie Wong. In many ways the Bloomberg campaign is only mimicking tactics that Donald Trump successfully harnessed in 2016, when his campaign enjoyed \u2026 a \u2018symbiotic relationship\u2019 with the far-right meme machine. Sport When MLS launched a quarter of a century ago, many wondered whether it could survive, writes Tom Dart. But on the eve of its 25th season it continues to grow, attracting foreign stars and developing new ties to football-mad Mexico. A senior member of the International Olympic Committee has said this summer\u2019s Tokyo Games may have to be cancelled if the coronavirus crisis becomes too dangerous in Japan, where a dozen new cases of the disease were reported on Monday.

The first is that many clubs have updated their facilities and huge tubs where players can collectively scrub themselves clean are not as common as they used to be. Privacy and PR are a big deal for clubs too, so the thought of images of naked players cavorting in baths getting shared on social media may well set alarm bells ringing.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that players in the modern era don\u2019t take a plunge to celebrate. If we broaden the question out to include celebrations of victories outside of the FA Cup, we can find a few relatively recent photos. Here\u2019s one of Lille\u2019s Moussa Sow leading a sing-song with teammates (including Eden Hazard), after they claimed the Ligue 1 title with a win at PSG in May 2011.

      "bodyText": "\u201cFootballers in dressing-room communal baths celebrating FA Cup wins used to be a sports pages staple,\u201d reminisces Roger Kirkby. \u201cWhen was the last such photo taken?\u201d We\u2019re guessing there are a number of reasons why we no longer see giddy footballers photographed in changing room baths, Roger. The first is that many clubs have updated their facilities and huge tubs where players can collectively scrub themselves clean are not as common as they used to be. Privacy and PR are a big deal for clubs too, so the thought of images of naked players cavorting in baths getting shared on social media may well set alarm bells ringing. That\u2019s not to say that players in the modern era don\u2019t take a plunge to celebrate. If we broaden the question out to include celebrations of victories outside of the FA Cup, we can find a few relatively recent photos. Here\u2019s one of Lille\u2019s Moussa Sow leading a sing-song with teammates (including Eden Hazard), after they claimed the Ligue 1 title with a win at PSG in May 2011. They are fully dressed, mind, so there was no danger of any indecency working its way on to the internet. Another team that we are grateful to for still having a big bath are Feyenoord. Their players used the space it afforded them to pose with the KNVB Cup after their victory over AZ Alkmaar at De Kuip stadium in April 2018. It\u2019s also the most recent communal-bath photo we can find, so hopefully answers Roger\u2019s tweaked question. \u201cI stumbled across this picture of Paul Lambert in the bath celebrating a Scottish Cup win for St Mirren in 1987 when writing an article about him for our local fanzine,\u201d writes Garry Brogden. \u201cIt\u2019s haunted me ever since.\u201d On the subject of haunting pictures, try this one for size: here\u2019s Mark Hughes, Gary Pallister and a far too relaxed-looking Bryan Robson celebrating Manchester United\u2019s 1993-94 Premier League win with some bubbly in the Old Trafford hot tub. Let\u2019s be honest, though, the old pictures are the best. The steam, the booze, the emotion. Bournemouth\u2019s players, and first-team coach and club stalwart John \u201cCaptain\u201d Kirk, piled into the Dean Court bath after their famous FA Cup win over Manchester United in January 1984. No sign of manager Harry Redknapp, however. And here\u2019s Manchester City celebrating their promotion to Division One in 1985. Some careful cropping was required with this one but not for Mick McCarthy, who hit the Maine Road bath proudly wearing his full kit and a rather serious expression. When Liverpool end their 30-year wait to win the league this season, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see images of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s well-drilled side letting their hair down with some booze and a bath. They are far too well-behaved for that. Liverpool\u2019s title-winners of 1975-76 were always up for a celebratory tipple. Here they are taking a dip in a Molineux bath that is probably 12% alcohol. Even their strict longtime physio and coach, Ronnie Moran, was happy to toast a famous 1-0 victory over Barcelona at Camp Nou after the 1975 Uefa Cup semi-final first leg with a bottle of ale and a soak. And who wouldn\u2019t want to take a relaxing plunge in that bath? If pictures of footballers in baths (celebrating or otherwise) float your boat then have a look at this classic gallery from 2014. It\u2019s pure gold. Playing for the most clubs beginning with the same letter \u201cHas any player played for more teams beginning with the same letter than Jan Hochscheidt (Energie Cottbus II, Erzgebirge Aue, Eintracht Braunschweig and Eintracht Braunschweig II),\u201d asks Stephen Bond. We have found a few, Stephen. \u201cDavid Connolly played for five (or six depending on whether the last counts) Watford, Wolves, Wimbledon, West Ham, Wigan and AFC Wimbledon,\u201d writes Tony Marsden. \u201cInterestingly, or maybe not, I have held a season ticket at some time for four of the clubs he has played for \u2013 the two Wimbledon clubs and his Dutch teams: Feyenoord and Excelsior).\u201d Unfortunately we\u2019re a stickler for accuracy and AFC has to be scratched off, Tony. \u201cAmong the 26 clubs Sebasti\u00e1n Abreu of Uruguay has represented (a record in itself), five start with \u2018S\u2019: San Lorenzo, San Luis, SD Aucas, Sol de Am\u00e9rica and Santa Tecla. And not only that, but each of the clubs are in a different country: Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, Paraguay and El Salvador \u2013 none of which includes his homeland. He\u2019s also played in five other countries, the wanderlust addict,\u201d gasps Ian Forth. Steve Claridge was always going to pop up wasn\u2019t he? \u201cHe played for Bournemouth, Birmingham, Brighton, Brentford and Bradford,\u201d tweets Steve Hyde. If we\u2019re being really picky (and we are), the Cherries are officially AFC Bournemouth. but ultimate journeyman Claridge has also played for five \u2018W\u2019 teams \u2013 Weymouth, Wolves, Wycombe, Walsall and Worthing. Back to B, and Steve can offer us a new front runner: \u201cNeil Redfearn can go one better than Claridge, having played for Bolton, Barnsley, Bradford City, Boston, Bradford Park Avenue and Bridlington.\u201d Playing home games at a rival\u2019s ground (part II) More of you have written in with examples of teams playing home games at a rival\u2019s ground \u2013 starting with Steven Chinn \u2026 \u201cI believe that in World War II, after bomb damage at Highbury, Spurs returned the WWI favour and Arsenal played games at White Hart Lane.\u201d Indeed, they did Steven. Arsenal played Wartime League games there to entertain locals. Highbury was also used as a centre for air raid precautions, which explains why it could not host matches. \u201cTo expand on the answer of Bristol Rovers playing at Ashton Gate, the game against Swindon happened on 11 April 1987 but the most interesting fact is why it occurred,\u201d begins Paul Biles. \u201cAs part of the transfer of striker Trevor Morgan from Rovers to City, one of the terms of the contract was that Rovers could use Ashton Gate free for one game. I\u2019m presuming the terms did not extend to the local derby that was played the following week at Twerton Park.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cWhat\u2019s the most disallowed goals scored in a match?\u201d asked Jonathan Malpass in 2004. On 2 April 2000, Celtic had four goals chalked off in 17 minutes against Kilmarnock, including three from a distraught Tommy Johnson. Needless to say, they still won the match 4-2. Since then Sheffield United, in 2016, have had four goals chalked off in a single match, too. Can you help? \u201cWith Liverpool having done the double over seven out of the eight teams they\u2019ve played twice in this season\u2019s Premier League as of 25 February, they might end up doing the double against 18 out of their 19 opponents. What\u2019s the record for the most doubles over everyone else in a league?\u201d asks Derek McHugh. \u201cHas there ever been an English league or FA Cup game played in July?\u201d asks Tai Wai Cheung.

      "bodyText": "Eight school facilities were bombed in Idlib province, Syria, in a single day, as the battle for control of the country\u2019s last opposition stronghold intensified. The attacks came despite warnings that the violence had already led to the worst humanitarian crisis in the Syrian war to date. Six schools and two nurseries in Idlib city, and the surrounding countryside, were among the targets of airstrikes by the Syrian regime and Russian forces on Tuesday. The attacks killed 21 people in total, the White Helmets civil defence service said. Yousef Kashto, a teacher at al-Baraem school, in Idlib city, said the bombing began at 8am, and teachers decided to send the children home. As the pupils were leaving a cluster bomb hit the school yard, killing three teachers and a student, and severely injuring six others. \u201cWe have been working under a state of emergency for two weeks due to the escalation in regime and Russian attacks on Idlib city \u2026 Two of our teachers are now in a critical condition. Parents rushed to the school horrified and looking for their children, who were still in shock,\u201d he said. At least 22 educational facilities have been bombed since the beginning of the year, according to the White Helmets and war monitors, and 400 civilians have been killed in total since Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies began the blistering offensive on Turkish-backed rebels and jihadist groups in north-west Idlib province in December. The UN says the violence has sent almost 1 million people fleeing north towards the Turkish border, which remains closed to refugees. Hundreds of thousands of families are now camped out in the winter conditions without adequate shelter, food or access to healthcare. Seven children have died due to exposure to the cold and horrific living conditions in the informal settlements, according to Hurras Network, Save the Children\u2019s local partner in Idlib. Supported by Russian air strikes, over the last 48 hours pro-regime forces have managed to capture the town of Kafranbel, once a centre of Syria\u2019s revolution, as well as 18 nearby towns and villages. Turkey, which has deployed about 12,000 troops to Idlib to shore up a 2018 de-escalation deal agreed with Moscow, has repeatedly called on Assad and his Russian allies to pull back to the previous ceasefire line. Also on Tuesday Syrian rebels, backed by the Turkish military, managed to seize the town of Nayrab, the first gain against the advancing Syrian government forces since Ankara entered the battle earlier this month. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has been pushing for a four-way summit with the leaders of Russia, France and Germany to address the escalating violence in Syria, but the Kremlin has so far remained non-committal.",

Steven Davis* entered into a relationship with a lecturer while a student, an arrangement he says was widespread at his university. \u201cI believe we had a full right to enjoy a relationship and enjoy each other\u2019s company,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody was harmed or placed at any disadvantage.\u201d But universities may be out of step with their students\u2019 expectations. The 1752 Group and the National Union of Students published a survey of 1,839 students in 2018 which found that four-fifths of students were uncomfortable with staff having relationships with students, which they described as \u201cpredatory\u201d. \u201cIf you allow sexual and romantic relationships then you\u2019re allowing staff to make sexual and romantic approaches to students, and that can be seen as harassment,\u201d explains Bull. She thinks that staff and student relationships have been normalised and romanticised through popular culture. Relationships are a common cultural trope in film and literature: for instance, in John Williams\u2019s cult novel Stoner, JM Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, or Malcolm Bradbury\u2019s The History Man. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move away from that, think about what we want the professional relationship to look like, and learn from other areas like social work and medicine,\u201d she says. A Freedom of Information (FoI) request by the Guardian sent to 130 UK universities that received 122 responses showed that while 97 universities have policies in place \u2013 many of which have been introduced in the last decade \u2013 just 12 keep central records monitoring numbers. Instead, individual line managers are left to monitor relationships. Ninety-five universities\u2019 relationship policies request that staff and students disclose sexual and romantic relationships, yet just 31 were able to provide numbers. The FoI responses showed considerable variation across universities, ranging from zero relationships disclosed over the past three years, to 22 at Glasgow University since September 2018 (when its policy was introduced), making it likely that reporting procedures are not fit for purpose. Although most universities claim to have disciplinary policies, only seven have ever disciplined a member of staff over a consensual relationship. At present, Universities UK guidelines on sexual misconduct do not cover staff-student relationships; however, it acknowledges that there is \u201cwork to be done\u201d. This would bring the UK closer in line with the US, where growing numbers of universities including Princeton and Harvard have banned sexual or romantic relationships. In the sexual misconduct experts\u2019 view, UK universities are falling behind where they should be. \u201cWe have seen much less progress on addressing abusive relationships and coercive control compared to work on sexual violence and harassment,\u201d Bull says. \u201cMuch greater awareness of the risks is needed.\u201d * Some names have been changed",

Now, the 1970 Miss World protests \u2013 during which feminist activists dramatically flour-bombed the stage \u2013 is getting a Hollywood makeover. The film Misbehaviour will document the period of fizzing excitement and possibility marked by the demonstrations. \u201cMiss World epitomised everything I believed was wrong,\u201d says one of the protesters, Jenny Fortune. \u201cIt felt as if we were stopping the patriarchy in its tracks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all believed in revolution back then,\u201d says Jo Robinson, another one of the activists who hurled flour and old vegetables at the host, Bob Hope, that night. \u201cWe all believed the world could be changed, and we all believed we could do it.\u201d</p> <p>Keira Knightley and Jessie Buckley play the lead roles in a starry lineup that also includes Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Keeley Hawes, Lesley Manville and Rhys Ifans. The film, directed by Philippa Lowthorpe (the first woman to win a Bafta for directing), follows the events leading up to the 1970 Miss World competition at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and focuses on two of the protesters: Robinson and Sally Alexander.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d495425686aca2ed88d9cf753e1366a79f24b5c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d495425686aca2ed88d9cf753e1366a79f24b5c1/0_392_3203_1922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protests at Miss World 1970\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The activists make their move at the show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonard Burt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film also pulls back to look at the many broader issues in the story, from the backdrop of the Vietnam war to the political circumstances that led the organisers to arrange for two contestants to represent the different sides of apartheid South Africa \u2013 one white (Miss South Africa), the other black (Miss Africa South). Misbehaviour was inspired by the Radio 4 programme The Reunion: its producer, Suzanne Mackie, heard the broadcast and later contacted Lowthorpe, who says she knew straightaway that this was a story she wanted to make into a film, in order to pay tribute to a past generation of feminists. \u201cWe\u2019ve forgotten how important their contribution was, and how much of a difference it made. I was almost in tears sometimes listening to their stories. And I realised I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do some of the things I\u2019ve done in my life, like going to Oxford University from a comprehensive school a decade later, if it hadn\u2019t been for them.\u201d\u201d</p> <p>In 1970, the women at the centre of the protests were in their 20s; today, they are in their 70s. Alexander, played by Knightley, went on to a career in academia, and today is professor emerita of modern history at Goldsmiths, University of London. \u201cWe thought it would be a good way of putting the issues on to the table because we knew the TV viewing figures would be high,\u201d she says. High is an understatement \u2013 the event was watched by 100 million people, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/miss-world-contest-1970-new-film-misbehaviour-jennifer-hosten-first-black-winner\" title=\"\">22 million in the UK</a>. \u201cWe were very wary of the media, and we thought this was a way of getting ourselves a direct line to people\u2019s TV screens.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander has mixed feelings about how she is portrayed in the film. She is glad it focuses on Jennifer Hosten, from Grenada, being crowned the first black Miss World. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that would turn out to be the most significant element of the night, but it certainly was, given the context of the anti-apartheid movement which many of us were also wrapped up in,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t even know who went on to win the contest \u2013 that was the last thing on our minds.\u201d In the event, after the protesters had been bundled out of the hall and the competition resumed, not only did Hosten win, but the black Miss Africa South, Pearl Jansen, was named the runner-up. \u201cLooking back, it was ironic this was the year we chose to demonstrate,\u201d says Alexander.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUa0Mtdv1HQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZUa0Mtdv1HQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Misbehaviour.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her main bugbear about the film is that it portrays a bomb \u2013 planted outside the hall by the militant far-left group the Angry Brigade \u2013 going off the day before the protest; in real life, it was on the evening itself. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would have gone out to demonstrate that night if there had been a bomb the day before: I\u2019m a mother, and my child came first \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t have put myself in danger,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Nor is there any mention in the film of the trial that followed the protest.

(In real life, for example, Alexander, who was a mature student, lived in a collective household not dissimilar to Robinson\u2019s commune; in the movie, she is presented as living with a partner in a more conventional setup.) But there were contrasts: Alexander was raised in the south-east, while Robinson grew up in Blackpool; Alexander was pursuing feminism through academia, while Robinson was an anarchist not averse to taking direct action \u2013 although, in the end, Alexander was also galvanised to protest.</p> <p>No one remembers exactly who came up with the idea of trying to get inside the Royal Albert Hall to disrupt the contest, but Sarah Wilson, another of the women there that night, recalls there being only five people at the initial meeting to discuss the plan. \u201cThere had been demonstrations outside the Miss World contest in previous years, but no one had ever tried getting inside the auditorium before.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38cd47aaec7cf8a3a7d4f4b24f20bf677ef71cf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38cd47aaec7cf8a3a7d4f4b24f20bf677ef71cf8/0_224_4228_2536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Hosten, the eventual winner, with Bob Hope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Hosten, the eventual winner, with Bob Hope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter King/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The women bought tickets and arrived solo or in pairs to avoid raising suspicion. \u201cI thought I might be on my own,\u201d says Robinson, who is played in the film by Buckley. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if anyone else had managed to get in. We knew we needed to blend in, so we dressed up. I certainly wasn\u2019t wearing the sort of clothes I usually wore. I was in a pink dress and coat with a floppy hat \u2013 it was what I\u2019d imagined would be right for Ascot.\u201d Another protester, Sue Finch, had never been to the Albert Hall before. \u201cI was 10 days away from giving birth to my first child, and it was quite a climb up to my balcony seat.\u201d</p> <p>The plan, says Wilson, was to wait until the Miss World contestants were all on stage before giving a signal to rain down the flour bombs and vegetables they had hidden in their handbags. There was no intention to criticise the contestants, only the organisers, she says \u2013 but they thought choosing the moment they were all on stage together to hurl their missiles would make the biggest impact.</p> <p>On the night, however, Bob Hope\u2019s tasteless, misogynistic gags changed their plans. \u201cHe was so gross,\u201d remembers Wilson. Hope referred to the event as a cattle market, mooing to make his point. Wilson leapt to her feet. \u201cI said to the woman beside me: \u2018This can\u2019t go on.\u2019 I started swinging my football rattle above my head.\u201d Finch remembers: \u201cWhen I heard Sarah\u2019s rattle, I began to throw flour bombs and leaflets over the balcony. And suddenly, all around me were other women doing the same. It was as if snow was falling \u2026 it was a wonderful moment \u2026\u201d Fortune recalls it in the same way. \u201cIt felt as if we were taking control. It was life-changing \u2013 I knew that I was heading into a very different future.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reCX3_OAkv8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/reCX3_OAkv8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The 1970 Miss World protest.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But how different would that future turn out to be? It\u2019s difficult to imagine that the activists of 1970, poised for dramatic changes in women\u2019s rights, would be satisfied half a century on. Alexander says they were children of the welfare state, and that they believed the narrowing gap in inequality would continue as the decades rolled on. \u201cBut it all changed in 1979,\u201d she says, \u201cwith the election of Thatcher.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t realise what we were up against,\u201d says Fortune. \u201cWe felt very powerful, and we thought things were going to change more than they did.\u201d Looking back to the original Ruskin conference, Finch says there has been little in the way of significant change. \u201cOn childcare we\u2019ve done OK. But violence against women hasn\u2019t changed, and, in a way, that\u2019s what our protest was all about. If you treat women as objects, it\u2019s easier to rape and kill them.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to hope that Misbehaviour will inspire a new generation of women, but Alexander is philosophical; each generation, she says, must find its own way of dealing with the struggle, with political and social injustice. \u201cI do think, though, that the women\u2019s liberation movement was important, and if people don\u2019t know where equality and equal pay came from, then they should know,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s still a great deal to do, and so many young women today are active, and in a different way.\u201d Robinson has the final word: \u201cWe are still hopeful,\u201d she says.</p> <p><em>Misbehaviour is released on 13 March in the UK, and 23 April in Australia</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 February.

But there were contrasts: Alexander was raised in the south-east, while Robinson grew up in Blackpool; Alexander was pursuing feminism through academia, while Robinson was an anarchist not averse to taking direct action \u2013 although, in the end, Alexander was also galvanised to protest. No one remembers exactly who came up with the idea of trying to get inside the Royal Albert Hall to disrupt the contest, but Sarah Wilson, another of the women there that night, recalls there being only five people at the initial meeting to discuss the plan. \u201cThere had been demonstrations outside the Miss World contest in previous years, but no one had ever tried getting inside the auditorium before.\u201d The women bought tickets and arrived solo or in pairs to avoid raising suspicion. \u201cI thought I might be on my own,\u201d says Robinson, who is played in the film by Buckley. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if anyone else had managed to get in. We knew we needed to blend in, so we dressed up. I certainly wasn\u2019t wearing the sort of clothes I usually wore. I was in a pink dress and coat with a floppy hat \u2013 it was what I\u2019d imagined would be right for Ascot.\u201d Another protester, Sue Finch, had never been to the Albert Hall before. \u201cI was 10 days away from giving birth to my first child, and it was quite a climb up to my balcony seat.\u201d The plan, says Wilson, was to wait until the Miss World contestants were all on stage before giving a signal to rain down the flour bombs and vegetables they had hidden in their handbags. There was no intention to criticise the contestants, only the organisers, she says \u2013 but they thought choosing the moment they were all on stage together to hurl their missiles would make the biggest impact. On the night, however, Bob Hope\u2019s tasteless, misogynistic gags changed their plans. \u201cHe was so gross,\u201d remembers Wilson. Hope referred to the event as a cattle market, mooing to make his point. Wilson leapt to her feet. \u201cI said to the woman beside me: \u2018This can\u2019t go on.\u2019 I started swinging my football rattle above my head.\u201d Finch remembers: \u201cWhen I heard Sarah\u2019s rattle, I began to throw flour bombs and leaflets over the balcony. And suddenly, all around me were other women doing the same. It was as if snow was falling \u2026 it was a wonderful moment \u2026\u201d Fortune recalls it in the same way. \u201cIt felt as if we were taking control. It was life-changing \u2013 I knew that I was heading into a very different future.\u201d But how different would that future turn out to be? It\u2019s difficult to imagine that the activists of 1970, poised for dramatic changes in women\u2019s rights, would be satisfied half a century on. Alexander says they were children of the welfare state, and that they believed the narrowing gap in inequality would continue as the decades rolled on. \u201cBut it all changed in 1979,\u201d she says, \u201cwith the election of Thatcher.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise what we were up against,\u201d says Fortune. \u201cWe felt very powerful, and we thought things were going to change more than they did.\u201d Looking back to the original Ruskin conference, Finch says there has been little in the way of significant change. \u201cOn childcare we\u2019ve done OK. But violence against women hasn\u2019t changed, and, in a way, that\u2019s what our protest was all about. If you treat women as objects, it\u2019s easier to rape and kill them.\u201d It\u2019s tempting to hope that Misbehaviour will inspire a new generation of women, but Alexander is philosophical; each generation, she says, must find its own way of dealing with the struggle, with political and social injustice. \u201cI do think, though, that the women\u2019s liberation movement was important, and if people don\u2019t know where equality and equal pay came from, then they should know,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s still a great deal to do, and so many young women today are active, and in a different way.\u201d Robinson has the final word: \u201cWe are still hopeful,\u201d she says. Misbehaviour is released on 13 March in the UK, and 23 April in Australia \u2022 This article was amended on 27 February. An earlier version stated that director Philippa Lowthorpe was inspired by overhearing The Reunion, when it was that programme\u2019s producer, Suzanne Mackie, who contacted her.",

      "body": "<p>If a dumpster is already on fire, is there any harm in throwing some more trash into it?</p> <p>Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has spent the last month unapologetically performing the digital equivalent of dumping buckets of fresh garbage into the trash fire that is internet discourse in 2020, apparently with little or no concern for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/23/detroit-garbage-incinerator-pollution-health-problems-environmentalists\">toxic side</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/23/detroit-garbage-incinerator-pollution-health-problems-environmentalists\"> effects</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a cynical approach, and if left unchecked, it threatens to poison the atmosphere for good.</p> <p>The first sign that the Bloomberg campaign was prepared to test the unwritten rules around digital campaigning came in mid-February, when a coordinated \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/michael-bloomberg-memes-jerry-media.html\">influencer\u201d campaign</a> flooded Instagram with paid content promoting the image of the 78-year-old billionaire as a bumbling but lovable dad just trying to get down with the kids. The Bloomberg \u201cmemes\u201d conveniently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/14/facebook-reverses-political-ads-rule-bloomberg-finds-loophole\">sidestepped the transparency rules</a> Facebook and Instagram put in place after the 2016 election, while attracting huge amounts of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/opinion/mike-bloomberg-campaign.html\">attention</a> and media coverage.</p> <p>Next came the campaign\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/20/mike-bloomberg-debate-video-facebook-twitter-instagram\">infamous post-debate video</a>, which used editing tricks to fabricate a moment of triumph for Bloomberg out of decidedly less triumphant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/20/michael-bloomberg-elizabeth-warren-new-york-mayor-trump\">raw material</a>. The video showed Bloomberg\u2019s Democratic rivals struck dumb for 20 seconds after Bloomberg asserted that he was the only person on stage to have started a business; Bloomberg did make that statement, but the extended silence was faked.</p> <p>The campaign argues that the video was \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d \u2013 and that the inclusion of cricket chirps in the audio made that fakery clear to viewers. I disagree \u2013 it\u2019s hard for the average viewer who hasn\u2019t seen the debate to discern which parts of the video are real and which are fake, making it a potent and misleading piece of propaganda.</p> <p>Bloomberg is also paying a team of \u201cdeputy field organizers\u201d to post scripted campaign messaging to their social media accounts. Some of the accounts spreading these messages were suspended by Twitter for violating the rules against platform manipulation and spam, the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-02-23/mike-bloomberg-paid-twitter-social-media?utm_source=CrossCheck+Leads&amp;utm_campaign=ec602cc398-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_10_29_11_33_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_9011cfe5e0-ec602cc398-267300221&amp;mc_cid=ec602cc398&amp;mc_eid=6453bbc4ae\">Los Angeles Times</a> reported, though Twitter told me that it has yet to determine who is behind the accounts it suspended.</p> <p>Finally (so far), on Monday the Bloomberg campaign\u2019s Twitter account published a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/25/mike-bloomberg-bernie-sanders-dictator-tweets-twitter\">fabricated \u201cquotes\u201d</a> that purported to \u201cguess\u201d Bernie Sanders\u2019 views on various \u201cdespots\u201d. The fake quotes were published in separate tweets, while a final tweet in the thread disclosed that they were \u201csatire\u201d \u2013 an insufficient disclaimer on a platform where any individual tweet is designed to be removed from its context. The #BernieOnDespots tweets hit the trifecta of being misleading, homophobic, and unfunny \u2013 and were subsequently deleted by the campaign.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The dumpster fire is creating billowing clouds of noxious smoke, and it\u2019s making it harder for all of us to breathe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Viewed individually, each of these tactics is questionable without being necessarily condemnable. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing the boundaries of what we deem acceptable as political speech,\u201d said Claire Wardle, an expert in disinformation and the director of First Draft Media. Tactics such as misleadingly editing video were not new to American politics, she said, but the combination of such tactics with social media was novel.</p> <p>Wardle argued that the Bloomberg ad was \u201cexactly the same\u201d as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/09/nancy-pelosi-trump-state-of-the-union-video-twitter-facebook\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/09/nancy-pelosi-trump-state-of-the-union-video-twitter-facebook\">manipulated video of Nancy Pelosi</a> recently released by the Trump campaign that created the false impression that Pelosi ripped up Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech just as Trump was honoring a Tuskegee airman.</p> <p>Such content takes advantage of the way that our media ecosystem works, she explained.

      "bodyText": "If a dumpster is already on fire, is there any harm in throwing some more trash into it? Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has spent the last month unapologetically performing the digital equivalent of dumping buckets of fresh garbage into the trash fire that is internet discourse in 2020, apparently with little or no concern for the toxic side effects. It\u2019s a cynical approach, and if left unchecked, it threatens to poison the atmosphere for good. The first sign that the Bloomberg campaign was prepared to test the unwritten rules around digital campaigning came in mid-February, when a coordinated \u201cinfluencer\u201d campaign flooded Instagram with paid content promoting the image of the 78-year-old billionaire as a bumbling but lovable dad just trying to get down with the kids. The Bloomberg \u201cmemes\u201d conveniently sidestepped the transparency rules Facebook and Instagram put in place after the 2016 election, while attracting huge amounts of attention and media coverage. Next came the campaign\u2019s infamous post-debate video, which used editing tricks to fabricate a moment of triumph for Bloomberg out of decidedly less triumphant raw material. The video showed Bloomberg\u2019s Democratic rivals struck dumb for 20 seconds after Bloomberg asserted that he was the only person on stage to have started a business; Bloomberg did make that statement, but the extended silence was faked. The campaign argues that the video was \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d \u2013 and that the inclusion of cricket chirps in the audio made that fakery clear to viewers. I disagree \u2013 it\u2019s hard for the average viewer who hasn\u2019t seen the debate to discern which parts of the video are real and which are fake, making it a potent and misleading piece of propaganda. Bloomberg is also paying a team of \u201cdeputy field organizers\u201d to post scripted campaign messaging to their social media accounts. Some of the accounts spreading these messages were suspended by Twitter for violating the rules against platform manipulation and spam, the Los Angeles Times reported, though Twitter told me that it has yet to determine who is behind the accounts it suspended. Finally (so far), on Monday the Bloomberg campaign\u2019s Twitter account published a series of fabricated \u201cquotes\u201d that purported to \u201cguess\u201d Bernie Sanders\u2019 views on various \u201cdespots\u201d. The fake quotes were published in separate tweets, while a final tweet in the thread disclosed that they were \u201csatire\u201d \u2013 an insufficient disclaimer on a platform where any individual tweet is designed to be removed from its context. The #BernieOnDespots tweets hit the trifecta of being misleading, homophobic, and unfunny \u2013 and were subsequently deleted by the campaign. Viewed individually, each of these tactics is questionable without being necessarily condemnable. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing the boundaries of what we deem acceptable as political speech,\u201d said Claire Wardle, an expert in disinformation and the director of First Draft Media. Tactics such as misleadingly editing video were not new to American politics, she said, but the combination of such tactics with social media was novel. Wardle argued that the Bloomberg ad was \u201cexactly the same\u201d as a manipulated video of Nancy Pelosi recently released by the Trump campaign that created the false impression that Pelosi ripped up Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech just as Trump was honoring a Tuskegee airman. Such content takes advantage of the way that our media ecosystem works, she explained. Some people will actually be fooled by the faked video; others will recognize that it\u2019s false and react with anger or attempts at correcting the record. Either way, the result is more eyes on the video and the broader campaign \u2013 a formula for monopolizing attention that Trump has used to his advantage for years now. \u201cWe see people hiding behind the label of satire,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cYou push something out, get a ton of press coverage, then when someone pushes you on it, you say it was \u2018tongue-in-cheek\u2019. You win on both levels.\u201d A Bloomberg aide who would only speak to the Guardian on background said that there was a huge difference between the debate video and a manipulated video that made Nancy Pelosi appear to slur her words that went viral in 2019. \u201cThey changed something; we just cut different shots,\u201d the aide said. The Bloomberg campaign has instructed all \u201cdeputy field organizers\u201d to identify themselves as campaign staffers and deleted the #BernieOnDespots tweets after facing criticism, the aide added. Above all, the aide argued, the campaign was not trying to be dishonest. Perhaps. But in the aggregate, a troubling pattern of behavior emerges. \u201cIt feels like a bunch of extremely online, talented, well-informed social media marketer types who are utilizing their skills to propagate messages about Mike Bloomberg in a way that feels like it has no moral center,\u201d said Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communications and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University. \u201cIt\u2019s the embracing of a cynical outlook: \u2018lol nothing matters\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s leaning into nihilism.\u201d Phillips has developed a framework for understanding internet discourse as an \u201cinformation ecology\u201d in which disinformation, misinformation and other negative behaviors are forms of pollution. I\u2019ve found it a very helpful way to grasp what\u2019s happening in the ineffable world of the internet; that dumpster fire is creating billowing clouds of noxious smoke, and it\u2019s making it harder for all of us to breathe. \u201cIn an already polluted information landscape, politicians have a special obligation to not contribute to that pollution,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe reason that the Bloomberg campaign is so distressing to me is that it points to precisely what we\u2019re up against, which is that pollution works.\u201d Indeed, in many ways the Bloomberg campaign is only mimicking tactics that Donald Trump successfully harnessed in 2016, when his campaign enjoyed what Phillips described as a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d with the far-right meme machine. \u201cMy fear is that we\u2019re going to see an avalanche of this stuff,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t people do it?

      "body": "<p>A young woman stands at the grave of her recently departed father, her blond hair in a ponytail. After a quiet moment, she places flowers on the ground, then hears the crunch of gravel behind her. She whips around, pulls out her gun and finds a brunette woman of roughly her own age. The brunette smiles faintly and reassures the blonde that she\u2019s not here to fight. She, too, is here to pay her respects. They walk past one another, visibly tense in blocky 1996 animation, and decide to let the feud rest. For today.</p> <p>This is one of the more conservative story endings for Nina Williams, a much-beloved combatant in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/02/wipeout-tekken-return-90s-gaming\">the Tekken series of fighting games</a>. In conversations around classic female video games characters, she often gets overlooked.

There\u2019s more, a lot more. Tekken is the very definition of \u201ca lot\u201d. It\u2019s soap opera, anime, drama, toy commercial.

Nobody ever enters Iron Fist for the money or the heck of it. They battle through a dozen or so fights of three rounds, usually ending with a supernatural near-unbeatable boss, and then they walk off into the sunset. And we get to see what that sunset looks like for them. Sometimes it\u2019s Jun Kazama taking a bus to the middle of the woods. Sometimes it\u2019s Michelle and Julia Chang, archaeologist and scientist respectively, trying to take down the Mishima Zaibatsu. For me, Tekken is the gold standard in terms of classic arcade games that went out of its way to show a diversity of female characters.</p> <p>Diversity here is a relative term. There were no black women in the series until Master Raven in Tekken 7. They\u2019re all smoking hot, crazily proportioned women with insane fashion choices. Nina was, rather conveniently for the designers, put under cryo-sleep for 15 years and woke up still in her 20s, while Kazuya Mishima\u2019s face aged like a railway map in the rain. But in comparison with Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Dead or Alive, and the other fighting games of the era, the women never felt like tokenistic afterthoughts, there for girls to feel mildly included and for boys to ogle. By taking <em>every</em> character on their own hero\u2019s journey, they necessarily had to write <em>every </em>journey. Tekken exists in a crazy, mixed-up world where women are people. They have jealousies, rivalries and long-standing misunderstandings that morph into lifelong feuds. They have children, and they have weird feelings about those children. Teenagers, mothers, daughters, assassins, nature girls, sexpots, cat-masked demon thieves (Kunimitsu, we never see enough of you!), they all had as valid a place as the male fighters and as complex a history.</p> <p>Tekken gives you a lot more story than virtually any other fighting game, and asks for more mental flexibility from its players. When you win the Iron Fist tournament with a character, you are given their victory, and what they do with it.

      "bodyText": "A young woman stands at the grave of her recently departed father, her blond hair in a ponytail. After a quiet moment, she places flowers on the ground, then hears the crunch of gravel behind her. She whips around, pulls out her gun and finds a brunette woman of roughly her own age. The brunette smiles faintly and reassures the blonde that she\u2019s not here to fight. She, too, is here to pay her respects. They walk past one another, visibly tense in blocky 1996 animation, and decide to let the feud rest. For today. This is one of the more conservative story endings for Nina Williams, a much-beloved combatant in the Tekken series of fighting games.

They then set the mosque alight. Later in the evening, another smaller mosque and Muslim shops in the local market were burned.</p> \n<p>A local Muslim, who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety, described how the mob had set about destroying the mosque for over three hours, shouting Hindu nationalist slogans as they went. \u201cThey came in the afternoon and burned everything inside and then they looted and burned the shop inside the mosque and then two Muslim houses next door,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do not even know what to say. In 35 years I have never seen a situation like this, Hindus and Muslims always lived peacefully here. We all celebrated Eid and Diwali together.

Heavy deployment of Delhi police and paramilitary forces were visible in some of the worst hit areas on Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally broke his silence on the violence, appealing for \u201cpeace and brotherhood\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHad an extensive review on the situation prevailing in various parts of Delhi,\u201d tweeted Modi \u201cPolice and other agencies are working on the ground to ensure peace and normalcy.\u201d</p> \n<p>By Wednesday evening, an uneasy calm had descended on the city but there was a heavy police presence still on the streets.

Groups on both sides began throwing stones and attacking each other, prompting an escalation of violence.</p> \n<p>A legal order that prevents gatherings of more than four people, has been imposed across north-west Delhi. Police deployed tear gas but the measures failed to contain the mobs.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the Delhi high court passed a series of orders relating to the religious violence in Delhi. The judges stated that \u201canother 1984-like situation cannot be allowed to happen in this city under it\u2019s watch\u201d, referring to the anti-Sikh pogroms that broke out in India in 1984 following the assassination of prime minister Indira Gandhi, which saw over 3,000 Sikhs killed in Delhi. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The death toll from the worst religious violence in Delhi in decades has risen to 24, as Muslims fled from their homes and several mosques in the capital smouldered after being attacked by Hindu mobs. The deathly clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups that began on Sunday continued into their forth consecutive day, with reports of early morning looting on some Muslim homes which had been abandoned out of fear. More than 200 people were admitted to hospitals for injuries mainly from gunshot wounds as well as acid burns, stabbings and wounds from beatings and stone pelting. Several of those who died had jumped from high buildings to escape the attacking mobs. On Wednesday, an intelligence bureau officer was declared among the dead in the clashes, after his body was found in a drain in the Chand Bagh area. It followed the death of a police officer on Monday after he was hit in the head with a stone. Police said they had arrested 106 people in connection with the violence. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal described the situation as \u201calarming\u201d and said the army should be called to take control of the violence. \u201cSituation alarming,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cPolice, despite all its efforts, unable to control situation and instil confidence. Army should be called in and curfew imposed in rest of affected areas immediately.\u201d On Tuesday afternoon, a violent Hindu mob of around 500 young men descended on to a mosque in Ashok Nagar, broke down the doors and climbed the minaret to fly a Hindu flag. They then set the mosque alight. Later in the evening, another smaller mosque and Muslim shops in the local market were burned. A local Muslim, who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety, described how the mob had set about destroying the mosque for over three hours, shouting Hindu nationalist slogans as they went. \u201cThey came in the afternoon and burned everything inside and then they looted and burned the shop inside the mosque and then two Muslim houses next door,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI do not even know what to say. In 35 years I have never seen a situation like this, Hindus and Muslims always lived peacefully here. We all celebrated Eid and Diwali together. Hindu women often came into the mosque with their children, so this was not just a building for Muslims but for the whole community. But whatever peace we had is now gone.\u201d The attacks on Muslim properties continued on Wednesday morning. However, some local Hindus were patrolling the area to protect the mosque and offered to shelter Muslim families to keep them safe. The riots have continued to spread across north-east Delhi, with Jafrabad, Babarpur, Brahmpuri, Gorakh Park, Maujpur, Bhajanpura, Kabir Nagar, Chand Bagh, Gokulpuri, Karawal Nagar, Khajuri Khas and Kardampuri all affected. Heavy deployment of Delhi police and paramilitary forces were visible in some of the worst hit areas on Wednesday morning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally broke his silence on the violence, appealing for \u201cpeace and brotherhood\u201d. \u201cHad an extensive review on the situation prevailing in various parts of Delhi,\u201d tweeted Modi \u201cPolice and other agencies are working on the ground to ensure peace and normalcy.\u201d By Wednesday evening, an uneasy calm had descended on the city but there was a heavy police presence still on the streets. National security adviser Ajit Doval said the situation was \u201cunder control\u201d. It has been the bloodiest days of protest in India since Modi\u2019s government passed a new citizenship amendment act, which grants citizenship for refugees of every major South Asian religion except Muslims, in December. The law sparked a nationwide backlash over fears the law is discriminatory towards Muslims and will undermine the secular foundations of India by making religion the basis of citizenship, and demonstrations have continued across India for the past three months. The violence in Delhi was sparked after Kapil Mishra, leader from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), incited a Hindu mob to violently remove a group of Muslims who were blocking a road in north-west Delhi in protest against the citizenship act. Groups on both sides began throwing stones and attacking each other, prompting an escalation of violence. A legal order that prevents gatherings of more than four people, has been imposed across north-west Delhi. Police deployed tear gas but the measures failed to contain the mobs. On Wednesday, the Delhi high court passed a series of orders relating to the religious violence in Delhi. The judges stated that \u201canother 1984-like situation cannot be allowed to happen in this city under it\u2019s watch\u201d, referring to the anti-Sikh pogroms that broke out in India in 1984 following the assassination of prime minister Indira Gandhi, which saw over 3,000 Sikhs killed in Delhi.",

Metals found there such as copper, nickel, aluminium, lithium, cobalt and mangen are increasingly needed to make batteries, smartphones and solar panels.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;When will it happen?<br></b>So far, 30 exploration licences have been granted by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body. In total, 1.5m km2 has been set aside for mineral exploration (equivalent to an area the size of Mongolia) in the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as along the mid-Atlantic ridge. No exploitation contracts have yet been allocated but they are expected to be given out as early as this year when ISA\u2019s Mining Code is expected to be approved. This will be a set of rules \u201cto regulate prospecting, exploration and exploitation of marine minerals in the international seabed area\u201d.</p>\n    <p><b>Why is it a problem?<br></b>Critics are concerned mining could do huge damage to the deep sea and the creatures and ecosystems that exist there. Underwater ecosystems like volcanic mountains, hydrothermal vents and deep-sea trenches are still poorly understood. Many endemic deep-sea species could be wiped out by the creation of a single large mine, while more mobile creatures will be indirectly affected by noise and light pollution.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>What can be done?&nbsp;<br></b>Comprehensive studies need to be carried out to assess the potential damage to biodiversity before deep-sea mining goes ahead, according to the <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/deep-sea-mining\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>&nbsp;(IUCN). Fundamentally, the IUCN also says people need to recycle and reuse products so there is less demand for extraction of natural resources. Researchers have created a list of priorities for deep-sea conservation. The survey,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1091-z\"> published in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</a>, included the responses of 112 scientists.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Phoebe Weston</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mining companies in Germany, China, Korea, India and the UK are among the recipients. \u201cThey\u2019re not supposed to be used for commercial-scale mining, but several of the licences have been renewed and they\u2019re into a second 10-year term, says Sigwart, adding that the ISA is currently developing a regulatory framework for commercial mining in the high seas.</p> \n<p>The race is now on for Sigwart and other biologists to identify and learn more about the vent-dwelling creatures and lobby for their protection.

But it\u2019s no longer fine, because now we\u2019re on a path to developing commercial-scale deep-sea mining and vents are a target. We can no longer naively hope that the depths of the oceans are still pristine and untouched.\u201d \u201cMore and more,\u201d says Sigwart, \u201cit\u2019s clear that they are already impacted by human activities. We find plastic in deep-sea sediments, the ocean circulation patterns are being altered by global climate change.\u201d Crucially, she says, the tide is turning when it comes to scientists becoming more vocal about the animals that would otherwise stay out of sight and out of mind. \u201cDeep-sea biology is fascinating and exciting, and it inspires a sense of wonder in everybody,\u201d says Sigwart. \u201cThere are very few of us that have the privilege of actually working on these animals and habitats. We have a burden of responsibility to try to explain them to other people before the damage is done.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

Some 73% of leave voters <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/17/how-britain-voted-2019-general-election\" title=\"\">supported the Conservatives in 2019</a>, an increase of eight points from 2017, mostly at the expense of Labour (down nine points). Of the 54 seats that Labour <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-all-the-seats-jeremy-corbyns-labour-party-has-lost-to-the-conservatives-and-snp-1340689\" title=\"\">lost to the Conservatives</a>, 52 voted leave in 2016, and most of the voters who abandoned Labour for the Tories said that they did so to get Brexit done. To form a minority government in 2024, Labour needs to win about 78 seats that the Conservatives won by less than 15 points in 2019. Of these, more than 80% voted leave in 2016. As well as winning new seats, if Labour is to have any hope of winning back those it lost in 2019, it needs to win about 25% to 30% of the vote among those who voted leave in 2016. In 2019 it won just 15%.</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s potential difficulties in winning back leave voters are immediately apparent. As a key remain campaigner and the author of Labour\u2019s second referendum policy \u2013 which more than 80% of leave voters disapproved of \u2013 there is a distinct risk that he will prove unable to win back the Labour voters who abandoned the party to support Brexit.</p> <p>According to Opinium, more leave voters already associate him with Labour\u2019s Brexit strategy than any other candidate, and he has a negative net rating (-4 points) from leave voters in the recent Lord Ashcroft <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2020/02/diagnosis-of-defeat-labours-turn-to-smell-the-coffee/\" title=\"\">poll</a>.

When asked in an Ashcroft poll to select a word or phrase to describe her, 77% of voters simply said \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. However, Nandy is in the unique position of having voted for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, which may help her in leave seats that voted for the Tories.</p> <p>The second big challenge for Labour is to convince voters that the party\u2019s polices are credible and achievable. According to <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2020/02/diagnosis-of-defeat-labours-turn-to-smell-the-coffee/\" title=\"\">the Ashcroft poll</a>, 62% of the voters Labour lost to the Conservatives did not believe Labour would be able to deliver on its promises. It is not that voters did not approve of Labour\u2019s policies \u2013 indeed, those policies are overwhelmingly <a href=\"https://statsforlefties.blogspot.com/2020/02/why-long-bailey-is-most-electable.html\" title=\"\">supported by the public</a> \u2013 but that they did not see them as achievable.</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s supporters would likely argue that his experience as shadow Brexit secretary has given him a forensic grasp of policy, which would help him to explain Labour\u2019s policies better while giving them an \u201celectable\u201d face. Indeed, as of right now, Starmer has the <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2020/02/diagnosis-of-defeat-labours-turn-to-smell-the-coffee/\" title=\"\">best approval ratings</a> with voters \u2013 with a net +5 points, according to Ipsos Mori, and +15 points, according to Lord Ashcroft. However, the proportion of \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d in these polls is very high (51%, according to Ashcroft), so these early polls may change.</p> <p>Nandy, meanwhile, has urged Labour to abandon some policies, such as free broadband, that she sees as not being credible with the voters. It is certainly true that free broadband was the 2019 policy with the <a href=\"https://statsforlefties.blogspot.com/2020/02/why-long-bailey-is-most-electable.html\" title=\"\">lowest net approval in a DeltaPollUK poll</a>. However, Nandy\u2019s desire to also abandon Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1227715122900144128\" title=\"\">plans of mass nationalisation</a> and abolishing tuition fees may be a misstep: the voters <a href=\"https://statsforlefties.blogspot.com/2020/02/why-long-bailey-is-most-electable.html\" title=\"\">overwhelmingly support those policies</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/24/labour-period-reflection-self-flagellation\">Labour\u2019s \u2018period of reflection\u2019 requires more than self-flagellation | Tom Blackburn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, Long-Bailey\u2019s supporters would likely argue that as the author of many Labour policies, she is best placed to explain them. Indeed she is <a href=\"https://statsforlefties.blogspot.com/2020/02/why-long-bailey-is-most-electable.html\" title=\"\">already associated</a> with Labour\u2019s manifesto and with its policies of nationalisation. However, her approval ratings with voters are currently the lowest of any candidate (-16 points according to Ipsos Mori, and -20 points according to Ashcroft). As with Starmer and Nandy, the proportion of \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d are very high, but this nonetheless indicates that Long-Bailey will have to improve her image with the voters if she wins.</p> <p>To win back leave voters and convince all voters that Labour\u2019s policies are achievable is no easy task. There is no candidate who ticks all the boxes, so Labour members face a difficult choice. But whoever is elected will face the same challenges, and they will need the support of the whole Labour party to succeed. Uniting the party behind the leader will give them the best chance. Those of us who want a Labour victory in 2024 can only hope that whoever wins will be up to the task.</p> <p>\u2022 Ell Smith is the founder of Stats for Lefties, a blog and podcast that examines polls and elections</p>",

However, Nandy is in the unique position of having voted for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, which may help her in leave seats that voted for the Tories. The second big challenge for Labour is to convince voters that the party\u2019s polices are credible and achievable. According to the Ashcroft poll, 62% of the voters Labour lost to the Conservatives did not believe Labour would be able to deliver on its promises. It is not that voters did not approve of Labour\u2019s policies \u2013 indeed, those policies are overwhelmingly supported by the public \u2013 but that they did not see them as achievable. Starmer\u2019s supporters would likely argue that his experience as shadow Brexit secretary has given him a forensic grasp of policy, which would help him to explain Labour\u2019s policies better while giving them an \u201celectable\u201d face. Indeed, as of right now, Starmer has the best approval ratings with voters \u2013 with a net +5 points, according to Ipsos Mori, and +15 points, according to Lord Ashcroft. However, the proportion of \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d in these polls is very high (51%, according to Ashcroft), so these early polls may change. Nandy, meanwhile, has urged Labour to abandon some policies, such as free broadband, that she sees as not being credible with the voters. It is certainly true that free broadband was the 2019 policy with the lowest net approval in a DeltaPollUK poll. However, Nandy\u2019s desire to also abandon Labour\u2019s plans of mass nationalisation and abolishing tuition fees may be a misstep: the voters overwhelmingly support those policies. Finally, Long-Bailey\u2019s supporters would likely argue that as the author of many Labour policies, she is best placed to explain them. Indeed she is already associated with Labour\u2019s manifesto and with its policies of nationalisation. However, her approval ratings with voters are currently the lowest of any candidate (-16 points according to Ipsos Mori, and -20 points according to Ashcroft). As with Starmer and Nandy, the proportion of \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d are very high, but this nonetheless indicates that Long-Bailey will have to improve her image with the voters if she wins. To win back leave voters and convince all voters that Labour\u2019s policies are achievable is no easy task. There is no candidate who ticks all the boxes, so Labour members face a difficult choice. But whoever is elected will face the same challenges, and they will need the support of the whole Labour party to succeed. Uniting the party behind the leader will give them the best chance. Those of us who want a Labour victory in 2024 can only hope that whoever wins will be up to the task. \u2022 Ell Smith is the founder of Stats for Lefties, a blog and podcast that examines polls and elections",

      "bodyText": "This is a story about MLS that begins not at the stadium where the Houston Dynamo will host the Los Angeles Galaxy as the league\u2019s 25th season kicks off on Saturday, but in a converted warehouse across the street. Here, in a low-slung brick building, former USA and Dynamo striker Brian Ching opened a bar in 2018 that features industrial-chic exposed ductwork, and, more surprisingly, an indoor football pitch. It\u2019s doubtful this soccer-centric venture would have made economic or cultural sense without the impact of BBVA Stadium. The Dynamo opened their purpose-built home in 2012: a 22,000-capacity arena with a tessellated metal mesh exterior, orange seating bowl and a location, in the shadow of downtown\u2019s shiny skyscrapers, that set MLS at the core of the country\u2019s fourth-biggest city. The venue underlined that a sport once derided as the province of suburban families also appealed to young urbanites \u2013 the kind of crowds who flock to Ching\u2019s bar, Pitch 25. Ching made his MLS debut for the Galaxy in 2001, the year before the league killed off clubs in Tampa and Miami, leaving 10 franchises \u2013 the same number it had in 1996, its inaugural season. And nine of those were owned by two men, Philip Anschutz (the boss of AEG) and Lamar Hunt (the son of a Texas oil tycoon). Despite ongoing stadium agonies, MLS has returned to south Florida in the Beckham-esque shape of Inter Miami. Nashville SC also make their debut in 2020, with another four teams arriving by 2022 to lift the total to 30. Toronto FC paid $10m to join in 2007. The latest entrant, Charlotte, is splashing out $325m. Quite a contrast with 20 years ago, when many wondered if the league would survive, let alone thrive. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d Ching says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty awesome to see \u2026 There\u2019s just an excitement around soccer now and I think that\u2019s going to exponentially grow over the next few World Cups.\u201d But most of his customers are not watching MLS. The biggest draws are the English, Spanish, German and Mexican leagues. \u201cBayern Munich versus Dortmund, we had probably five or six hundred people in for that game; La Liga, Barcelona versus Real Madrid, we probably get a thousand, twelve hundred people for those games,\u201d he says. While MLS is growing in popularity, Ching says, \u201cit\u2019s not nearly on the level of the other leagues just yet\u201d. After two and a half decades, MLS can boast an array of soccer-specific stadiums \u2013 but there are other choices. \u201cThere\u2019s a very large market of professional soccer fans in the United States, it\u2019s over 70 million people who watch some sort of league, whether it\u2019s us, Premier League, Spanish league, Mexican league,\u201d says Mark Abbott, the president and deputy commissioner of MLS. \u201cAnd so clearly we compete with those leagues for interest among soccer fans \u2013 but we have a lot of advantages.\u201d Abbott points to the opportunity to watch games in person in stadiums that are, for the most part, modern, and offer affordable tickets. \u201cI think in 25 years we\u2019ve become a true major league sport in the US and Canada,\u201d he says, citing investments in infrastructure, growing fanbases, a diverse group of wealthy and committed owners and improvement in the on-field product. Still, the local landscape is uneven. While Atlanta United attracted a regular-season average of 52,510 fans last year, FC Dallas averaged fewer than 15,000 in a metropolitan area of nearly 8 million people. As Los Angeles FC\u2019s supporters and celebrity co-owners relished packed houses and a thrilling attack spearheaded by Carlos Vela, the Chicago Fire, with a league-worst 12,324 average, decided to ditch a 14-year-old suburban soccer-specific stadium in order to return to Soldier Field, a centrally located NFL arena.

This perpetuates the gulf in finances, and therefore in quality, between them and MLS.

      "body": "<p>In October last year, a Japanese-Peruvian restaurant called Yapa opened in the Little Tokyo district of Los Angeles. Three months later, having visited three times, Patricia Esc\u00e1rcega, the restaurant critic for the Los Angeles Times, published a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-01-29/yapa-peruvian-review-patricia-escarcega\">thoughtful, positive review</a>. While short on laughs, it contained some delightfully lyrical descriptions of the food; of the \u201ccreamy slips of uni\u201d and the \u201cfragrant lake of oil spiked with the voluptuous heat of rocoto chilies\u201d. There was no picture byline.</p> <p>That same week, after just one visit to a restaurant that had been open at full price for only a matter of days, the Observer published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/02/the-yard-by-robin-gill-london-unappealing-ill-conceived-overpriced-restaurant-review\">my extremely negative review</a> of The Yard by Robin Gill in London. In it, I compared the gnocchi to dental swabs, and described one dish as tasting of \u201claziness and gross profit margin\u201d. My picture byline was slapped all over it, so you could be stared down by me as you read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;is-extract=false&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6e6a15d04963965def9cf66499a49a24ebe17099%3Fcrop%3D0_0_709_1080&amp;title=My%20Last%20Supper%3A%20One%20Meal%2C%20a%20Lifetime%20in%20the%20Making&amp;author=Jay%20Rayner&amp;publisher=Guardian%20faber&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fguardianbookshop.com%2Fmy-last-supper-9781783351466.html\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/book/index.html?opinion-tint=false&is-extract=false&image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F6e6a15d04963965def9cf66499a49a24ebe17099%3Fcrop%3D0_0_709_1080&title=My%20Last%20Supper%3A%20One%20Meal%2C%20a%20Lifetime%20in%20the%20Making&author=Jay%20Rayner&publisher=Guardian%20faber&link=https%3A%2F%2Fguardianbookshop.com%2Fmy-last-supper-9781783351466.html\">.</a> </figure>  <p>Esc\u00e1rcega and I do the same job. We are both employed by newspapers to eat in a restaurant and then tell you whether it\u2019s worth your time, money and appetite. But we do that job very differently. \u201cUS critics write as if they are the inheritors of the mantle of Tom Wolfe or Hemingway,\u201d says Giles Coren, who reviews for the Times in the UK. \u201cThey go five times. There\u2019s a pomposity to the way they write.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Sifton, the food editor of the New York Times, who was also the paper\u2019s critic for two years between 2009 and 2011, returns the compliment. British restaurant critics can be \u201cbarbaric\u201d, he says, although he admits to finding it all highly entertaining. \u201cFor the reader, there\u2019s something delicious about you lot going off on some horrible place. As a reader I take delight in that. We, however, have to take a more sombre approach.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed they do. Travelling across the US, undertaking research for my latest book on my last meal on earth, which draws on my 20 years as a restaurant critic, I was constantly struck by the difference in tone.

      "bodyText": "In October last year, a Japanese-Peruvian restaurant called Yapa opened in the Little Tokyo district of Los Angeles. Three months later, having visited three times, Patricia Esc\u00e1rcega, the restaurant critic for the Los Angeles Times, published a thoughtful, positive review. While short on laughs, it contained some delightfully lyrical descriptions of the food; of the \u201ccreamy slips of uni\u201d and the \u201cfragrant lake of oil spiked with the voluptuous heat of rocoto chilies\u201d. There was no picture byline. That same week, after just one visit to a restaurant that had been open at full price for only a matter of days, the Observer published my extremely negative review of The Yard by Robin Gill in London. In it, I compared the gnocchi to dental swabs, and described one dish as tasting of \u201claziness and gross profit margin\u201d. My picture byline was slapped all over it, so you could be stared down by me as you read. Esc\u00e1rcega and I do the same job. We are both employed by newspapers to eat in a restaurant and then tell you whether it\u2019s worth your time, money and appetite. But we do that job very differently. \u201cUS critics write as if they are the inheritors of the mantle of Tom Wolfe or Hemingway,\u201d says Giles Coren, who reviews for the Times in the UK. \u201cThey go five times. There\u2019s a pomposity to the way they write.\u201d Sam Sifton, the food editor of the New York Times, who was also the paper\u2019s critic for two years between 2009 and 2011, returns the compliment. British restaurant critics can be \u201cbarbaric\u201d, he says, although he admits to finding it all highly entertaining. \u201cFor the reader, there\u2019s something delicious about you lot going off on some horrible place. As a reader I take delight in that. We, however, have to take a more sombre approach.\u201d Indeed they do. Travelling across the US, undertaking research for my latest book on my last meal on earth, which draws on my 20 years as a restaurant critic, I was constantly struck by the difference in tone. It\u2019s all respectful and solicitous. My recent description of one restaurant\u2019s poor service as akin to an \u201cunlubricated colonoscopy\u201d, while hardly Oscar Wilde, got a lot of love from readers. In the US, I am certain it would never be published. Of course, American critics can go in hard.

      "bodyText": "Shanaya Ball did everything right during her pregnancy: she attended check-ups, ate well, and kitted out the nursery for her son Amari, who was born in March 2017. But by his first birthday, Amari had failed to meet almost every developmental milestone, and was unable to play, communicate or move like other infants. Last August, aged two and a half, he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder \u2013 a complex set of neurological and developmental symptoms for which he will need long-term specialist support. Ball, 27, was still reeling from the diagnosis when the pediatrician called with more devastating news: Amari had dangerous lead levels in his blood. He\u2019d been poisoned at his Philadelphia home by lead paint crumbling off the old windows, door frames and skirting boards to create toxic dust ingested and inhaled by mother and son. Ball did not know that Philadelphia has a huge problem with lead, especially in its older housing stock, often used by minority communities. Nor that powerful property interests are accused of weakening enforcement of health standards on the issue and refusing to properly tackle it. \u201cI knew nothing about lead, but it was everywhere, and my baby was crawling through it,\u201d said Ball, a single mother who works at a convenience store. \u201cI felt so guilty: was it my fault, should I have known?\u201d Lead, a heavy metal which has no smell and is invisible to the naked eye, is a suspected carcinogen and highly toxic to the brain and nervous system, as well as most other organs. It had been linked to reduced IQ, ADHD, school failure and criminality \u2013 even at low levels. Research suggests exposure during pregnancy may increase a child\u2019s risk of developing autism. There is no safe lead level, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Amari\u2019s blood test showed 29.6 \u00b5g/dL (micrograms per deciliter) of lead. He\u2019s almost three and very sweet, but he struggles to communicate and is emotionally volatile. The higher and longer the exposure, the worse the range and severity of the problems. Lead is mostly found in ageing water pipes, contaminated soil and old peeling paint \u2013 hazards found in an estimated 3.6m homes with young children nationwide, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In Philadelphia, 7.6% of under-sevens tested in 2018 \u2013 or 2,881 children \u2013 had blood lead levels of 5\u00b5g/dL or higher, according to recently published figures. The actual number is probably significantly higher, as only 30% of children were tested. The lead burden is unevenly spread: an investigation by the Philadelphia Inquirer found that as many as one in five children are poisoned in the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods where mostly black, Latinx and migrant families live. About two-thirds live in rental properties. \u201cLead poisoning is entirely preventable, but once the damage is done, it\u2019s done. I don\u2019t have anything in my back pocket to help, and the ramifications are long-term,\u201d said George Dalembert, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. America\u2019s modern-day lead crisis was exposed in 2016 by the scandal in Flint, Michigan, where 3% of children were poisoned after the city swapped to a cheaper water source. At the time, Philadelphia was among 17 cities in Pennsylvania where 10% to 23% of children tested were poisoned. A state investigation published last year found dangerous levels of lead lurking in all 67 Pennsylvania counties, with paint the most common culprit. Lead paint was outlawed by the federal government in 1978 but in Philadelphia, for instance, about 90% of the current housing stock was built before the ban. In 2012, city lawmakers passed a lead disclosure rule that required landlords with properties built before 1978 to provide tenants with children under seven with a lead certificate confirming the property is safe before they move in. But the law has been largely unenforceable, according to campaigners, who claim that lobbying meant the legislation was watered down to favor landlords\u2019 profits over safety. After Amari was diagnosed, the health department gave the landlord 30 days to remediate the property, but it was four months \u2013 until January 2020 \u2013 before all the lead was removed. Amari\u2019s blood level is finally falling but remains dangerously high at 20. \u201cI was told about breastfeeding, healthy eating, where to get free diapers, but not once was lead mentioned,\u201d Ball told the Guardian as Amari asked for a cookie using sign language. The scale of America\u2019s lead problem is astonishing: half a million children under six had blood lead levels over 5\u00b5g/dL, according to the CDC in 2016 \u2013 despite a significant fall in cases over the past four decades. Thousands more probably had low levels of lead poisoning, which multiple studies have shown can also cause irreversible impairments. Yet nationwide testing remains patchy, and the data is fragmented. In Pennsylvania, only 19% of under-sevens were tested in 2018, of whom 8,822 were poisoned. In Philadelphia, only half the children born in 2015 who qualified for medical assistance had been tested twice by 2018, as required by federal law. Lead exposure during pregnancy can cause miscarriage and impaired neurodevelopment, but prenatal screening is not mandatory. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that in 2020 we still use children as canaries in mines to find lead in homes,\u201d said Colleen McCauley, health policy director at Public Citizens for Children and Youth (PCCY), which advocates for better testing, data collection and universal remediation of older rental properties. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sell primary prevention [to elected officials] because it costs money to find the lead and then more money to remove the hazards. This is an utterly shortsighted perspective, however, because caring for children after they are poisoned is much more expensive.\u201d Investing in tackling lead makes economic sense: eradicating lead paint hazards from older properties housing children born in 2018 would provide $3.5bn in future benefits \u2013 the equivalent of $1.39 per dollar invested, according to research by Pew Charitable Trusts. The investment would protect more than 311,000 children from low-income families over 10 years. Replacing lead water pipes would yield a further $2.7bn in future benefits.

For all his shortcomings, Highsmith\u2019s villain was at least goal\u2011oriented; by contrast, Paul\u2019s motives are enigmatically opaque. His pursuit of Emily seems to be driven not so much by carnal lust as by animus against her partner and all that he represents \u2013 a kind of sexualised class warfare that calls to mind Pulp\u2019s 1995 song \u201cI Spy\u201d, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/19/jarvis-cocker-i-have-lived-in-my-head-for-most-of-my-life\" title=\"\">Jarvis Cocker</a> croons with creepy relish about an affair with a rich west London housewife: \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of woman v man / It\u2019s more a case of haves against haven\u2019ts.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, perhaps the most striking feature of this well-crafted novel is the highly selective access we are afforded to the narrator\u2019s inner life. He is candid and transparent when ruminating on family and friends, but of his sexual machinations we get zilch. This makes for a convincing rendering of the compulsive, thoughtless nature of certain kinds of destructive behaviour. The register here is more black comedy than psychodrama: the narration is brisk and the dialogue pithy, with lots of satirical lampooning of the contemporary cultural landscape \u2013 wry digs about clickbait journalists, ambivalent polyamorists and right-on literati. Reading a viral social media post about gender and literature, Paul recounts how \u201cEager men who were keen to demonstrate they did not hate all women joined in the conversation to announce that they would never read a book by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/17/the-five-essential-saul-bellow-novels\" title=\"\">Saul Bellow</a> or John Updike, not never again, but never at all.\u201d</p> <p>Here, the cultural and the political converge. Brown\u2019s narrator looks askance at the media zeitgeist because it, too, is inextricably bound up in the London-centric networks from which he is excluded. But Paul is no leftist: his cynicism, together with his fetishisation of power and privilege, evokes a jaded political agnosticism. He has nowhere to go. The best he can do is play it for laughs.</p> <p>\u2022<em>Theft</em> <em>by Luke Brown is published by And Other Stories (RRP \u00a311.99). </em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/theft-9781911508588.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.</em></a> <em>Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.</em></p>",

The thrusting chancer who insinuates himself into people\u2019s lives with latent malign intent is a perennially compelling archetype; its best-known literary exemplar is probably Patricia Highsmith\u2019s eponymous antihero in The Talented Mr Ripley. For all his shortcomings, Highsmith\u2019s villain was at least goal\u2011oriented; by contrast, Paul\u2019s motives are enigmatically opaque. His pursuit of Emily seems to be driven not so much by carnal lust as by animus against her partner and all that he represents \u2013 a kind of sexualised class warfare that calls to mind Pulp\u2019s 1995 song \u201cI Spy\u201d, in which Jarvis Cocker croons with creepy relish about an affair with a rich west London housewife: \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of woman v man / It\u2019s more a case of haves against haven\u2019ts.\u201d Indeed, perhaps the most striking feature of this well-crafted novel is the highly selective access we are afforded to the narrator\u2019s inner life. He is candid and transparent when ruminating on family and friends, but of his sexual machinations we get zilch. This makes for a convincing rendering of the compulsive, thoughtless nature of certain kinds of destructive behaviour. The register here is more black comedy than psychodrama: the narration is brisk and the dialogue pithy, with lots of satirical lampooning of the contemporary cultural landscape \u2013 wry digs about clickbait journalists, ambivalent polyamorists and right-on literati. Reading a viral social media post about gender and literature, Paul recounts how \u201cEager men who were keen to demonstrate they did not hate all women joined in the conversation to announce that they would never read a book by Saul Bellow or John Updike, not never again, but never at all.\u201d Here, the cultural and the political converge. Brown\u2019s narrator looks askance at the media zeitgeist because it, too, is inextricably bound up in the London-centric networks from which he is excluded. But Paul is no leftist: his cynicism, together with his fetishisation of power and privilege, evokes a jaded political agnosticism. He has nowhere to go. The best he can do is play it for laughs. \u2022Theft by Luke Brown is published by And Other Stories (RRP \u00a311.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.",

The developments in Asia came after three more people died from Covid-19 disease in Iran, which has reported 16 fatalities out of nearly 100 infections. It has been scrambling to contain the spread of the virus since last week when it announced its first two deaths in Qom, a centre for Islamic studies and pilgrims that attracts scholars from abroad. The deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said he had contracted the virus after appearing at a press conference in which he downplayed its significance of the virus but appeared feverish. The first potential case in Latin America was reported late on Tuesday with Brazilian authorities saying a 61-year-old man in S\u00e3o Paulo had tested positive. According to the O Globo newspaper the man recently arrived back in the country from Italy. In Europe towns and cities have been sealed off in an attempt to stop the contagion, while hotels in the Canary Islands and Austria were locked down because of suspected cases. Italy \u2013 which has reported 10 deaths and more than 300 cases \u2013 has locked down 11 towns and ordered Serie A football games to be played to empty stadiums. A man who returned to Croatia from Italy became the first case in the Balkans region. In France, a second person infected with the coronavirus died late on Tuesday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. The death was one of three new cases in France this week, bringing the total confirmed cases in the country to 17. A Chinese tourist who had tested positive for the virus died earlier this month.

      "bodyText": "Mining giant Rio Tinto says it wants its globe-spanning operations to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon footprint. The second biggest miner in the world has also committed to reducing its emissions by 15% by 2030. Rio Tinto\u2019s decision, which follows pressure from investors, puts it in line with Australian business groups and unions and at odds with an Australian government that has devoted itself to attacking the Labor opposition over its commitment to the same net zero target. Its commitment to cut emissions is easier for Rio Tinto than BHP and other big global miners because unlike BHP, it does not mine coal or oil. However, unlike BHP, Rio Tinto has refused to set a target to reduce so-called \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions produced by its customers. Announcing Rio Tinto\u2019s full-year results on Wednesday, the company\u2019s chief executive Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques also warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt its operations. Chinese steel mills are major Rio Tinto customers, however Jacques said the company\u2019s iron order books were full. \u201cBut we are likely to see some short term impacts such as supply chains and possibly even provision of services from Chinese suppliers,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cWe acknowledge that there will be some short-term volatility and uncertainty, but we are very well positioned.\u201d He said Rio Tinto\u2019s new commitments on climate added to a 46% cut in the company\u2019s emissions since 2008, although much of that reduction was due to it selling operations that produce a lot of pollution. To reduce its total emissions by 15% by 2030, every new business opened by Rio Tinto in the next decade will need to be carbon neutral. Jacques said the company was open to buying carbon offsets if necessary but this was a \u201clast port of call\u201d. He said the emissions cut to 2030 would be achieved using existing technology but Rio Tinto would also be investing part of the $1bn on developing new ways of eliminating carbon production. \u201cWe have approved around US$100m last week for the Pilbara, I think it would be a good example of things we may look at going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 34MW solar photovoltaic plant and a battery system of 12MW per hour storage facility at one of our operations. \u201cBy doing this investment \u2026 we\u2019ll be able to take out about 90,000 tonnes compared to commercial gas power generation.\u201d This was equivalent to taking 28,000 cars off the road or about 3% of the company\u2019s emissions from the Pilbara, he said. \u201cAt the same time we are investing serious money in order to find the technology for the future. We have only a pathway for the next 10 years. If we don\u2019t work today on options beyond the next 10 years, we\u2019ll never get there.\u201d He defended Rio Tinto\u2019s decision not to set scope 3 targets \u2013 something rival BHP did in July as part of a $400m program to cut its emissions. \u201cWe will not set targets for our customers,\u201d Jaques said. \u201cHaving said that, we are looking to partner with our customers and the customers of our customers to look for ways to work together in order to improve emissions across the value chain.\u201d He said examples included a deal the company struck with giant Chinese steel mill and key customer Baosteel in September to reduce emissions from steelmaking and another deal struck with Apple and the government of Quebec two years ago relating to aluminium. \u201cRemember, we are the only large diversified mining and metal company that is not selling either coal, and the carbon associated with coal, or drilling oil and gas and the carbon associated with oil and gas. \u201cSo if you step back, if you believe in climate change \u2013 and we do believe in climate change \u2013 we know we need to have more high quality copper, high quality aluminium, in order to be part of the solution.\u201d Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s conservative Coalition government campaigned hard against Labor\u2019s net zero target as part of its re-election strategy at the federal election last May, and in recent weeks has revived its attacks on the opposition over the policy by demanding costings and raising the spectre of soaring energy prices.

      "body": "<p>As a junior researcher on a TV documentary in Uganda in 1986, I was told to ask a question that was the dark cliche of war reporting: \u201cAnyone here been raped and speak English?\u201d To my horror, a teenage girl stepped shyly forward, eyes cast downwards. Since then, I have come across hundreds of women raped in wars around the world \u2013 and I have found kinder ways of establishing if they want to tell their story.</p> <p>In her harrowing new book, foreign correspondent Christina Lamb explains that rape in conflict is often seen as a \u201cprivate crime\u201d, an incidental atrocity, when it is \u201cas much of a weapon of war as the machete, club or Kalashnikov\u201d. She gives priority to the stories of individual women, many of whom feel validated by speaking out, but understands why other victims remain silent. Often they feel ashamed, or fear ostracism from their own communities. \u201cYou won\u2019t find these women\u2019s names in the history books or on the war memorials,\u201d Lamb writes. \u201cBut to me they are the real heroes.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being a common battlefield tactic, rape has been largely ignored in historical accounts, featuring in neither the second world war history textbooks Lamb read in school, nor those her son studied. It took half a century for the Japanese government to acknowledge the harm done to the \u201ccomfort women\u201d, an agonising euphemism given to Koreans and others forced into sexual slavery by the imperial Japanese army. Although reports existed, the mass rape of German women by Stalin\u2019s forces as they entered Berlin in 1945 was not widely known until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/antony-beevor\" title=\"\">Antony Beevor</a> wrote about it in 2002. The Russian government still denies it happened.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite being a common battlefield tactic, rape has been largely ignored in historical accounts, omitted from history textbooks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More recently, journalists and medical staff have reported mass rape in Bosnia, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where even babies have been sexually abused, earning the country the sobriquet \u201cthe rape capital of the world\u201d. But, distressingly, greater awareness through the 1990s and 2000s has not acted as a deterrent. During their three year rampage through northern Iraq and Syria starting in 2014, the Islamic State leadership declared that fighters could sexually enslave Yazidi women because they were not Muslims. In Myanmar in 2017, Buddhist government forces carried out mass rape against the Muslim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya\" title=\"\">Rohingya</a>.</p> <p>Inevitably, Lamb has sombre thoughts. \u201cWhat enjoyment could men get from abusing women in such a way? ... Are men somehow hardwired to hurt women?\u201d War is a time when rules are broken \u2013 if killing is legitimised then it\u2019s not entirely surprising that other norms are also breached. But rape is often integral to how a war is prosecuted. Commanders may tolerate or even order rape to humiliate the enemy, traumatise the population so they flee, and impregnate women to change the demographic balance of a country or region. In Syrian prisons, men are also raped as a form of torture.</p> <p>Lamb\u2019s attempts to interview perpetrators don\u2019t get very far. The Isis prisoners she meets deny that they raped \u2013 it\u2019s always someone else who kept a Yazidi slave, although, suspiciously, they seem to know a lot about the practice. Lamb asks why some armies rape and some do not. The British raped less than other armies during the second world war, mainly due to their military culture. Despite the brutality of the conflict, there are few reports of Israeli soldiers raping Palestinians, possibly because one-third of the soldiers in the Israeli Defence Forces are women, a far higher proportion than in most armies.</p> <p>Slowly, attitudes to rape in conflict are changing. In 2018 the Nobel peace prize was awarded to the Yazidi campaigner Nadia Murad \u2013 herself a victim of battlefield rape \u2013 and Dr Denis Mukwege, a surgeon from the DRC. At Panzi hospital in Bukavu, Mukwege has pioneered a holistic approach that starts with surgical procedures to repair physical damage done to women, and proceeds to psychotherapy, financial support and legal advice. Mukwege is clear that in the DRC, soldiers rape as much as irregular bandit forces. As a result, his life is in constant danger. \u201cIt takes time, but the only way we can change society is to end impunity,\u201d he tells Lamb.</p> <p>Some glimmers of hope lie in the changing legal environment. Navanethem Pillay, a judge at the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda, realised that the detailed testimony of rape provided by female witnesses was central not peripheral to charges of genocide. Lamb\u2019s interviews with the pioneering Rwandan women who overcame fear and stigma to testify are especially moving. Eventually prosecutors added rape and sexual violence to their indictments. It was the first time that rape was recognised in an international court and prosecuted as part of genocide. The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia went further, ruling that systematic rape and enslavement could be treated as torture and thus a war crime. Again it was a female judge, Florence Mumba of Zambia, who presided over the initial conviction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the #MeToo era, the impetus is to believe women \u2013 Lamb quite rightly does, while never losing her journalistic rigour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"24249bc358b54408c16d0dbdf795abf1ad7c160f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24249bc358b54408c16d0dbdf795abf1ad7c160f/106_15_770_963/400.jpg\" alt=\"Christina Lamb.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christina Lamb</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given these legal advances, it\u2019s disturbing to note that no one has yet tried Isis members for the rape of Yazidi women. At the international court of justice in The Hague last December, the former political prisoner and darling of the human rights community, Aung San Suu Kyi, now State Consellor and effectively prime minister of Myanmar, said her country\u2019s military courts could handle any alleged atrocities by soldiers against the Rohingya. She made no mention of rape. Nor has there been any effective action against members of the Nigeria-based jihadi group Boko Haram, who continue to kidnap and enslave women. The fate of the 219 schoolgirls kidnapped from the village of Chibok in 2014 reveals the limits of international pressure. Despite hashtags and outrage from celebrities, including Michelle Obama, then US first lady, the Nigerian government failed to mount a rescue when it might have been possible. Negotiations resulted in the liberation of some girls, but most are missing to this day.</p> <p>At times, Lamb worries that she is being intrusive, but she is also careful not to be credulous. An experienced journalist, she can tell when something doesn\u2019t smell right \u2013 one Rohingya woman in a camp in Bangladesh has a long story that doesn\u2019t add up. In the age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/women-worldwide-use-hashtag-metoo-against-sexual-harassment\" title=\"\">#MeToo</a>, the impetus is to believe women and on the whole, she \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 does, while never losing her journalistic rigour. The litany of pain she recounts is all too believeable. I know because I have heard it too.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been in many ways a journey through the worst depravities of man and I thank you for bearing with me, for I know it has not been an easy read,\u201d she writes. But silence is the women\u2019s worst enemy, and that\u2019s why, while some may be tempted to turn away from the horror, this is such an important book.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lindsey Hilsum\u2019s In Extremis: The Life of War Correspondent Marie Colvin is published by Chatto.

Often they feel ashamed, or fear ostracism from their own communities. \u201cYou won\u2019t find these women\u2019s names in the history books or on the war memorials,\u201d Lamb writes. \u201cBut to me they are the real heroes.\u201d Despite being a common battlefield tactic, rape has been largely ignored in historical accounts, featuring in neither the second world war history textbooks Lamb read in school, nor those her son studied. It took half a century for the Japanese government to acknowledge the harm done to the \u201ccomfort women\u201d, an agonising euphemism given to Koreans and others forced into sexual slavery by the imperial Japanese army. Although reports existed, the mass rape of German women by Stalin\u2019s forces as they entered Berlin in 1945 was not widely known until Antony Beevor wrote about it in 2002. The Russian government still denies it happened. More recently, journalists and medical staff have reported mass rape in Bosnia, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where even babies have been sexually abused, earning the country the sobriquet \u201cthe rape capital of the world\u201d. But, distressingly, greater awareness through the 1990s and 2000s has not acted as a deterrent. During their three year rampage through northern Iraq and Syria starting in 2014, the Islamic State leadership declared that fighters could sexually enslave Yazidi women because they were not Muslims. In Myanmar in 2017, Buddhist government forces carried out mass rape against the Muslim Rohingya. Inevitably, Lamb has sombre thoughts. \u201cWhat enjoyment could men get from abusing women in such a way? ... Are men somehow hardwired to hurt women?\u201d War is a time when rules are broken \u2013 if killing is legitimised then it\u2019s not entirely surprising that other norms are also breached. But rape is often integral to how a war is prosecuted. Commanders may tolerate or even order rape to humiliate the enemy, traumatise the population so they flee, and impregnate women to change the demographic balance of a country or region. In Syrian prisons, men are also raped as a form of torture. Lamb\u2019s attempts to interview perpetrators don\u2019t get very far. The Isis prisoners she meets deny that they raped \u2013 it\u2019s always someone else who kept a Yazidi slave, although, suspiciously, they seem to know a lot about the practice. Lamb asks why some armies rape and some do not. The British raped less than other armies during the second world war, mainly due to their military culture. Despite the brutality of the conflict, there are few reports of Israeli soldiers raping Palestinians, possibly because one-third of the soldiers in the Israeli Defence Forces are women, a far higher proportion than in most armies. Slowly, attitudes to rape in conflict are changing. In 2018 the Nobel peace prize was awarded to the Yazidi campaigner Nadia Murad \u2013 herself a victim of battlefield rape \u2013 and Dr Denis Mukwege, a surgeon from the DRC. At Panzi hospital in Bukavu, Mukwege has pioneered a holistic approach that starts with surgical procedures to repair physical damage done to women, and proceeds to psychotherapy, financial support and legal advice. Mukwege is clear that in the DRC, soldiers rape as much as irregular bandit forces. As a result, his life is in constant danger. \u201cIt takes time, but the only way we can change society is to end impunity,\u201d he tells Lamb. Some glimmers of hope lie in the changing legal environment. Navanethem Pillay, a judge at the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda, realised that the detailed testimony of rape provided by female witnesses was central not peripheral to charges of genocide. Lamb\u2019s interviews with the pioneering Rwandan women who overcame fear and stigma to testify are especially moving. Eventually prosecutors added rape and sexual violence to their indictments. It was the first time that rape was recognised in an international court and prosecuted as part of genocide. The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia went further, ruling that systematic rape and enslavement could be treated as torture and thus a war crime. Again it was a female judge, Florence Mumba of Zambia, who presided over the initial conviction. Given these legal advances, it\u2019s disturbing to note that no one has yet tried Isis members for the rape of Yazidi women. At the international court of justice in The Hague last December, the former political prisoner and darling of the human rights community, Aung San Suu Kyi, now State Consellor and effectively prime minister of Myanmar, said her country\u2019s military courts could handle any alleged atrocities by soldiers against the Rohingya. She made no mention of rape. Nor has there been any effective action against members of the Nigeria-based jihadi group Boko Haram, who continue to kidnap and enslave women. The fate of the 219 schoolgirls kidnapped from the village of Chibok in 2014 reveals the limits of international pressure. Despite hashtags and outrage from celebrities, including Michelle Obama, then US first lady, the Nigerian government failed to mount a rescue when it might have been possible. Negotiations resulted in the liberation of some girls, but most are missing to this day. At times, Lamb worries that she is being intrusive, but she is also careful not to be credulous. An experienced journalist, she can tell when something doesn\u2019t smell right \u2013 one Rohingya woman in a camp in Bangladesh has a long story that doesn\u2019t add up. In the age of #MeToo, the impetus is to believe women and on the whole, she \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 does, while never losing her journalistic rigour. The litany of pain she recounts is all too believeable. I know because I have heard it too. \u201cThis has been in many ways a journey through the worst depravities of man and I thank you for bearing with me, for I know it has not been an easy read,\u201d she writes. But silence is the women\u2019s worst enemy, and that\u2019s why, while some may be tempted to turn away from the horror, this is such an important book. \u2022 Lindsey Hilsum\u2019s In Extremis: The Life of War Correspondent Marie Colvin is published by Chatto.

He was arrested and accused, though not formally charged, with purchasing a stolen vehicle. He denies the allegation.</p> \n<p>Chukwudi was taken to Sars headquarters in Abuja. It was almost a year before he was brought before a court to be formally charged. The first time he appears on official records is 5 March 2014, when he was sent to a medium security prison near the capital to wait for his trial. \u201cI was happy when I was brought to court because the pain of Sars is too much\u201d, he told me. \u201cIn Sars, you are relieved only by the mercies of God. I saw people die. It was survival of the fittest.\u201d Neither Chukwudi nor his family could recall the precise date he was arrested. Sars did not respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>Chukwudi hoped that once he was finally brought to court, his ordeal would soon be over. \u201cBut it happens not to be like that,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou discover that a whole lot of systems are involved.\u201d</p> \n<p>Like tens of thousands of Nigerians, Chukwudi was denied bail because he was unable to provide a guarantor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58455254395e15f546b4abb5cf5ac3f0bc3f7aca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58455254395e15f546b4abb5cf5ac3f0bc3f7aca/0_0_8000_5300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Nigeria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite Nigerians\u2019 constitutional right to bail, many judges fear defendants may disappear if released, and believe that \u201cremanding\u201d defendants in prison serves the greater cause of justice.</p> \n<p>Countless visits to court resulted in Chukwudi\u2019s case being adjourned, sometimes before it had even begun, forcing him back to prison while he waited for a new date.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost times you feel like crying,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cYou know you are returning to where you are coming from. Every time you go to court you must have prayed a lot, and every prayer is backed up with hope. You will tell your people: \u2018Today I am leaving.\u2019 Only for you to go to court to find the judge didn\u2019t sit. Only for you to go to court and they brought you too late, the court has finished sitting. Only for you to go to court and find that your prosecution council is not there. So the aim of going to court is wasted, and they have their cases adjourned for another day.\u201d </p> \n<p>By the time he was finally granted bail in November 2016, Chukwudi\u2019s father was dead, his job and home lost, and friends and family distanced from him. \u201cNormally if you come out of prison it should feel good. One experiences another freedom. But in Nigeria that is where another problem starts for you,\u201d Chukwudi said. \u201cAnybody who comes to know that you have been in prison doesn\u2019t want to relate with you. Even your own family members. The way they are seeing it, the name of the family has been put to shame because you went to prison. When I came out, I learned that nobody wanted to see me.\u201d</p> \n<p>These days he is the pastor of a church known as the Transformation Ministry that supports former inmates returning to civilian life. Eight ex-prisoners are currently benefiting from free basic accommodation. \u201cI just fixed two with laundry jobs, and am working on computer training for the others,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of giving back.\u201d</p> \n<p>Remand inmates make up about 69% of Nigeria\u2019s prison <a href=\"https://www.prisonstudies.org/country/nigeria\">population</a>. While this is not high compared to many western countries, the length of time they spend awaiting trial is. In prisons where this data is available, most defendants have been on remand for between one and four years, some for more than a decade.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Rivers State, 14 people were awaiting trial for 15 years. Not one day were they taken to court,\u201d Justice Bello told the Guardian, shaking his head. \u201cWe had to release them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Because there is no systematic way to monitor cases, defendants may simply be forgotten in prison. Data collected by the legal aid organisation, Network of University Legal Aid Institutions, shows that there are more than 160 cases where defendants have not been assigned a date for their next trial. \u201cSome of them last attended court in 2017,\u201d the network\u2019s Charissa Kabir told me.</p> \n<p>Another factor that exacerbates crowding is the practice of imprisoning convicts unable to pay small fines for minor offences. Research by <a href=\"http://www.prawa.org/\">Prawa</a>, a Nigerian security, justice and development NGO, found that up to 80% of inmates were living on less than $130 per month prior to arrest.</p> \n<p>Income lost during remand combined with legal expenses often leave convicts deep in debt and unable to pay, meaning many serve between six and 12 months in prison instead. Up to 90% of inmates the presidential committee has released fall into this category. \u201cFines are paid by the government, and sometimes Nigerian NGOs\u201d, said the committee secretary, Leticia Ayoola-Daniels.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db1f02b246d148eb984d6dec15ac683d81be0e0a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db1f02b246d148eb984d6dec15ac683d81be0e0a/0_0_3680_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justice Bello observes inmate conditions at a correctional facility in Ondo State in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justice Bello observes inmate conditions at a correctional facility in Ondo State in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigerian Government Archive</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Numerous cases reflect extreme poverty. \u201cWe found a scenario where a pregnant woman was said to have stolen cassava, and she was there awaiting trial for almost four years,\u201d said Justice Bello. \u201cIt\u2019s lamentable.\u201d Shortly after arriving in prison, the woman miscarried. </p> \n<p>He worries about the damage prisons inflicted on defendants behind bars. \u201cTo be in prison is a very dangerous thing. Some of them have attained some level of mental deterioration because of the horrendous nature of the environment they live in,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The judge seems to be trying to activate the justice system by shaking its conscience rather than by devising a new judgment \u2013 the usual tactic for activist judges. He invites officials who have unresolved cases to prison to face defendants, and account for what went wrong. By admonishing lax lawyers and judges he turns turns lapses which previously went unnoticed into a source of personal and professional shame.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe visits do try to restore fairness, in the sense that they acknowledge that lapses in the administration of justice have resulted in the loss of freedom,\u201d said Melissa Omene, a lawyer who has worked across government and civil society justice reform efforts.</p> \n<p>\u201cAddressing a practitioner\u2019s failure to carry out his duty requires more than simply calling on him to do so. Did he fail to act due to a lack of interest or resources? Did he fail to act for political reasons, or fear? Each of these will require a different reform strategy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Justice officials need to be able to see into their own systems in order to detect and manage problems. To do that, they need better data. A quieter but potentially transformative piece of the committee\u2019s work is the rollout of a federal prison (now corrections) information management system (Cims) as part of its wider efforts to establish a national criminal justice database.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d74adc5e166e12c8089091414f6b607dc75771ae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d74adc5e166e12c8089091414f6b607dc75771ae/0_197_4496_2697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justice Bello and a team from the committee at a prison in Anambra state, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justice Bello and a team from the committee at a prison in Anambra state, 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Committee on Prison Reform and Decongestion</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cims has been partially implementing in 16 states, but only one prison is making full use of the platform. It features an early warning system that alerts the attorney general if an inmate stays on remand beyond 90 days, and allows officials to identify and hold to account officials and departments that cause unreasonable delays.</p> \n<p>If well managed, Cims could regulate some of the chaos that currently governs the lives of inmates. At the very least, digital records will make it harder for them to officially disappear. But it\u2019s is only part of the solution. If not backed by political clout and people able to use the data, Cims risks remaining a technical solution to a political problem.</p> \n<p>Nigeria\u2019s justice system has been the subject of numerous reform efforts over the past two decades. Committees have been formed, new laws passed, presidents come and go, and people like Chukwudi continue to lose years of their lives to a system that cannot or fails to detect those who fall through its cracks.</p> \n<p>Despite Chukwudi\u2019s ordeal and everything he\u2019s lost, when he compares himself with other former inmates, he still considers himself one of the lucky ones. Every Sunday morning his congregation files into the little church he has coaxed to life. The room fills with people, music and choruses of prayer, and it makes him feel a part of something holy.</p> \n<p><em>This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Despite Nigerians\u2019 constitutional right to bail, many judges fear defendants may disappear if released, and believe that \u201cremanding\u201d defendants in prison serves the greater cause of justice. Countless visits to court resulted in Chukwudi\u2019s case being adjourned, sometimes before it had even begun, forcing him back to prison while he waited for a new date. \u201cMost times you feel like crying,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cYou know you are returning to where you are coming from. Every time you go to court you must have prayed a lot, and every prayer is backed up with hope. You will tell your people: \u2018Today I am leaving.\u2019 Only for you to go to court to find the judge didn\u2019t sit. Only for you to go to court and they brought you too late, the court has finished sitting. Only for you to go to court and find that your prosecution council is not there. So the aim of going to court is wasted, and they have their cases adjourned for another day.\u201d By the time he was finally granted bail in November 2016, Chukwudi\u2019s father was dead, his job and home lost, and friends and family distanced from him. \u201cNormally if you come out of prison it should feel good. One experiences another freedom. But in Nigeria that is where another problem starts for you,\u201d Chukwudi said. \u201cAnybody who comes to know that you have been in prison doesn\u2019t want to relate with you. Even your own family members. The way they are seeing it, the name of the family has been put to shame because you went to prison. When I came out, I learned that nobody wanted to see me.\u201d These days he is the pastor of a church known as the Transformation Ministry that supports former inmates returning to civilian life. Eight ex-prisoners are currently benefiting from free basic accommodation. \u201cI just fixed two with laundry jobs, and am working on computer training for the others,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of giving back.\u201d Remand inmates make up about 69% of Nigeria\u2019s prison population. While this is not high compared to many western countries, the length of time they spend awaiting trial is. In prisons where this data is available, most defendants have been on remand for between one and four years, some for more than a decade. \u201cIn Rivers State, 14 people were awaiting trial for 15 years. Not one day were they taken to court,\u201d Justice Bello told the Guardian, shaking his head. \u201cWe had to release them.\u201d Because there is no systematic way to monitor cases, defendants may simply be forgotten in prison. Data collected by the legal aid organisation, Network of University Legal Aid Institutions, shows that there are more than 160 cases where defendants have not been assigned a date for their next trial. \u201cSome of them last attended court in 2017,\u201d the network\u2019s Charissa Kabir told me. Another factor that exacerbates crowding is the practice of imprisoning convicts unable to pay small fines for minor offences. Research by Prawa, a Nigerian security, justice and development NGO, found that up to 80% of inmates were living on less than $130 per month prior to arrest. Income lost during remand combined with legal expenses often leave convicts deep in debt and unable to pay, meaning many serve between six and 12 months in prison instead. Up to 90% of inmates the presidential committee has released fall into this category. \u201cFines are paid by the government, and sometimes Nigerian NGOs\u201d, said the committee secretary, Leticia Ayoola-Daniels. Numerous cases reflect extreme poverty. \u201cWe found a scenario where a pregnant woman was said to have stolen cassava, and she was there awaiting trial for almost four years,\u201d said Justice Bello. \u201cIt\u2019s lamentable.\u201d Shortly after arriving in prison, the woman miscarried. He worries about the damage prisons inflicted on defendants behind bars. \u201cTo be in prison is a very dangerous thing. Some of them have attained some level of mental deterioration because of the horrendous nature of the environment they live in,\u201d he said. The judge seems to be trying to activate the justice system by shaking its conscience rather than by devising a new judgment \u2013 the usual tactic for activist judges. He invites officials who have unresolved cases to prison to face defendants, and account for what went wrong. By admonishing lax lawyers and judges he turns turns lapses which previously went unnoticed into a source of personal and professional shame. \u201cThe visits do try to restore fairness, in the sense that they acknowledge that lapses in the administration of justice have resulted in the loss of freedom,\u201d said Melissa Omene, a lawyer who has worked across government and civil society justice reform efforts. \u201cAddressing a practitioner\u2019s failure to carry out his duty requires more than simply calling on him to do so. Did he fail to act due to a lack of interest or resources? Did he fail to act for political reasons, or fear? Each of these will require a different reform strategy.\u201d Justice officials need to be able to see into their own systems in order to detect and manage problems. To do that, they need better data. A quieter but potentially transformative piece of the committee\u2019s work is the rollout of a federal prison (now corrections) information management system (Cims) as part of its wider efforts to establish a national criminal justice database. Cims has been partially implementing in 16 states, but only one prison is making full use of the platform. It features an early warning system that alerts the attorney general if an inmate stays on remand beyond 90 days, and allows officials to identify and hold to account officials and departments that cause unreasonable delays. If well managed, Cims could regulate some of the chaos that currently governs the lives of inmates. At the very least, digital records will make it harder for them to officially disappear. But it\u2019s is only part of the solution. If not backed by political clout and people able to use the data, Cims risks remaining a technical solution to a political problem. Nigeria\u2019s justice system has been the subject of numerous reform efforts over the past two decades. Committees have been formed, new laws passed, presidents come and go, and people like Chukwudi continue to lose years of their lives to a system that cannot or fails to detect those who fall through its cracks. Despite Chukwudi\u2019s ordeal and everything he\u2019s lost, when he compares himself with other former inmates, he still considers himself one of the lucky ones. Every Sunday morning his congregation files into the little church he has coaxed to life. The room fills with people, music and choruses of prayer, and it makes him feel a part of something holy.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has been drawn further into the sports grants controversy after it was revealed his office exchanged 136 emails with the former sports minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office about the program and one of the clubs in his electorate received funding despite being ineligible. On Tuesday Labor pressed the issue on multiple fronts, as clubs that missed out came forward to complain to a Senate inquiry, and a Senate order for production of documents revealed Morrison attended an event at the Sans Souci Football Club, which was given $50,000 despite its project nearly having been completed. Morrison has maintained that his involvement in the $100m community sport infrastructure program was limited to his office passing on representations from MPs to McKenzie\u2019s office. But in an answer to the Senate inquiry, the Australian National Audit Office revealed that between 17 October 2018 and 11 April 2019 McKenzie and Morrison\u2019s office exchanged 136 emails about the program. The documents also reveal McKenzie wrote back to the prime minister on 10 April 2019 \u2013 the day before the election was called \u2013 with the list of projects she proposed to fund, summarised by state, political party and electorate. On 11 April, the day the election was called, the minister sent the final list to Sport Australia. Documents produced to the Senate reveal that Morrison\u2019s office was informed before he attended an event at the Sans Souci Football Club on 11 July that \u201cit is worth noting that the club initially missed out on the first two rounds of funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure grant program\u201d. \u201cThe club was subsequently funded in round three,\u201d it said. \u201cDuring the intervening period, the club has fundraised and the project is almost completed.\u201d A spokesman for the prime minister said the project was \u201capproved for funding by the then minister for sport based on its assessed eligibility by Sport Australia\u201d. \u201cIt was the responsibility of the applicants and Sport Australia to have ensured all projects met the eligibility criteria,\u201d he said. Earlier in February, the ANAO told the Senate inquiry that 43% of projects funded were not eligible, mostly because they had started or completed work by the time a funding agreement was signed. In question time, Anthony Albanese quoted evidence from ANAO officials at a 13 February Senate inquiry hearing that Morrison\u2019s office had made both indirect and direct representations such as \u201cthese are the ones we think should be included in the list of approved projects\u201d. Morrison replied: \u201cNeither I nor my office were decision-makers in the process that governs the sports grants program, the decision-maker, as has been identified through the audit office, was the sports minister [McKenzie].\u201d Morrison argued government MPs knew what was best for their communities \u2013 including the member for Lindsay, Melissa McIntosh, even though she was not an MP when funding decisions were made before the 2019 election. \u201cThe people of Lindsay agree with me,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cBecause they elected the member for Lindsay because the member for Lindsay knows what\u2019s best for her community.\u201d Labor leapt on the suggestion that Liberal candidates \u2013 not just MPs \u2013 had influenced allocation of funding. In a scathing report the ANAO found the program was skewed towards marginal or Coalition target seats. McKenzie was later forced to resign over a conflict of interest related to the program. In submissions to the Senate inquiry, the top-scoring Gippsland Ranges Roller Derby has said it is \u201cincredibly disappointed\u201d with the politicisation of the program, while the North Shore Country Club has threatened to join possible legal action. Plaintiff law firms Slater and Gordon and Maurice Blackburn have both proposed class actions or tests cases, citing concerns the grants may be unconstitutional and the ANAO finding that it was \u201cnot evident\u201d what McKenzie\u2019s authority was to give grants. Morrison has suggested clubs that missed out could be funded in a further round of the program but has not made a concrete commitment. The North Shore Country Club, which provides tennis facilities in Kallaroo, Western Australia, submitted that it was unable to fund its project to improve accessibility and female facilities, while other clubs received funding despite not being eligible when agreements were signed for projects that would have been built anyway. \u201cFor volunteers at clubs throughout Australia, who worked hard to submit applications that on merit should have received awards, this outcome is extremely disappointing and needs to be addressed,\u201d it submitted. \u201cIt is evident that the award of grant funding was not informed by an appropriate assessment process and sound advice.\u201d \u201cThe government needs to make additional funding available to ensure that grants are made to all organisations that would have been successful based on Sport Australia merit scores but were later rejected by the sports minister. \u201cWe are aware of a possible class action and based on the strength of our application, and Sport Australia evaluation we have been advised that we will present a very strong case for award. \u201cIt is our hope that the government addresses these wrongdoings and we do not have to consider this course of action.\u201d The Gippsland Ranges Roller Derby club, which top-scored with 98 out of 100 in Sport Australia\u2019s assessment, submitted there had been \u201cno explanation of why funds were awarded to applicants with considerably lower gradings on applications, and for ten times the amount requested by our club\u201d. \u201cWe are left with no doubt that the action of denying our club the funds we were assessed as deserving was indeed discriminatory and politically motivated,\u201d it said. The Gippsland Ranges Roller Derby club demanded that all clubs that scored above the designated cut-off of 74 \u2013 above which the ANAO said clubs would have been funded but for ministerial intervention \u2013 \u201cshould be retrospectively funded in full via the release of additional funds\u201d. The Kyneton District Soccer Club, which scored 87 out of 100, called on the government to \u201cfund all the projects that should have been funded but missed out\u201d . The constitutional expert Anne Twomey submitted that program guidelines were invalid because they nominated McKenzie \u201cthe final approver of grants\u201d and reiterated her view that \u201cmost of the funding given to projects under the scheme was unlawful because there was no constitutional head of power to support it\u201d. The Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies at Melbourne University agreed that there was \u201cno plausible head of legislative power to support most and, perhaps, all [the grants]\u201d. The health department submitted that although it helped develop the program guidelines \u201cthe department did not seek legal advice\u201d about the program, which it said was the responsibility of Sport Australia. Sport Australia submitted that it had accepted the three recommendations of the ANAO to manage the expected level of demand for programs, improve conflict of interest procedures and assessment records. It did not comment on what the legal authority was for McKenzie to make grants. The Senate select committee on sports grants is due to hear from McKenzie and the secretary of the department of the prime minister and cabinet, Phil Gaetjens.

      "body": "<p>The Nvidia Shield TV is a refined version of the best Android TV box for years, packed with impressive new AI-based upscaling technology and a novel space-saving design.</p> <p>The new Nvidia Shield TV comes in two versions: a \u00a3149.99 media streamer and a \u201cPro\u201d alternative for \u00a3199 that is aimed more at gaming.</p> <p>For those unfamiliar with these types of media streaming devices, they in effect add a smart TV experience to older televisions or replace the often terrible or out-of-date smart elements of more modern sets, so that you can use apps such as Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer and Netflix.</p> <p>Nvidia is arguably the biggest name in graphics, and also makes mobile chips called Tegra, on which these two Android TV boxes are based. The previous Shield was released in 2015 and, unlike many other smart TVs and streaming boxes, is being kept fresh with a steady stream of updates, making it the best, most supported Android TV experience available either baked into a TV or in a set-top box.</p> <p>The new Shield TV doesn\u2019t mess with the formula. You get one of the most powerful media-streaming boxes available, running the latest version of Android TV and similar long-term software support.</p> <h2>User-centric design</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7892dd2b98b4d0f7da5a535fa90cc62b5f44e8f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7892dd2b98b4d0f7da5a535fa90cc62b5f44e8f4/998_563_2977_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nvidia Shield TV remote control\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The triangular remote looks odd at first glance, but works really well and won\u2019t slip around or get lost down the side of the sofa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s new is the form factor. The standard Shield TV is not a box but a small tube with a power cable and ethernet socket in one end and an HDMI socket and microSD card slot in the other. The idea is you hide this small tube behind your TV in series with the cable without taking up any significant space.</p> <p>The remote too has been rethought. Instead of being a thin, touch-sensitive remote, the new version has a triangular profile, takes two standard AAA batteries including rechargeables, has a good weight to it and an assortment of buttons that are backlit when the remote is picked up, including dedicated pause and volume buttons.</p> <p>The shape may seem odd but it\u2019s designed to prevent it slipping down the side or backs of sofas, and it works. A simple, user-friendly design.</p> <p>The remote communicates with the Shield TV via Bluetooth and has an IR blaster in the end for controlling the volume on your TV, amp or soundbar. It works great.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> Nvidia Tegra X1+</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 2 or 3GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 8 or 16GB + microSD card</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> wifi ac, Bluetooth 5, gigabit ethernet, HDMI 2.0b (HDCP2.2), 2x USB 3.0 (Pro only)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Software:</strong> Android TV (Android 9 Pie)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Format support:</strong> up to 4K @ 60Hz, Dolby Vision, HDR10, Dolby Atmos, TrueHD and Digital Plus, DTS-X</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 40mm diameter, 165mm length or 98 x 159 x 259.3mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 137g or 250g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Android TV</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52b4d9da88499cb59b4855c34fd4046b47336399\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52b4d9da88499cb59b4855c34fd4046b47336399/291_299_4331_2599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nvidia Shield TV interface\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Shield TV has is the standard, customisable Android TV interface, without adverts, with a few Nvidia additions for things such as the AI upscaling, GeForce Now game streaming and accessory updates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Google\u2019s Android TV platform is a fairly simple system based on apps and a customisable carousel layout that highlights content from certain apps.

He was, until recently, the minister president of the east German state of Thuringia, where his leftwing party, Die Linke, has ruled in coalition with the Greens and Social Democrats for the past six years, and kept both Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and the far right at bay. In a parliamentary election in October Die Linke won more votes than any other \u2013 31% \u2013 the first time in German history that Die Linke has performed so well at the state level.

In a country that prides itself on honouring political taboos, the apparent coordination between conservatives and the AfD cut through the cordon sanitaire that has long forbidden mainstream parties from working with the far right.

Ramelow, who had strong union credentials, was descended from a long line of Protestant ministers in West Germany, and was adept at forging alliances.

Between 7pm and 9pm Kavuma verifies information from civilians who have spotted locusts in their neighbourhoods, and deploys troops. Dozens of soldiers travel through the night, so they can begin spraying pesticide before sunrise.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis work is done in two phases. Phase number one is to kill these mature locusts. They don\u2019t eat a lot but they lay eggs,\u201d Kavuma explains. \u201cPhase two is mapping the areas they land and sleep [in].

      "bodyText": "Sitting at a plastic table in the garden of Timisha hotel in Soroti, eastern Uganda, Major General Samuel Kavuma takes a drag of his cigarette and looks down at his phone, which has barely stopped ringing for the past hour. A military figure for nearly 40 years, Kavuma fought the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army insurgent group. Now, he\u2019s become the \u201clocust commander\u201d, the man leading the fight against the country\u2019s worst locust outbreak in decades. Swarms of locusts \u2013 billions in total \u2013 have spread to eight countries in east Africa, after they crossed the Red Sea from Yemen at the end of last year. The insects can travel roughly 90 miles a day and eat their own body weight in crops. The UN has warned the locust swarms could increase 500 times by June, posing a major threat to the region. In response, Uganda has deployed its army. Kavuma, 59, doesn\u2019t know why he was put in charge, but he sees the locusts as a formidable enemy. \u201cWhen we started two weeks ago we did not know much about these creatures,\u201d Kavuma says. \u201cNow I am a professor. I know how they behave, the pattern of their movements.\u201d Locusts are highly mobile, he notes. \u201c[But] after 6.30pm or 7pm they don\u2019t move, they don\u2019t fly at night.\u201d That gives him time to focus operations. Between 7pm and 9pm Kavuma verifies information from civilians who have spotted locusts in their neighbourhoods, and deploys troops. Dozens of soldiers travel through the night, so they can begin spraying pesticide before sunrise. \u201cThis work is done in two phases. Phase number one is to kill these mature locusts. They don\u2019t eat a lot but they lay eggs,\u201d Kavuma explains. \u201cPhase two is mapping the areas they land and sleep [in]. After this then we shall embark on locating and identifying the places where they lay eggs. Then we destroy eggs.\u201d Kavuma sleeps less than three hours each day, going to bed around 1am and waking again between 3\u20134am, often flying to the location of that morning\u2019s operation. He won\u2019t confirm how many soldiers are working on the response, although local media put the figure at 2,000. In early February, Uganda said it had set aside 15 billion Ugandan shillings (around \u00a33.16m) to combat the locusts. \u201cI have enough soldiers to do the work. I may not give you the number, but the operation has been successful. We have killed and killed millions of these locusts,\u201d says Kavuma, who describes some of the operations as \u201cmassacres\u201d. One operation starts long before dawn on Sunday morning, in Biloyoro village, in Kitgum district, more than 200km (124 miles) from Kavuma\u2019s base. Around 100 soldiers and wildlife rangers stumble bleary-eyed from military trucks, putting on protective gear \u2013 plastic trousers, jackets, gloves, boots and face masks. \u201cThey\u2019re there, they\u2019re there,\u201d shouts an officer as soldiers use UN-branded buckets to mix water and bottles of a pesticide containing chlorpyrifos. There has been some concern around the longterm impacts of chlorpyrifos. In 2015, the Obama administration announced the pesticide would be banned because of evidence it affects the development of children\u2019s brains. This decision was reversed by Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful,\u201d says one soldier. Kavuma says the insecticide is \u201charmless\u201d. The soldiers fan out across the land, spraying the ground, crops and aiming for the trees, locusts flying through the air around them. The motorised sprayers are unable to reach the higher tree branches. \u201c[The soldiers] are working but these things, they need airplanes,\u201d says Omony Charles, a 24-year-old boda boda motorbike driver who lives nearby, watching the operation unfold. \u201cThe machines are not reaching the top.\u201d \u201cThey are dormant, they are confused, they are very drunk,\u201d a soldier replies, arguing that it takes time for the locusts to die. \u201cBut there\u2019s not enough manpower. And when we can\u2019t spray high enough, they get away.\u201d Other soldiers complain that their masks don\u2019t work, that the protective gear is ripped, and that they are exhausted. \u201cTransport is a problem,\u201d one says, describing the cramped trucks they are moved around in, too packed to sleep. Some of their backpacks leak, dripping pesticide down the legs of soldiers as they spray.

The 40-year-old, who grows maize, sorghum, millet and cotton, is worried about the locusts spreading. \u201cWe will suffer,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll struggle to look for food for my children.\u201d Charles Kama, a 54-year-old civil servant in Kitgum, drives out a water tank to help with the operation. \u201cI think the war has started,\u201d he says. \u201cThe locusts will be defeated because I\u2019ve seen the effort [the military is] making.\u201d \u201cThis is a crazy situation but thank God we shall fight it slowly,\u201d says Abitegeka Gerald, a commander in the Ugandan Wildlife Authority, sitting in the front of a military truck as it ploughs through crops to a new position, yellow locusts smashing against the windscreen. Later, he stands in the middle of soldiers shouting orders, holding a plastic bag of live locusts he says he will present to his seniors to show the job has been done. By 10am, the operation winds down. Gerald calls it a \u201csuccessful\u201d morning, though as he talks clouds of locusts continue to fly in circles behind him. \u201cBy coming here very early we made sure that we did a massive job of killing \u2026 We are making sure that we deter them before they spread all over the country.\u201d Still, he says, they need assistance. \u201cWe are thin on the ground in fighting these locusts.

But that is not what is taking up our time at the moment. It is too early to tell. It is too early to tell what effects some mitigating arrangements might have. It\u2019s too early to tell what, for instance, might be something that will come out of the fact that actually, our semester two starts earlier than the northern hemisphere teaching periods. So it\u2019s too early. What I want to say is here - our focus is on the students and what they need at the moment. They are our students.

      "bodyText": "We are going to close the blog off for the night, but we will be back tomorrow for the last sitting day this week. The next sports rorts inquiry hearing will start at 9am. Sports Australia will be there. And so will we, covering that, as well as everything else that happens. Whatever that may be. Except legislation, because that doesn\u2019t seem to be something that is happening at the moment. Not a lot on the agenda. A very big thank you to Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Mike Bowers and Katharine Murphy and all the moderators, producers and Guardian brains trust members for all that they do. And to you. If you need me before tomorrow, I\u2019ll be here and here. Until then \u2013 take care of you. The leftwing Peter Dutton (because leftwing apparently covers anything from the left to the right, according to the home affairs minister) didn\u2019t explain his leftwing terrorism is Islamic terrorism comments today, but that is par for the course of the most secretive department in this nation, which just gets more and more power, almost unchecked. The Senate has set up an inquiry into domestic violence. From Rex Patrick\u2019s office: The inquiry will examine the existing programs undertaken and funded by the Australian government, state and territory governments and non-government organisations to reduce family violence. This examination will inform the committee in its primary focus of identifying what needs to be done and the resources required to drive and achieve real change to prevent violence against women and their children. Linda Burney talks about the vigil for Hannah Clarke with Patricia Karvelas: We all thought it was very appropriate, given the shocking circumstances of Hannah and her children and the way in which it\u2019s touched all Australians. To hold something here in the parliament, as you say, in the nation\u2019s capital, it will be a very simple vigil, candles and flowers and a song and some speakers. But it\u2019s got another purpose and that\u2019s to remind people the scourge of domestic violence happens every day, every hour, every minute for thousands of women across this country. And we\u2019re remembering women and children that have been touched by this terrible abuse. The leaders are attending. It\u2019s a bipartisan event, where, for a rare occasion, politics are being put to the side. As seen by Mike Bowers: Matt Canavan, the former resources minister, tells Patricia Karvelas he knows buttloads (the technical term) of farmers who are against the National Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s aspiration to work towards net zero emissions by 2050. Well, actually, I\u2019ve been inundated with support from farmers about their rejection and disagreement with the NFS\u2019s position. I think I\u2019m solely on the side of future farming in this country, the development of our nation. The CSIRO report that the Labor party relies on in this debate to say net zero emissions is achievable, that report says agricultural production would experience substantial decline under a net zero emissions model. That\u2019s just to offset all the carbon emissions that will occur in cities and people flying around, you have to plant lots of trees. That will cost thousands of jobs in regional Australia. The Labor party have long since deserted support for workers. It\u2019s not just for mining workers, or the manufacturing sector, it\u2019s also all in the food industries as well. Not just on farm, the jobs in sugar mills, the cotton gins, the meat processing facilities. Those are good paying regular jobs that I want to defend. I mean, the resources sector and mines have never, ever impacted farming in this country. No. Of course not. There is plenty of water to go around. Plenty of it. It\u2019s all great. Matt Canavan has found another camera. The senator for Queensland hasn\u2019t been more than 10 metres away from a camera since resigning from the cabinet during the latest Barnaby Joyce leadership challenge. The cruel summer continues. A vigil will be held for Hannah Clarke and her children in parliament tonight. I think we all know which way Zed Seselja went when it came to Malcolm Turnbull. Asked about the former prime minister\u2019s climate warning, the ACT senator says: Well, look, I guess I agree with the former PM, Malcolm Turnbull, on one thing, when he made a point of saying that former PMs who hung around and gave lots of ongoing commentary on current events weren\u2019t all that useful. And Malcolm has a different view than he had when he was in government. I noticed some of his commentary over the summer referring to the bushfire crisis when there were bushfires when he was PM and he pointed out that no single weather event could be attributed directly to climate change. He\u2019s changed his views since he left government. Good luck to him. But we\u2019re going to get on with what are very, very strong targets, what is very, very strong action, whether it\u2019s in the delivery of renewable energy, the 50% per capita. Patricia Karvelas: You\u2019re saying he\u2019s a hypocrite? ZS: No. You can make commentary as you like. I\u2019m just pointing to the facts. PK: So you\u2019re saying that he\u2019s got a different view to the one he had when he was PM? ZS: It would clearly appear so. Patricia Karvelas is questioning Zed Seselja over the \u201cBack in Black\u201d budget boasts \u2013 which are now looking decidedly pink-faced, on ABC TV. Seselja says there is no way the government could have known what was coming. Including, the bushfires. We\u2019ve underestimated where our budget position would be over the last few years. And we have tended to overdeliver. No one could have foreseen the bushfire disaster we\u2019ve had on the back of drought, with coronavirus. As I say, we don\u2019t know where the final position will be but we are in a radically better position with a balanced budget already achieved in order to respond to all of these issues. We\u2019ve taken our fiscal responsibilities very seriously, whilst also seeking to grow the economy. So the Australian people can have great confidence that when we take spending decisions, we are very, very careful so that we can ensure that we can respond to these crises as they arise. Except the government was warned about a terrible bushfire season being due. It thought it was going to happen the season before. MPs have said that themselves. And then there were the former fire chiefs, who banded together to write a letter saying the bushfire season was going to be pretty terrible. But sure. . We are still working out how to call out rightwing terrorism as a country, though. Which is not being helped along by political leaders who find it difficult to find the words to do so. Bill Shorten is not letting robodebt go. He has left question time and released this statement: This directly contradicts the argument being made in court by government lawyers in defending the robodebt scheme against a class action brought by 11,000 Australians. Government lawyers on February 14 stated their policy in the robodebt class action was that the government does not owe Centrelink recipients a duty of care. Today in parliament Mr Morrison was asked by Labor: \u201cPrime minister, does the government owe a duty of care or not to Centrelink recipients.\u201d He responded with a rambling monologue prefaced by the statement: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the duty of care we have to the Australian people including those who depend on their social services payments.\u201d Who is lying about whether the victims of robodebt were owed a duty of care by their government \u2013 the Prime Minister or his lawyers? And will the prime minister match his talk inside the parliament by instructing his lawyers to amend their defence to confirm the commonwealth does owe Centrelink recipients a duty of care? All summer we\u2019ve heard revelation after revelation about the rorting of government grant programs. In the case of the sports rorts affair, the then sports minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office was found to have ignored the recommendations of her department and instead delivered grants in a way that would boost the Coalition\u2019s election prospects. The Greens senator Larissa Waters is now seeking a Senate order of continuing effect that would prevent that from happening again. The Greens want to compel ministers to provide an explanation to the treasurer if they award grants in a way that deviates from the advice of relevant officials. Such explanations would also be made public. \u201cFor weeks, the prime minister has refused to explain how funds allocated for sports facilities and infrastructure ended up going mostly to marginal seats,\u201d Waters said. \u201cColour-coded spreadsheets and funding for mates has replaced proper process and integrity. \u201cTaxpayer money is not just a slush fund for ministers to further their own interests. If a minister ignores the advice of officials, the public deserves to know why.\u201d But the government appears keen to kill off the Greens\u2019 proposal. Waters says the government, with One Nation support, is attempting to knock off the proposal and is blocking an attempt to postpone its consideration until tomorrow. Scott Morrison has raised the Malka Leifer case in his meeting with the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, in Canberra on Wednesday, ahead of court hearings this week. The two leaders expressed a \u201cstrong commitment\u201d to seeing justice for the victims of Leifer in a meeting that also canvassed the two countries\u2019 commitment to democracy and the rule of law. The six-year impasse over Leifer\u2019s extradition has also been raised by other MPs who met with the president, including Australia\u2019s former ambassador to Israel, Liberal MP Dave Sharma, and the Macnamara MP, Josh Burns. Rivlin has committed to emphasising the priority of the case when he returns home, and has told MPs he will meet personally with Israel\u2019s chief justice to try to progress the matter if it remains unresolved. Morrison said the meeting with Rivlin demonstrated the \u201cgreat friendship\u201d between Israel and Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s a friendship between peoples; a friendship that has been born out of deep respect and empathy for the struggles that Israel has faced,\u201d Morrison said. And question time ends. Scott Morrison says something to Anthony Albanese across the table and leaves. We have reached the inevitable conclusion of the Labor motion failing, and question time moves into a dixer to Karen Andrews. The punishment does not fit the crime. Croquet didn\u2019t do so well. \u201cAircraft sports\u201d, on the other hand, seem to be on the rise. Other MPs are taking the opportunity to hit Twitter As we go through the final stages of the divisions, the MPs take the chance to sledge each other. Richard Marles just accused the prime minister of being \u201cmore nervous than a baboon in Camperdown\u201d. Who says Australia has no culture. While it is interesting that there were 136 emails exchanged between Bridget McKenzie and Scott Morrison\u2019s office, it\u2019s important to keep it in perspective. On the one hand \u2013 the Australian National Audit Office found the prime minister\u2019s office made both direct and indirect representations about which projects should be funded. On the other, the auditor general, Grant Hehir, said that not all representations changed the outcome of funding decisions and the ANAO did not find sufficient correlation between representations and an outcome to make it a focus of the audit. On 13 February Hehir told a hearing: \u201cThe evidence before us was that the minister was the decision-maker ... If we had have identified someone else as the decision-maker, we would have gone down that path.\u201d Hehir concluded that the community sport infrastructure grant program was \u201cnot informed by appropriate assessment process and sound advice\u201d. Christian Porter has moved that Anthony Albanese no longer be heard, which will pass, and then Labor will have another go, which will also be shut down, before we get to the final vote, where question time will resume for one or two more dixers. The motion (which will fail) I seek leave to move the following motion \u2014 That the House: 1) notes: a) the prime minister claims his only involvement in the corrupt sports rorts scheme was the passing of information by his office; b) the Audit Office found there were 136 emails between the prime minister\u2019s office and Senator McKenzie\u2019s office over a six-month period about the corrupt sports rorts scheme; c) the Audit Office also found the prime minister\u2019s office emailed Senator McKenzie\u2019s office about projects under the corrupt sports rorts scheme indicating \u201cthese are the ones we think should be included in the list of approved projects\u201d; d) the Audit Office found the colour-coded spreadsheet was shared between Senator McKenzie\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s office; and e) in preparing his report, the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff and now secretary of his department relied on only one version of the colour-coded spreadsheet when there were dozens of versions; and 2) therefore, calls on the prime minister to: a) correct his repeated misleading statements to the parliament that only eligible projects were funded under the corrupt sports rorts scheme when paragraphs 4.32 and 4.33 of the audit of the scheme show 280 ineligible projects were funded; b) explain how his story can withstand the findings of the Audit Office; and c) explain why he has used taxpayer money as though it was his own personal marketing fund. Anthony Albanese is moving to suspend standing orders over the sports grants affair. This is the document the opposition is referring to. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Why did his office received copies of the multiple versions of the colour-coded spreadsheet of the corrupt sports rorts affair program? Why did Mr Gaetjens rely on just one version of the spreadsheet when the auditor general said there were dozens. Did he ignore the other versions of the spreadsheet or was he not ever given them? Christian Porter tries to stop the question. But he probably should spend less time practicing his dixer replies (which are remarkably similar) and more time studying the standing orders, because you are allowed to ask the prime minister about inquiries he has instigated, involving the head of his own department. Morrison: As would be appropriate because it was a serious inquiry and I note that the head of prime minister and cabinet, Mr Speaker, he was able to have whatever document he sought to conduct the inquiry and the prime minister\u2019s office complied with all requests of the Secretary, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, what I can go back to highlight again, what the auditor general said about the matters of the leader of the opposition, settle down, settle down! What he said was for us to see that there was some driver in this that we would have to identify those representations that there was a bias and there was a correlation in what was in those representations and the outcome, he said that they did not see that. The auditor general has been quizzed on these very matters and he has found no correlation, Mr Speaker, with the representations that were made from my office with these outcomes. Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition is trying to throw mud while he himself sits in an absolute swamp, Mr Speaker! We know that the leader of the opposition had a spreadsheet in his office when he ran a similar program which had a column on it that said Labor or Liberal, Mr Speaker. That is what he had and then he threw the rulebook away and gave the money to the project he wanted to. Morrison is made to withdraw his final remark, which I missed, but I think involved the word \u201chypocrite\u201d. Scott Morrison, who told journalists to settle down in a press conference lately, is now telling the opposition to settle down. Paul Fletcher says some things. On what? Who knows. There are words. Scott Morrison: I want to refer to the evidence provided by the ANAO to the committee ... he [the auditor general] says it was not the case that we could see that those which came directly from the prime minister\u2019s office were more successful than those that came from the local member\u2019s office. I hope that the leader of the opposition would be more truthful about these things. I would certainly hope that when he had to appear as a witness at the Labor committal conspiracy trial, Mr Speaker, that he was more truthful there. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister and it follows his extraordinary answer to my last question. The prime minister has said about the corrupt sports rorts affair program and said that: \u201cAll we did was provide information.\u201d Why did the office tell the [minister] and I quote: \u201cThese are the ones we think should be included in the list of approved projects.\u201d Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I repeat what I just said. I said that our office ... Mr Speaker, what I just said to the House in response to the last question, is that we passed on information about other funding options or programs relevant to project proposals and provided proposals based on representations made to us. Why does the leader of the opposition have an issue with the government talking to people in communities about what their priorities for community projects should be? Mr Speaker, what I know, and I make reference to my earlier answer, Mr Speaker, I and the auditor general reported that the leader of the Labor Party in response to the program ... There is also this (given that Melissa McIntosh was the Lindsay candidate at the time, not the MP) It\u2019s time for Just How Safe Are You with leftwing warrior, Peter Dutton. After all, as Dutton himself says: \u201cYou can use leftwing to describe everybody from the left to the right. \u201cI said today, I don\u2019t care where people are on the spectrum, if they pose a threat to our country and want to do harm to Australians, then they are in our sights.\u201d One of the points of relevance is Scott Morrison\u2019s use of the \u2018member for Lindsay\u2019, given that the member for Lindsay at the time was Emma Husar. Morrison: I\u2019m happy to take the leader of the opposition\u2019s interjection, what I know about the member for Lindsay even if she isn\u2019t in this place she knew what was right, and guess what, Mr Speaker? The people of Lindsay agree with me. Because they elected the member for Lindsay because the member for Lindsay knows what\u2019s best for her community. Morrison again brings up the auditor general report critical of Anthony Albanese released about 10 years ago. Tony Smith pulls him up on relevance, so Morrison ends with this: I have set out the role my office played, all I know is that when the leader of the opposition was a minister, he threw the book away and knowingly funded ineligible projects. You want to talk about corruption! Totally normal discourse. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison The prime minister has claimed his office\u2019s only involvement in the corrupt sports rorts scheme was to pass along information, why has the audit office told the Senate today there were 136 emails about sports rorts going back and forth between the prime minister\u2019s office and Senator McKenzie\u2019s office in under six months. Morrison: Neither I nor my office were decision-makers in the process that governs the sports grants program, the decision-maker as has been identified through the audit office was the sports master. As I stated at the [time], what prime ministers have always done is support their judgement and colleagues because I know they know what is best for their communities. I know the member for Petrie and the member for Boothby know best for their communities, the member for Lindsay knows what\u2019s best for her community. I know what is best for our communities right across the country. There is a back and forth over whether the prime minister is being relevant. Christian Porter is delivering the next dixer, but he appears to have practiced this once too many times in front of the mirror, because it seems a bit stale. The human vision board is entertaining the prime minister though, so he can count that as a brownie point. Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: Why have nearly 140,000 apprentice and trainee places been lost under the seven-year-old government? Morrison: Thank you for your question about apprentices and the trends we are seeing in apprenticeship numbers and I am pleased to inform the House that in the 2019-20 budget the government provided $585m for skills measures to implement long needed reforms in the veteran sector and created up to 80,000 new apprenticeship places through the new incentive scheme, kicked off on July 1, 2019, which is after the period of the trends that the member is referring to. So the funding the government has put in place to do with these issues commenced and went in place from 1 July, 2019. Apprentices and their employees have readily taken up the new scheme with almost 6,000 additional apprentices signed up just the six months. I note that at the same time we have increased the funding when it comes to the vet sector, states and territories responsible for the delivery of that, including Tafe funding have withdrawn funding from $4bn in 2013 and down to $3.1m in 2017 The Commonwealth is stepping up a meeting up commitment to ensure we get more apprentices in place and to address the issues that the member has raised but I do note to compare and contrast, that when the Labor party was last in power, between 2011 \u2013 2013, Labor cut employer incentives to businesses that employ apprentices nine times, totalling $1.2bn and when the leader of the opposition was deputy prime minister, Labor cut $241m from incentives to encourage employers to take on apprentices and in 2012-13, the number of apprentices and trainees in training collapsed under Labor by 22%, or $110,000. I am not going to cop lectures from a Labor party that does not know how to manage money and run an economy and does not have a plan. Angus Taylor attempts to answer a question (he\u2019s a Rhodes scholar, don\u2019t you know) and the similarity to a test pattern is uncanny. We are investing in new and storage projects like Snowy 2.0 to make sure we have a secure, reliable grid. Yup. And you know what we need to make snowy viable? Katharine Murphy does: Josh Frydenberg ends his dixer with another attack on the \u201cwellbeing\u201d budget, which Jim Chalmers said Labor would look at delivering, at the same time as the budget budget. New Zealand has announced it will deliver one. It basically lists what the government is doing to tackle well-being issues impacting its population \u2013 things like mental health, suicide prevention, child welfare, indigenous welfare, homelessness and equality. Frydenberg thinks this is hilarious: Picture this alternative, the Member for Rankin is about to deliver his first wellbeing budget. He walks in, therefore, into the Chamber and robes are flowing. Incense is burning, Mr Speaker. These are in one hand and gone are the seats, gone are the benches, Mr Speaker and in their place, meditation mats for all, Mr Speaker. Meditation mats for all and the Member for Rankin stands up to address the Chamber to announce that his wellbeing tour has gone national, hugs for all, Mr Speaker! Hugs for all! There is a warning to every Australian, Mr Speaker, when the Member for Rankin provides him with a hug and a kiss he will take away their wallets. This is the same government that scrapped the women\u2019s statement in the budget (the one which worked out how the budget would impact women) under Tony Abbott (before Kelly O\u2019Dwyer insisted it be reinstated) so sure. Let\u2019s attack wellbeing. How about we kick some puppies into the sun a bit later? Maybe burn some kid\u2019s art? Adam Bandt delivers a question which covers War and Peace and everything in between, which just gives the prime minister carte blanche to talk about whatever he wants. Bandt: Now the coronavirus is hurting us as well. This is on top of the underemployment crisis in the country plus wage stagnation and an inequality crisis. With the risk of the economy heading towards recession and the Reserve Bank running out of bullets, will you back a Green New Deal to fight the threat of recession and lift public-sector wages to boost wage growth across the economy, will you start by at least $95 a week to encourage retail spending and invest $6bn to remove the grid bottlenecks holding back renewable energy investments and grow construction and manufacturing jobs?\u201d Scott Morrison: It would be a great relief that we are not going to adopt the policy of the Greens! It would be a great relief for the people, I cannot speak for the Labor party because they are known to like quite a few of the Greens ideas when it comes to economic policy so I do not think they can provide that same assurance.\u201d Morrison then wanders into dixer territory about why his government is the greatest government to govern ever in the history of governments. Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister, why is the prime minister privatising aged care assessments? Greg Hunt gets the nod: We reject the proposition put forward by the member that is inaccurate, untrue, and it is false. I will make this point, what we are doing \u2026 is making sure we are having a system which actually delivers better, better outcomes for patients who are seeking to enter residential aged care or have some kind of aged care assessment, that\u2019s exactly what we are doing. In terms of the implementation we will work with states, I make this offer ahead of Coag at the end of this week, we are looking forward to working with the states in a constructive fashion, what the opposition are saying is that they will abandon the practice they had when they were in government on using non-government providers to assist with the assessment process, that\u2019s the change, or are they not? Here is the question for the opposition to take away from this, are they now saying they would abandon all of those current, non-government providers which were in place when they were in government, which they did not propose to change at the election, or is this a case of simply making it up as they go along? Because we know one thing, when they had the opportunity, only a few months ago, the current shadow minister was the current minister going into the election, they had a chance to invest in aged care, what did they provide for residential care, nothing. For home care, nothing, they know that we know that and the Australian public knows that. Michael McCormack\u2019s performance is so bad, even the Speaker alerts him to the concept of the inside voice. Can I assure the deputy prime minister his microphone is in good working order, so far. We were so preoccupied with whether or not we could turn a loaf of bread into a politician, we didn\u2019t stop to think if we should. Michael McCormack is now pretending to be a leader by acting as if he has just discovered hands and wants you all to know about it. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: The government social security law guide, which was released on 10 February this year, states Australian government employees have a duty of care to the public in performing their duties. But government lawyers on February 14 stated the policy in the robodebt class action does not owe Centrelink recipients a duty of care. Does the government owe a duty of care to Centrelink recipients? Morrison: The duty of care to the Australian people including those who depend on their social services payment which enables them to deal with the difficulties in their lives and at a time like this, when the country is facing some very difficult challenges \u2013 I refer to the impact of the bushfires and coronavirus which means more and more Australians because of the automatic stabilisers of social security payments which go to those impacted by the economic shocks we are now experiencing. What they deserve from a government is to be able to pay their bills and make sure we can make the payments we can make to them, as we have, and we make sure we do that, one of the ways, as a government, we have been able to make sure people can rely on the services of the essential government delivers with a Centrelink payers or other support payments, aged care payments as you need to know how to manage money, that means when you are making payments to those, you pay them If anyone is managing to pay their bills on Newstart, let me know. Scott Morrison answers a dixer on how amazing the government is as an economic manager by talking about Labor. Bill Shorten asks about the government\u2019s duty of care in regards to robodebt and Stuart Robert loses his mind: \u201cLet me say we will not be lectured on duty of care by those opposite who have presided over 1,200 deaths at sea and those opposite have the hypocrisy to...\u201d Tony Smith tells him to pull his head in and Robert\u2019s withdraws his comment. Robert again starts talking about the wonderful social safety net, so Shorten raises a point of order on direct relevance. Smith once again tells Robert to get on with it. Robert: The members question goes to technical legal matters before the court. It would be inappropriate to comment further when the matter is under actual judicial review. Labor groans. Remind you of anyone in Australian politics? I regret to inform you the Liberal party store $35 \u2018Back in Black\u2019 coffee mug, is now sold out. DEIDRE CHAMBERS Universities Australia chair Deborah Terry has just spoken at the National Press Club about the need for science and expertise to guide Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus and climate change, although she steered clear of political commentary when asked why some politicians refuse to believe the science. Terry had a few pointed lines on the issue of freedom of speech on campus: \u201cLast April, a review by a former high court chief justice [Robert French] found that claims of freedom of speech crisis were \u2018Not substantiated\u2019. But offered a guide for each university to consider how its existing policies breathed life into those freedoms. So, in the 10 months since, each university has carefully and thoughtfully mapped that guide against its own policies.\u201d Earlier today the education minister, Dan Tehan, spoke to the Universities Australia conference, and revealed the government would include freedom of speech in the school experience survey. Asked if the university sector would seek some form of federal funding to compensate for the impact of coronavirus, Terry responds that the first priority is the wellbeing of students, but does not rule out seeking assistance in future. She said: \u201cYes, in the background, we are looking at what the implications of it might be, [we\u2019re] doing some modelling in the background. But that is not what is taking up our time at the moment. It is too early to tell. It is too early to tell what effects some mitigating arrangements might have. It\u2019s too early to tell what, for instance, might be something that will come out of the fact that actually, our semester two starts earlier than the northern hemisphere teaching periods. So it\u2019s too early. What I want to say is here - our focus is on the students and what they need at the moment. They are our students. They are part of our community and we must keep our focus there.\u201d New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern will be in town later this week. She has already said she won\u2019t be \u201cwaggling\u201d her finger at Australia over our climate policies. I would expect Australia\u2019s immigration policies will come up, though. It is still a pretty big bone of contention that Australia is deporting people who may have been born in New Zealand but lived here their whole life, if they are imprisoned. Personally, I hope this is suitably brought up, and lauded: The health minister was also asked about the baboons: Greg Hunt: Other than the story as reported through the ABC, and it is where I\u2019d learned about the baboons, I don\u2019t have any extra information. My heart was with the baboons, I have to say. ... They operated as a modern relationship. And I\u2019m fine with that. Some more baboon content for you. Because we all need it. Turns out the baboon has six wives. If anyone hits me with a \u201cno wonder he was trying to escape\u201d joke, you too will be tarred with the boomer brush. It is the downhill slide into question time. Economy, economy, economy from both sides, will most likely be the order of the day. Greg Hunt says Australia has changed its travel advisory for northern Italy, because of the impact coronavirus is having in the region. To repeat, the Australian government, on medical advice, has lifted our travel advisory for northern Italy, in particular. That is exercise a high degree of caution \u2013 level two, of our travel advisory \u2013 for the provinces of Lombardy and Veneto. In addition, with regards to Iran, we have higher levels of travel advisory for non-medical reasons, but we have issued additional advice with regards to exercising a high degree of caution in relation to any travel to Iran, where we have had an increase in the numbers and significantly high number of deaths, which as the chief medical officer indicated yesterday, may be a strong guide that the number of cases is greater than those that have been reported. The Sydney baboons are in the mind of Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, who wants the Senate to acknowledge the three who made a bid for freedom and also raise awareness of animal testing and research in Australia. This is her latest motion: The Senate will vote on the motion on Thursday. I give notice that on the next day of sitting, I shall move \u2013That the Senate: 1. Notes: a. Three baboons made a bid for freedom in Sydney this week, b. The baboons were from a colony bred for use in research, c. Animal testing causes harm and suffering to animals, and d. The episode has highlighted the community\u2019s concern for the welfare of animals used in experimentation and research; 2. Wishes the baboons well; and 3. Calls on the government to: a. Ensure national transparency and accountability in the use of animals in research, and b. Invest in the methods and technology needed to end the use of animals for research purposes. Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff has taken to the Senate to call for an immediate review of all the anime and manga available in Australia. The Japanese animation has caught his eye because of some of the themes which run through it \u2013 Griff says the depiction of young characters in some stories amounts to the glorification of child sexual abuse. \u201cThey contain depictions of wide-eyed children, usually in school uniforms, engaged in explicit sexual activities and poses, and often being sexually abused,\u201d Griff said. He wants a review of the ratings. \u201cThe classification board appears to be making decisions in isolation to criminal law. This must stop.\u201d Griff has written to communications minister Paul Fletcher over the issue. In this quiet, quiet time, let\u2019s take a look at the latest ABS figures. You may have noticed Shane Wright\u2019s tweet a few posts down, pointing out construction work as a whole fell 3% in December, which was worse than the 1% predictions. Over the year, construction work (building) is down 7.1% Private residential construction fell 4.6% in the December quarter, bringing its downward trend to 12.8% over the year. Greg Hunt will be giving the next coronavirus update at 1.10pm. Meanwhile, the lights keep flickering in Parliament House, which can only mean that my moods have begun to physically manifest. Australia is also warning it will not risk the health of athletes, if the coronavirus reaches pandemic levels Quoting an IOC official which would bring a tear to Roy and HG\u2019s fans\u2019 eyes, AAP reports shiz is getting real with the Olympics in general. A senior member of the International Olympic Committee says if it\u2019s too dangerous to hold the Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus, the event could be cancelled rather than postponed. Canadian official Dick Pound, who has been on the IOC since 1978, estimated there is a three-month window \u2013 or even two months \u2013 to decide the fate of the Tokyo Olympics, meaning a decision could be put off until late May. \u201cIn and around that time, I\u2019d say folks are going to have to ask: \u2018Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo or not?\u201d\u2019 he told the Associated Press. As the games draw near, he said: \u201cA lot of things have to start happening. You\u2019ve got to start ramping up your security, your food, the Olympic village, the hotels. The media folks will be in there building their studios.\u201d If the IOC decides the games cannot go forward as scheduled in Tokyo, \u201cyou\u2019re probably looking at a cancellation,\u201d he said. It is very, very quiet here today. I miss the baboons. I hope they are OK. Mark Butler has a few things to say to Keith Pitt this morning: This morning on ABC Breakfast, resources minister Keith Pitt, in response to a question about the government\u2019s $4m coal feasibility study, said: \u201cI\u2019m technology agnostic \u2013 if you look at HELE coal, super critical boilers combined with CCS \u2013 that is a 90% reduction on emissions from legacy brown coal power stations around the country. \u201cSo if we want to take the opportunity to look at this with open minds I think there are opportunities for building further power stations right around the country , and we need them.\u201d Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated the cost of a HELE power station with CCS as $352/Mwh. In comparison, Snowy Hydro are selling dispatchable renewables for $70/Mwh. And the government has itself a target of wholesale price at $70/Mwh. Not to mention the fact that any serious research and development into CCS technology was scrapped by this government\u2019s cut of $400m and effective abolition of the carbon capture and storage flagships program. Reuven Rivlin to Scott Morrison: We appreciate your welcome and we must say, the appreciation comes from the bottom of our hearts because we know that when you are blessing us and hosting us, you are doing it from the bottom of your heart. And I must say to you, Mr Prime Minister, Australia is a great friend of Israel, a real great friend. Once upon a time we used to say the firm relationship of Israel is based on three principles: the relationship with the United States, second, not necessarily as important, the relationship with the United States, and the last but not least, the relationship with the United States. Now, it\u2019s not only that. It\u2019s the relationship between United States and Australia. Really, the relationship and friendship Australia comes out of the relation between people, between, really, sharing the same values that we are sharing. You are ambassador in Jerusalem, I know Tel Aviv, but Israel is very small. I think it is very close to Jerusalem. I must say, we really salute Australians for what they have done and what they are doing just now. For example, the ICC, the ICC is a real \u2013 you are a beacon. You are a beacon to show people all around and understand. The Israeli army are the soldiers of our sons and daughters. And our grandsons and granddaughters. The army of Israel is the army to defend our homes and to keep Israel as a really safe haven to everyone, but we would like to live in democracy and harmony. Israel has been defined as a Jewish state, nevertheless it is a democratic one. It is a Jewish democratic state as much as it is a democratic Jewish state. And I know you appreciate that and all of your government, and I know how we appreciate that. And you are standing behind us once the political ideas of people who are taking part in the international organisations \u2013 very much cleared by you and your prime minister \u2013 saying there is no way to end date Israel once we\u2019re talking about the unification of his, not only the duty of Israel, the right of Israel to protect its citizens and people who are living with us. Scott Morrison to Reuven Rivlin: Australia and Israel have a great friendship, and it\u2019s a friendship between people, a friendship that has been born out of deep respect and empathy for the struggles that Israel has faced. At Israel\u2019s Jewish people\u2019s worst times, Australia has been there, and will always be there to support the Jewish people. And the state of Israel as well. And my recent remarks, our position has been very strong when it comes to defending the great democracy that is the state of Israel. A beacon in an area where democracy is something that is not as widespread, but certainly the freedom of the press and stridency of the judiciary and all of these great principles and values that underpin freedom I what the state of Israel stands for. So it is a very easy, very comfortable, very relaxed relationship that rests in I think deep affection and also one that rests in a deep sharing of values and beliefs about what\u2019s important. So it\u2019s a great honour to have you here, particularly someone not only of your very high office, but someone of your esteemed background and contribution. This is not the news anyone wants, given how much more fragile things got in the months after. And Jim Chalmer\u2019s response: This country is crying out for economic leadership and for an economic plan and Scott Morrison is either unwilling or unable to provide either of those things. Morrison and Frydenberg had no plan before the coronavirus, they have no plan now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had disappointing growth, stagnant wages, record household debt, more than doubled public debt, and extraordinarily weak productivity and business investment. The government needs to come up with a plan. They need to provide economic leadership which has been lacking for so long now. They shouldn\u2019t be pretending in their seventh year of government that all of this economic weakness is somehow the product of coronavirus which hit in recent weeks. The country is crying out for leadership and a plan and Scott Morrison is unwilling or unable to provide either. For those wondering why Labor is going so hard on this, given the outside factors, just remember that Chalmers was in Wayne Swan\u2019s office when the GFC hit and how then Coalition opposition responded. There was no leeway there for not being able to deliver a surplus in the midst of the greatest economic challenge since the Great Depression. And there will be none here. Here is some of what Josh Frydenberg has been saying during his \u201clowering expectations tour\u201d rounds (from AAP): \u201cBut I do know that this is going to hit the economy, and I do know that our focus has been, in relation to the fires and other shocks that we\u2019ve faced, on getting the support to the community in need,\u201d he told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s been our primary focus, not the surplus.\u201d He noted the government had already notched up an achievement in delivering the first balanced budget in 11 years, at the same time as it rolled out tax cuts. \u201cWe\u2019re back in balance, and no one can ever take that away from us,\u201d he told ABC Radio National. The treasurer was also coy when asked whether a recession could be on its way. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the word I would use,\u201d before noting he\u2019s waiting to see the figures from the December and March quarters. Frydenberg stressed this was just the latest economic shock the Australian economy has faced, following trade tensions between the US and China, an extended drought, bushfires and floods. The virus is also a shock beyond our control, he said. Non-government senators are still taking up the government business time in the Senate. It\u2019s up to two hours now. James McGrath is only 45 years old. That would make him Gen X. But quotes like this: How would it be unethical for a political party to say write to the over 65s to say this is what we\u2019re doing with the pension and to the person under the age of 21 to say this is what we\u2019re doing with ... I don\u2019t know, under 21 issues, whatever they are.\u201d He is displaying BIG boomer energy. Proving, once and for all, that boomer is a frame of mind. Caroline Fisher told the electoral committee that there was \u201ca lot of concern\u201d around political advertising and campaigning that was \u201cless than honest, and very dubious\u201d including Labor\u2019s Mediscare campaign in 2016 and the anti-Labor \u201ctax scare campaign\u201d in 2019. Fisher said while there was \u201clittle evidence of international interference\u201d in the election \u2013 there were questionable claims made by political parties and \u201cthe outcome of the election seems to indicate it did have an impact\u201d. Labor then pursued a line of questioning about micro-targeting of voters through social media ads, which Fisher suggests may not be \u201cethical\u201d because it allows parties to target people\u2019s particular prejudices without giving everyone the same information. JSCEM chair, James McGrath, speaks in defence of micro-targeting, noting different groups of voters have different interests. He said: How would it be unethical for a political party to say write to the over 65s to say this is what we\u2019re doing with the pension and to the person under the age of 21 to say this is what we\u2019re doing with ... I don\u2019t know, under 21 issues, whatever they are.\u201d Perhaps he should ask the youth minister Richard Colbeck for an example of a youth issue. He sounded *this close* to saying skate parks. The joint standing committee on electoral matters has a hearing in Canberra examining whether fake news played a role in the 2019 election. Caroline Fisher, from the News and Media Research Centre, said Australians are the \u201clightest\u201d consumers of news in the world: Almost half of all Australians only get news once a day or less. Two thirds are concerned if news is fake but only one third did any fact checking. 60% are interested in news but only one third in politics \u2013 meaning 65% said they had no to low interest in politics. Fisher said that \u201cof most concern\u201d is the fact that those who don\u2019t know their political orientation and aren\u2019t interested in politics do not engage in fact-checking. She said: \u201cThese less engaged consumers are more likely to be female, younger and less educated. In an environment of tainted information, they fact-check the least. This group is possibly aligned with undecided voters, and if so they are voting based on the fewest news sources. This represents a significant population of disengaged voters, who are more vulnerable to misinformation.\u201d Michael Jensen, associate professor at the University of Canberra, said he did not see evidence of \u201csizeable or sustained effort by Russia or China to sway the Australian federal election\u201d. For Russia, there was \u201clittle difference\u201d between the Coalition and Labor to their strategic interests. For China, there was \u201cclear evidence the CCP is opposed to this government and believe it is especially hostile to its interests\u201d. He cited an article in propaganda outlet the Global Times that Labor \u201cmight change Australia\u2019s attitude to Washington and be more favourable to Beijing\u201d. But China did not intervene, he said, perhaps because it was a high-risk low-reward proposition, and perhaps because they believed Labor would win anyway. Jensen said both are engage in political interference on particular issues including in favour of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and Huawei\u2019s involvement in the 5G network; and for Russia, in undermining faith in institutions generally. Today is going really, really well for everyone. Michael McCormack continues his attempts at a personality. Here he was this morning. Honestly. Four-day-old oats have more appeal: A surplus is a number that I know that is in important to get the books back in balance and that is what we have done. Labor, well, they wouldn\u2019t know what the definition of a surplus was, they haven\u2019t produced one since 1989 when Cher was singing If I Could Turn Back Time, of course we all remember that vision of her on that navy ship, and there you go again, Labor didn\u2019t even build a navy ship and they had six years, six years of opportunity, didn\u2019t give a ship, didn\u2019t give a ship at all, about making sure that we built the infrastructure to increase defence capability. If Labor could only turn back time who knows what might happen.\u201d But we also get a sportsball (that\u2019s what the people like, right? Sportsball) reference, when asked if the surplus is sunk. I don\u2019t believe so, and you\u2019ll have to wait until May. It\u2019s like suggesting that Hawthorn\u2019s not going to win the premiership and it\u2019s only February. I am hoping that Hawthorn will win the premiership, they\u2019ve lost a trial game the other day, you know, it\u2019s early day.\u201d So, obviously, Hawthorn is now cancelled. And I don\u2019t just say that as a Collingwood supporter. Anyways, Matt Canavan then turned up and the Curb Your Enthusiasm music began playing in all our heads: (apologies Melbournites for the extra e. I am tired. And now obviously hate Hawthorn) I can\u2019t imagine that the extradition of Malka Leifer won\u2019t come up in some way today. Josh Burns and Dave Shama are on a bipartisan unity ticket when it comes to this, pushing for Leifer\u2019s return in order to face the abuse allegations levelled agains her. Everyone is allowed to be aspirational apparently, except for the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, when it comes to looking at carbon neutrality, says the man who is somehow the nation\u2019s deputy prime minister and supposed advocate for farmers. Here he is this morning, as reported by AAP: Nationals leader Michael McCormack has cast aspersions on the farming sector\u2019s aims to cut emissions over the next decade. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation has had a policy for almost two years for the sector to be \u201ctrending towards carbon neutrality by 2030\u201d. Its 2030 roadmap also says Australia could become a global leader in low-emissions agriculture, although cautions a poor policy response \u201ccould saddle farm businesses with additional costs\u201d. The move towards carbon neutrality has been seized by Labor to back its commitment to bring Australia down to net zero emissions by 2050. But the deputy prime minister is sceptical about the NFF aims. \u201cTrending towards and actually achieving might be two different things,\u201d McCormack told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cWhat the Nationals support is jobs in regional Australia and jobs in agriculture.\u201d Asked whether he backed the NFF\u2019s plans, he said only that it was aspirational. \u201cIt\u2019s aspirational by the NFF, good on them, and I support Fiona Simson and what the NFF stand for,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact remains we want to make sure we grow agriculture.\u201d Unless of course, we need water for irrigators. Or if a mine needs to go in a food bowl. It\u2019s so difficult being a Nat these days. In case you haven\u2019t seen it yet, Anne Davies has this story this morning: The federal government is spending up to $2m buying water from Queensland agribusiness Eastern Australia Agriculture in a bid to keep an internationally significant wetlands from dying, despite paying $80m to the same company three years ago for water rights for the same purpose. The $80m purchase of overland flows from Eastern Australia Agriculture has been controversial and is now under scrutiny by Australian National Audit Office. Secret Nationals business, as captured by Mike Bowers. Here is what Zali Steggall was seeing when she tweeted asking where the government MPs were. Keith Pitt on ABC Breakfast this morning, once again talking about the government\u2019s technology roadmap. No one is really clear on what that actually means just yet, but it\u2019s something to do with the technology the government is looking at for energy security moving forward. Anyways, Pitt has discovered the word commitment and he\u2019s not afraid to use it. We made a commitment internationally. We will meet our commitment. We took that proposal to the election. I\u2019m a member of the government. I support what we are doing. We took a balanced proposition, it was accepted by the Australian people at the election. They clearly rejected what was put forward by then Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten. Although I see Mr Anthony Albanese has decided he wants to head down the same track, uncosted an unplanned targets. I don\u2019t think people will fall for it. We\u2019re looking at a technology road map as you know. We\u2019re looking for opportunities into the future. I\u2019m sure those shareholding ministers that have responsibility for that area will be making statements later in the year. But right now we\u2019re committed to 2030. We\u2019ll deliver on our commitments, we\u2019ll do what we said we would. We have taken a balanced proposition to the Australian and it has been accepted. Up to $4 million for the feasible study. It was an election commitment. We deliver on our election commitments. And feasibility studies determine feasibility, that\u2019s what they\u2019re for. As an engineer I wait to see the results. The Greens senator Janet Rice is up in the Senate, chasing the Phil Gaetjens report into the sports rort affair. The government once again came back with a public interest immunity claim to avoid having to bring in the report (they have declared it cabinet in-confidence, despite previous reports like this being made public) so non-government senators are now taking up the government\u2019s business time this morning. Depending on how many senators join in, the government could lose a couple of hours of business time here. Rice\u2019s motion: Mr President I give notice that on the next day of sitting, I shall move: (1) That there be laid on the table by the minister representing the prime minister, by no later than 7:20pm on Tuesday 25 February 2020, the final report provided by the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Phillip Gaetjens, to the prime minister in relation to the application of the statement of ministerial standards to the former minister for sport\u2019s award of funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure Program. 2) In the event the minister fails to table the report, the Senate requires the minister representing the prime minister to attend the Senate on Wednesday 26 February 2020, prior to government business being called on, to provide an explanation, of no more than 10 minutes, of the government\u2019s failure to table the report. (3) Any senator may move to take note of the explanation required by paragraph (2). (4) Any motion under paragraph (3) shall have precedence over all government business until determined, and senators may speak to the motion for not more than 10 minutes each. ....SQUIRREL! This issue has come off the boiler \u2013 but will no doubt start ticking away again when a distraction is needed. Even though it seems like 600 days ago, it was only yesterday that Peter Dutton defined \u201cleftwing terrorism\u201d as Islamic terrorism, for reasons only he can explain \u2013 but won\u2019t. In the midst of that word vomit, you may have missed this from Katharine Murphy: While the debate about false equivalence played out in public, Guardian Australia has also confirmed that one of the minister\u2019s advisers cited the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion as an example of a troublesome leftwing organisation during a telephone conversation with a member of the public who sought to query Dutton\u2019s controversial intervention in the debate. Matthew Noel, an engineering student from New South Wales, says he rang Dutton\u2019s ministerial office in Canberra on Tuesday morning. Noel says he telephoned to try to establish exactly who the minister was referring to when he raised the spectre of leftwing terrorism. The student says he spoke to an adviser who identified himself as Mark. Noel says the adviser over the course of the call identified the group Extinction Rebellion as an example of leftwing terrorism. Noel says he said to the adviser: \u201cAre you saying Extinction Rebellion are a terrorist group? [The adviser] replied, yes.\u201d Dutton\u2019s office has confirmed the call took place. But a spokeswoman disputes some of Noel\u2019s recollection of the conversation. Dutton\u2019s spokeswoman told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe allegation that a member of staff nominated Extinction Rebellion as an example of a leftwing terror group is completely false. \u201cWhen asked by the caller, the staff member advised that the group is an example of a leftwing extremist group, not a terrorist group.\u201d Asked whether the adviser was reflecting the minister\u2019s view during the conversation, the spokeswoman said: \u201cThe minister does not believe this group is a leftwing terror organisation.\u201d Parliament starts at 9.30am this morning. Just in case anyone was wondering. Resources minister Keith Pitt was asked what the problem with a net zero 2050 target was, while speaking to ABC TV this morning. The fact that he didn\u2019t outright slam it, is very telling. We\u2019re looking at a technology road map, as you know. We\u2019re looking for opportunities into the future and I\u2019m sure those shareholding ministers that have responsibility for that area will be making statements later in the year. But right new we\u2019re committed to 2030. We\u2019ll deliver on our commitments. We\u2019ll do what we said we would. We have taken a balanced proposition to the Australian people and it\u2019s been accepted. It\u2019s not just Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 facing the reality of climate change is something more and more of Australia\u2019s sectors are turning their mind to. Someone who is enjoying the treasurer\u2019s discomfort though, is his shadow counterpart and former adviser to Wayne Swan, Jim Chalmers. Speaking about Josh Frydenberg\u2019s Fran Kelly interview this morning, Chalmers could barely contain his glee: \u201cJosh Frydenberg\u2019s interview on radio this morning had all of the coherence of a Sydney baboon rampage.\u201d Josh Frydenberg\u2019s \u201cmanaging expectations\u201d tour has continued. He has been on Sky News, ABC radio and Sydney radio 2GB today. After spending the better part of the last eight years smashing up Wayne Swan for promising a series of surpluses and then failing deliver (because of that little thing called the global financial crisis), the Morrison government is attempting to get out ahead of it\u2019s own potential failure by reminding everyone they can find that the world economy is under quite a bit of pressure. If the surplus disappears, which, Frydenberg and Scott Morrison\u2019s language makes clear is a real possibility, given the bushfires, drought and now coronavirus impacts, it\u2019s a little more embarrassing given there was an entire advertising campaign dedicated to moody, slightly smug, black and white portraits of the government\u2019s leaders declaring the budget was BACK IN BLACK. There are coffee mugs. MUGS. There was the \u201cI said we brought the budget back to surplus next year.\u201d So what does Frydenberg say to that? \u201cWe\u2019re back in balance and no one can ever take that away from us,\u201d the treasurer told ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly. \u201cI made a very clear statement based on the best advice available to us knowing that Australia is now living within its means.\u201d We\u2019ve got to stop this false debate, this misleading debate about whether getting to net zero emissions by 2050 ... is something that\u2019s optional. Well, I suppose it is optional, but it\u2019s an option you don\u2019t want to miss, because if we do miss it we know what the consequences are. The fires of this last summer will seem like a very, very mild experience compared to what a 3C [warmer] world will look like.\u201d That\u2019s Malcolm Turnbull there, as reported by David Crowe in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, speaking to an energy executive conference in Sydney yesterday. The former PM, who was dumped by his party over energy and climate policy, is now leaving it all on the floor. After a tweet storm on Sunday during Insiders: Turnbull is now taking every opportunity to remind people of what the cost of inaction is. As Crowe reports: There is no economic case for building a new coal-fired power station in Australia anymore, regardless what you think about carbon policy \u2013 and everyone in the energy sector knows that. But if you read the News Limited newspapers and listen to debates in Canberra, it\u2019s a parallel universe. As to the future of the coal industry, we should all hope that thermal coal is going to go out of business, not just in Australia but around the world. Because if it doesn\u2019t, and we\u2019re still burning coal to generate energy in 30 or 40 years, we\u2019re moving into a 3C environment, which is catastrophic.\u201d Meanwhile, Josh Frydenberg is having to explain how he is not embarrassed about the government getting so excited about the possibility of a surplus it launched a \u201cback in black\u201d advertising campaign \u2013 and $35 souvenir mug \u2013 when it is looking increasingly likely the surplus is gone, and avoiding negative growth will be lineball. We\u2019ll bring you that, and everything else as it happens. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp as well as a one coffee me. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

The tax and spending thinktank said the government was on-track to ramp up borrowing to about \u00a363bn next year \u2013 \u00a323bn more than the most recent official forecasts \u2013 amid a rapid increase in spending under Boris Johnson. Delivering a warning to the chancellor ahead of the 11 March budget, the IFS said the Tories would probably break their election pledge to balance day-to-day government spending with tax income by the middle of the current parliament. Sunak is expected to come under pressure from No 10 to tear-up the fiscal rules that were devised ahead of the snap December election by his predecessor, Sajid Javid. Even ahead of the budget, the IFS warned: \u201cIt is not clear that the manifesto pledge to target current budget balance three years out would be met even under current policy.\u201d Calling on the chancellor to fund the increase in spending with tax rises, the IFS warned the alternative was to continue the intense pressure applied to Whitehall departments during the austerity drive of the past decade. Despite rising expectations for an increase in funding to begin the long process of mending the public sector after a decade of austerity, the thinktank warned that the long period of cuts had made a lasting impact. It said returning departmental spending to 2010 levels after adjusting for inflation \u2013 excluding the NHS, which had been protected \u2013 would require an additional \u00a354bn funding settlement, it added. Paul Johnson, director at the IFS, urged the chancellor to raise taxes. Sunak could abolish entrepreneurs relief, which costs \u00a32.3bn and only benefits as few as 5,000 individuals, while also reforming council tax to increase charges on the most expensive homes in the country. He added: \u201cWe have already had 16 fiscal targets in a decade, and fiscal targets should not just be for Christmas.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.

      "body": "<p>When I was a kid I loved to dance. Anywhere. I danced in the street, on my way to school, in the local shop and at the back of the smoke-filled bingo hall where I tagged along every Thursday night with a neighbour.</p> <p>I was seven or eight when I asked my mum and dad if I could go to dance lessons. Someday, maybe, they told me. There just wasn\u2019t the money for luxuries like that. I couldn\u2019t let it go, so when I heard disco-dancing classes had started for 10p every Tuesday night at the church hall, there was no stopping me. It was exactly the amount I got in pocket money on a Friday when my dad came home from working on the building site. Each week until my early teens I walked the mile to the church hall where I handed it over and danced my heart out for 90 minutes.</p> <p>Peggy said I was good, that I should enter the regional disco-dancing championships. I ran home to tell my mum, who was peeling a bag of potatoes in the living room as she watched the TV, with a baby and a toddler. My other siblings were out in the street playing.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, love,\u201d Mum said, \u201cwe just can\u2019t afford it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only 50p to enter,\u201d I countered, but she said nothing and looked back with sad eyes.</p> <p>A week later I won \u00a31.50 at the bingo. I gave my parents a pound and kept the rest. That Saturday I put on my best red blouse under the denim dungarees I practically lived in but which were an inch too short, and laced up my one pair of decent shoes after polishing the toes and began the three-mile walk in the rain to the other end of the city. I\u2019d never been to that side of town with its big houses and manicured gardens. It was like another world.</p> <p>The convention centre was vast. Groups of girls began piling in, giggling and sparkling in the most incredible outfits I had ever laid eyes on. A posse of mothers followed the girls, all carrying little pink-coloured cases.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve been pitied by more financially fortunate people, the undercurrent of shame stayed with me for a long time'</p> <footer> <cite>Mary O'Hara</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I approached the long table at the front of the room, my hair still wet from the rain, where I handed over my 50p entrance fee and a middle-aged man gave me a white, square piece of paper with the number 11 on it. </p> <p>Girls, clucking loudly and preening, raced to the floor and took up spaces. One by one they edged me towards the back. Mothers stared at me from the sidelines. </p> <p>That was the first time I felt the sting of other people\u2019s pity and when I realised, on a visceral level, that being from a poor background came (though I certainly hadn\u2019t heard of the concept yet) with a stigma attached to it. Being poor or \u201con welfare\u201d was a source of shame.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/uk-live-poverty-charity-joseph-rowntree-foundation\">Number of people in poverty in working families hits record high</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other incidents followed. Like realising our first home, where I lived until the age of seven, was nothing short of a slum: eight of us slept in two tiny, damp bedrooms. The house was overrun with rats; there was no bathroom, indoor toilet or central heating; and the kitchen was a makeshift scullery with a plastic corrugated roof. Having a fridge or washing machine was unimaginable. My mum kept it immaculately clean and looking as nice as possible, but there\u2019s only so much makeup you can put on a pig.</p> <p>Later my dad became unemployed and had to claim the \u201cdole\u201d for long periods of time. Even within a community where many people were in the same situation, this was a source of humiliation: relying on state assistance to get by was seen by some as a sign of parental failure. While we had enough food to mostly meet our daily needs (we had to borrow from neighbours when things got really tight), occasional treats were often paid for by going into debt with loan sharks. Although we were far from unusual \u2013 west Belfast, which was also one of the main flashpoints during Northern Ireland\u2019s sectarian conflict in the 1970s and 1980s, was among the most deprived areas in the whole of western Europe \u2013 I hated how much we had to struggle and how much shame there was in not being able to afford what others could.</p> <p>Like most poorer families \u2013 and this is true today \u2013 we lived our lives in the poorer parts of town. We didn\u2019t have middle-class friends. But, when I first began to understand that we were looked down upon or pitied by many more financially fortunate people, the undercurrent of shame stayed with me for a long time. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/09/how-poverty-has-become-the-scourge-of-those-in-work\">Why poverty has become the scourge of those in work | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyone who has grown up poor will have similar stories to tell: those small or large experiences or encounters that force you to register that your family is not just lacking in material things (as hard as that may be), but that as a kid you are set apart from other children. If you have never lived on the breadline, it\u2019s probably difficult to grasp, for example, that for many people, no matter how hard they work at their minimum-wage precarious job/s, they just never have enough to make the rent, eat nutritious food every day, or buy a much-needed new pair of shoes for their kids, or a warm winter coat. You might not have thought about what it feels like to have no choice but to swallow your pride and go to a food bank to stock up on essentials because you don\u2019t qualify for state assistance \u2013 or what you do qualify for falls far short of what you actually need to survive and help you get back on your feet. Yet, every single day, people all over the US and the UK live with the gross injustice that is being poor and with the humiliation of being blamed for circumstances beyond their control.

I didn\u2019t. I was a beneficiary of the welfare state. It might not have been perfect, but it was a safety net. I had access to good council housing from the age of seven, and to free healthcare and free school meals. And I had teachers who passionately advocated for the rights of children growing up in poverty and encouraged us to believe in ourselves and to challenge anyone or any system that tried to tell us we were undeserving.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/11/universal-credit-could-steamroll-vulnerable-into-poverty-salvation-army\">Universal credit could 'steamroll vulnerable into poverty'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have learned a great deal about the structural causes and consequences of poverty and inequality while researching and writing The Shame Game. <a href=\"https://www.projecttwistit.com/\" title=\"\">Project Twist-It</a> is a platform I created for people with experiences of poverty to share their stories, and for advocacy groups to highlight their work fighting poverty. There are too many to name here but they include people working with organisations such as <a href=\"https://atd-uk.org/about-us/atd-fourth-world-uk/\" title=\"\">ATD Fourth World</a> in the US and UK and <a href=\"https://www.poverty2solutions.org/\" title=\"\">Poverty2Solutions</a> in the UK, formerly homeless female campaigners in the US and army veterans, food-bank volunteers, and artists, writers and musicians. </p> <p>What we have to say matters. We can make a difference. I have come to understand how we might build a new narrative that helps address the structural causes of poverty and steers us towards a greater consensus on how we can tackle the inequality that holds us back. As one of the many contributors to Project Twist-It, teacher and artist Janet Owen Driggs, put it: \u2018\u201cWe need to identify the narratives that underpin structural inequality and consider how they keep us swirling, applauding and, too often, drowning. And we need to tell each other about possible futures.\u201d</p> <p>Extreme poverty and inequality in America and Britain are the result of a political choice that is causing millions to suffer \u2013 but neither is inevitable and they are fixable. Bad narratives underpin and enable bad policy. We saw that all too clearly when austerity was rolled out across the UK after the financial crisis. So, we need to construct a new narrative; one that reflects the reality of people\u2019s lives, not an imagined one-dimensional \u201cscrounger\u201d or \u201cskiver\u201d. And we need a narrative that starts from the premise that all of us have the right to live with dignity and without impoverishment. The dominant poverty narrative, as the US scholar Chuck Collins so succinctly puts it \u2013 that we are where we economically deserve to be \u2013 has deep roots.</p> <p>From politics to the media and the wider culture, it is entrenched and it will be no easy task to overcome. However, I have observed a growing impetus for change. An important way to begin to dent the narrative is by elevating the voices and stories of those of us with experience. As one of the figureheads of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign in the US, the Rev Dr William Barber II told me: \u201cWe have to shift the narrative. But you can\u2019t do this without shifting the narrators.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 This is an edited extract from The Shame Game by Mary O\u2019Hara (Policy Press, \u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "When I was a kid I loved to dance. Anywhere. I danced in the street, on my way to school, in the local shop and at the back of the smoke-filled bingo hall where I tagged along every Thursday night with a neighbour. I was seven or eight when I asked my mum and dad if I could go to dance lessons. Someday, maybe, they told me. There just wasn\u2019t the money for luxuries like that. I couldn\u2019t let it go, so when I heard disco-dancing classes had started for 10p every Tuesday night at the church hall, there was no stopping me. It was exactly the amount I got in pocket money on a Friday when my dad came home from working on the building site. Each week until my early teens I walked the mile to the church hall where I handed it over and danced my heart out for 90 minutes. Peggy said I was good, that I should enter the regional disco-dancing championships. I ran home to tell my mum, who was peeling a bag of potatoes in the living room as she watched the TV, with a baby and a toddler. My other siblings were out in the street playing. \u201cSorry, love,\u201d Mum said, \u201cwe just can\u2019t afford it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only 50p to enter,\u201d I countered, but she said nothing and looked back with sad eyes. A week later I won \u00a31.50 at the bingo. I gave my parents a pound and kept the rest. That Saturday I put on my best red blouse under the denim dungarees I practically lived in but which were an inch too short, and laced up my one pair of decent shoes after polishing the toes and began the three-mile walk in the rain to the other end of the city. I\u2019d never been to that side of town with its big houses and manicured gardens. It was like another world. The convention centre was vast. Groups of girls began piling in, giggling and sparkling in the most incredible outfits I had ever laid eyes on. A posse of mothers followed the girls, all carrying little pink-coloured cases. I approached the long table at the front of the room, my hair still wet from the rain, where I handed over my 50p entrance fee and a middle-aged man gave me a white, square piece of paper with the number 11 on it. Girls, clucking loudly and preening, raced to the floor and took up spaces. One by one they edged me towards the back. Mothers stared at me from the sidelines. That was the first time I felt the sting of other people\u2019s pity and when I realised, on a visceral level, that being from a poor background came (though I certainly hadn\u2019t heard of the concept yet) with a stigma attached to it. Being poor or \u201con welfare\u201d was a source of shame. Other incidents followed. Like realising our first home, where I lived until the age of seven, was nothing short of a slum: eight of us slept in two tiny, damp bedrooms. The house was overrun with rats; there was no bathroom, indoor toilet or central heating; and the kitchen was a makeshift scullery with a plastic corrugated roof. Having a fridge or washing machine was unimaginable. My mum kept it immaculately clean and looking as nice as possible, but there\u2019s only so much makeup you can put on a pig. Later my dad became unemployed and had to claim the \u201cdole\u201d for long periods of time. Even within a community where many people were in the same situation, this was a source of humiliation: relying on state assistance to get by was seen by some as a sign of parental failure. While we had enough food to mostly meet our daily needs (we had to borrow from neighbours when things got really tight), occasional treats were often paid for by going into debt with loan sharks. Although we were far from unusual \u2013 west Belfast, which was also one of the main flashpoints during Northern Ireland\u2019s sectarian conflict in the 1970s and 1980s, was among the most deprived areas in the whole of western Europe \u2013 I hated how much we had to struggle and how much shame there was in not being able to afford what others could. Like most poorer families \u2013 and this is true today \u2013 we lived our lives in the poorer parts of town. We didn\u2019t have middle-class friends. But, when I first began to understand that we were looked down upon or pitied by many more financially fortunate people, the undercurrent of shame stayed with me for a long time. Anyone who has grown up poor will have similar stories to tell: those small or large experiences or encounters that force you to register that your family is not just lacking in material things (as hard as that may be), but that as a kid you are set apart from other children. If you have never lived on the breadline, it\u2019s probably difficult to grasp, for example, that for many people, no matter how hard they work at their minimum-wage precarious job/s, they just never have enough to make the rent, eat nutritious food every day, or buy a much-needed new pair of shoes for their kids, or a warm winter coat. You might not have thought about what it feels like to have no choice but to swallow your pride and go to a food bank to stock up on essentials because you don\u2019t qualify for state assistance \u2013 or what you do qualify for falls far short of what you actually need to survive and help you get back on your feet. Yet, every single day, people all over the US and the UK live with the gross injustice that is being poor and with the humiliation of being blamed for circumstances beyond their control. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. It really doesn\u2019t. Being poor is not inevitable or due to personal flaws. From a distance, my story could be construed as someone who \u201cpulled themselves up by their bootstraps\u201d and escaped poverty. I didn\u2019t. I was a beneficiary of the welfare state. It might not have been perfect, but it was a safety net. I had access to good council housing from the age of seven, and to free healthcare and free school meals. And I had teachers who passionately advocated for the rights of children growing up in poverty and encouraged us to believe in ourselves and to challenge anyone or any system that tried to tell us we were undeserving. I have learned a great deal about the structural causes and consequences of poverty and inequality while researching and writing The Shame Game. Project Twist-It is a platform I created for people with experiences of poverty to share their stories, and for advocacy groups to highlight their work fighting poverty. There are too many to name here but they include people working with organisations such as ATD Fourth World in the US and UK and Poverty2Solutions in the UK, formerly homeless female campaigners in the US and army veterans, food-bank volunteers, and artists, writers and musicians. What we have to say matters. We can make a difference. I have come to understand how we might build a new narrative that helps address the structural causes of poverty and steers us towards a greater consensus on how we can tackle the inequality that holds us back. As one of the many contributors to Project Twist-It, teacher and artist Janet Owen Driggs, put it: \u2018\u201cWe need to identify the narratives that underpin structural inequality and consider how they keep us swirling, applauding and, too often, drowning. And we need to tell each other about possible futures.\u201d Extreme poverty and inequality in America and Britain are the result of a political choice that is causing millions to suffer \u2013 but neither is inevitable and they are fixable. Bad narratives underpin and enable bad policy. We saw that all too clearly when austerity was rolled out across the UK after the financial crisis. So, we need to construct a new narrative; one that reflects the reality of people\u2019s lives, not an imagined one-dimensional \u201cscrounger\u201d or \u201cskiver\u201d. And we need a narrative that starts from the premise that all of us have the right to live with dignity and without impoverishment. The dominant poverty narrative, as the US scholar Chuck Collins so succinctly puts it \u2013 that we are where we economically deserve to be \u2013 has deep roots. From politics to the media and the wider culture, it is entrenched and it will be no easy task to overcome. However, I have observed a growing impetus for change. An important way to begin to dent the narrative is by elevating the voices and stories of those of us with experience. As one of the figureheads of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign in the US, the Rev Dr William Barber II told me: \u201cWe have to shift the narrative. But you can\u2019t do this without shifting the narrators.\u201d \u2022 This is an edited extract from The Shame Game by Mary O\u2019Hara (Policy Press, \u00a312.99).

Yet, because they don\u2019t depend on return trade, they treat their audiences abysmally.\u201d She mentions the Tina Turner musical at the Aldwych, with its prominent signs requesting that punters refrain from singing and dancing. \u201cYou walk in and they\u2019re already telling you: no. To a 15-year-old kid making their first visit to a real theatre, that\u2019s extremely off-putting.\u201d</p> <p>Small fringe theatres with an insider vibe are also problematic, she says. \u201cYou\u2019re like, am I <em>allowed</em> to be here?\u201d The warmest welcome? That was at the tiny Pentameters in Hampstead. Leonie Scott-Matthews, who has run the theatre since 1968, \u201cgrabs on to you the moment you walk through the door, establishes you\u2019re a newbie and looks after you through the whole thing.

People of colour often report a visit to the theatre as an unwelcoming thicket of microaggressions (and, occasionally, overt aggression): ignored at the box office, scrutinised by ushers, finding themselves the subject of complaints about everything from big hair to exuberant laughter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Just saying that it's OK to be late, to move around, to make a noise, puts everyone at ease</p> <footer> <cite>Tarek Iskander, BAC</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While theatres struggle to rethink their cultures, it\u2019s often left to initiatives such as Tobi Kyeremateng\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.blacktheatrelive.co.uk/news/black-ticket-project-creating-opportunities-for-young-black-people-to-access-theatre\">Black Ticket Project,</a> which gives cheap or free tickets to young black people, to crack open intimidating spaces.

I think that\u2019s where the GC came about.\u201d It may seem difficult to tell the GC and Collins apart, but for her the differences are clear. \u201cI try not to bring any attention to myself. I like to cook, I like nature, I like to read. I do like to shop, don\u2019t get me wrong, every now and then. I like a good day out in London, but, yeah, they are two very different people \u2013 massively.\u201d Her close friends, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t even ask about the GC.

Her partner, James Argent \u2013 known as Arg \u2013 also appeared on Towie and his problems with addiction have featured in gossip columns in recent years. A few weeks after we meet, Collins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/missgemcollins/status/1229056428855435264\">posts on Twitter</a> about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-the-sparky-presenters-death-is-a-stomach-churning-shock\" title=\"\">the tragic death of the Love Island host Caroline Flack</a>, commenting on her own experience of being \u201cpersonally hounded\u201d by a tabloid reporter.</p> <p>When we speak on the phone a few days later, Collins says that she has hardly stopped thinking about Flack. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one knows exactly what went on, but it did affect me, because I remember a time when a reporter hounded me every three hours \u2013 it was like they hated me. It\u2019s easy for someone to say: \u2018Ignore it, it will go away tomorrow,\u2019 but it can have huge implications on a person, and a lot of time what [the papers are] saying isn\u2019t true.\u201d She sighs. \u201cThe press is a double-edged sword in this industry, but I hope everyone is going to be a lot more mindful and respectful regarding celebrities \u2013 we\u2019re doing a job.\u201d She thinks that perhaps it\u2019s time for \u201ca rethink\u201d where Love Island is concerned. \u201cOr maybe they should pull it off air. They\u2019ve had three people pass \u2013 it\u2019s got a taint over it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember a time when a reporter hounded me every three hours \u2013 it was like they hated me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now 39, Collins was working at a BMW showroom when she was approached about appearing on Towie. She had always been a performer; she went to the highly competitive Sylvia Young theatre school in London in her teens, where alumni include Amy Winehouse and Rita Ora. Even so, she thought the offer to join the nascent reality show was a wind-up. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my 30th birthday and the producers called me up and said: \u2018We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a right character; will you come into the office?\u2019 I thought someone was messing about, so I put the phone down twice. The third time, they said: \u2018Gemma, we\u2019re not messing about; here\u2019s our email address.\u2019\u201d Collins had a hunch that this was not just any old offer. \u201cIt was like someone stood next to me and whispered in my ear: \u2018Your life is about to change.\u2019 All the hairs stood up on my neck; I was like \u2013\u201d She gasps for effect. \u201cIt was one of them moments where you\u2019re like: who was that? I\u2019m in some twilight zone.\u201d Collins is an avid proponent of \u201cangels and stuff\u201d, something she expands on via her podcast, where she has tackled subjects including \u201cWhat animal was I in a past life?\u201d, \u201cWho do I need to call to become the Illuminati?\u201d and whether houses have feelings. She says she believes in the supernatural \u201c1,000%\u201d and that a future episode of the show will involve going to a haunted house \u00e0 la <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/05/derek-acorah-obituary\" title=\"\">Derek Acorah</a>, the medium from the TV show Most Haunted, whose death in January left Collins \u201cdevastated\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps her belief in fate and destiny is a way to rationalise how she has gone from earning \u00a350 a day on Towie to amassing a fortune estimated at \u00a33m. Collins was born in Romford, on the border of London and Essex, to a working-class family \u2013 her parents, Alan and Joan, and her older brother, Russell \u2013 that she describes as \u201cvery grounded\u201d. Even now, her dad, who has watched only one episode of Towie, keeps an eye on her finances for her (\u201cHe called me last Christmas and was like: I can\u2019t believe you spent \u00a32,000 in Harrods\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1ac01d3d9b5838f14c39e5e7de108654b5765c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ac01d3d9b5838f14c39e5e7de108654b5765c6/0_615_5947_3567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018People can look down all they want, but there\u2019s a lot of successful people in Essex\u2019 ...

Gemma Collins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe was really poor growing up,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe it when I say it.\u201d She mentions an appearance on the Jonathan Ross Show last year, where she mentioned that the family didn\u2019t have a toaster in their kitchen when she was growing up. \u201cPeople sort of laughed like I was joking around, but I\u2019m not: it\u2019s the truth. My dad had to do an extra shift in the pub to put shoes on my feet. I used to go round my nan\u2019s and she\u2019d have HP sauce in the cupboard and a bit of bread \u2013 I\u2019d have an HP sauce sandwich and it was the best times ever. There wasn\u2019t luxuries.\u201d Reading between the lines, it seems to have informed Collins\u2019s relentless work ethic: as well as her boutique, she has her own perfume, Diva Pink, and <a href=\"https://www.boohoo.com/womens/looks/gemma-collins\" title=\"\">a clothing line for the</a><a href=\"https://www.boohoo.com/womens/looks/gemma-collins\" title=\"\"> retaile</a><a href=\"https://www.boohoo.com/womens/looks/gemma-collins\" title=\"\">r Boo</a><a href=\"https://www.boohoo.com/womens/looks/gemma-collins\" title=\"\">hoo</a>. She even lists her castoffs on <a href=\"https://www.depop.com/gemmacollins/\" title=\"\">the online marketplace Depop</a>; items recently for sale included a camisole from Missguided (\u00a37) and a New Look T-shirt (\u00a35).</p> <p>Collins is also far more understated than the GC when it comes to material goods. The GC, she says, would love to be \u201ccruising around in a Bentley\u201d; Collins just bought a used car (\u201cThree years old, so it had already depreciated in value\u201d) and was papped last year driving her sister-in-law\u2019s Nissan Micra (\u201cThe papers kindly said the car was worth \u00a3695 \u2013 it was more like \u00a3395\u201d). \u201cPeople just think I lay in bed every day with people fanning me down or bathing in asses\u2019 milk like Cleopatra,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case: I work, I work and I work.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder what it must be like for Collins to have two personas. Is everyday life ever overwhelming? \u201cI\u2019ve been to shopping centres before where people all start crowding round. They get excited, obviously, but when I go to the shopping centre, I\u2019m not the GC. I\u2019m just there with my mum, and then I\u2019ll have had so many selfies that I\u2019m like: shit, I\u2019ve left the shop and I\u2019ve not got what I\u2019ve needed to get. Some days I do just want to go to the market with my friends, but then people will be like: what\u2019s she doing at the market?\u201d</p> <p>She is keen to emphasise that she is always happy to interact with fans, but she thinks they can cross a line. \u201cSometimes they bark at you like a rottweiler: give us a picture, give us a picture ... all they have to say is: \u2018All right, Gem, how are you? Can I have a picture?\u2019 and I\u2019d be like: yeah, course. When they start grabbing and mauling it, it\u2019s a bit ... it\u2019s scary, you know? I would never say that to someone, or pull someone.\u201d Ever the stoic, she describes such interactions as like \u201cloading the dishwasher. It\u2019s just a part of life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af8ae927198e2cc46ecc28526a97f7981cb7df92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8ae927198e2cc46ecc28526a97f7981cb7df92/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Collins visits a doctor with Jonathan Cheban (left) for her show Gemma Collins: Diva Forever\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visiting a doctor with the reality star Jonathan Cheban <em>(left)</em> for her 2019 show Gemma Collins: Diva Forever.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Collins calls herself the \u201cunderdog\u201d of Towie \u2013 and it is easy to see why. \u201cSomeone said to me once: you know, it just don\u2019t stack up \u2013 you\u2019re the fat one, you\u2019re not the most prettiest, but you\u2019ve been the most successful,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s charming!\u201d</p> <p>Criticism of her image was one thing, but Towie also provoked a classist brand of disdain among audiences and critics alike, who reached for a decades-old cliche of Essex\u2019s inhabitants as coarse and uncultured. How did Collins react to this wave of criticism? \u201cI was very proud to come from Essex, at the end of the day,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a lot of lovely people in Essex \u2013 just look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/25/gavin-and-stacey-christmas-special-review-absolutely-crackin\" title=\"\">Gavin and Stacey</a>. People can look down all they want, but there\u2019s a lot of successful people there.\u201d She tries not to dwell on the haters: \u201cIf they\u2019ve got them awful thoughts in their head about people, what a shame for them.\u201d</p> <p>A waiter comes to get our mugs. \u201cThank you very, very, very much,\u201d she says to him, before turning to me: \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything else, do you? A biscuit or anything?\u201d As we get up to leave, she puts her slippers on \u2013 a pair of sequin Ugg boots \u2013 and asks if she can call me a taxi. \u201cAnd if you ever want anything from my shop, anything, a bottle of perfume, you just give me a call.\u201d I get the feeling I probably could.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2020.

A third headline reads: \u201cGemma Collins labelled a \u2018rude bitch\u2019 as she kicks camera crew out of shop during Diva Forever premiere,\u201d after she asked a crew filming her for a reality show to leave her Brentwood boutique. For every instance where she has been portrayed as rude or arrogant, there are another 10 headlines about her body, her weight or her fertility. \u201cGemma Collins \u2018will have a surrogate because she doesn\u2019t want to put on weight\u2019\u201d claimed one story. \u201cThere was a time where I just thought: \u2018This is all getting a bit much,\u2019\u201d she says of the tabloid coverage. \u201cI had to grow a very thick skin very fast. I think that\u2019s where the GC came about.\u201d It may seem difficult to tell the GC and Collins apart, but for her the differences are clear. \u201cI try not to bring any attention to myself. I like to cook, I like nature, I like to read. I do like to shop, don\u2019t get me wrong, every now and then. I like a good day out in London, but, yeah, they are two very different people \u2013 massively.\u201d Her close friends, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t even ask about the GC. But when my best friend drops her kids at school, people in the playground ask her: \u2018What\u2019s she like?\u2019 That\u2019s the million-dollar question that everyone wants to know. The truth is, in day-to-day life, I\u2019m just grinding like everyone else.\u201d It must be extraordinarily difficult to keep \u201cGemma Collins\u201d going in the face of a media industry that wants headlines. Her partner, James Argent \u2013 known as Arg \u2013 also appeared on Towie and his problems with addiction have featured in gossip columns in recent years. A few weeks after we meet, Collins posts on Twitter about the tragic death of the Love Island host Caroline Flack, commenting on her own experience of being \u201cpersonally hounded\u201d by a tabloid reporter. When we speak on the phone a few days later, Collins says that she has hardly stopped thinking about Flack. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one knows exactly what went on, but it did affect me, because I remember a time when a reporter hounded me every three hours \u2013 it was like they hated me. It\u2019s easy for someone to say: \u2018Ignore it, it will go away tomorrow,\u2019 but it can have huge implications on a person, and a lot of time what [the papers are] saying isn\u2019t true.\u201d She sighs. \u201cThe press is a double-edged sword in this industry, but I hope everyone is going to be a lot more mindful and respectful regarding celebrities \u2013 we\u2019re doing a job.\u201d She thinks that perhaps it\u2019s time for \u201ca rethink\u201d where Love Island is concerned. \u201cOr maybe they should pull it off air. They\u2019ve had three people pass \u2013 it\u2019s got a taint over it.\u201d Now 39, Collins was working at a BMW showroom when she was approached about appearing on Towie. She had always been a performer; she went to the highly competitive Sylvia Young theatre school in London in her teens, where alumni include Amy Winehouse and Rita Ora. Even so, she thought the offer to join the nascent reality show was a wind-up. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my 30th birthday and the producers called me up and said: \u2018We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a right character; will you come into the office?\u2019 I thought someone was messing about, so I put the phone down twice. The third time, they said: \u2018Gemma, we\u2019re not messing about; here\u2019s our email address.\u2019\u201d Collins had a hunch that this was not just any old offer. \u201cIt was like someone stood next to me and whispered in my ear: \u2018Your life is about to change.\u2019 All the hairs stood up on my neck; I was like \u2013\u201d She gasps for effect. \u201cIt was one of them moments where you\u2019re like: who was that? I\u2019m in some twilight zone.\u201d Collins is an avid proponent of \u201cangels and stuff\u201d, something she expands on via her podcast, where she has tackled subjects including \u201cWhat animal was I in a past life?\u201d, \u201cWho do I need to call to become the Illuminati?\u201d and whether houses have feelings. She says she believes in the supernatural \u201c1,000%\u201d and that a future episode of the show will involve going to a haunted house \u00e0 la Derek Acorah, the medium from the TV show Most Haunted, whose death in January left Collins \u201cdevastated\u201d. Perhaps her belief in fate and destiny is a way to rationalise how she has gone from earning \u00a350 a day on Towie to amassing a fortune estimated at \u00a33m. Collins was born in Romford, on the border of London and Essex, to a working-class family \u2013 her parents, Alan and Joan, and her older brother, Russell \u2013 that she describes as \u201cvery grounded\u201d. Even now, her dad, who has watched only one episode of Towie, keeps an eye on her finances for her (\u201cHe called me last Christmas and was like: I can\u2019t believe you spent \u00a32,000 in Harrods\u201d). \u201cWe was really poor growing up,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe it when I say it.\u201d She mentions an appearance on the Jonathan Ross Show last year, where she mentioned that the family didn\u2019t have a toaster in their kitchen when she was growing up. \u201cPeople sort of laughed like I was joking around, but I\u2019m not: it\u2019s the truth. My dad had to do an extra shift in the pub to put shoes on my feet. I used to go round my nan\u2019s and she\u2019d have HP sauce in the cupboard and a bit of bread \u2013 I\u2019d have an HP sauce sandwich and it was the best times ever. There wasn\u2019t luxuries.\u201d Reading between the lines, it seems to have informed Collins\u2019s relentless work ethic: as well as her boutique, she has her own perfume, Diva Pink, and a clothing line for the retailer Boohoo. She even lists her castoffs on the online marketplace Depop; items recently for sale included a camisole from Missguided (\u00a37) and a New Look T-shirt (\u00a35). Collins is also far more understated than the GC when it comes to material goods. The GC, she says, would love to be \u201ccruising around in a Bentley\u201d; Collins just bought a used car (\u201cThree years old, so it had already depreciated in value\u201d) and was papped last year driving her sister-in-law\u2019s Nissan Micra (\u201cThe papers kindly said the car was worth \u00a3695 \u2013 it was more like \u00a3395\u201d). \u201cPeople just think I lay in bed every day with people fanning me down or bathing in asses\u2019 milk like Cleopatra,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case: I work, I work and I work.\u201d I wonder what it must be like for Collins to have two personas. Is everyday life ever overwhelming? \u201cI\u2019ve been to shopping centres before where people all start crowding round. They get excited, obviously, but when I go to the shopping centre, I\u2019m not the GC. I\u2019m just there with my mum, and then I\u2019ll have had so many selfies that I\u2019m like: shit, I\u2019ve left the shop and I\u2019ve not got what I\u2019ve needed to get. Some days I do just want to go to the market with my friends, but then people will be like: what\u2019s she doing at the market?\u201d She is keen to emphasise that she is always happy to interact with fans, but she thinks they can cross a line. \u201cSometimes they bark at you like a rottweiler: give us a picture, give us a picture ... all they have to say is: \u2018All right, Gem, how are you? Can I have a picture?\u2019 and I\u2019d be like: yeah, course. When they start grabbing and mauling it, it\u2019s a bit ... it\u2019s scary, you know? I would never say that to someone, or pull someone.\u201d Ever the stoic, she describes such interactions as like \u201cloading the dishwasher. It\u2019s just a part of life.\u201d Collins calls herself the \u201cunderdog\u201d of Towie \u2013 and it is easy to see why. \u201cSomeone said to me once: you know, it just don\u2019t stack up \u2013 you\u2019re the fat one, you\u2019re not the most prettiest, but you\u2019ve been the most successful,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s charming!\u201d Criticism of her image was one thing, but Towie also provoked a classist brand of disdain among audiences and critics alike, who reached for a decades-old cliche of Essex\u2019s inhabitants as coarse and uncultured. How did Collins react to this wave of criticism? \u201cI was very proud to come from Essex, at the end of the day,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a lot of lovely people in Essex \u2013 just look at Gavin and Stacey. People can look down all they want, but there\u2019s a lot of successful people there.\u201d She tries not to dwell on the haters: \u201cIf they\u2019ve got them awful thoughts in their head about people, what a shame for them.\u201d A waiter comes to get our mugs. \u201cThank you very, very, very much,\u201d she says to him, before turning to me: \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything else, do you? A biscuit or anything?\u201d As we get up to leave, she puts her slippers on \u2013 a pair of sequin Ugg boots \u2013 and asks if she can call me a taxi. \u201cAnd if you ever want anything from my shop, anything, a bottle of perfume, you just give me a call.\u201d I get the feeling I probably could. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 March 2020. Due to an editing error we described Gemma Collins as being \u201cin the tabloid firing line\u201d. This should have said \u201cin the tabloid line of fire\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A&amp;E units are so overcrowded that growing numbers of patients have to be looked after in hospital corridors, warn nurses and doctors. There are rising concerns that the \u201cshameful\u201d trend means people stuck in corridors are not getting the care they need, or they may be even coming to harm. A&amp;E health professionals say \u201ccorridor nursing\u201d is becoming increasingly widespread as emergency departments become too full to look after the sheer number of people seeking treatment. In a survey of 1,174 A&amp;E nurses in the Royal College of Nursing\u2019s (RCN) Emergency Care Association, 73% of those polled said they looked after patients in a \u201cnon-designated area\u201d such as corridors every day and another 16% said they did so at least once a week, while 90% said they feared patient safety was being put at risk by those needing care having to spend time in areas of hospitals which did not have medical equipment or call bells. Staff have had difficulty administering urgent doses of intravenous antibiotics to such patients, some of whom have been denied privacy and found it harder to use a toilet or been left in distress, nurses said. NHS bosses believe the RCN\u2019s findings, which are based on a self-selecting sample of A&amp;E nurses, exaggerates the scale of the problem. Dr Katherine Henderson, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&amp;E doctors, said: \u201cWe fully recognise these findings from our nursing colleagues. \u201cIt is shameful that corridor care has become the norm and this survey reflects the reality emergency department staff experience on a daily basis. \u201cCorridor care is terrible for patients and demoralising for staff, who through no fault of their own have nowhere to admit patients to.\u201d Evidence shows that patients stuck in corridors have a higher risk of dying, Henderson added. Patients who end up in corridors are either waiting to be seen by A&amp;E staff or have already been treated, judged to need admission and are waiting for a bed to become free. The RCN said that patients being attended to in \u201ccompletely unsuitable locations\u201d was risky for them and demoralising for staff. Mike Adams, the union\u2019s director for England, said: \u201cHighly complex procedures such as insertion of intravenous lines and medication should not have to be carried out in conditions like these, while it is completely unacceptable that patients\u2019 privacy and dignity are being undermined by lack of access to toilet facilities while they\u2019re stuck in corridors.\u201d \u201cCorridor nursing\u201d is on the rise because hospitals have too few staff and not enough beds for patients, and because inadequate social care is adding to pressure on the NHS, Adams said. Henderson said the NHS needed to halt the 20-year-long reduction in the number of general and acute hospital beds in England. Many hospitals have become totally full for parts of this winter because they have run out of beds as seasonal illnesses have increased demand. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, last year urged hospital bosses not to reduce their bed stock any further to ensure they still had capacity for when they got very busy. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThese are shocking findings revealing the scale of pressure nurses are working under after years of austerity and bed cuts in the NHS. \u201cPatients simply are denied the quality, safe care they deserve thanks to funding decisions made by Tory ministers.\u201d Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS\u2019s national medical director, said: \u201cThis self-selecting survey does not give a reliable representation of nurses\u2019 views.

The route into Westminster Hall was built especially for the procession to the coronation banquet of Charles II in the 17th century and was used afterwards to access parliament by political luminaries such as the first prime minister of Great Britain, Robert Walpole, and William Pitt the younger. It was bricked up and the entrance was later hidden and forgotten about, and sometime after the second world war covered by wooden panelling.

Another piece of graffiti reads: \u201cThese masons were employed refacing these groines ...

      "bodyText": "The escape of three baboons from a Sydney hospital on Tuesday has sparked renewed calls for greater transparency in medical testing on animals in Australia and prompted the federal health minister to make a public statement in favour of polygamy among primates. The baboons \u2013 a 15-year-old male who was scheduled to have a vasectomy, and two females brought along to keep him calm \u2014 escaped in the car park of the Royal Prince Alfred hospital on Tuesday afternoon, causing localised alarm and widespread bafflement. Many questions were left unanswered after their swift recapture by staff from Taronga Zoo. Where did the baboons come from and how did they get out? The baboons are part of the national baboon colony at Wallacia, 68km west of the Sydney CBD, which supplies baboons for scientific testing. Information about the colony is scant \u2013 the number of baboons at the facility is not publicly available and animal welfare organisations told Guardian Australia that requests to tour the facility have been refused. Much of the medical research using the baboons is conducted at an animal research laboratory at the RPA. The vasectomy was due to be carried out by specialist vets in an area of the RPA set up for veterinary surgery. In a statement, NSW Health said it took the safety of animals and the public seriously. \u201cThe animals were uninjured and have now safely returned to veterinary care and their families.\u201d Colony management did not respond to requests for comment. Helen Marston, the chief executive of Humane Research Australia, said she believed the number of baboons at the colony was \u201cin the hundreds\u201d. Marston said she understood the baboons were kept in family groups in cages with some outside access, and \u201cwould have to be supplied with some environmental enrichment\u201d, such as tyre swings and food toys. All facilities involved in animal testing in NSW are inspected by authorities every four years. The details of those inspections are not published. There are other primate colonies in Australia that breed animals for research purposes: a colony of marmosets and macaques in Gippsland, Victoria; and a colony of owl monkeys in Queensland used in malaria research. These particular baboons are in a family group of seven \u2013 the three who escaped and four other females. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said the group would be reunited on Friday, after the male\u2019s vasectomy, which was delayed by a day. Hazzard said the male and \u201ctwo of his wives\u201d escaped due to a faulty lock on the truck. It\u2019s unclear how many locks were between the baboons and freedom. Animal welfare experts told Guardian Australia it was unlikely the animals were loose in the back of the truck, but those details have not been made available. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, did not provide any further details but told reporters in Canberra his \u201cheart was with the baboons\u201d. \u201cThey operated as a modern relationship and I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d Hunt said. Are the baboons OK? Hazzard said the baboons were \u201cwell and resting\u201d after their foiled escape attempt and had breakfasted on bananas, capsicum, apple and bread. He told reporters on Tuesday that the trio were not being transported for medical testing on this occasion. \u201cHe was having a vasectomy because there\u2019s no desire for him to continue to breed for the troop, and the other option was to move him from the troop,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cThis way, he can stay with his family through until old age.\u201d Hazzard said he understood baboons in the colony were \u201cextremely well cared for\u201d. Marston said that even if these animals had not been used in animal testing, their offspring would have been. Emma Hurst, an Animal Justice Party MP from NSW, said the animals \u201cmay have undergone multiple experiments and been involved in multiple protocols\u201d over their lifetime. Hurst said she hoped the escape would draw attention to the lack of transparency around the use of animals in medical testing in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s possibly the least transparent animal-use industry that we have,\u201d she said. What do we know about the use of primates in medical testing? According to figures collated by Humane Research Australia, 272 primates were used in \u201cinvasive experiments\u201d in Australia in 2017. National figures are not compiled by any official body. South Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT do not provide data. \u201cWe really do need the Australian government to collect these figures and provide them,\u201d Marston said. \u201cThere is no benchmark to see if we are increasing the number of tests, there\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just an estimate based on what we can get.\u201d The most common primate species used are baboons, macaques and marmosets. Australia does not allow medical or scientific testing on great apes. According to the latest NSW data, 38 primates were used in research in NSW in 2017. The total number of animals involved in animal testing and research in that state in 2017 was 2.63m, of which 1.7m were involved in \u201cenvironmental studies\u201d and 1.6m were described as tests with \u201cobservation involving minor interference\u201d. Animal testing and research in NSW is overseen by the 12-member Animal Research Review Panel, of which the director of the baboon colony is a member. According to its 2017-18 annual report, there are 166 accredited animal research establishments and 34 licensed animal suppliers in NSW. NSW Health said research on animals was subject to a \u201crigorous ethics process\u201d. \u201cAnimals are only used in medical research when it is scientifically warranted and there are no appropriate alternatives,\u201d NSW Health said. \u201cResearch using non-animal systems such as computer or cell-based systems are used as a replacement for animal research where possible.\u201d According to published scientific studies, compiled by the HRA, tests involving baboons at the RPA included: the testing of radioactive material on four baboons; a blood pressure study involving 109 baboons as part of research into the effects of hypertension in pregnancy; a study involving nine baboons where researchers attempted to induce preeclampsia, which resulted in the death of one mother and one baby baboon; and a study on shoulder injuries which involved the surgical cutting of the shoulder tendons of eight baboons that were then euthanised to allow post-mortem study of the healing process. The most controversial study involved the transplant of pig organs into baboons. Dr Kevin Coleman, a retired GP who also worked in public health, is a member of a group that opposes the continued use of animal experiments at RPA and holds regular protests at the hospital on the first Friday of the month. Coleman said he was concerned about the public health risks posed by xenotransplantation (the transplanting of organs from one species to another) in particular, and the animal testing in biomedical research more broadly. Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases specialist from the Australian National University, has also raised concerns about the risk of zoonotic diseases from xenotransplantation. He told Guardian Australia those concerns were particularly relevant as the world grapples with another coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIf something is there [in the transplanted organ] that we don\u2019t know about, that could be not only a disaster for the person who has the transplant, that could be a public health crisis,\u201d Collingon said.",

      "body": "<p>For reasons that remain unclear, there was yet another Democratic primary debate on Tuesday night, the 10th such event of the presidential contest. The seven candidates who qualified convened in Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of the South Carolina primary on Saturday and the slew of Super Tuesday contests next week. It will not be the last debate that we are subjected to \u2013 yet another is scheduled for 15 March. Tuesday\u2019s debate, hosted by CBS, was mercifully short compared to some others, wrapping up after just two hours. For my sins, I watched the whole thing.</p> <p>Perhaps because there have been so many of these debates, the candidates seemed determined to make it dramatic television. At times, they seemed to be vying for ratings. Much of the evening was spent in shouting and cross talk. Biden pointed; Sanders threw his hands in the air in exasperation; Bloomberg delivered practiced jokes he had paid someone to write for him, exuding all the charisma of a rubber chicken. Everyone had grievances; everyone had accusations and recriminations to make against the others. Not that you could hear them: the shouting often made it hard to make out just quite what anyone was saying. The event was heavy on vitriol and light on substance.</p> <p>Faint overtures toward civility were made. Joe Biden complained frequently that other candidates did not respect the response time limits, and used much of his own time to suggest that he might take extra time himself. The billionaire Michael Bloomberg, in an attempt to extoll the virtues of centrism, made an odd Freudian slip when referring to the wave of Democrats elected to the House in the 2018 midterms. \u201cAll those new Democrats who came in and put Nancy Pelosi in power, I bought \u2013&#xa0;I got \u2018em,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others urged unity. \u201cIf we spend the next four months tearing our party apart,\u201d warned Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend the next four years tearing our country apart.\u201d This sentiment did not stop her from attacking her rivals, however: she quickly complained that Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had not been sufficiently productive in the Senate.</p> <p>Perhaps the only person on stage who did not spend much of her speaking time yelling was Senator Warren, who remained composed and calm while the men around her screamed and grew petulant under pressure. But the chaos of Tuesday\u2019s debate may have been partially a punishment for Senator Warren\u2019s success in the previous debate last week, in Nevada, when she devastatingly attacked former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p> <p>Warren\u2019s attacks were a boon to her candidacy: she raised a tremendous amount of money during and just after the debate, and the polling numbers of Bloomberg, her ideological enemy and a significant Super Tuesday threat, dropped like a lead balloon after she was done with him. The event catapulted her to number two in a national poll, and demonstrated her ability to handily skewer an arrogant billionaire. But the events of last week\u2019s debate seems to have cursed this week\u2019s: every candidate wanted a Warren moment, but not every candidate is Elizabeth Warren. The result was a lot of attacks directed at Bloomberg and Sanders from other candidates that lacked the intelligence and moral certainty of Warren\u2019s skewering of Bloomberg last week.</p> <p>The moderators did not help. Some of the questions were phrased in what seemed like deliberate bad faith, such as when they suggested, absurdly, that Bernie Sanders was sympathetic to authoritarianism. Other questions were pointless softballs that elicited no meaningful information from the candidates, such as a concluding prompt directed at all the candidates, asking them to state their personal motto and to correct one misconception about themselves. To this, former vice-president Joe Biden replied, \u201cI have more hair than I think I do.\u201d It is quite possible that viewers who watched the debate ended it with less information than when they began.</p> <p>The 10th Democratic debate, then, was less an informed discussion of the issues in the service of better informing the electorate than it was a bad-faith fiasco in the service of narcissism, dishonesty, and petty grievance. The event was so heavy on theatrics and so light on policy substance that it calls into question the usefulness of the broadcasts at all.

      "bodyText": "For reasons that remain unclear, there was yet another Democratic primary debate on Tuesday night, the 10th such event of the presidential contest. The seven candidates who qualified convened in Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of the South Carolina primary on Saturday and the slew of Super Tuesday contests next week. It will not be the last debate that we are subjected to \u2013 yet another is scheduled for 15 March. Tuesday\u2019s debate, hosted by CBS, was mercifully short compared to some others, wrapping up after just two hours. For my sins, I watched the whole thing. Perhaps because there have been so many of these debates, the candidates seemed determined to make it dramatic television. At times, they seemed to be vying for ratings. Much of the evening was spent in shouting and cross talk. Biden pointed; Sanders threw his hands in the air in exasperation; Bloomberg delivered practiced jokes he had paid someone to write for him, exuding all the charisma of a rubber chicken. Everyone had grievances; everyone had accusations and recriminations to make against the others. Not that you could hear them: the shouting often made it hard to make out just quite what anyone was saying. The event was heavy on vitriol and light on substance. Faint overtures toward civility were made. Joe Biden complained frequently that other candidates did not respect the response time limits, and used much of his own time to suggest that he might take extra time himself. The billionaire Michael Bloomberg, in an attempt to extoll the virtues of centrism, made an odd Freudian slip when referring to the wave of Democrats elected to the House in the 2018 midterms. \u201cAll those new Democrats who came in and put Nancy Pelosi in power, I bought \u2013 I got \u2018em,\u201d he said. Others urged unity. \u201cIf we spend the next four months tearing our party apart,\u201d warned Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend the next four years tearing our country apart.\u201d This sentiment did not stop her from attacking her rivals, however: she quickly complained that Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had not been sufficiently productive in the Senate. Perhaps the only person on stage who did not spend much of her speaking time yelling was Senator Warren, who remained composed and calm while the men around her screamed and grew petulant under pressure. But the chaos of Tuesday\u2019s debate may have been partially a punishment for Senator Warren\u2019s success in the previous debate last week, in Nevada, when she devastatingly attacked former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Warren\u2019s attacks were a boon to her candidacy: she raised a tremendous amount of money during and just after the debate, and the polling numbers of Bloomberg, her ideological enemy and a significant Super Tuesday threat, dropped like a lead balloon after she was done with him. The event catapulted her to number two in a national poll, and demonstrated her ability to handily skewer an arrogant billionaire. But the events of last week\u2019s debate seems to have cursed this week\u2019s: every candidate wanted a Warren moment, but not every candidate is Elizabeth Warren. The result was a lot of attacks directed at Bloomberg and Sanders from other candidates that lacked the intelligence and moral certainty of Warren\u2019s skewering of Bloomberg last week. The moderators did not help. Some of the questions were phrased in what seemed like deliberate bad faith, such as when they suggested, absurdly, that Bernie Sanders was sympathetic to authoritarianism. Other questions were pointless softballs that elicited no meaningful information from the candidates, such as a concluding prompt directed at all the candidates, asking them to state their personal motto and to correct one misconception about themselves. To this, former vice-president Joe Biden replied, \u201cI have more hair than I think I do.\u201d It is quite possible that viewers who watched the debate ended it with less information than when they began. The 10th Democratic debate, then, was less an informed discussion of the issues in the service of better informing the electorate than it was a bad-faith fiasco in the service of narcissism, dishonesty, and petty grievance. The event was so heavy on theatrics and so light on policy substance that it calls into question the usefulness of the broadcasts at all. The Tuesday debate did not benefit the republic, and may have actively hurt it. The events, repeated ad nauseam with few variations and little new information, seem to benefit no one except the networks that air them. They are designed less to facilitate meaningful debates on policy issues than to manufacture conflict and stoke voters\u2019 contempt. Perhaps the only moment of the night that seemed to have more to do with principle than pageantry was an exchange between Bloomberg and Warren, when Bloomberg objected to Warren\u2019s characterization of the accusations of sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination.

The Vermont senator\u2019s status as the one to beat in the nominating contest appears to be unchanged.</li> \n   <li>The CBS News moderators were sharply criticized for their inability to maintain control of the debate as candidates tried to wrest control of the discussion by shouting over each other. A number of commentators also bemoaned the lack of questions on key issues like climate change and immigration.</li> \n   <li><strong>Republicans </strong>reveled in the \u201cchaos\u201d of the night, dismissing all the Democratic candidates as unworthy of ascending to the Oval Office.</li> \n   <li>Coming off his disastrous first debate performance last week, <strong>Mike Bloomberg </strong>faced the lowest expectations of any candidate but still managed to inflict some damage upon himself.

He\u2019d fought <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> to a virtual tie in Iowa - no small feat for a little-known senator running a longshot presidential campaign. Then he trounced Clinton in New Hampshire, which neighbors Vermont. There was chaos at the Nevada caucuses, which Clinton won by a narrower-than expected margin. </p> \n  <p>But then came South Carolina. Defeat was resounding. The margin \u201374% to 26% \u2013 was so wide that there would be no spinning the result. Sanders won only 14% of the black vote there, compared to Clinton\u2019s 86%, according to exit polls.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e0aac67854e7fc22ebc503a47be983b4cfa53d0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e0aac67854e7fc22ebc503a47be983b4cfa53d0/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton addresses supporters after winning the 2016 South Carolina primary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton addresses supporters after winning the 2016 South Carolina primary.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>It was a KO from which Sanders never recovered. Even though the race dragged on for several more months, South Carolina was Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But Clinton lost to <strong>Trump</strong> and Sanders effectively never stopped running for president. And in the intervening years, he spent much more time in the south, investing in the community there and making efforts to strengthen his ties with the black community.</p> \n  <p>He\u2019s tweaked his famously consistent message to specifically address race and racial justice. Even in his landslide defeat, Sanders showed signs of strength with young black voters, and he has continued to cultivate his support with this constituency, organizing on historically black colleges around his plans for free-college tuition and a Green New Deal.</p> \n  <p>All of these efforts will face their first real test in South Carolina, the first primary contest featuring a majority black electorate.</p> \n  <p>Recent polling shows Sanders within striking distance of <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, who has portrayed the state as his \u201cfirewall\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Biden is still favored to win the Palmetto State , but if Sanders can breach his \u201cfirewall\u201d it may be the beginning of his march to the nomination. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e55981d8f08e1332474a2a5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T00:40:18.270Z\">12.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Here\u2019s the format of tonight\u2019s debate</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The format of tonight\u2019s debate is very similar to past debates, with candidates receiving time for responses to direct questions and rebuttals to opponents\u2019 answers.<br></p> \n  <p>Candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer direct questions, and moderators will decide when to award candidates 45 seconds for rebuttals.</p> \n  <p>CBS News has said candidates will not make opening or closing statements, but all the debate participants will get a closing question, which will likely be used as a sort of final pitch to voters.</p> \n  <p>We are about 20 minutes away from the first question, so stay tuned. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e55b78d8f086a28115b294b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T00:35:25.917Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bernie Sanders\u2019 </strong>allies are pushing back against <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/sanders-obama-primary-challenge/606709/\">an Atlantic report</a> that the Vermont senator considered a primary challenge against <strong>Barack Obama </strong>in 2012.</p> \n  <p>According to the Atlantic, Sanders was seriously considering launching a White House bid against the Democratic president and had to be talked out of it by then-Senate majority leader <strong>Harry Reid.</strong></p> \n  <p>Sanders himself dismissed the story last night, saying it was \u201cnot true at all.\u201d But <strong>Joe Biden</strong>\u2019s campaign is already out with an ad highlighting the report:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J2pTaPtdZM\"> \n   <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1J2pTaPtdZM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Patrick Leahy, </strong>a fellow Vermont senator who reportedly spoke with Sanders about his plans in the summer of 2011, said he did not \u201crecall\u201d discussing the subject:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1232456672204840960\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sen.

The stakes are high for him. He\u2019s generally polled further behind his rivals in national polls, and his campaign struggled through the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. </p> \n  <p>But recent polling has shown Steyer faring better in South Carolina. He\u2019s averaging in <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/election/article240100868.html\">third place</a> going into Tuesday\u2019s debate. </p> \n  <p>Steyer has been directing his recent attacks at both Sanders and Biden. One ad warns Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialist plans won\u2019t beat <strong>Trump</strong>\u201d and that nothing would change in a Biden administration. The ad then pivots to Steyer\u2019s work helping \u201cblack and brown communities\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In essence, the ad is an encapsulation of how the former hedge fund manager has approached South Carolina: pick at Biden\u2019s base while also contrasting himself with Sanders. He\u2019s likely to go after both candidates during Tuesday\u2019s debate. </p> \n  <p>Steyer is hoping it will do more than place him behind two other candidates on election night. In an interview with NBC Nightly News set to air Tuesday night, Steyer said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get third place in South Carolina. I want to win South Carolina.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am pushing as hard as I can to see as many people and push as hard as I can to move forward in South Carolina because I think it\u2019s really important,\u201d Steyer added. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a diverse state.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me tonight after the 10th Democratic debate, the last debate before Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday. Here are some key takeaways from the night: Early in the night, Bernie Sanders was the main target of his opponents\u2019 attacks, but the frontrunner then seemed to fade into the background as the debate repeatedly devolved into bickering. The Vermont senator\u2019s status as the one to beat in the nominating contest appears to be unchanged. The CBS News moderators were sharply criticized for their inability to maintain control of the debate as candidates tried to wrest control of the discussion by shouting over each other. A number of commentators also bemoaned the lack of questions on key issues like climate change and immigration. Republicans reveled in the \u201cchaos\u201d of the night, dismissing all the Democratic candidates as unworthy of ascending to the Oval Office. Coming off his disastrous first debate performance last week, Mike Bloomberg faced the lowest expectations of any candidate but still managed to inflict some damage upon himself. For example, Bloomberg said in response to criticism from Elizabeth Warren that he was \u201cprobably wrong\u201d to make sexist jokes about his employees. The candidates repeatedly tried to address racial issues in light of Saturday\u2019s primary in South Carolina, where more than half the Democratic electorate is African American. Most notably, Joe Biden promised to nominate an African-American women to the Supreme Court. But the direct appeals to black voters from the seven white candidates on stage struck some critics as blatant pandering. Thanks for following along with our debate coverage, and tune back in tomorrow morning for more of the Guardian\u2019s live analysis of the 2020 election. MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews pushed Elizabeth Warren on her accusation that Mike Bloomberg told an employee to \u201ckill it\u201d when he learned of her pregnancy. But as previously noted, the woman\u2019s accusation, which Bloomberg denied, is well documented: Wondering why Bloomberg didn\u2019t do so badly this time? It may be due to his debate prep (although it didn\u2019t seem to help too much): An aide to Pete Buttigieg said the presidential candidate had canceled a planned trip to Florida because he is sick. During tonight\u2019s debate, the former Indiana mayor could be heard coughing and sneezing as other candidates delivered their answers. Speaking to the Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland in Charleston, Tom Steyer defended his record on private prisons. \u201cI worked to get rid of any use of private prisons,\u201d Steyer said of his activism in his home state of California. \u201cWe successfully did it.\u201d During the debate, Joe Biden attacked Steyer, who is rising in the South Carolina polls, for previously investing in a private prison system. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought for 15 years, long before other people were talking about it,\u201d Steyer said on his opposition to private prisons. \u201cI made the right decision, and I\u2019ve been working on it ever since.\u201d Asked by another reporter whether he would reconsider his candidacy if he fell short in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, Steyer would not give a clear answer. The billionaire activist predicted the primary in South Carolina, where more than half of Democratic voters are African-American, would provide a \u201ccourse correction\u201d in the race. During the debate, Pete Buttigieg condemned the \u201crevolutionary politics of the 1960s\u201d, in an implicit dig at Bernie Sanders. The former Indiana mayor also tweeted and then deleted a tweet in which he said the US \u201ccan\u2019t afford a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950\u2019s and Bernie Sanders with his nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960\u2019s.\u201d Buttigieg repeated the line again when he spoke to reporters in the debate spin room. But the \u201crevolutionary politics\u201d of the 60s include the civil rights movement and the Stonewall riots. In South Carolina, during Black history month, the comments came off as tone deaf. The Sanders campaign picked up on Buttigieg\u2019s point, as well. Nina Turner, a top Sanders surrogate, addressed the former South Bend mayor in a tweet: \u201cCheck your history!\u201d Buttigieg has previously been criticized by LBGTQ+ activists. As The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reported earlier this month, \u201cButtigieg may be the first openly gay candidate to sweep the national stage and perform as well as he has in Iowa and New Hampshire, but more and more young queer voters say they feel he is not representative of them or their experiences.\u201d Pete Buttigieg has canceled a planned trip to Florida, which will hold its primary on 17 March. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign sent a memo to donors earlier today that seemed to downplay expectations for Super Tuesday, which appears to be very favorable for frontrunner Bernie Sanders. The Buttigieg campaign said its strategy was to \u201cminimize Sanders\u2019 margins on Super Tuesday\u201d, but that may not be enough to halt Sanders\u2019 march toward the nomination. Even while Joe Biden\u2019s campaign celebrated his debate performance tonight, the former vice president\u2019s advisers were struggling to explain his outlandish claim about being arrested trying to see Nelson Mandela. Biden has repeatedly claimed in the past month that he was arrested while trying to visit the late South African leader in prison. The New York Times reported last week: But if Mr. Biden, then a United States senator from Delaware, was in fact arrested while trying to visit Mr. Mandela, he did not mention it in his 2007 memoir when writing about a 1970s trip to South Africa, and he has not spoken of it prominently on the 2020 campaign trail. A check of available news accounts by The New York Times turned up no references to an arrest. South African arrest records are not readily available in the United States. Andrew Young, a former congressman and mayor of Atlanta who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1977 to 1979, said that he had traveled with Mr. Biden over the years, including to South Africa. But Mr. Young said that he had never been arrested in South Africa and expressed skepticism that members of Congress would have faced arrest there. Now Biden\u2019s campaign is claiming the former vice president was referring to how he was separated from fellow Congress members during the trip: There wasn\u2019t a single question from the CBS moderators on climate change tonight, and it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Most notably, Bernie Sanders has quote retweeted Alexandria Ocasio Cortez after she called its absence from the debate \u201chorrifying\u201d. However, Tom Steyer has been acknowledged for bringing it up nonetheless: Steyer also seems to have a good source of information for his latest climate crisis coverage Elizabeth Warren ended the debate by invoking Matthew 25 \u2014 as she\u2019s done many times before. \u201cIn as much as ye have done to one of these, the least of my brethren, ye have done it unto me,\u201d she quoted, when asked what she considers her motto. Warren has evoked the Gospel of Matthew many times, but she\u2019s far from the only Democratic candidate to do so. As the Associated Press\u2019 Elana Schor reported last week, the biblical passage is a favorite for Dems. Pete Buttigieg evoked Matthew in a political ad, saying in a voice over: \u201cWhatever happened to, \u2018I was hungry and you fed me? I was a stranger and you welcomed me?\u2019\u201d Cory Booker referenced it when he was still in the running. Barack Obama, back in 2008, referenced Matthew. And a political action committee that helped Obama\u2019s campaign that year was dubbed the Matthew 25 Network. The gospel\u2019s message is a way to speak to Democrats\u2019 progressive ideas of building up the social safety net while trying to connect with and appeal to a solid bloc of Christian voters. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign said it saw its best online fundraising day since the former vice president launched his White House bid. Biden is counting on a win in South Carolina to reinvigorate his campaign after dismal performances in Iowa and New Hampshire and a distant second-place finish in Nevada. Biden predicted during tonight\u2019s debate that he would win Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary. If he does, the money he raises today will help him try to compete against frontrunner Bernie Sanders on Super Tuesday next week. Here are the final speaking times for each candidate now the debate is over, via the New York Times\u2019 live tracker. What\u2019s most noticeable is how much less time Elizabeth Warren spoke for this time. As the final table for last week shows, she was down by four minutes tonight, putting her in fourth place. Viewers may have noticed the boisterous cheers and applause for Mike Bloomberg. The debate audience clapped enthusiastically when Bloomberg mentioned a gun control group he founded. They also booed Bernie Sanders \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s biggest competition. The display prompted some viewers to wonder if the billionaire candidate had stacked the audience. After all, the Bloomberg has paid Instagram influencers to promote his candidacy and paid people to text their friends to drum up support. But the Democratic National Committee\u2019s communications director clarified that each candidate is allocated the same number of tickets. \u201cNo one is packing the debate hall,\u201d said the DNC\u2019s Xochitl Hinojosa. \u201cThis is how conspiracy theories get started.\u201d But Bloomberg was able to boost his message outside the debate hall: by running campaign ads during the commercial breaks. In a post-debate interview, Bernie Sanders repeated his final debate answer, arguing his policy proposals are not radical because other countries have already adopted them. \u201cThe truth is, nothing I am saying is radical,\u201d Sanders said. The Vermont Senator also once again stood by his flattering comments on Fidel Castro\u2019s literacy programs, while condemning the \u201cauthoritarian\u201d leader\u2019s regime. But Sanders\u2019 comments have attracted some criticism from fellow Democrats, including this freshman House member who was born in Poland during the Cold War: Joe Biden used his final debate answer to pledge that he would nominate an African American woman to the Supreme Court. The unexpected promise -- which is likely meant to win over voters before Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, where more than half of the 2016 electorate was African American -- was quickly praised over Twitter: But far-right commentator Ann Coulter seized on Biden\u2019s promise to try to dissuade white male Democrats from supporting the former vice president: Here\u2019s how some viewers have been responding to tonight\u2019s debate on Twitter, starting with Andrew Yang, who until recently was on the stage. Like many, he wasn\u2019t happy with CBS\u2019 moderation: Republicans are celebrating the chaotic nature of tonight\u2019s debate, which featured many moments of Democratic candidates yelling over each other to be heard. The Trump campaign called the debate a \u201chot mess,\u201d and the chairwoman of the Republican National Commitee said the night proved none of the candidates deserve to be president. The 10th Democratic debate has concluded, but the blog will have more updates and analysis coming up, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters praised his final answer on the biggest misconception about himself. The Vermont senator, who has been criticized by some of his opponents for being too far left for the Democratic Party, pushed back against the notion that his ideas are \u201cradical.\u201d Sanders said his proposals exist \u201cin one form or another\u201d all around the world. The moderators\u2019 last question is a bizarre two-parter: what is the biggest misconception about you, and what is your motto? There have been some funny answers, such as when Amy Klobuchar said the biggest misconception about her was that she is \u201cboring.\u201d But most candidates have used the odd question to deliver an unofficial closing statement. Most notably, Joe Biden pledged to put an African American woman on the Supreme Court, prompting loud applause from the South Carolina audience. Elizabeth Warren has remained focused on bringing down Mike Bloomberg \u2014 and has largely avoided bringing down frontrunner Bernie Sanders, whose support she needs to chip away at if her campaign is to remain viable. The question is: Why? So far, Bloomberg has served as a good foil to Warren, who has been equating him with the New York businessman currently occupying the White House. But strategically, it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll sway moderates who support Bloomberg. It\u2019s almost as if Warren is more worried about stopping the billionaire former mayor than stealing the progressive vote. It could be that Warren\u2019s campaign doesn\u2019t want to risk directly taking on Sanders again. The last time the two progressive senators clashed, progressives were left feeling betrayed and confused. Earlier tonight, Mike Bloomberg criticized Elizabeth Warren after she called on him to release more employees from non-discloure agreements. \u201cWith this senator, enough is never enough,\u201d Bloomberg said. Some of Warren\u2019s fans celebrated the flippant comment over Twitter, and it has now been turned into campaign merch. Responding to a question on Middle East policy, Bernie Sanders called Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201ca reactionary racist.\u201d The Vermont senator added that he would consider moving the US embassy in Israel back to Tel Aviv after Trump moved it to Jerusalem. Sanders argued the United States\u2019 Middle East policy should focus on \u201cprotecting the independence and security of Israel, but you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people.\u201d As the debate moderators questioned Democratic presidential candidates about the proper response to coronavirus, Trump weighed in over Twitter. According to the White House pool report, the Democratic debate is similarly being played on the televisions on Air Force One as the president returns from India. Here are the latest speaking times for each candidate via the New York Times: The moderators questioned Bernie Sanders about his flattering comments on the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Sanders once again said Castro supported some positive policies, such as literacy programs, which prompted boos from the audience. \u201cReally? Literacy programs are bad?\u201d Sanders said. Pete Buttigieg tried to pick up the criticism by saying Democrats would not win by spotlighting the \u201cbright side of the Castro regime,\u201d but the attack was largely lost in a flurry of crosstalk with Sanders. Elizabeth Warren used a question on whether to allow Chinese firms to build parts of American technological infrastructute to bash Michael Bloomberg for not releasing his tax returns. \u201cWe know that Mayor Bloomberg has been doing business with China for a long time, and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe plans to release them after Super Tuesday. It is not enough to say just trust me on this.\u201d Bloomberg responded by saying he would release his tax returns \u201cin a couple of weeks,\u201d but that would mean they are not available until after Super Tuesday. Chaos is still one of the main themes of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate, although the bickering has died down slightly since it first erupted earlier tonight. But candidates are still going over time on their answers, being abruptly cut off, and speaking over one another. Some former Obama administration officials are praising Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance, but they have one suggestion: stop yelling. CBS News\u2019 Gayle King has asked the night\u2019s first question about the coronavirus after two days of stock market losses because of the health threat. King asked senator Amy Klobuchar whether she would close borders to Americans who have been exposed to the virus. Klobuchar responded by saying that the focus needs to be on helping infected Americans. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna give you my website, I\u2019m going to give the CDC\u2019s site, it\u2019s cdc.gov,\u201d the Minnesota senator said. Some viewers have spotted quite an overstatement from Joe Biden: Mike Bloomberg was the first candidate to bring up the coronavirus after two days of steep stock market losses due to fears about the spreading health threat. But the CBS News moderators have not yet asked any questions about coronvirus, which has not escaped the attention of Twitter commentators. Meanwhile, the virus has now reached into the ranks of the US military: Here\u2019s where tonight\u2019s Democratic debate stands so far: It\u2019s looking like a good night for Bernie Sanders, who has often faded into the background as his opponents bicker and yell over each other. The Vermont senator\u2019s frontrunner status currently appears safe. The CBS News moderators have been criticized for failing to keep the debate on track as candidates try to seize the stage by launching into answers when they have not been addressed. Elizabeth Warren once again criticized Mike Bloomberg for his reported history of making sexist comments, so the billionaire has not escaped scrutiny after his widely panned debate performance last week. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. While the last debate was defined by the heavy blows the candidates were landing on each other, this one has so far been defined by its disorderly chaos. Ironically, it\u2019s also the first debate to be sponsored by Twitter which, as some have noted, it is increasingly starting to resemble. Asked about his anti-junk food campaign as mayor of New York, Mike Bloomberg said the policy may not work well for the entire country. Bloomberg noted New York \u201cisn\u2019t like all other cities, otherwise you would have a Naked Cowboy in every city.\u201d The billionaire candidate\u2019s obviously pre-written jokes are attracting some mockery on Twitter: The moderators appear to be trying to take back control of the debate after candidates spent the first hour cutting each other off and yelling to deliver answers. As Pete Buttigieg tried to interject himself into the discussion, CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan told him to \u201chonor the rules of the debate.\u201d Questions are being asked about how tickets were made available for tonight\u2019s debate. Some reports suggest that certain tickets were priced between $1,750 - $3,200. Some are saying that might account for the unexpected enthusiasm being shown for billionaire candidate Bloomberg ... Mike Bloomberg tried to make a joke about his widely panned debate performance last week by suggesting he actually did a great job pushing back against his opponents. But the joke was poorly timed and did not appear to land with the Charleston audience: Did Mike Bloomberg fall prey to an unfortunate Freudian slip earlier, and say he bought 21 Democratic seats in 2018? Donald Trump Jr has already jumped on the moment, but watch the clip and decide for yourself (it happens just towards the end): There is a sense of desperation to tonight\u2019s debate, as candidates repeatedly cut each other off to launch attacks at each other. Here\u2019s how much each candidate has spoken tonight, via the New York Times\u2019 live tracker: Once again turning their attention to frontrunner Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg criticized the frontrunner for not supporting an elimination of the Senate filibuster. \u201cHow are we going to deliver a revolution if you won\u2019t even support a rule change?\u201d Buttigieg asked. Eliminating the Senate filibuster would lower the threshold required to pass legislation, and the proposal has another high-profile supporter -- Donald Trump. The debate moderators are coming in for a lot of heat tonight. Viewers\u2019 criticisms have included the lack of control over the bickering candidates, and the fact no-one has yet been asked about the global panic over coronavirus. Bernie Sanders was asked why he voted to protect gun manufacturers from legal liability, which other candidates have criticized him for. Sanders initially tried to pivot to criticizing Joe Biden for his record on trade deals, which prompted boos from the Charleston audience. \u201cI have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,\u201d Sanders then said. \u201cThat was a bad vote.\u201d Elizabeth Warren has so far directed more criticism at Mike Bloomberg than Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner in the primary race. As another progressive senator, Warren will likely need to pick off some of Sanders\u2019 supporters to have any chance of the nomination. But Warren cannot criticize Sanders\u2019 agenda too harshly -- because it aligns so closely with her own -- so she has decided to continue slamming the billionaire former mayor of New York. While tonight\u2019s debate hasn\u2019t been quite as fierce as last week\u2019s, it has featured the most cross-talk, shouting and overall bickering. At one point the candidates spoke over one another for about 20 seconds as they argued over the cost of Bernie Sanders\u2019 healthcare plans. And it\u2019s not just the candidates on stage \u2013 the audience is also far more vocal and unruly than before: Joe Biden just went after Tom Steyer for his past support for private prisons, a clear effort to stop the billionaire activist\u2019s rise in the South Carolina polls. Biden pointed to Steyer\u2019s past investment in a private prison system to argue he was not in sync with Democratic voters on criminal justice. Steyer responded by saying he no longer supports private prisons, which prompted Biden to give him a new nickname: \u201cTommy come lately!\u201d It\u2019s round two of Warren v Bloomberg, and this time it\u2019s just as personal as it was last week. Similar to her first attack on the billionaire media mogul in the previous debate, Warren started off by highlighting one of the disturbing remarks Bloomberg allegedly made to a female employee in 1995 (which he denies): Warren has also gone after Bloomberg over his electability with Democratic voters, and whether they can trust him: Elizabeth Warren was asked for evidence to back up her accusation that Mike Bloomberg responded to news of an employee\u2019s pregnancy by telling her to \u201ckill it.\u201d But the claim has been thoroughly reported: Asked about reports of his sexist comments, Mike Bloomberg said he was \u201cprobably\u201d wrong to make jokes that sparked complaints against him. Elizabeth Warren used her first answer to criticize Bernie Sanders, but she has now turned her attention to Mike Bloomberg, who she targeted in the last debate. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will.\u201d Warren then resurrected reports of Bloomberg\u2019s history of sexist remarks, specifically an allegation that the billionaire responded to news of an employee\u2019s pregnancy by telling her to \u201ckill it.\u201d Bloomberg denied the claim and criticized the senator for once again raising the issue of his company\u2019s non-disclosure agreements, accusing Warren of continually moving the goalposts. Amy Klobuchar was just been asked her first question of the night. But while the other candidates have been going back and forth over the last eighteen minutes, it\u2019s the first chance she\u2019s had to speak. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both agreed \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d the controversial policy supported by Mike Bloomberg while he was New York\u2019s mayor, was racist. \u201cI\u2019m conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cStop and frisk\u201d has been repeatedly criticized for unfairly targeting young men of color. Bloomberg has apologized for supporting the policy, but his controversial record on race could be an issue in the South Carolina primary, where more than half of voters were African American in 2016. Asked about his declining support among African American voters, Joe Biden expressed confidence he would win Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary. Biden noted polls indicate he still leads the Democratic field with black voters. \u201cI\u2019ve worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African American community,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president then unequivocally predicted he would be victorious on Saturday. \u201cI will win South Carolina,\u201d Biden said. Elizabeth Warren has taken aim at Bernie Sanders tonight. It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s tried to contrast herself with him, but it\u2019s definitely her sharpest rebuke of the senator yet. And it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed: Everyone is clearly focusing their attacks on Bernie Sanders tonight after his landslide victory in Nevada. Elizabeth Warren used her first debate answer to try to distinguish herself from her fellow progressive senator. \u201cBernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I\u2019d be a better president,\u201d Warren said, arguing she would be the best option to implement a progressive agenda. \u201cProgressives have one shot, and we need to spend it on a leader who will get something done,\u201d Warren said. Mike Bloomberg used his first debate answer to criticize Bernie Sanders over recent reports that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election to help his campaign. Trying to recover from his disastrous first debate performance, Bloomberg said Russia\u2019s efforts showed Sanders is the weakest candidate Democrats could put up against Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s why Russia is helping you get elected so you\u2019ll lose to [Trump],\u201d Bloomberg said. Moderators Norah O\u2019Donnell and Gayle King kicked off the debate by explaining the rules and underscoring the signficance of tonight\u2019s event. King called the debate the \u201clast, best chance for candidates to make their case\u201d to South Carolina and Super Tuesday voters. The first question went to Bernie Sanders, who was asked how he would reassure voters concerned the democratic socialist would halt the country\u2019s economic growth. Sanders said the economy was working well for \u201cMr Bloomberg and other billionaires\u201d but not everyday Americans, lamenting the country\u2019s stagnant wage growth. Sanders pledged to create an economy that works for American families and not just the wealthy few. If you want to see for yourself how much trouble Joe Biden is in at the moment \u2013 and how much Bernie Sanders is surging \u2013 then you can take a look at this graph from Real Clear Politics, which aggregates all the reliable primary polls (Sanders is in blue and Biden is green). Going back to the December 2018 it shows just how spectacular and how sudden Biden\u2019s fall has been. You can see the full interactive graph for yourself here. The tenth Democratic debate, the last debate before the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday, is now under way. With minutes to go before things kick off here in Charleston, the spin room is in a mild degree of panic as the WiFi, provided by the DNC, has been down for over an hour. As such, I\u2019m now in a grand ballroom behind the debate stage, with a few hundred panicking journalists, scrambling to figure out how they\u2019ll file stories. Luckily, here at the Guardian, we\u2019re supported by a crack team in Washington and New York who are taking my words straight off my phone. We\u2019ll see what happens when things kick off, but this is already seeming like a bit of a logistical meltdown as crews of DNC tech support people continue to swarm around their a single laptop to get it fixed. In a new memo to donors, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign appears to be lowering expectations for Super Tuesday. If Sanders\u2019 opponents cannot sufficiently slow his momentum between Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary and next week\u2019s Super Tuesday contests, the Vermont senator could be unstoppable. After all, winning generally begets more winning in presidential primaries, and Sanders\u2019 opponents need to start landing victories if they want to stop him from running away with the nomination. The 10th Democratic debate is about 10 minutes away, so here is how you can watch the candidates face off for the last time before the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday. Tonight\u2019s debate is hosted by CBS News and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, so it can be watched on CBS stations and streamed on CBSN, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The moderators of the debate are CBS Evening News anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell and CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King, and three other CBS correspondents \u2013 Margaret Brennan, Major Garrett and Bill Whitaker \u2013 will join them in questioning the candidates. The debate is scheduled to run for two hours and will kick off shortly, so stay tuned. Tonight\u2019s debate, at the Galliard Center in downtown Charleston, is taking place just a few dozen feet from the Mother Emanuel AME church. This historic building, built in the early nineteenth century, is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the southern United States and has long been a centre for resistance against white supremacy and racism in South Carolina. In 1822, its founder Denmark Vesey was a lead organizer in a planned slave revolt, and the church was a hub of activity during the civil rights era. It was also the site of the 2015 church massacre, when a white supremacist terrorist murdered nine black churchgoers in a mass shooting that shook the nation and led to the then Republican governor Nikki Haley to remove the confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse. As such, it\u2019s likely the legacy of that horrific terror attack will be referenced at a number of policy junctures at tonight\u2019s debate -- namely the candidates\u2019 plans for gun control and what they hope to do to combat the rise in white nationalist terror in the US. A few candidates are going into tonight\u2019s debate still bruised from last Wednesday\u2019s clash in Las Vegas. Elizabeth Warren managed to land two of the night\u2019s biggest blows on Mike Bloomberg, who was roundly attacked by everyone on stage. Her first attack came right at the start of the night, when she highlighted his previous remarks about women: Warren later rounded on Bloomberg once again, and called on him to release all the women who had signed NDAs with him: But these weren\u2019t the only big clashes of the night. Biden also went after Bloomberg over his stop and frisk policy while mayor of New York. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar repeatedly went up against each other. Warren went after everyone over their healthcare plans. Bernie Sanders suggested Bloomberg shouldn\u2019t exist. And Bloomberg slammed Sanders for owning three homes while also being a socialist. In 2016, Bernie Sanders rolled into South Carolina with the wind at his back. He\u2019d fought Hillary Clinton to a virtual tie in Iowa - no small feat for a little-known senator running a longshot presidential campaign. Then he trounced Clinton in New Hampshire, which neighbors Vermont. There was chaos at the Nevada caucuses, which Clinton won by a narrower-than expected margin. But then came South Carolina. Defeat was resounding. The margin \u201374% to 26% \u2013 was so wide that there would be no spinning the result. Sanders won only 14% of the black vote there, compared to Clinton\u2019s 86%, according to exit polls. It was a KO from which Sanders never recovered. Even though the race dragged on for several more months, South Carolina was Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall.\u201d But Clinton lost to Trump and Sanders effectively never stopped running for president. And in the intervening years, he spent much more time in the south, investing in the community there and making efforts to strengthen his ties with the black community. He\u2019s tweaked his famously consistent message to specifically address race and racial justice. Even in his landslide defeat, Sanders showed signs of strength with young black voters, and he has continued to cultivate his support with this constituency, organizing on historically black colleges around his plans for free-college tuition and a Green New Deal. All of these efforts will face their first real test in South Carolina, the first primary contest featuring a majority black electorate. Recent polling shows Sanders within striking distance of Joe Biden, who has portrayed the state as his \u201cfirewall\u201d. Biden is still favored to win the Palmetto State , but if Sanders can breach his \u201cfirewall\u201d it may be the beginning of his march to the nomination. The format of tonight\u2019s debate is very similar to past debates, with candidates receiving time for responses to direct questions and rebuttals to opponents\u2019 answers. Candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer direct questions, and moderators will decide when to award candidates 45 seconds for rebuttals. CBS News has said candidates will not make opening or closing statements, but all the debate participants will get a closing question, which will likely be used as a sort of final pitch to voters. We are about 20 minutes away from the first question, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders\u2019 allies are pushing back against an Atlantic report that the Vermont senator considered a primary challenge against Barack Obama in 2012. According to the Atlantic, Sanders was seriously considering launching a White House bid against the Democratic president and had to be talked out of it by then-Senate majority leader Harry Reid. Sanders himself dismissed the story last night, saying it was \u201cnot true at all.\u201d But Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is already out with an ad highlighting the report: Patrick Leahy, a fellow Vermont senator who reportedly spoke with Sanders about his plans in the summer of 2011, said he did not \u201crecall\u201d discussing the subject: The 10th Democratic debate is just 30 minutes away. Here is a refresher on who will be on stage tonight: Bernie Sanders, the definitive frontrunner in the presidential primary who will likely be the top target for his opponents tonight after his landslide victory in Nevada last week. Joe Biden, the former vice president who is counting on a victory in South Carolina to reinvigorate his campaign after disappointing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire. Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who suffered a disastrous debate performance last week and will need to improve tonight before Super Tuesday, on which his candidacy depends. Pete Buttigieg, the former Indiana mayor who performed well in Iowa and New Hampshire but needs to prove he can win in more racially diverse states. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who was widely praised for her debate performance last week but needs to start turning those plaudits into votes as soon as possible. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who exceeded expectations in New Hampshire but finished in single digits in Nevada last week as she struggles to attract voters of color. Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist who is returning to the stage tonight after failing to qualify for the Nevada debate and has been climbing in the South Carolina polls. Those seven candidates will soon take the stage, so stay tuned. For weeks, billionaire Tom Steyer has been pouring campaign resources into South Carolina, hoping to rally conservative Democrats and African American voters away from former vice-president Joe Biden and toward him. And now he has one more big opportunity to contrast himself not only with Senator Bernie Sanders, the new frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic primary, but also Biden. Steyer did not qualify for the last Democratic debate but Tuesday night he will rejoin his rivals on the stage in South Carolina. The stakes are high for him. He\u2019s generally polled further behind his rivals in national polls, and his campaign struggled through the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. But recent polling has shown Steyer faring better in South Carolina. He\u2019s averaging in third place going into Tuesday\u2019s debate. Steyer has been directing his recent attacks at both Sanders and Biden. One ad warns Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialist plans won\u2019t beat Trump\u201d and that nothing would change in a Biden administration. The ad then pivots to Steyer\u2019s work helping \u201cblack and brown communities\u201d. In essence, the ad is an encapsulation of how the former hedge fund manager has approached South Carolina: pick at Biden\u2019s base while also contrasting himself with Sanders. He\u2019s likely to go after both candidates during Tuesday\u2019s debate. Steyer is hoping it will do more than place him behind two other candidates on election night. In an interview with NBC Nightly News set to air Tuesday night, Steyer said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get third place in South Carolina. I want to win South Carolina.\u201d \u201cI am pushing as hard as I can to see as many people and push as hard as I can to move forward in South Carolina because I think it\u2019s really important,\u201d Steyer added. \u201cIt\u2019s a diverse state. There are a lot of black people here, there are a lot of Latinos here. I think I\u2019m talking directly to them about the issues that matter and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to keep trying to do.\u201d The candidates are gathered in Charleston tonight in advance of Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, but a much more crucial test awaits them on Tuesday. Next week, 16 states and territories will hold contests for Super Tuesday, when more than 1,300 delegates will be awarded to the presidential candidates. (As a reminder, candidates need 1,991 delegates to clinch the nomination.) Although nearly five months remain until the Democratic convention, more than 60% of all delegates will be awarded by 17 March, so the next few weeks will be critical in determining the eventual nominee. That tight timeline has led many establishment Democrats to express panic that Bernie Sanders may soon gain an insurmountable delegate lead. Tonight is the last debate before Super Tuesday, so it may be the final opportunity for Sanders\u2019 opponents to throw some roadblocks in his path to the nomination. Joe Biden has long portrayed South Carolina as his \u201cfirewall,\u201d fortified by his support among black voters and particularly older black voters. But after disastrous performances in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 overwhelmingly white electorates that Biden said did not reflect the diversity of his support \u2013 and a distant second-place in Nevada, South Carolina has emerged as a must-win for the former vice president who was recently overtaken by Bernie Sanders as the frontrunner. According to several recent surveys, Biden has been bleeding support in South Carolina, so much so that he\u2019s started to say that the state is not his campaign\u2019s \u201cfirewall.\u201d An NBC News/Marist poll released yesterday showed Biden leading Sanders by just 4 points in South Carolina. Tom Steyer, the billionaire from California, has gained ground on Biden in recent weeks by spending heavily on advertising in the state. After missing a debate, Steyer qualified on Tuesday. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is you have Steyer spending hundreds of millions, tens of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, out campaigning there,\u201d Biden said in an interview on CBS News\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday. \u201cAnd so I think a lot is happening in terms of the amount of money being spent by the billionaires to try to cut into the African American vote. I think that has a lot to do with it.\u201d In the interview, Biden refused to \u201cpontificate\u201d on whether a second- or first-place finish is necessary for his campaign, though many Democrats believe a win is essential to his survival at this point. Firewall or no firewall, Biden was defiant: \u201cI\u2019m going to go all the way through this thing.\u201d Of the seven candidates on stage tonight, no one needs a strong showing more than Mike Bloomberg. The billionaire former New York mayor suffered a disastrous performance in last week\u2019s debate, his first appearance on stage since launching his campaign in late November. Bloomberg fumbled his responses to obvious lines of attack, such as his past support for \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d and his reported history of making sexist comments. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a worse showing for a presidential candidate appearing in his first debate than the one Mr Bloomberg had last week,\u201d the New York Times wrote. Bloomberg is not actually competing in the South Carolina primary, instead focusing on the 16 states and territories that will hold contests on Super Tuesday next week. However, if Bloomberg cannot improve upon his last debate performance, it may cost him votes in crucial states like California and Texas, which will each award hundreds of delegates on Tuesday. Bloomberg has previewed his strategy in recent days, releasing a digital ad criticizing Bernie Sanders\u2019 record on gun control and accusing the frontrunners\u2019 supporters of deploying divisive rhetoric. The billionaire is hoping those attack lines will land tonight. Otherwise, his campaign may turn out to be a $500m mistake. Good evening, live blog readers! The tenth Democratic debate has arrived, marking the third debate this month and the second in a week. However, the dynamics of the race have shifted since the candidates faced off last week in the most contentious debate of the election cycle yet. Bernie Sanders has cemented his status as the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination after a landslide victory in Nevada, where he defeated second-place Joe Biden by 27 points. A number of commentators have said Sanders could gain an insurmountable delegate lead on Super Tuesday next week, meaning this may be the last chance for the Vermont senator\u2019s opponents to slow his momentum. Sanders will likely find himself on the receiving end of a number of attacks, and his effectiveness at responding could determine his success in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary and beyond. The candidates will take the stage in Charleston at 8 pm ET, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "The Democratic presidential candidates engaged in a series of chaotic and fiery exchanges on Tuesday night, in the final debate before the critical South Carolina presidential primary and Super Tuesday contests that could represent a make-or-break moment. Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner who cruised to victory in Nevada last week, bore the brunt of criticism from a number of his centrist rivals, including the former vice-president Joe Biden, the ex-New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg labelled Sanders a polarizing figure in the primary and warned of a race between the self-declared Democratic socialist and Trump, who has already sought to weaponise the spectre of socialism in the run-up to the November election. \u201cIf you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders v Donald Trump,\u201d he said. The Vermont senator denied his policies were radical, and acknowledged the heat he attracted, stating wryly: \u201cI\u2019m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why.\u201d In one of the earliest exchanges, Bloomberg \u2013 who is not on the ballot in South Carolina but is seeking to make gains in the 16 states and territories voting next Tuesday \u2013 referenced recent reports to suggest that Sanders\u2019 campaign was benefiting from Russian interference in the 2020 primary. \u201cRussia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him [Trump]\u201d Bloomberg told Sanders, in an early attempt to recover from his disastrous first debate performance last week, as members of the audience jeered. Addressing his response directly to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Sanders said: \u201cIf I\u2019m president of the United States, trust me, you\u2019re not going to interfere in any more American elections.\u201d The South Carolina primary on Saturday marks the first vote in the deep south and in which African American voters form a majority of the electorate for the first time. On Super Tuesday \u2013 3 March \u2013 the candidates will be vying for more than a third of the available delegates that are key to securing the nomination \u2013 a high stakes day that has the potential to propel one candidate to solid frontrunner status and see others drop out. Biden has long courted voters in the black community, touting his record as vice-president to America\u2019s first African American president, Barack Obama. But recent polling has suggested that Sanders, buoyed by success in a multicultural electorate in Nevada, is the frontrunner with black voters nationally. Biden, who holds a slim lead in South Carolina according to recent polling, said he intended to win in the state on Saturday, and pledged to nominate an African American woman to the supreme court if elected. But he also tried to tear strips off Sanders, his closest rival in the state. Referencing the 2015 terror attack at Mother Emanuel AME church, which stands a few dozen feet from the debate stage in downtown Charleston, Biden pointed to Sanders\u2019 mixed voting record on gun control, and touted his own 1994 legislation implementing five-day waiting periods for firearms purchases. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he [Sanders] is responsible for the nine deaths [at Mother Emanuel],\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut that man [the white supremacist Dylann Roof] would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest[ed].\u201d Sanders initially tried to pivot to criticizing Biden for his record on trade deals, prompting more boos from the audience, before saying: \u201cI have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat was a bad vote.\u201d As with much of the debate there was little follow-up questioning after Sanders\u2019 significant acknowledgement, as moderators struggled to keep the candidates from interrupting each other, talking over each other, shouting, and speaking for longer than their assigned time limits. The Trump campaign quickly seized on the disorder, issuing a statement saying: \u201cThe Democrat party is a hot mess and tonight\u2019s debate was further evidence that not one of these candidates is serious or can stand toe-to-toe with President Trump.\u201d The Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, a fellow progressive, also took aim at Sanders, saying the pair agreed on a lot of things, but that she would be a \u201cbetter president\u201d. \u201cProgressives have one shot, and we need to spend it on a leader who will get something done,\u201d Warren said. Warren also renewed her attacks on Bloomberg over the billionaire philanthropist\u2019s treatment of female employees. Warren, who benefited from a surge in fundraising after her criticism of Bloomberg at last week\u2019s debate, resurfaced an allegation that he had once told a pregnant subordinate to \u201ckill it\u201d. A visibly riled Bloomberg replied: \u201cCategorically never said it.\u201d The billionaire former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, returning to the debate stage as recent polls place him third in South Carolina, was also drawn into an angry exchange with Biden, who questioned his record investing in a private prison company, a move Steyer said he also regretted. In a withering put-down, Biden referred to Steyer as \u201cTommy come lately\u201d as the billionaire pushed back and argued he had done more to support minority communities than the former vice-president. As the debate wound to a close, the candidates began to move the focus towards more pointed criticism of the Trump administration, particularly the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The Minnesota senator, Amy Klobuchar, criticized the administration\u2019s funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US government agency responsible for helping prevent global outbreaks. She argued that the president \u201chasn\u2019t really yet addressed the nation on this topic\u201d and urged the administration to work on better quarantine and treatment plans. Shortly after the debate, Trump, seemingly listening in to the discussion, tweeted: \u201cCDC and my administration are doing a GREAT job handling Coronavirus \u2026\u201d",

Most of the rest of them are like Joe Biden: they just think it\u2019s their turn to talk. Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist",

The University of Melbourne has offered to reimburse expenses related to forfeited flights, accommodation and remote study workarounds by those students who have been affected by the Australian government\u2019s continuing ban on entry to foreign nationals who have travelled through mainland China. The ban has been in force since 1 February and extended twice. It is due to expire on 29 February but is being reviewed weekly. Australian citizens and permanent residents are exempt from the ban. The University of Melbourne is the third Australian university to offer financial assistance to stranded students. The University of Adelaide emailed its affected students last week to offer \u201ccare packages\u201d including discounted fees and a financial contribution towards air fares of up to $2,000. It also offered to completely refund semester fees to any student who couldn\u2019t make it onto campus by the end of semester due to the outbreak. On Friday, Western Sydney University announced it was \u201cencouraging its students \u2013 who are currently offshore, and impacted by travel restrictions \u2013 to consider the option of travelling to Australia via another country\u201d and that it was offering a one-off $1,500 subsidy to assist them. Australian universities have come under particular pressure from the effects of the coronavirus outbreak due to their economic reliance on international, full-fee-paying students. Universities are facing an estimated $1.2bn hit to fee revenue from an estimated 65,800 students at risk of cancelling their enrolment due to being stuck outside the country. The University of Melbourne provost, Prof Mark Considine, said in a statement that the university\u2019s \u201cnumber one priority\u201d was the health and wellbeing of the university community. \u201cWe understand this has been a difficult time for students who have been affected and we are working hard to ensure they can complete their studies on time,\u201d Considine said. \u201cThe student support grants are intended to help students with unanticipated expenses incurred as a result of the travel restrictions related to Covid-19 and to help students transition to or return to study at the University of Melbourne,\u201d he said. The grant would help students with accommodation costs, fees associated with flight changes, costs incurred during the mandatory 14-day self-isolation period, and technology upgrades to help with remote study. Students needed to be scheduled for on-campus study in the summer term or semester one of this year to be eligible to access the grant. The government has said it will consider relaxing the travel ban at the end of the month. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, announced a slight relaxation to the ban on Saturday to allow Chinese students in years 11 or 12 \u2013 other than those from Hubei province, the locus of the outbreak \u2013 to return to Australia. An estimated 400 year 12 students and 360 year 11 students enrolled in Australian schools were stuck outside the country due to the travel ban and are now eligible to apply for an exemption. The travel ban is due to be reviewed again in the coming days.",

In its first full-year results since the $4bn merger with Fairfax, Nine reported revenue of just under $1.2bn, group Ebitda (pre-tax earnings) of $251m and a net profit after tax of $114m.

Nine is moving away from linear television and \u201cevolving towards digital distribution\u201d because almost 40% of the media company\u2019s earnings now come from digital platforms, including catch-up TV 9Now, streaming platform Stan, real estate brand Domain, and the websites of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Marks said. Despite competition from new players including Disney+, Apple TV and Amazon Prime, Stan is growing in subscribers and revenue, recording 1.8m subscribers at the end of December. Nine\u2019s free-to-air channels will concentrate on the more profitable content in a digital era, regular sport like NRL, news and current affairs and local reality shows like Married at First Sight, he said.

On Wednesday, Seven chief executive James Warburton called on the government to urgently review the local content quotas the free-to-air broadcasters are subject to in return for their TV licenses. In an extraordinary move Warburton threatened the government the network would stop making children\u2019s television and could be in breach of requirements which say all broadcasters must produce 390 hours of kids TV a year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear for a long time that the children\u2019s content quota was not a sustainable one for us and the wider commercial television industry in Australia,\u201d Warburton told Nine newspapers.",

      "bodyText": "A non-native goat-like animal is destroying New Zealand\u2019s fragile alpine regions, and government culling has been unable to keep up with its population booms. The Himalayan tahr was introduced to New Zealand in 1904 as hunting game for sports shooters, and has thrived in the rugged, alpine environment of the South Island. The tahr\u2019s significant weight and solid hooves are destroying precious snow tussock in sub-alpine regions. Numbers have reached 35,000, despite a government tahr control plan committing to keep numbers at 10,000. As well as trampling native flora, tahr also snack on threatened alpine vegetation such as the the Mount Cook buttercup, the scree buttercup and Ranunculus acraeus. \u201cTahr are social animals and can move in large groups browsing alpine herbs, tussocks and shrubs,\u201d said James Holborow, from the Department of Conservation (DoC). \u201cThey have a patchy effect across the landscape, but large groups of animals can transform tall tussocks and sub-alpine shrublands to a grassy turf or bare ground.\u201d Last year hunters, helicopter pilots and government conservation staff joined forces in a controversial attempt to control tahr numbers, with 12,000 animals shot since July 2019. The tahr-control plan has caused tension among the outdoor community in New Zealand. Many hunters have protested at the government killing their favourite game targets, as have some animal rights activists. In a petition objecting to the tahr cull, hunters accused the government of \u201cdestroying more than 100 years of New Zealand heritage and culture\u201d. Capitulating to objections, the government reduced their initial target from 17,000 to 10,000, but says further culling is necessary to save the mountains. Ingrid Gruner, a DoC ecologist, said the changes tahr made to alpine areas were dramatic and \u201cheartbreaking\u201d, with Zora canyon on the west coast of the country\u2019s South Island a prime example of the destruction wrought by the animals, who are native to India and Nepal. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see the change over time,\u201d Gruner said. \u201cWhen we last visited the Zora canyon, it more closely resembled a rough paddock than tall tussock grassland. \u201cTahr are a relatively heavy animal and when they mob together they compact the ground.

A briefing document to back the letter, coordinated by The Australia Institute thinktank, argues logging in wet eucalypt forests promotes more flammable regrowth. Dr Jennifer Sanger, a forest ecologist who is in Canberra today to deliver the letter told Guardian Australia: \u201cAs we face this climate crisis, we see our forests are worth far more standing. \u201cWe have to start taking this climate emergency more seriously and protective native forests is a simple step we could take and in my mind, a logical call.\u201d Some experts told Guardian Australia they disagreed, saying it could effectively rule out one potential response to managing forests in the face of climate change.

If we don\u2019t get this right in 2020 you can open a decade or longer of a descent into fascism. And it will be global because platforms are global.\u201d</p> <p>As Ressa tells it, Duterte\u2019s foray into social media began in earnest in January 2016, six months before the election, when executives from Facebook flew in to train presidential campaign teams. For the Philippines, with its population of 105 million, Facebook is the internet. Everyone who is online has a page. The platform often comes pre-installed on mobile phones.</p> <p>Already into his seventies, Duterte embraced the new medium. With a fraction of the campaign spend of previous presidents, his team used online engagement to dominate the debate. At first he courted Rappler, but after his election, there was a falling out. Duterte supporters began using the word \u201cpresstitute\u201d to slander reporters critical of his methods.</p> <p>In August 2016, Ressa travelled to Facebook\u2019s regional headquarters in Singapore with her initial list of 26 suspected fake accounts, all supporting Duterte, which she estimated had in turn influenced 3m other accounts. She asked for them to be taken down. No action was taken.</p> <p>Days later, a bomb killed 14 people in Duterte\u2019s home town, Davao City. Ressa\u2019s team noticed his followers were posting links to the same article, entitled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/127132-man-bomb-nabbed-davao-checkpoint\">Man with bomb nabbed at Davao checkpoint</a>\u201d. The headline gave the impression the government had acted quickly. It was a false impression: the article was five months old.</p> <p>Using data and human sources, Rappler uncovered the campaign\u2019s online architecture. Created for the election, it appears to have been maintained after Duterte entered office. At its core, a volunteer network of more than 400 individuals was organised into four groups, three for the main Filipino islands and another for the country\u2019s diaspora of overseas workers. Each group created its own content, but followed key daily messages issued from the centre.</p> <p>Duterte\u2019s campaign claimed to have used only unpaid volunteers. But Rappler sources alleged there were trolls being paid 100,000 pesos (\u00a31,500) per month, twice the average salary. Real-world influencers allegedly served as the main centres of attacks, their tweets and posts amplified by armies of fake and genuine accounts. Some of those influencers have since been awarded government posts.</p> <p>In October 2016, <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/148007-propaganda-war-weaponizing-internet\">Ressa began to publish her findings</a>. The retaliation was immediate. She was inundated with hate messages, up to 90 per hour, threatening rape, murder and violence against her family. Over the next year, she spoke to 50 Facebook executives, urging them to rein in the disinformation and verbal attacks. She lunched with Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. To no avail \u2013 the troll pages remained online.</p> <p>In 2017, Duterte used his state of the nation address to <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/176565-sona-2017-duterte-rappler-ownership\">attack Rappler by name</a>. In February 2018, Rappler\u2019s correspondent was shut out from government briefings. Its regional reporters were then blocked from attending any Duterte events.</p> <p>Finally, in October 2018, Facebook took action. It announced the removal of a \u201cspam network\u201d, comprising 95 pages and 39 accounts in the Philippines. A further 200 pages, groups and accounts were removed in March 2019. But the reason given was not disinformation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b489da1696b0dcef03d5c2e35d1e1575547ead87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b489da1696b0dcef03d5c2e35d1e1575547ead87/0_324_4856_2913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, responds to a question directed toward him by Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Capitol Hill in October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, responds to a question from the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Capitol Hill in October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The removal was triggered by what Facebook described as \u201c<a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/cib-from-the-philippines/\">coordinated inauthentic behaviour</a>\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe toughest part is not knowing whether it\u2019s going to be a normal day, or a not normal day,\u201d says Maria Ressa, speaking by phone from her office in Manila. A former CNN bureau chief who spent two decades as an investigative reporter, Ressa is the founder of a news website that has found itself on the frontline of the global disinformation wars. Since the summer of 2016, her reporters at Rappler have been engaged in a running battle with paid trolls, influencers, bot armies and fake news websites run by supporters of Rodrigo Duterte, the authoritarian president of the Philippines. Launched on Facebook in 2012, before emerging as a fully fledged news website with a monthly audience of 12 million, Rappler was among the first publications anywhere in the world to shine a light on how a populist leader could harness social media to win power. Ressa\u2019s commitment to exposing corruption, propaganda and thousands of extrajudicial killings sanctioned by Duterte in his self-proclaimed \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has made her some powerful enemies. But her determination to speak has also won her many allies. In 2018, she was one of a group of journalists named as Time magazine\u2019s person of the year. All of the others lauded by the US journal were at that point either dead or in detention. Ressa lives every day knowing that both of these fates could befall her. Security measures have been increased six times at Rappler\u2019s offices in the past year, and Ressa has protection at home, too. A Princeton graduate raised in the US, she is a dual national. Returning to the US might be the safest option. But for now, it is not on the cards. \u201cI hate it, but I can\u2019t leave. This time matters. It\u2019s why we do what we do.\u201d On 3 April, Ressa will learn the outcome of a libel trial brought against her. If she loses, the sentence is a maximum of 12 years: in the Philippines, defamation remains a criminal offence. Other regime-led prosecutions are pending, for allegations ranging from tax offences to foreign ownership. She has been arrested and bailed eight times in the past year. Ressa has assembled a formidable defence team of 40 lawyers, including the London barrister Amal Clooney. If found guilty on all counts, she faces up to 83 years in prison. She is braced: \u201cI\u2019m preparing to lose every case here. They could shut us down tomorrow. But we will fight everything, both in court and by telling stories. Our fame is our only protection.\u201d Rappler is not alone in feeling the heat. In a sign that the outlook for independent journalism in the Philippines is fast deteriorating, the solicitor general filed a complaint on Monday against ABS-CBN, which could lead to the broadcaster losing its licence. The online playbook developed by Duterte, 74, while he was still a city mayor has by now become familiar. It is being repeated the world over, with populist leaders from Donald Trump to Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro adopting its toxic mix of viral disinformation and intimidation of independent media. In the UK, there are parallels with the tactics employed during the EU referendum, and more recently the bullying of the BBC and other media by the team that surrounds Boris Johnson. But Duterte\u2019s campaign preceded the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s election. Rappler was discovering the playbook as it was being written. It did so by mapping Duterte\u2019s hidden networks, an effort that eventually led to the creation of a monitoring tool capable of scraping information from across the internet. Rappler\u2019s Sharktank database began as a spreadsheet listing 26 suspected fake accounts, and has evolved into a vast information-gathering machine. As of October, it had captured data on posts and comments from 6,000 public Facebook groups and 48,000 public Facebook pages, alongside links posted each day from more than 2,700 separate websites. \u201cI feel like a Cassandra,\u201d says Ressa. While her personality is sunny, her prophecies are bleak. She believes that the rise of hard-right leaders has been made possible by the failures of those who control the web\u2019s biggest forums. \u201cIf the social media platforms don\u2019t take the gatekeeping seriously they will kill the public sphere. If we don\u2019t get this right in 2020 you can open a decade or longer of a descent into fascism. And it will be global because platforms are global.\u201d As Ressa tells it, Duterte\u2019s foray into social media began in earnest in January 2016, six months before the election, when executives from Facebook flew in to train presidential campaign teams. For the Philippines, with its population of 105 million, Facebook is the internet. Everyone who is online has a page. The platform often comes pre-installed on mobile phones.

The company\u2019s chief marketing and customer officer, Mike Tod, said in the announcement that the product would be aimed at some of Air New Zealand\u2019s longest haul flights, including the Auckland to New York service launching next year \u2013 the flight takes 17 hours and 40 minutes. Tod said when that route launches Air New Zealand will make a decision on whether to go ahead with the Skynest. The cost of the Skynest for customers has yet to be determined, a spokeswoman for Air New Zealand told Guardian Australia, but it would be separate to the cost of booking a seat on the flight. \u201cThe concept is designed as a pod you go to during the flight,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will still have your economy seat separately for the other portion of the flight.\u201d Customers could book a session in the bed during the flight, rather than the whole flight, the spokeswoman said, and the cabin crew would change and freshen up the pods with new bedding for each session. The airline would need to get it certified with regulators before passengers can expect to climb into the in-air beds. \u201cBut it was a prize worth chasing and one that we think has the potential to be a game-changer for economy class travellers on all airlines around the world,\u201d said Air New Zealand\u2019s head of airline programmes, Kerry Reeves. If the product takes off, Air New Zealand has said it is open to licensing the Skynest to other airlines. The Auckland to New York flight results in 650kg of CO2 emissions per passenger, according to the UN\u2019s carbon emissions calculator. Air New Zealand had not immediately responded to a request to confirm the amount. Qantas has indicated its economy seats for the A350, which will be used for the mega long haul flights launching in 2023 between Sydney and London and Sydney and New York will be a bit more roomy with an extra 3cm in width than the current economy seats. Air New Zealand is not the first airline to attempt to reform passengers\u2019 in-air experience. Last year, Collins Aerospace announced the launch of a \u201cself-serve social zone\u201d, which would see aircraft doorways transformed into snack and drink bars for passengers to socialise and fuel up mid-flight. The innovation won Collins Aerospace a position in the final of 2019\u2019s Crystal Cabin Awards \u2013 the awards for aircraft interior innovation \u2013 alongside Airbus, who announced plans to introduce sleeping berths in the cargo decks of their planes. The designs included a lounge, conference room, medical care zone and kids and family area, built on the lower deck of Airbus aircrafts. However, not all proposals have been so well-received. In 2012, Ryanair\u2019s plan to offer standing-only tickets, with hand rails and straps like those on the London Underground in the place of seat belts, was scrapped after regulators prevented the airline from trialling its designs.",

A passenger on the train who was in the second carriage, Charmaine Bolte, said prior to the derailment passengers were handed cards with the Transport NSW phone number and website, and were encouraged to make a complaint about the service, including delays due to signalling problems. \u201cTrain staff were very concerned about the delays and stops and starts,\u201d Bolte said. \u201cBefore the crash they were asking passengers to complain, telling people who did not have the internet to call Transport NSW and tell them they were blind so that they would not be fobbed off and would have to write down the complaint for them. \u201cThey explained all about the faults and nothing being done about them. Both the driver and train staff were apologetic about the train being late and all of the stops. Most passengers were very good about it.\u201d Investigators will examine the signalling, maintenance of the train and railway line, and the speed of the train prior to the incident. It was earlier revealed that on 3 February, Kennedy wrote to his friend, Australian National University professor Clive Williams, that numerous trips along the same rail line had been precarious. \u201cMy last six Melbourne return trips have been very late or cancelled mainly due to train fault issues, three of the six runs I was down to one engine, on another trip I had no speedo and the only trip without a train fault was disrupted by the big derailment last week,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau will release a preliminary report after 30 days, ahead of a final report due in 18 months.",

Although open justice always has been important, New Zealand is a small country where everyone seems to know everyone else and so that puts a premium on controlling information.</p> <p>Publish that someone is facing trial or has been convicted of an offence, and the entire country may quickly learn of it. Anything else that person might have done in the past could then filter into the jury room. And there\u2019s no heaving crowds in which to hide from the social stigma of a criminal charge or subsequent conviction.</p> <p>The New Zealand Law Commission <a href=\"https://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/projectAvailableFormats/NZLC%20R109.pdf\">considered such historical reasons</a> for controlling trial information in 2008. Following from its report, the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 then reformed when suppression orders may be given.</p> <p>It empowers a judge to <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0081/latest/DLM3360346.html\">issue an order</a> forbidding the publication of identifying details for people charged with, convicted or acquitted of an offence.</p> <p>Such suppression orders <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0081/latest/DLM3360347.html\">are mandatory</a> in relation to some sexual offences, if the publication of an accused\u2019s identity would lead to a victim\u2019s identification.

      "bodyText": "British backpacker Grace Millane\u2019s murderer was last week sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years. However, the killer\u2019s identity has not been published in New Zealand. When convicting Millane\u2019s killer, Justice Simon Moore extended an existing suppression order that not only prohibits his naming, but also the reasons for making it. Why is this so? Surely if someone is being tried for a crime and the public can freely sit in the court to watch events unfold, then it should be fully reported without restriction? Especially, you might think, after the trial has ended and a verdict has been pronounced. New Zealand has a history of suppressing the publication of information about those facing trial, and even after conviction, that is quite different to many other jurisdictions. Although open justice always has been important, New Zealand is a small country where everyone seems to know everyone else and so that puts a premium on controlling information. Publish that someone is facing trial or has been convicted of an offence, and the entire country may quickly learn of it. Anything else that person might have done in the past could then filter into the jury room. And there\u2019s no heaving crowds in which to hide from the social stigma of a criminal charge or subsequent conviction. The New Zealand Law Commission considered such historical reasons for controlling trial information in 2008. Following from its report, the Criminal Procedure Act 2011 then reformed when suppression orders may be given. It empowers a judge to issue an order forbidding the publication of identifying details for people charged with, convicted or acquitted of an offence. Such suppression orders are mandatory in relation to some sexual offences, if the publication of an accused\u2019s identity would lead to a victim\u2019s identification. For any other offending, orders only can be issued if publication would have at least one of a set of specific consequences. These include that publication would be likely to cause extreme hardship to the defendant or a person connected with the defendant, cast suspicion on another person, cause undue hardship for a victim, create a real risk of an unfair trial or endanger someone\u2019s safety. Even where such consequences are established, the court can still decline to make a suppression order if countervailing interests prevail. And so most often name suppression only lasts the duration of the trial and is lifted upon a conviction. That\u2019s because the court of appeal has on a number of occasions emphasised that \u201cthe test [for permanent suppression] \u2026 is a demanding one. It places the emphasis very much on the importance of an open justice system and requires a real risk of \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 to be established before the court may consider suppression\u201d. In particular, addressing public concern that name suppression was too easily available for the rich and famous, the Criminal Justice Act specifically states that: \u201cThe fact that a defendant is well known does not, of itself, mean that publication of his or her name will result in extreme hardship.\u201d Consequently, the number of people winning permanent name suppression in New Zealand\u2019s courts has declined by some 40% in the last decade. Far from being an increasingly common phenomenon, permanent name suppression is actually a practice on the slide. Whether it is a practice that can survive in an era of Facebook, Google and Instagram is another question altogether. While the justice minister Andrew Little is endeavouring to create an agreement that enforces suppression orders on overseas media, the behemoths of the internet are harder to tame. In particular, their ability to operate in New Zealand from behind the protection of the US first amendment means there are very few legal sanctions this country can bring to bear on them. Meaning that any compliance with our courts\u2019 suppression orders is, in effect, voluntary.

In a move unlikely to further endear the Iranians to the Trump administration, Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister for international and legal affairs Mohsen Baharvand told the Conference on Disarmament in the UN building in Geneva said that \u201cSuch provocative actions must be condemned\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA new nuclear arms race is being accelerated\u201d, he added.</p> <p>The US Defense Department confirmed earlier this month that the Navy had fielded a low-yield, submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead.

David Lauter at the LA Times has written about the widespread support Sanders enjoys among communities of colour in California, outstripping his nearest Democratic rivals. Of the poll he says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe survey offers an unusual level of detail on the views of Latino, African Americans and Asian and Pacific Americans in California, groups that in many opinion surveys are too small to analyze. It provides strong evidence of the Vermont senator\u2019s ability to build a multiracial, multiethnic coalition in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>It also reveals that support for Sanders is generationally split, regardless of ethnicity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAmong Latinos younger than 50, for example, Sanders enjoyed roughly a 3-1 lead over Bloomberg when poll respondents were asked whom they would most like to see as the next president. Latinos 50 and older were divided closely between Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg.

So far he has said that India doesn\u2019t have \u201cmuch of a problem\u201d with coronavirus, and has suggested that there has been tremendous praise for the peace efforts in Afghanistan. He says he plans to bring the troop presence down to 8,600 in the country.</p> <p>On other foreign policy issues he has urged Iran to crack down on Isis, and says that he has a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister. He says he is willing to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.</p> <p>Trump also says he has discussed the issue of religious freedom with India\u2019s Narendra Modi. The bakdrop to this Trump visit has included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/delhi-rocked-by-deadly-protests-during-donald-trumps-india-visit\">violent scenes on India\u2019s streets as people protest a new citizenship law</a> which many say is discriminatory against Muslims.</p> <p>On trade Trump declares that India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world. He singles out Harley Davidson, saying they have to pay a \u201cTremendous tariff\u201d when they sell to India. If a trade deal is to happen with India, he says, it will be towards the end of the year. Trump insists that the \u201cUnited States has to be treated fairly\u201d and that deals have to be reciprocal. \u201cWe have a large deficit of $24bn with India. That is very high.\u201d</p> <p>He has also mentioned yesterday\u2019s Harvey Weinstein verdict, describing it as \u201ca great victory, sends a very very strong message\u201d.

      "bodyText": "As the CDC warned of \u201csevere disruption\u201d in case of a coronavirus update, lawmakers criticized the administration\u2019s response plan as inadequate. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was grilled earlier today by senators and criticized for lacking substantive answers to questions about how the US would handle an outbreak. Two abortion bills failed in the Senate; one would have banned abortions after 20 weeks, and the other players into misconceptions about the procedure in mandating that doctors treat babies that survive failed abortions. Doctors do not provide abortions to patients in labor and it is pretty much impossible for a baby to be born alive after a failed abortion. Ahead of the Democratic debate and the South Carolina primary, the civil rights leader Rev Jesse Jackson defended Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as well as the idea of \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d. Frontrunner Sanders is bracing for attacks from his opponents tonight during the crucial primary debate in Charleston, South Carolina. The Guardian\u2019s politics team will be providing live updates and analysis during the debate. Follow our debate liveblog: Mike Bloomberg to speak at pro-Israel lobby\u2019s conference Bloomberg will be speaking at the conference for the influential pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the group confirmed. This weekend, Bernie Sanders, who has never attended an Aipac conference, said that the group gives a platform to leaders who \u201cwho express bigotry and oppose basic Palestinian rights\u201d. The pro-Israel group has previously run Trun ads targeting the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign in California, Texas and Florida. In response to Sanders\u2019 recent comments, Aipac put out a statement condemning his views as \u201ctruly shameful\u201d. In 2016, all the presidential candidates except Sanders address the conference and in 2012, Barack Obama and all the GOP candidates participated despite the event overlapping with Super Tuesday (as it will this year). Elizabeth Warren has also said she\u2019s not going, and the other candidates have yet to confirm their attendance. Reverend Jesse Jackson: \u2018Democratic socialism isn\u2019t socialism, it\u2019s democratic\u2019 Ahead of the South Carolina primary, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson has written an op-ed for the Chicago Sun-Times to clarify that Bernie Sanders \u201cisn\u2019t talking about making America into Cuba or Venezuela\u201d. Sanders is \u201ctalking about extending social guarantees like those offered in most other advanced industrial states, invoking Denmark or Sweden. These countries have universal health care at a lower cost, paid family leave, guaranteed paid vacations, higher minimum wages, more generous public retirement programs,\u201d Jackson writes. \u201cThey also have vibrant and competitive economies, lower inequality, less poverty, and higher life expectancies.\u201d The Vermont senator recently drew bipartisan criticism for emphasizing the literacy drives under Fidel Castro and claiming \u201cit\u2019s unfair to simply say everything is bad\u201d about the communist state. Jackson emphasized that Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are proposing a \u201cmodern version of what Franklin D Roosevelt called the Economic Bill of Rights: Medicare for all, tuition-free public education, universal daycare, a Green New Deal to generate jobs while addressing climate change.\u201d San Francisco declares a state of emergency over coronavirus concerns Although no coronavirus cases have been confirmed in San Francisco, \u201cthe global picture is changing rapidly, and we need to step-up preparedness\u201d, said mayor London Breed. \u201cWe see the virus spreading in new parts of the world every day, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm.\u201d Lawmakers in DC have been arguing over the administration\u2019s plan to stem coronavirus, which Democrats have said isn\u2019t enough. The extent to which the virus could spread in the US is unclear, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that an outbreak could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d and urged communities to start preparing. \u201cAs more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder,\u201d said Nancy Messonnier, the head of immunization at the CDC Donald Trump, in India earlier today, told journalists that the coronavirus is \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. Second abortion bill fails in Senate Another abortion bill, which would have required medical providers to \u201cexercise the proper degree of care\u201d if a child survives an abortion has been blocked in the Senate. Democrats Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Doug Jones of Alabama voted with all the Republicans in this case. Jones, a vulnerable Democratic senator from a red state, has found himself in the difficult position of either alienating his own base of Democrats or anti-choice independents whose votes he needs to keep his seat. The \u201cborn alive\u201d bill in question here plays into misconceptions about late abortions. Doctors do not provide abortions to patients who are in labor. And It is essentially impossible for babies to survive failed abortions, and if a baby did survive the process, it\u2019s would be standard procedure to care for the infant like any other patient. Here\u2019s everything that\u2019s happened today: After coming out with a plan to dedicate $2.5bn to fighting and preventing coronavirus, Donald Trump and Democrats have been in a spat about whether the White House\u2019s measures will be strong enough to prevent an outbreak. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has been the most vocal critic, saying Trump isn\u2019t taking the issue seriously. In response, Trump said that Schumer would complain if he asked for more. Though Roger Stone was sentenced to 40 weeks in prison last week, his trial continues as a judge rules whether the former political operative can have a new trial due to alleged juror misconduct. The judge criticized Trump for tweeting about a juror on the case, while Trump said the judge is biased. The Democratic candidates are gearing up for a heated debate tonight, one that will likely see blows dealt to senator Bernie Sanders, who is thought of as the current front-runner in the case. Mike Bloomberg, who was seen as the punching bag of last week\u2019s debate, sent out surrogates today to criticize Sanders. Meanwhile, Bloomberg\u2019s long-term partner Diana Taylor told a reporter in an interview that those who are concerned about allegations against him should \u201cget over it\u201d. A group of former US senators are calling on the men and women they once called colleagues to come together and rise above the partisan moment. \u201cCongress is not fulfilling its Constitutional duties,\u201d the letter says. \u201cMuch of the responsibility rests on the Senate.\u201d The letter encourages the 100-person body to create a \u201cbipartisan caucus\u201d committed to breaking the partisan gridlock that has paralyzed Congress in recent years. \u201cThe Senate\u2019s abdication of its legislative and oversight responsibilities erodes the checks and balances of the separate powers that are designed to protect the liberties on which our democracy depends,\u201d the letter states. They write that morale is low and that they\u2019ve spoken to incumbents who have doubted whether there is \u201cany point in continuing to serve\u201d and potential candidates have questioned whether \u201cthe reality of Senate membership is worth the considerable effort and expense of running for office. Among those who signed the letter are former senators Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican whose criticism of Donald Trump hampered his re-election, Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska and the former Secretary of Defense under Obama, Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota who lost her seat in 2018, and Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who also lost her seat in 2018. \u201cOversight and public policy are responsibilities of the legislative branch,\u201d Hagel wrote in a statement. \u201cThis is the Senate\u2019s constitutional duty. Anything less is an abdication of its responsibilities.\u201d The writers nodded to the deeply partisan reality of the moment, when Republicans\u2019 fear of reprisal from the president has forced many of them to toe the party line. \u201cWe know that accepting this challenge may put some of you at political risk,\u201d they write. \u201cBut we are also confident that each of you chose to serve in public life to advance the cause of a \u2018more perfect union.\u2019 Our hope is that all of you will accept this challenge to advance that timeless and higher purpose. The Senate\u2014and the proper functioning of our Republic\u2014are simply too important to be allowed to continue on their present course.\u201d Bill banning abortions after 20 weeks falls in Senate A bill banning abortion at after 20 weeks failed to get enough votes in the Senate this afternoon. Sixty votes were needed for the bill. Though abortion is a highly partisan issue in Washington, two people from each party crossed party lines. Democrats Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted in favor of the bill, while Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against it. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell likely brought the bill, and a second anti-abortion bill that requires medical providers to \u201cexercise the proper degree of care\u201d if a child survives an abortion or attempted abortion, to spark energy around the issue amongst conservatives. DHS secretary grilled over coronavirus preparedness Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was grilled earlier today by a Republican senator about coronavirus and the US preparedness against the spread of the illness. The department has been put in charge of coordinating efforts to taper the spread of coronavirus. \u201cYou\u2019re head of homeland security, do we have enough respirators or not?\u201d asked Republican Senator John Neely Kennedy. \u201cI would refer you to [Health and Human Services] for that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cSecretary, you\u2019re supposed to keep us safe,\u201d Kennedy said in response. In a Tweet reply, a DHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe Senator should direct medical questions to HHS and CDC. DHS\u2019s role is primarily related to air, land and sea ports.\u201d Tweeting while aboard Air Force One on his way back from India, Donald Trump just doubled down on his attack against the jury foreman in the case of Roger Stone, long-time GOP political operative and former Trump confidant, and said the judge in the case is also biased against him. This afternoon, the judge on the case, Amy Berman Jackson, criticized Trump\u2019s original tweet attacking Tomeka Hart, who revealed herself to by the jury foreman on the case earlier this month. Trump said that the \u201cfore person in the jury, in the Roger Stone case, had significant bias\u201d and criticized the justice department for its handling of the case. Jackson rebuked Trump for attacking Hart, who he did not mention by name, in a public matter. \u201cIn a highly publicized political climate\u2026 the risk of harassment and intimidation of any juror\u201d is high, she said. While Jackson sentenced Stone to 40 months in prison for seven felony charges, including lying to Congress and tampering with a witness, Stone has not been sent to prison. He is currently waiting on a request to have a new trial, which his team is trying to get by alleging juror misconduct. That Trump said in his Tweet this afternoon that he believes Jackson is biased against him furthers a rift between Trump and his attorney general, Bill Barr, who heads the justice department. In an interview with ABC News, Barr said that \u201cpublic statements and tweets made about the department\u2026 about cases pending in the department and about the judges before whom we have cases make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the department that we\u2019re doing our work with integrity.\u201d He also said, \u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases\u201d -- advice that Trump has clearly not heeded. Back to the 2020 election: Comments made by Diana Taylor, Mike Bloomberg\u2019s long-time partner, on the reported nondisclosure agreements with women who accused his company of discrimination and harassment is giving ammunition to his critics. In an interview with CBS News, Taylor said that none of the nondisclosure agreements accuse Bloomberg of \u201csaying something nasty to a woman\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not who he is. Life has changed. I grew up in that world. It was bro culture,\u201d Taylor said. When asked what she would say to people who have concerns about the allegations. \u201cIt was 30 years ago, get over it!\u201d she said. In a later statement, a spokesperson for Taylor said that she \u201coffered her personal view from her forty years working in finance, not the view of the campaign.\u201d Mitt Romney: US is \u2018substantially underinvesting\u2019 in preventing coronavirus outbreak Senator Mitt Romney, who recently made headlines for being the sole GOP senator to vote for Donald Trump\u2019s removal from office, said that the US is \u201csubstantially underinvesting\u201d in preventing an outbreak, according to The Hill. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in the degree to which we\u2019ve prepared for a pandemic both in terms of protective equipment and would help people once they are infected,\u201d Romney said. Romney\u2019s fellow Republicans have indicated they are happy with the president\u2019s response to the illness. \u201cIt\u2019s $2.5bn. If it\u2019s not enough, we\u2019ll appropriate more. We have to have a balance here,\u201d said senator Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions Committee, earlier today. Senator Chuck Schumer took his criticisms of Donald Trump\u2019s response to coronavirus to the Senate floor this afternoon, saying that the administration\u2019s response to the virus has been tainted with \u201ctowering and dangerous incompetence\u201d. \u201cThe Trump administration has no plan to deal with the coronavirus, no plan and seemingly no urgency to develop one,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe Trump administration is trying to build an airplane while already mid-flight.\u201d Earlier this morning, Trump tweeted that \u201cCryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer\u201d is \u201cincompetent\u201d and would complain if Trump asked for more funding. The political battle over the US response to coronavirus began yesterday when the White House announced they are requesting Congress approve $2.5bn to address a potential outbreak, with $1.25m coming from new funding and the rest coming from other areas within the Department of Health and Human Services budget. Republicans have indicated they are happy with this plan, while Democrats have said it\u2019s not enough. Earlier this afternoon, officials from the US Center for Disease Control warned in a press conference that an outbreak could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d in the lives of ordinary Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more exactly when this will happen,\u201d an official said about the potential spread of the illness. Roger Stone to make case for a new trial At 2pm, Roger Stone, a longtime Republican political operative and confidant to Donald Trump, will be asking a Washington D.C. court for a new trial. Stone was sentenced last week to 40 months in prison for seven felony charges, including lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. But a Facebook post from the jury foreperson has complicated the trial\u2019s end. Tomeka Hart identified herself on a Facebook post and said that she wanted to break her silence. Hart, a program officer at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said that she \u201ccan\u2019t keep quiet any longer\u2026 I want to stand up for Aaron Zelinsky, Adam Jed, Michael Marando and Jonathan Kravis \u2013 the prosecutors on the Roger Stone trial.\u201d Other Facebook posts from Hart showed she called the president and his supporters racist and had mentioned Stone\u2019s arrest before she was seated on the jury. Trump said later that it was clear that Hart \u201chad significant bias\u201d. Stone is fighting for a new trial while outside of prison, though he was already sentenced. Bloomberg team revving up battle with Bernie The battle billionaire Michael Bloomberg is preparing to launch against senators Bernie Sanders is slowly being revealed today in anticipation of tonight\u2019s debate. Timothy O\u2019Brien, a senior advisor on Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, told CNN that though Sanders has risen in the polls because of his track record, he has \u201call this loopy stuff in his background.\u201d \u201cSaying things like you know, women get cancer from getting too many orgasms or toddlers should run around naked and touch each others genitals,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d the host asked incredulously. O\u2019Brien continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the loony side of Bernie,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. He continued on with attacks on Sanders policies, saying that he has \u201cnot been good on immigration\u201d and backed that 1994 crime bill that was largely seen as discriminatory toward black and brown Americans. The attacks on Sanders shows the effect that the candidate is having on his fellow candidates, who see him as the current front-runner. In South Carolina, a group of Bloomberg surrogates held a press conference, saying that people will \u201csee a 180 degree shift tonight\u201d during the debate. Responding to a question about Stop and Frisk, US Rep Greg Meeks told reporters, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to question Michael Bloomberg for what he\u2019s done in the past, you have to question everyone else.\u201d At a press conference in India, Donald Trump covered a broad range of topics, including the recent conviction of disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein. \u201cI think that from the standpoint of women, I think it was a great thing,\u201d Trump said of the conviction, which found Weinstein guilty of two sexual assault charges. \u201cIt was a great victory and sends a very strong message \u2013 a very, very strong message.\u201d Trump named the Democrats that Weinstein was tied to, including Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. Before his downfall, Weinstein was known as a major Democratic donor, helping to finance Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. From India, Donald Trump lashed out this morning at US senator Chuck Schumer for criticizing him on his response to the coronavirus. In a tweet, Trump calls the senator, who he refers to as \u201cCryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer\u201d, \u201cincompetent\u201d. Trump is asking Congress for $2.5bn to respond to the illness. The administration is requesting $1.25bn of new funding and get $535m from the Ebola preparedness account and the rest of the money from the Department of Health and Human Services budget. In India, Trump told reporters that the US is in \u201cvery good shape\u201d to handle coronavirus and that the US has \u201cvery few people with it\u201d. \u201cI think the whole situation will start working out. Lots of talent, lots of brain power is being put behind it,\u201d he said. Democrats have been vocal critics of the White House\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying the money allocated to preventing a more severe outbreak is not enough. Schumer tweeted that Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus is \u201ctoo little too late\u201d and slammed Trump for \u201ctrying to steal funds dedicated to fight Ebola\u201d, saying that it is proof that the administration is not taking the coronavirus seriously. A barrage of criticism from the Democrats followed. \u201cAmericans need a coordinated, fully-funded, whole-of-government response to keep them and their loved ones safe,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted last night. The virus has 14 confirmed cases in the United States. In response to Schumer, Trump said \u201cIf I asked for more he would say it is too much.\u201d Schumer bit back at Trump. \u201cI didn\u2019t just criticize Pres. Trump\u2019s pathetic, inadequate funding request. I noted his incompetence, how he has no plan to deal with coronavirus.\u201d Democrats and Republicans who were in the closed-door briefing that was given to senators on the status of the outbreak had divided reaction to the briefing. \u201cThere would be an outcry and outroar if the American people heard what we been told,\u201d Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal said after the briefing. \u201cProtection, preparedness, prevention all seem to be inadequate. In South Carolina, the contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination are preparing for tonight\u2019s debate and seeking to connect with voters ahead of the primary on Saturday. While they do that, a word about polling averages. Which is to say, they\u2019re useful. Here\u2019s a screenshot of the realclearpolitics.com polling average for South Carolina as of midmorning Tuesday: As you can see, Joe Biden is still leading in a state most analysts agree he must win if he is to remain in the primary \u2013 he says he never called it his firewall, but he did \u2013 but Bernie Sanders has narrowed the gap considerably over the past few months. Among other things you can also see the impact of Tom Steyer\u2019s concentration on the state \u2013 as well as the billionaire\u2019s purchasing power when it comes to buying ads \u2013 and Pete Buttigieg\u2019s inability to make any sort of mark. Here\u2019s another average from another site: fivethirtyeight.com\u2019s average of Donald Trump\u2019s popularity: Which, to non-Trump supporters, might be a little worrying. The president is still underwater but since impeachment proceedings gathered pace in October, through to his acquittal in the Senate and after, his approval rating has risen. This is what CNN\u2019s Harry Enten, formerly of this parish, has to say about it all. More from Trump\u2019s press conference in India: another testy exchange with Jim Acosta of CNN about who is more fake news than the other. Acosta asked the president about reports that Russia is trying to boost his campaign again, and about reports of a purge of non-loyalists from his administration. \u201cFirst of all I want no help from any country,\u201d the president said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been given any help from any country.\u201d And then, duly, he attacked CNN for having to apologise for errors in stories \u2013 something most media companies end up having to do. \u201cMr President,\u201d Acosta retorted, \u201cI think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours sometimes, if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d Trump did mind. \u201cYour record is so bad you ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou probably have the worst record in the history of broadcasting.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of anything,\u201d Acosta said, \u201cand our organization is not ashamed, Sir.\u201d Trump then answered, after a fashion, the question about the reported purge. Acosta and Trump have history, so much so that last year Acosta got a book out of it: The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America. The book deals with Trump\u2019s antagonistic stance with the mainstream media via the medium of Acosta\u2019s run-ins with Trump that culminated in the CNN correspondent having his White House pass revoked. It also echoes other books in saying Trump seems to have admitted, via an intermediary, that the whole thing is something of a performative act. Here\u2019s how we reported the book: In The Enemy of the People, Acosta writes that after an early confrontation, close Trump aide Hope Hicks called him to say the president wanted him to know he was \u201cvery professional today\u201d. \u201cHe said, \u2018Jim gets it,\u2019\u201d Hicks is quoted as saying. Trump, Acosta writes, had just called the reporter \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cvery fake news\u201d after being asked about Russian election interference at a press conference in February 2017. \u201cWhen he called us \u2018fake news\u2019,\u201d Acosta writes, \u201cit was, in his mind, an act.\u201d On the subject of Trump calling people and organisations \u201cfake news\u201d when his own relationship with the truth is somewhat, um, tenuous, here\u2019s a link to the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker column. It says that in his first three years in office, the 45th president made more than 16,000 false or misleading claims. It might be a stretch to say Donald Trump is in hot water over his criticism of supreme court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2013 this being America in the age of Trump, his tweets and remarks at a presser in India will be old news before your average desk editor can try to remember what it was Paul Manafort was found guilty of, what that jacket he had was made of, or which ex-national security adviser is next due out with a book. Plus, y\u2019know, Trump doesn\u2019t seem to be being held to account much by anyone these days, let alone his own political party. But here\u2019s a key take on the supreme court story from University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck, a particularly well-informed and worthwhile presence in the Twittersphere: In short, because Fox misrepresented Sotomayor\u2019s words, Trump is misrepresenting Sotomayor\u2019s words, which means much of the media is misrepresenting Sotomayor\u2019s words. Here\u2019s a link to Sotomayor\u2019s dissent, so you can read it for yourselves. A new ad from Mike Bloomberg titled \u201cSupports Women\u201d features women who have worked at Bloomberg\u2019s company or on his staff while he was mayor of New York City praising the presidential candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s important to talk to the people who know him personally,\u201d says Erana Stennett, who is the director of the Bloomberg Media Initiative Africa, in the video. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that I respect more and felt respected by,\u201d says Jacki Kelly, a former Bloomberg LP employee. The ad is a response to mounting criticism against Bloomberg over allegations of mistreatment and discrimination in his company, sparked by rumors of nondisclosure agreements the candidate\u2019s company signed with women. The allegations put a target on Bloomberg\u2019s back during last week\u2019s debate and will likely continue to weigh on the candidate as the race continues: Having earlier said that India wasn\u2019t having much of a problem with coronavirus, Trump has just now gone on the attack against somebody criticising his own administrations\u2019s preparedness for the outbreak - in this case Sen. Chuck Schumer. The row over US moves to deploy low-yield nuclear missiles on submarines continued in Geneva today, with criticism of the decision from Iran. In a move unlikely to further endear the Iranians to the Trump administration, Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister for international and legal affairs Mohsen Baharvand told the Conference on Disarmament in the UN building in Geneva said that \u201cSuch provocative actions must be condemned\u201d. \u201cA new nuclear arms race is being accelerated\u201d, he added. The US Defense Department confirmed earlier this month that the Navy had fielded a low-yield, submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead. Low-yield nuclear weapons have a strength of less than 20 kilotons, which is about the same as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Moscow has already expressed alarm at the decision. A set of polling figures suggests that while Andres Oppenheimer thinks Sanders is going to be a problem for Democrats in Florida (see below), that may not be the case in California. David Lauter at the LA Times has written about the widespread support Sanders enjoys among communities of colour in California, outstripping his nearest Democratic rivals. Of the poll he says: \u201cThe survey offers an unusual level of detail on the views of Latino, African Americans and Asian and Pacific Americans in California, groups that in many opinion surveys are too small to analyze. It provides strong evidence of the Vermont senator\u2019s ability to build a multiracial, multiethnic coalition in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\u201d It also reveals that support for Sanders is generationally split, regardless of ethnicity: \u201cAmong Latinos younger than 50, for example, Sanders enjoyed roughly a 3-1 lead over Bloomberg when poll respondents were asked whom they would most like to see as the next president. Latinos 50 and older were divided closely between Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg. Similar age divisions showed up among blacks, Asian Americans and whites in the poll.\u201d Read the piece here: \u201cBernie Sanders has broad support in diverse California communities, new poll finds\u201d There\u2019s a strong opinion piece in the Miami Herald from Andres Oppenheimer, picking at two of the threads where Sanders has faced criticism in recent days - his comments about Cuba on 60 Minutes, and his decision to skip the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s (AIPAC) annual policy conference. He doesn\u2019t mince his words about how he thinks that will play for Sanders in Florida. \u201cIn short, the Democrats can kiss Florida \u2014 and maybe other swing states \u2014 good-bye if they pick Sanders as their nominee. It will be political suicide \u2014 and a godsend to Trump, the worst president in America\u2019s recent memory.\u201d Read the full blast here: \u201cSanders praised Cuba, spurned Israel group. If he\u2019s the nominee, he just lost Florida\u201d There\u2019s more detail coming from Julian Assange\u2019s lawyers in London about the way the Wikileaks founder has been treated while being detained. They claim he was handcuffed 11 times, stripped naked twice and had his case files confiscated after the first day of his extradition hearing yesterday. My colleague Ben Quinn has more from the court in London, where the US is attempting to extradite Assange from the UK. President Trump has begun giving a press conference in India. It is typically wide-ranging. So far he has said that India doesn\u2019t have \u201cmuch of a problem\u201d with coronavirus, and has suggested that there has been tremendous praise for the peace efforts in Afghanistan. He says he plans to bring the troop presence down to 8,600 in the country. On other foreign policy issues he has urged Iran to crack down on Isis, and says that he has a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister. He says he is willing to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. Trump also says he has discussed the issue of religious freedom with India\u2019s Narendra Modi. The bakdrop to this Trump visit has included violent scenes on India\u2019s streets as people protest a new citizenship law which many say is discriminatory against Muslims. On trade Trump declares that India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world. He singles out Harley Davidson, saying they have to pay a \u201cTremendous tariff\u201d when they sell to India. If a trade deal is to happen with India, he says, it will be towards the end of the year. Trump insists that the \u201cUnited States has to be treated fairly\u201d and that deals have to be reciprocal. \u201cWe have a large deficit of $24bn with India. That is very high.\u201d He has also mentioned yesterday\u2019s Harvey Weinstein verdict, describing it as \u201ca great victory, sends a very very strong message\u201d. Trump himself stands accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour by more than a dozen women. Trump has denied the allegations. Trump had joked that he would be \u201cvery, very conservative\u201d in his answers to avoid distracting from his \u201cfantastic two days\u201d in the country. But he also waded into domestic issues, including criticizing Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how they can not recuse themselves for anything Trump or Trump-related,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWhat Justice Sotomayor said yesterday was highly inappropriate. She\u2019s trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way.\u201d He said that Ginsburg had gone \u201cwild\u201d against him during the 2016 campaign. It is going to be a slightly unfamiliar meal for the president and his wife in India today. Trump is well known for his love of burgers and steaks, but cows are considered sacred in the Hindu religion. The main dish at the banquet tonight will be goat. The banquet is for around 90 guests, and a spokesman for India\u2019s president\u2019s office says the chefs will prepare food with \u201ca careful combination of spices to suit Indian and American palates.\u201d While Trump has been focussed on talks with prime minister Modi and Indian businessmen, first lady Melania has been visiting a \u201chappiness class\u201d at a government-run school in the Indian capital. The curriculum dovetails with her \u201cBe Best\u201d initiative to teach children and young adults to be kind, avoid drugs and take care of themselves. It has been clear for a few days now that the main Mike Bloomberg campaign strategy was going to be to turn his fire specifically on Bernie Sanders. With Sanders out in front in polling, to stand a chance of winning the nomination one of the chasing pack needs to peg him back urgently before he amounts an unassailable lead. Bloomberg\u2019s attack today is that some internal polling that suggests Sanders\u2019 nomination could drag down vulnerable House Democrats trying to hold onto their competitive districts. Here\u2019s an analysis of the tactic and the data by Christopher Cadelago and Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez for Politico: \u201cBloomberg internal poll claims Bernie would sink downballot Dems\u201d It isn\u2019t traditional for US presidents to comment on domestic politics while at events on foreign trips, but that\u2019s what the US president has been doing in India. At a meeting of Indian business leaders today he has told them that the US economy is being held back by the upcoming presidential election. Warning of economic turmoil at home if he loses his November election, Trump told his hosts \u201cif the wrong person gets elected, everything will come to a halt\u201d and unemployment will rise. He blamed the recent fall in US stock markets on the coronavirus outbreak, and predicted that the stock market will soar if he wins a second term. Here are a few interesting reads from around the internet to set you up for the day. Ben Mathis-Lilley over on Slate is arguing that the Democrats who are so worried that Sanders might grab the nomination should think hard about whether they\u2019ve been doing the right thing in backing Biden. If you sincerely hold the belief that [Sanders\u2019 \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d] will [repel swing voters], what should you have been doing for the past year to actually prevent the socialist from winning the nomination? Probably finding and supporting a nonsocialist nominee who\u2019s shown themselves ready to run a dynamic general-election presidential campaign, right? Perhaps one like Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, or even Elizabeth Warren? Sally Goldenberg on Politico has a bit on the inside track of how Mike Bloomberg is preparing for tonight\u2019s debate with a simple plan - \u201cNuke Bernie\u201d. That\u2019s why his team is getting ready to launch a fusillade at Sanders before and during the debate, and why Bloomberg\u2019s prep sessions were focused on aiming his fire at the liberal Vermont senator. \u2018We\u2019ve trained our eyes on him. Something the rest of the field has failed to do eight debates prior and a year in a campaign,\u2019 a top aide said in an interview. The Democratic challenger field is notably on the elderly side, with Biden, Bloomberg and Sanders all in their late 70s. Is that too old to run the country? Not according to John H Rowe, a professor of health policy and ageing at Columbia University. In the Washington Post he has argued that: The older people become, the less like each other they become. While many physical and mental functions might decline with advancing age on average, for most measures there are many older persons who perform as well as the average young adult, and well-educated, financially secure individuals are especially likely to be among them. Trump\u2019s visit to India has been high on pomp and ceremony, and a little short on substance. The president started the day with an elaborate outdoor welcome ceremony in front of the grand Rashtrapati Bhavan Presidential Palace in New Delhi, where he was welcomed with canon fire and horseback soldiers. The Trumps then went on to visit a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi where the president and first lady paid their respects in a petal throwing ceremony. The memorial is at Raj Ghat where the famed independence leader was cremated after his assassination in 1948. Trump also signed a guest book and was presented with a bust of Gandhi. Meeting prime minister Narendra Modi later on, Trump commented that he thought the crowds at the joint mass rally yesterday had been there more for Modi than for him. He said there were cheers every time he mentioned Modi\u2019s name, \u201cso they love you in India and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Modi went on to say that the two had a productive exchange on issues including defence cooperation, energy and technology, and said talks will continue. He said that he and Trump have now met five times over the past eight months and said ties between the two nations is the \u201cmost important partnership of the 21st century.\u201d Good morning. It\u2019s been another showy day already for Donald Trump as he continues his whirlwind 36-hour trip to India to meet prime minister Narendra Modi. The two have posed for photos together in New Delhi, but there have been violent clashes on the streets. Trump is due to attend a banquet in the evening, and then at 10pm local time (11.30 ET) he flies out. Back at home the Democrats are preparing for the next TV debate ahead of Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary. Businessman Tom Steyer has made the cut, meaning there will be a crowded field of seven challengers. Will anyone be able to cut through the noise and make a decisive move against current frontrunner Bernie Sanders? It\u2019s not just about South Carolina either. It is the last TV showdown before the 3 March Super Tuesday primaries. The debate is on from 8pm to 10:15pm ET, and is being hosted by CBS News. There are details on how to watch here. In London, the second day of a court hearing into the extradition of Julian Assange from the UK to the US will take place.",

      "bodyText": "The government must act urgently to stamp out the \u201ccurse\u201d of single-use plastic sachets, billions of which are helping to fuel the global plastics crisis, campaigners are warning. A coalition of more than 50 business leaders, politicians and campaigners is demanding that the plastic sachets \u2013 used for everything from ketchup to shampoo \u2013 be included in European and UK legislation outlawing other \u201cthrowaway\u201d items such as plastic straws and cotton buds. Its findings, published on Wednesday, reveal that 855bn sachets are used every year globally \u2013 enough to cover the entire surface of the Earth \u2013 and with many thrown away without being opened. Despite this, sachets have been almost entirely exempt from the broader crackdown on plastic, the campaigners say in an open letter sent to UK newspapers. Sachets are not covered by the EU single-use plastics directive, which is to outlaw a host of throwaway items by 2021. When Michael Gove was environment secretary, the government announced bans on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds in England, which will take effect in April. The environment bill 2020, introduced to parliament this month and due for its second reading on Wednesday, seeks to introduce charges for single-use plastic items but fails to regulate sachets. Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet, which is leading the campaign, said: \u201cIn recent years governments and business have gone all out to enforce a ban on plastic straws, cotton buds and even bags. \u201cAnd yet the plastic sachet, the ultimate symbol of our grab and go, convenience-addicted lifestyle, has been virtually invisible to all. The result? Our Earth is saturated with these uncollectable, unrecyclable, contaminated, valueless little packets. It\u2019s time to close the legal loophole. Now more than ever before we have to sack the sachet.\u201d The letter has been signed by global campaigners including the UN secretary general\u2019s special envoy for the ocean, Peter Thomson, business leaders such as Iceland Foods\u2019 managing director, Richard Walker, the Time Out group chief executive, Julio Bruno, and the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt. Virtually never recycled, plastic sachets are typically used to package single-serve portions of liquids and sauces such as ketchup, vinegar and mayonnaise, and are also popular for hand wipes, shampoo, washing powder and face creams. In an attempt to find an alternative, the UK\u2019s Just Eat chain has recently teamed up with Unilever to pilot Hellmann\u2019s sauces packaged in seaweed-based sachets.",
