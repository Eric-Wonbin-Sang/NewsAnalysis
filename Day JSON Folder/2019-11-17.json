      "bodyText": "Hong Kong police have laid siege to the city\u2019s Polytechnic University, where about 200 protesters are holed up after a weekend of violence which saw conflict between the two sides reach new heights. Protesters tried to leave the campus on Monday morning \u2013 at the request of the university\u2019s president \u2013 but were forced back by police who fired rounds of tear gas. Explosions and gun fire could be heard in videos posted online showing the protesters attempting to leave the area. The tactics used by police raised fears that the authorities had no interest in de-escalating the situation, but were aiming to trap and arrest all protesters. Dozens of people who were not involved in the siege have been arrested in the street after asking police to lift the siege, Hong Kong Free Press reported. On Monday morning, police attempted to storm the university in Kowloon after a 24-hour battle with protesters which saw officials threaten to use live rounds. Earlier, officers fired teargas and water cannon and drove an armoured vehicle at demonstrators who threw molotov cocktails. The police said in a video statement they would use live rounds on the \u201crioters\u201d if they did not stop using lethal weapons to attack officers. As riot police moved in at dawn, protesters set fire to one of the entrances to the university and explosions could be heard. The blazes forced police to pull back. Professor Teng Jin-guang, the president of Poly U, released a video statement on Monday saying he had negotiated a temporary suspension of the use of force with the police and urged protesters to \u201cleave the campus in a peaceful manner\u201d. When they did so, they were forced back by tear gas. During the day on Sunday, the university, which has been taken over by protesters since clashes last week, became the site of some of the longest, tensest clashes between anti-government demonstrators and police of the last five months. As a helicopter hovered overhead, riot police shot blue-dyed liquid laced with pepper spray at protesters who set fire to a pedestrian bridge packed with furniture, umbrellas and other materials, causing a blaze that was later put out by firefighters. Protesters on part of the university\u2019s roof used catapults as well as bows and arrows to shoot at police, with one arrow striking an officer in the calf. They also occupied a flyover and threw petrol bombs at riot police, setting off explosions and sending flames into the sky. An armoured vehicle drove towards protesters but was stopped by a barricade and pelted with molotov cocktails until it caught fire. \u201cThe main goal is to protect the campus and prevent people from getting arrested,\u201d said Rudy Lau, 27, an alumnus of the university. Using binoculars, he monitored a group of police outside the grounds, and alerted others to their movements. \u201cPeople are trying everything. Most of the actions we do are indeed pointless because the Chinese government is not budging. So we just have to try to do everything and keep the momentum going,\u201d he said. Owen Li, a PolyU council member and student, said \u201cpanic\u201d had taken hold of the estimated few hundred protesters who remained. \u201cMany friends feel helpless \u2026 we appeal to all of society to come out and help us.\u201d Thousands of residents and protesters flocked to various districts around the university to try to penetrate the riot-police lines to rescue the trapped students. \u201cIf we can only hold on till dawn, more might come,\u201d said one young activist in the university who was close to exhaustion. By late evening on Sunday, the unrest had spread, as protesters and their supporters took to the streets in at least five other locations to draw police resources away from the university. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Jordan, also in Kowloon, and lit a barricade as police pursued them with teargas and water cannon. Volunteers also parked their cars in the middle of roads leading to the university, prompting the police to issue a statement ordering drivers not to block the roads and obstruct a police operation. At the university, dozens were arrested as they tried to leave, following a police order to evacuate by a specified exit. The confrontation, a continuation of the fighting from the night before, began in the morning when protesters were seen throwing bricks at residents trying to clear a blockaded road. It continued into the late evening, when police declared the unrest a riot and warned that anyone who remained on the campus or assisted the perpetrators would be considered a rioter. The university issued a statement calling on people to leave the grounds immediately. \u201cThe university is gravely concerned that the spiralling radical illicit activities will cause not only a tremendous safety threat on campus, but also class suspension over an indefinite period of time,\u201d it said. Political unrest has escalated dramatically in the last week as demonstrators have blocked transport links and roads and paralysed parts of the city. After the Chinese president,Xi Jinping, delivered his first public remarks on the crisis on Thursday after five months of protests, People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers took to the streets on Saturday to help residents clear blocked roads. Dressed in shorts and T-shirts and holding plastic buckets, the soldiers helped residents clear the protesters\u2019 improvised barricades, a move that demonstrators described as \u201cclearance today, crackdown tomorrow\u201d. The Hong Kong government said it had not requested the help, describing the soldiers\u2019 excursion as a \u201cvoluntary activity\u201d. On Sunday, Chinese soldiers at a base near the university, some in riot gear, were seen monitoring the situation. The Global Times reported that police in Guangzhou were holding \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d exercises. The smell of teargas wafted over the campus, which has been turned into a battle station as first aid volunteers tended to injured protesters and others sorted supplies and prepared molotov cocktails. Protesters struck by the water were stripped and hosed down. Activists have destroyed the tollbooths along the tunnel and built barricades on the road, blocking a major traffic artery.

After almost six months of weekly and now daily protests, Hong Kong\u2019s crisis reached a new peak last week after two protest-related deaths, dozens of injuries, and what were seen as attacks on universities by the police. Residents have become frustrated and impatient with the traffic disruptions, while others have grown alarmed by what they see as the protesters\u2019 increasing violence and intolerance for those who disagree with them. Hong Kong\u2019s education bureau has called off lessons on Monday, after cancelling classes on Thursday and Friday out of safety concerns. Several universities have ended the semester early and sent foreign students home. On Sunday, Hong Kong\u2019s finance minister, Paul Chan, said the city was heading towards its worst recession since the 1997 handover, as tourist numbers have fallen, and stocks and retail sales have been hit. Calvin See, 27, who works at a logistics company, said the disruptions and slowdown were hurting its revenues. He had come to help support the protesters at Polytechnic University after seeing calls for reinforcements. \u201cThat\u2019s not the worst part.

      "bodyText": "Moments after Stefanos Tsitsipas contested the biggest match of his career at the Australian Open in January he arrived for his press conference and sat demoralised in his chair. He was broken. He had come all the way to his first major semi-final, scuppering his hero Roger Federer along the way, only to be dismantled 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 by Rafael Nadal. He seemed lost and he departed the press conference room wondering if he would ever beat Nadal: \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose to Rafa 10 times,\u201d he sighed. On Sunday the Greek produced an extraordinary performance, recovering from a set down to defeat Dominic Thiem 6-7 (6), 6-2, 7-6 (4) and win the ATP Finals. It is the biggest title of his career and his third of the year, a sum of his growth and maturity over the course of a rollercoaster of a breakthrough year. Tsitsipas started the season by speaking into existence the four things he wished to achieve: reach the top 10, contest a grand slam semi-final, qualify for the ATP Finals and win a Masters 1000. So good has his season been that he has passed each milestone he set out to achieve and overshot the final one, winning an even bigger title on Sunday. However, his season has also been a complicated and at times brutal learning curve. After piling on the tournaments and barely taking a breath, by the middle of the year he was burnt out from the endless grind of the tour. When he lost in the first round of Wimbledon he locked himself in his hotel room and read books for days. Then after his loss in the first round of the US Open, just three months ago, he admitted he was struggling to cope with the rigid routines essential to success in professional tennis \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing the same thing over and over again and my brain can\u2019t really take it any more,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel inspired. I play out on the court and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m chasing something.\u201d He eventually decided to turn it round by no longer taking defeats as severely he did against Nadal or after his US Open exit.

That\u2019s how we\u2019d call it.

Besides, what better time to produce a drama about the end of the world as we know it than this? You can\u2019t move for contemporary parallels: war, the climate crisis, an authoritarian insistence that all will be well despite copious evidence to the contrary. This tale of an alien invasion and the mass destruction of humanity will do little for the sense of dread that seems ever-present and pressing, but it does put on a jolly good show.</p> <p>We know this will be a stylish take on The War of the Worlds from the off. Its opening credits are very \u201cAmerican prestige drama\u201d, with archive military footage spliced with clips of parasites at work, all scratched and screwed up. While there have been notable changes to the story, it is hard to imagine any Wells purists being upset with what the writer/executive producer Peter Harness has done. The action has been shifted from the Victorian to the Edwardian era, and the unnamed narrator now has a name, George, who has in fact handed over narration duties to his partner, Amy, played by Poldark\u2019s Eleanor Tomlinson. Despite bits of sculpting here and there, Harness is not ripping up the novel and starting again.

We creep towards apocalyptic disaster by way of a Downton Abbey-esque subplot involving our two dashing leads. George (Rafe Spall, shocked and awed) is living in sin with Amy, which is obvious because they can barely keep their hands off each other, and therefore have clearly not spent the past decade arguing over whose turn it is to take out the dustbins.

This show is rarely subtle. George and Amy have a conversation about how they will survive financially if George is driven out of his newspaper job.

      "body": "<p>Potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has apologized for his longstanding support of the controversial \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d police strategy, a practice that he embraced as New York\u2019s mayor and continued to defend despite its disproportionate impact on people of color.</p> <p>The apology, however, was received skeptically by many prominent activists who noted that it was made as he is taking steps to enter the presidential race ahead of the 2020 US election.</p> <p>Addressing a black church in Brooklyn on Sunday, Bloomberg said he was \u201csorry\u201d and acknowledged it often led to the detention of blacks and Latinos.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t change history,\u201d Bloomberg told the congregation. \u201cHowever, today I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Bloomberg\u2019s reversal is notable for someone who is often reluctant to admit wrongdoing. It is also a recognition that if he is to compete for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the November 2020 US election, he will have to win support from black voters. And his record on stop-and-frisk is a glaring vulnerability that could hobble his potential candidacy if he does not express contrition.</p> <p>\u201cIt is convenient that Bloomberg suddenly apologizes but has done nothing to undo the immense damage he has caused on countless lives,\u201d said activist DeRay Mckesson. \u201cHis apology is not accepted.\u201d</p> <p>Stop-and-frisk gave police wide authority to detain people they suspected of committing a crime, and Bloomberg aggressively pursued the tactic when he first took over as mayor in 2002.

      "bodyText": "Potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has apologized for his longstanding support of the controversial \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d police strategy, a practice that he embraced as New York\u2019s mayor and continued to defend despite its disproportionate impact on people of color. The apology, however, was received skeptically by many prominent activists who noted that it was made as he is taking steps to enter the presidential race ahead of the 2020 US election. Addressing a black church in Brooklyn on Sunday, Bloomberg said he was \u201csorry\u201d and acknowledged it often led to the detention of blacks and Latinos. \u201cI can\u2019t change history,\u201d Bloomberg told the congregation. \u201cHowever, today I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s reversal is notable for someone who is often reluctant to admit wrongdoing. It is also a recognition that if he is to compete for the Democratic presidential nomination ahead of the November 2020 US election, he will have to win support from black voters. And his record on stop-and-frisk is a glaring vulnerability that could hobble his potential candidacy if he does not express contrition. \u201cIt is convenient that Bloomberg suddenly apologizes but has done nothing to undo the immense damage he has caused on countless lives,\u201d said activist DeRay Mckesson. \u201cHis apology is not accepted.\u201d Stop-and-frisk gave police wide authority to detain people they suspected of committing a crime, and Bloomberg aggressively pursued the tactic when he first took over as mayor in 2002. Under the program, New York City police officers made it a routine practice to stop and search multitudes of mostly black and Hispanic men to see if they were carrying weapons. Police claimed that people were only targeted if officers had a reasonable suspicion that they were breaking the law. But while the searches did lead to weapons being confiscated, the overwhelming majority of people who were detained and frisked were let go because they had not done anything wrong. Many men found the encounters humiliating and degrading, and statistics showed that minorities were far more likely to be subjected to such a search. \u201cUnder Bloomberg, NYPD increased stop and frisk from 100,000 stops to nearly 700,000 stops per year. 90% of those impacted were people of color \u2013 overwhelmingly black and brown men,\u201d black activist and data scientist Samuel Sinyangwe tweeted on Sunday. \u201cBloomberg personally has the money to begin paying reparations for this harm. \u2018Sorry\u2019 isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Patrick Lynch, president of New York city\u2019s largest police union, the Police Benevolent Association, issued a statement saying, \u201cMayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street. \u201cWe said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities.\u201d Bloomberg is not the first Democrat aiming to unseat Donald Trump next year who has sought to atone for past positions on matters that deeply affected people of color. Before he entered the race, former vice-president Joe Biden apologized for his role in the passage of a crime bill that imposed stiffer sentences on those convicted of crack cocaine possession \u2013 a law that has disproportionately affected the black community. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, too, said he was \u201cnot happy\u201d that he voted for the \u201cterrible\u201d 1994 legislation. And Pete Buttigieg apologized for his handling of race as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city with a history of segregation where decades of simmering tension erupted this summer when a white police officer shot and killed a black man. The veteran civil rights campaigner the Rev Al Sharpton applauded Bloomberg for reversing his stance, though he added that he would have to \u201cwait and see whether it was politically motivated\u201d. \u201cIt will take more than one speech for people to forgive and forget a policy that so negatively impacted entire communities.\u201d As recently as this year, Bloomberg had defended his handling of stop-and-frisk. \u201cThe murder rate in New York City went from 650 a year to 300 a year when I left,\u201d he said in January. He said most police departments do the same thing, \u201cthey just don\u2019t report it or use the terminology\u201d. Ultimately, a federal judge found in 2013 that stop-and-frisk intentionally and systematically violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men. Bloomberg blasted the ruling at the time, calling it a \u201cdangerous decision made by a judge who I think does not understand how policing works and what is compliant with the US constitution\u201d. Bloomberg\u2019s successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, made ending the practice a centerpiece of his first run for office.

Tsitsipas responded with a huge forehand to save the break point and he found his serve to dig out the hold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8185c0a4f983f2fa538998a1f6f7b90a5a043ad5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8185c0a4f983f2fa538998a1f6f7b90a5a043ad5/0_0_5577_3779/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsitsipas fights back to hold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsitsipas fights back to hold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-17T18:52:22.012Z\">at 6.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dd193a88f083559fb1cd10f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-17T18:38:53.967Z\">6.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *3-3 Dominic Thiem:</strong> Another great hold for Dominic Thiem.

Is there an answer from your side? Because possibly he could be one of your opponents in the final. Is there any answer about his development and his style of play? This week especially.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I haven\u2019t said that, but Dominic has inspired me a lot to be a better version of myself when I\u2019m out on the court.</p> <p>I see a lot of things that he does on the court, and I try to do the same. Because I have mentioned this before: what Roger does, only Roger does. It\u2019s really difficult to copy what you see.</p> <p>So to me Dominic is more, like, something normal, normal in a way that something that\u2019s possible, something that\u2019s possible.</p> <p>Roger is an exceptional talent. We all know that. He has a very difficult game style to copy. So for me, Dominic has always been someone that I looked up to and wanted to, wanted always to play with the same intensity and the same will that he puts in the court. He puts a lot of effort and a lot of -- I would just describe him as an intense player. If he\u2019s in the zone, he can just create so much opportunities with his game.</p> <p>And by the way, it\u2019s also nice to know I have an Austrian fan base.

      "bodyText": "Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from a dramatic night in the O2 Arena. It has been an amazing final tournament in London with great matches, all-court tennis and brilliant performances from the younger players. Let\u2019s hope that the courts are as fast and the tennis is as good in the new year. Thanks for following. The Greek recovers from a set down to win the ATP Finals and seal the biggest win of his career! Astounding resilience and an incredible match. The next generation has officially arrived. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 6-6 (*4-2) Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas is in the ascendancy here, but only narrowly. Beautiful play from Tsitsipas to move ahead 2-1 with a great crosscourt backhand before finishing the point with an overhead. Then Thiem\u2019s backhand malfunctions twice, with it flying wide at 2-1 then netting a short ball on the following point. Good work from Thiem to limit the damages by forcing a Tsitsipas forehand error with a big backhand down the line. He\u2019s still going after it. Impressive. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 6-6 Dominic Thiem: We\u2019re heading to a third set tiebreak! Another great hold from Tsitsipas, who found his first serve well. A particularly brilliant volley from him at 15-15, before sealing the point with a very good overhead. He held with a good unreturned first serve. Who will hold their nerve? Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 *5-6 Dominic Thiem: Thiem puts together another quick hold of his own, sealed with his eighth ace. He\u2019s serving bombs, crushing his forehand and coming forward whenever the opportunity presents itself. Tsitsipas was screaming at himself: \u201cmove your feet!\u201d Not many people in the world would have reached those forehand bullets from Thiem. Tsitsipas will serve to stay in it again. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 5-5* Dominic Thiem: Nerves of steel from Stefanos Tsitsipas to hold to love with everything on the line. He opened with an ace down the T and followed with a slew of unreturned serves. A 67 secound hold while serving to stay in it? Incredible. Back to Dominic. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 *4-5 Dominic Thiem: The problem for Tsitsipas is that Thiem is now well into a rhythm on his serve. He holds after striking bomb of a 92mph backhand flat down-the-line to bring up 40-0. He held with a great inside out forehand drive volley. A huge hold. Thiem has so impressively wrestled this set back in his favour. Now Tsitsipas will serve to stay in the tournament. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 4-4* Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas cuts Thiem\u2019s run of consecutive games at three, holding with a brilliant hooked forehand after defending multiple bombs from Thiem. He celebrated with a loud cheer at his box and he needed that. The level is high from both players now. This is really about who will hold firm mentally. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 *3-4 Dominic Thiem: All of a sudden, the momentum has completely shifted. Thiem is absolutely destroying the ball, opening with a huge forehand then a sizzling backhand down the line winner en route to a love hold. All of a sudden, Thiem has won three successive games and he is two games away. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 3-3* Dominic Thiem: Thiem breaks back! Finally, after being on fire for the past hour, the Greek finally came back down to earth. Three missed first serves and a flurry of errors. Across the net, Thiem returned really well and particularly came up with a brilliant backhand crosscourt passing shot at 15-30. We\u2019re back on serve. Such impressive resilience from the Austrian. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 *3-2 Dominic Thiem: Thiem keeps himself in the game with a vital hold. Some brutal forehands from Austrian helped him to a 40-0 lead. It took a couple of attempts, but he finally held serve for 30 with a huge ace. Tsitsipas is anincredible tennis player and he is playing with a lot of spirit, but he is truly abysmal at challenging. Another bad challenge from him on Thiem\u2019s game-sealing ace there. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 3-1* Dominic Thiem: The Greek is just streaming through these service games now and serving incredibly well. He eases through his second love hold of the set with a sweeping crosscourt forehand. \u215e first serves in, zero points lost on serve. The question is how long he can keep this up. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 *2-1 Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas breaks! He is everywhere - serving well, returning well, crushing the ball and moving so fluidly. The pressure is just too much for the Austrian. Thiem double faulted for 0-30, then Tsitsipas brought up break point after a lovely backhand return and a forehand that clipped the baseline to force a Thiem error. Thiem saved the first break point with a lovely pair of forehand volleys, but he went after a backhand down the line and it flew into the net. A big moment here. Can Thiem bounce back? Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 1-1* Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas is relentless. He shrugged off the missed break points and immediately went on the attack again, holding to love with ease. Gorgeous forehand down the line winner from him at 30-0. The pressure was off the Austrian\u2019s shoulders for about a minute. Now he has to hold again. Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 *0-1 Dominic Thiem: Quite an incredible hold from Thiem. With the momentum fully behind the Greek, this was a huge game and both players played like it. At 30-30, Tsitsipas came up with a tremendous point, sliding around the court as he defended Thiem\u2019s biggest blows, then flipping to offence and finishing with a beautiful drop volley on the 18th shot. It took a bullet of a forehand down the line from Thiem to save the first break point, then Tsitsipas responded with vicious, heavy forehands to move up break point again. But Thiem saved the second break point by forcing a Tsitsipas error with a heavy crosscourt forehand, then he slammed down two big serves to hold. Absurd tennis. Thiem celebrated with a huge fistpump to the ground and rightly so. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 6-2 Dominic Thiem: No problems for Tsitsipas, who comfortably serves out the set to take us into a decider. He lost his first service point of the set on the opening point, but then fired down a stream of big serves to find himself up 40-15. On his second set point, he slammed down another big serve to take it. What an incredible set of tennis from Tsitsipas, both in the quality of his tennis and his resilience. 10 winners and just 1 unforced error. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) *5-2 Dominic Thiem: Another good hold by Thiem, who seals it off to 15 with his fifth ace and then a service winner down the T. The good news for him is that he seems to have found his rhythm on serve again and that will help him going into the third set. Now, let\u2019s see if the Greek can serve this thing out. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 5-1* Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas keeps his foot on the gas, easing through another love service game. He has not lost a single point on his serve in this set. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) *4-1 Dominic Thiem: Thiem finally gets himself on the board in set two with a quickl love hold, finding some first serves and some big forehands behind them. He closed it off with a huge service winner. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 4-0* Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas is just running away with this set now. He finds his first serve and slams down a love hold to increase the lead. It\u2019s hard to see Thiem turning this set around at this point. He has won 2 (two!) points in this set so far. Tsitsipas has 7 winners and 0 unforced erroers. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) *3-0 Dominic Thiem: The answer at the moment is \u2018no\u2019 - Tsitsipas is all over Thiem right now. At 15-30, Thiem attempted a serve and volley, but Tsitsipas moved brilliantly to reach the drop shot, lobbed it over the Austrian\u2019s head and then buried the forehand volley after Thiem\u2019s floated response. He finished with an incredible forehand down the line winner. That is how you respond to disappointment in a tennis match. There will always be more opportunities. Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) 2-0* Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas slams down an easy hold to open the set with an ace. He has already hit 4 winners in set two and he is flying. Not too surprising to see the Austrian\u2019s level suffer a bit of a lull after the adrenaline release of winning the first set. Can he get back on track? Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) *1-0 Dominic Thiem: After such a great set of tennis, there was no reason for Tsitsipas to be discouraged. Good to see that he wasn\u2019t. The Greek immediately takes the first break of the match to 15 after a wayward forehand from the Austrian. Wow. That was a tough, tough set of tennis and very high quality. Tsitsipas started off the brighter of the two but Thiem really got into the match quickly. Both players were extremely impressive, with both players returning pretty well but also serving really well under pressure. They are both also moving forward extremely well and clinched big points with big volleys at the net. It all came down to what was between the ears and Thiem just held firm mentally at the end. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-7(6) Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas finally blinked and it\u2019s Thiem who takes this brilliant set of tennis! Tsitsipas shanked a backhand at 6-6, and Thiem slammed down a big serve down the T to take the set. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-6(6-6) Dominic Thiem: This is tense! There is nothing to choose between them. A fourth ace from Thiem brings set point, which is eradicated by a great move to the net from Tsitsipas. A gorgeous backhand volley into the corner from the Greek, who then slammed down the overhead. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-6 (5-5) Dominic Thiem: Thiem found another big unreturned first serve at 4-2, but then his backhand clipped the net tape and dribbled back on his side. Tsitsipas fired another big serve to keep himself tight to Thiem, and then a wide forehand from the Austrian brought them level. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-6 (2-4*) Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas missed a forehand on the opening point and Thiem used the immediate mini-breakto build a great lead, beautifully moving forward at 2-0 to bring up a 3-0 lead. Tsitsipas pegged him back with two service holds, but a big serve from Thiem keeps him in the lead. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-6 Dominic Thiem: We\u2019re heading to a tiebreak! A great hold from Dominic Thiem, who started with two bad forehand unforced errors to immediately fall down 0-30. But we have been here before - he immediately found a big serve and then a bruising forehand down the line. The Austrian just refuses to hold back and nor did he at 30-30, crushing a forehand crosscourt winner to bring up game point. Thiem missed the first game point, but he immediately brought up a second and he held with a beautiful backhand drop volley. It\u2019s time to decide this great set of tennis. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-5* Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas secures another hold, but it wasn\u2019t easy at all. Thiem pulled Tsitsipas to 30-30 by dragging Tsitsipas wide with a great forehand crosscourt, but at 30-30 Thiem went after a second serve return return and set his forehand long. A brutal miss. The Greek found a big serve to hold on. A big \u201cpame!\u201d from the Greek there, which means that he is very happy. A tiebreak on the horizon... First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *5-5 Dominic Thiem: Thiem responds with his own swift hold. He absolutely demolished a backhand down the line to bring up 30-0, then he forced a Tsitsipas forehand error with bruising, heavy forehand onto the baseline. The Austrian dismounted by coming forward from a huge forehand down the line and finishing with a beautiful drop volley. Why is Thiem thriving all of a sudden on hard courts? Just check out how well he has played at the net today and how willing he has been to move forward on big points. He is now clearly an all-court player. Here is that big Tsitsipas return from earlier. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 5-4* Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas breaks the run of struggle service games with a quick hold to 15. He is now 10/10 at the net, including on many important points. He came in twice here, serving and volleying early in the game, then closing things off with a great overhead. We move on. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *4-4 Dominic Thiem: This is so intense. For a third game in a row, break points are saved as Thiem recovers from 15-40 down to level the match again. Tsitsipas had blasted a rocket of a forehand down the line return winner for 15-30, then he ground out a long point with great defence until Thiem netted a forehand down the line. But Thiem saved the first break point with his third ace and the second by bravely finishing moving forward to bravely the point at the net. He escaped with some big serving. Both men are showing their guts and bravery early on. Very impressive. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 4-3* Dominic Thiem: Goodness. Now it\u2019s time for Tsitsipas to save two break points and dig out a hold. The Greek started off sloppy, with four bad forehand errors throughout the game, but he saved the first with a genius piece of decision making - a serve and volley off his second serve. Thiem was completely blindsided and offered up an easy floaty return from deep in the court. But on the second break point, Thiem was badly robbed. He was standing on top of the baseline and landing huge blows when the linesman called Tsitsipas\u2019 defensive forehand out. Thiem immediately knew the call was wrong, and hawkeye confirmed. Tsitsipas responded with a huge forehand to save the break point and he found his serve to dig out the hold. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *3-3 Dominic Thiem: Another great hold for Dominic Thiem. This time he dug it out after missed a pretty appalling forehand at 15-30. He responded by playing two brilliant points in a row, standing on the baseline and pummelling forehands drom side to side. He forced a Tsitsipas backhand error on the first point, then slipped into the net and played a great volley. He held with a big unreturned serve. Thiem is having to work much harder for his service games, but so far he is more than equal to it. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 3-2* Dominic Thiem: Another impressive hold from Tsitsipas, whose forehand is already purring. He opened the game by abolutely battering a 101mph forehand winner after a brutal 23 stroke rally, then he dispatched an easy forehand drive volley to eventually bring up 40-0. A couple of points later, he slipped a sweetly struck forehand winner crosscourt to hold. It is incredible how much he trusts that stroke at such a young age. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *2-2 Dominic Thiem: Dominic Thiem stared down break point for the first time today, and he came up with a brilliant hold to level the first set. Very impressive. Thiem started the game really shakily with a backhand long and a bad volley, eventually facing break point at 30-40 after a big forehand down the line from Tsitsipas. How did he respond? He scuppered the danger with a huge, heavy forehand crosscourt, then he slammed down his first ace at deuce and another big serve to hold. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 2-1* Dominic Thiem: Tsitsipas holds firm again after a great forehand winner and another ace to bring up 40-0. Thiem won the first return point of the match and the nuclear backhand down the line winner and it contained a message: He has been destroying that shot all week and that\u2019s what he will be looking for today. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *1-1 Dominic Thiem: Thiem kicks things off with a great hold of his own, sealing his first game to love with a big first serve to force a return error from Tsitsipas. First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 1-0* Dominic Thiem: Stefanos Tsitsipas kicks off proceedings and what a perfect start that was. Four first serves, two aces and he gets on the board with an immediate love hold. What are nerves? Tsitsipas on Thiem: Q. You have a huge fan base in Austria, I can tell you, and you have a huge fan named Dominic Thiem. A few days ago he said he loves watching you, the style of play you have. Is there an answer from your side? Because possibly he could be one of your opponents in the final. Is there any answer about his development and his style of play? This week especially. STEFANOS TSITSIPAS: I haven\u2019t said that, but Dominic has inspired me a lot to be a better version of myself when I\u2019m out on the court. I see a lot of things that he does on the court, and I try to do the same. Because I have mentioned this before: what Roger does, only Roger does. It\u2019s really difficult to copy what you see. So to me Dominic is more, like, something normal, normal in a way that something that\u2019s possible, something that\u2019s possible. Roger is an exceptional talent. We all know that. He has a very difficult game style to copy. So for me, Dominic has always been someone that I looked up to and wanted to, wanted always to play with the same intensity and the same will that he puts in the court. He puts a lot of effort and a lot of -- I would just describe him as an intense player. If he\u2019s in the zone, he can just create so much opportunities with his game. And by the way, it\u2019s also nice to know I have an Austrian fan base. It\u2019s great. Thiem on Tsitsipas. Q. You mentioned about Stefanos being a hitting partner. How long have you known him? What\u2019s your relationship like? DOMINIC THIEM: That was the first time I met him, 2016 here, as a hitting partner. Of course I saw that he\u2019s playing great, but I didn\u2019t put so much attention on it because other things to focus on. And then he came on tour, and we played our first match last year in Doha, like two years ago almost, and there I saw and I also felt his amazing potential. Then at the end of the year already he was No. 14 or 15, and then everybody could see where his direction goes, like, only up, only in absolute world class. Well, he really deserves it. He\u2019s a good person. He\u2019s a very good player with a very attractive style to watch, so it\u2019s good to have him. So, who will win? Thiem and Tsitsipas have plenty of history, with Thiem leading the series 4-2, including winning their most recent meeting 3-6 6-4 6-1 in the Beijing final last month. However, they have split their last four meetings, with the first two in early 2018 just before the Greek broke through. The big question is hidden in Djokovic\u2019s comments after his defeat to Thiem. Did the Austrian peak in the group stages? He has certainly reached a higher level than Tsitsipas this week, but although he managed his victory against Zverev well, it certainly wasn\u2019t a great match. Across the net, Tsitsipas has played at a consistent level throughout the tournament and it seems likely that he will produce another good match again. Pierre Hugues-Herbert and Nicolas Mahut just beat Raven Klaasen and Michael Venus to win their first ATP Finals title, another important victory to their incredible resume. They have now won the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, ATP Finals and Davis Cup together. All eyes will be on the Olympics next. Roger Federer was frustrated with his own performance in yesterday\u2019s defeat to Tsitsipas, but he had some positive words for his conqueror. I look across the net, and I thought that he played really well. He took the ball early. I know he does that. I thought I returned actually pretty good on the first serve. Second serve of breakpoints and stuff, I guess there were better moments, but for the most part I wasn\u2019t quite getting into the rallies the way I wanted to. Well, I think I have to credit him for pushing me to not playing at the level I was hoping to today. Here are Novak Djokovic\u2019s comments on Thiem a few nights ago: I don\u2019t think I have experienced too many matches like this where my opponent just goes for every single shot. I mean, he was unbelievable, and in some stages it was just incredible that he was just literally smacking the ball as hard as he can and he was going in. It\u2019s really hard to say -- I mean, of course his level was super high. This today was unbelievable. But whether he can keep that up, you know, every match, if he does, chapeau, you know. There is not much you can say. For sure, he\u2019s playing great tennis. Thiem hasn\u2019t quite hit the heights of his first two matches since. We\u2019ll see if he will be able to keep that level up for one more match. Hello! Welcome to our coverage of the title match at the ATP Finals, where Dominic Thiem will face off against Stefanos Tsitsipas as both players chase down the biggest title of their young careers. I\u2019m not sure there could be a more fitting final between the two best players of the tournament. Thiem has produced some mindblowing tennis, with wins over Roger Federer and Alexander Zverev and particularly in his second match against Novak Djokovic, who played a damn good match himself yet watched the Austrian hit winners past him at will in the end.This is what he said afterwards: Across the net, he will face Stefanos Tsitsipas who has been incredibly steady and consistent throughout the tournament. He arrives in the final after wins against Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev and Roger Federer. The Greek has beaten his biggest generational rivals and taken out the great Roger Federer to reach this final. The youngsters are making a move and as we look to the future, what a statement it would be for him to win.",

They\u2019re hungry for that, which is a really good sign for us. \u201cOur forward players and I mean, Raheem [Sterling], Harry [Kane], Marcus [Rashford] are so exciting to work with. Then, with the younger ones that are supporting that. They thrive from each other, they create for each other, they are all scoring goals \u2013 which wasn\u2019t the case 18 months ago, particularly for Marcus and Raheem. But they work so hard for the team. That\u2019s, for me, the biggest thing.\u201d Winks added: \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true to score for my country. It\u2019s one I never really thought would happen. There\u2019s always moments we need to improve on but we were excellent today and ruthless.\u201d",

Pushing back against accusations from the president that the process has been stacked against him, Pelosi said Trump is welcome to appear or answer questions in writing, if he chooses. \u201cIf he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it,\u201d she said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cTrump could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants,\u201d she said.

He said the White House\u2019s insistence on blocking witnesses from cooperating raises the question: what is he hiding? Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, told reporters last week that Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate one of his potential opponents in the 2020 election \u201cmakes what Nixon did look almost small\u201d. On Sunday, she alluded to Nixon\u2019s resignation after the Watergate scandal involving a break-in at Democratic party headquarters and the subsequent cover-up. Nixon, whose name has become synonymous with scandal and ignominy for many Americans, resigned in 1974 after the House judiciary committee approved articles of impeachment against him but before the full House voted on the issue, and he was not impeached. The comments come as the House Intelligence Committee prepares for a second week of public hearings as part of its inquiry, including with the man who is arguably the most important witness. Gordon Sondland, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, is the only person interviewed to date who had conversations directly with the president because the White House has blocked others from cooperating with what they dismiss as a sham investigation.

Multiple witnesses overheard a phone call in which Trump and Sondland reportedly discussed efforts to push for the investigations. In private testimony to impeachment investigators made public Saturday, Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide and longtime Republican defense hawk, said Sondland told him he was discussing Ukraine matters directly with Trump. Morrison said Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between 15 July and 11 September that $391m in US assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released.

      "body": "<p>Personal computer firm HP has rejected a takeover approach from printer maker Xerox, despite pressure from billionaire investor Carl Icahn to agree a merger.</p> <p><a href=\"https://investor.hp.com/news/press-release-details/2019/HP-Board-of-Directors-Unanimously-Rejects-Unsolicited-Xerox-Proposal/default.aspx\">HP\u2019s board of directors said on Sunday</a> that they had unanimously rejected an unsolicited proposal from Xerox Holdings Corporation. They concluded that the $33.5bn (\u00a326bn) offer undervalued HP and was not in the best interests of shareholders.</p> <p>HP\u2019s chief executive, Enrique Lores, and chairman Chip Bergh told Xerox they were also concerned that the deal would leave the combined company with \u201coutsized debt levels\u201d. But they also said they recognised \u201cthe potential benefits\u201d of consolidation, suggesting the two firms should keep talking.</p> <p>\u201cWe are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox,\u201d wrote Lores and Bergh. \u201cHowever, as we have previously shared in connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"171ac71bbed1ebcc23d0249641088e18855ad9e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/171ac71bbed1ebcc23d0249641088e18855ad9e7/0_28_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Investor Carl Icahn, who has a stake in both companies, supports the merger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Investor Carl Icahn, who has a stake in both companies, supports the merger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Xerox offered to pay $22 per HP share, made up of $17 of cash plus 0.137 of its own shares each. That was a 20% premium on HP\u2019s share price before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/06/xerox-hp-hewlett-packard-bid\">news of the deal broke earlier this month</a>.</p> <p>Xerox is valued at $8.5bn (\u00a36.6bn), so its interest in acquiring larger rival HP was unexpected. Outlining the proposal, Xerox chief John Visentin suggested it could deliver cost savings of $2bn per year. </p> <p>But Lores and Bergh questioned the merits of the proposal in their response to Xerox, saying: \u201cWe note the decline of Xerox\u2019s revenue from $10.2bn to $9.2bn (on a trailing 12-month basis) since June 2018, which raises significant questions for us regarding the trajectory of your business and future prospects.\u201d</p> <p>They are now seeking \u201csubstantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox\u201d to see if a transaction is possible.</p> <p>Icahn has already concluded that a merger would make sense for investors. He has built up a 4.24% stake in HP alongside his 10.6% stake in Xerox.</p> <p>Xerox\u2019s strength is in printers for businesses, while HP has a stronger focus on the home market. Icahn sees clear synergies between two fading one-time tech giants. \u201cI think a combination is a no-brainer,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/carl-icahn-makes-case-for-xerox-hp-union-11573702903\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> last week.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve found over the years that these types of companies that are in shrinking industries tend to decline much more slowly than many market participants may predict, while continuing to generate substantial amounts of cash,\u201d he added.</p>",

HP\u2019s board of directors said on Sunday that they had unanimously rejected an unsolicited proposal from Xerox Holdings Corporation. They concluded that the $33.5bn (\u00a326bn) offer undervalued HP and was not in the best interests of shareholders. HP\u2019s chief executive, Enrique Lores, and chairman Chip Bergh told Xerox they were also concerned that the deal would leave the combined company with \u201coutsized debt levels\u201d. But they also said they recognised \u201cthe potential benefits\u201d of consolidation, suggesting the two firms should keep talking. \u201cWe are open to exploring whether there is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential combination with Xerox,\u201d wrote Lores and Bergh. \u201cHowever, as we have previously shared in connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox.\u201d Xerox offered to pay $22 per HP share, made up of $17 of cash plus 0.137 of its own shares each. That was a 20% premium on HP\u2019s share price before news of the deal broke earlier this month. Xerox is valued at $8.5bn (\u00a36.6bn), so its interest in acquiring larger rival HP was unexpected. Outlining the proposal, Xerox chief John Visentin suggested it could deliver cost savings of $2bn per year. But Lores and Bergh questioned the merits of the proposal in their response to Xerox, saying: \u201cWe note the decline of Xerox\u2019s revenue from $10.2bn to $9.2bn (on a trailing 12-month basis) since June 2018, which raises significant questions for us regarding the trajectory of your business and future prospects.\u201d They are now seeking \u201csubstantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox\u201d to see if a transaction is possible. Icahn has already concluded that a merger would make sense for investors. He has built up a 4.24% stake in HP alongside his 10.6% stake in Xerox. Xerox\u2019s strength is in printers for businesses, while HP has a stronger focus on the home market. Icahn sees clear synergies between two fading one-time tech giants. \u201cI think a combination is a no-brainer,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal last week. \u201cI\u2019ve found over the years that these types of companies that are in shrinking industries tend to decline much more slowly than many market participants may predict, while continuing to generate substantial amounts of cash,\u201d he added.",

      "body": "<p>Labour will unveil a compromise position on immigration in its manifesto on Thursday that would not commit fully to free movement after Brexit but would expand the rights of migrants to bring family members to the UK.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the manifesto launch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> said he would want his government to allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people in a sign Labour would want a liberal immigration policy overall.</p> \n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> leader stopped short of saying free movement would be allowed to continue in its current form, arguing instead for immigration to help with shortages in the NHS and for an expansion of the rights of migrants to bring family members to the UK.</p> \n<p>Speaking on Sunday on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, he said: \u201cA lot of EU nationals have made their homes in this country and made a massive contribution to our society \u2026 many of those families have been through unbelievable stress. So they absolutely must have the right to remain and bring their families here.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlso, there are also huge economic demands. There are 40,000 nurse vacancies in the NHS, partly because so many EU nationals have left. We have a shortage of doctors. We cannot exist in isolation.</p> \n<p>\u201cTherefore there has to be migration into Britain in order to maintain our economy and our services. That will be reflected in our policy that you see on Thursday.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pressed again on whether free movement would continue, Corbyn said: \u201cThere will be a lot of movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto said free movement would end at the point of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>.

      "bodyText": "Labour will unveil a compromise position on immigration in its manifesto on Thursday that would not commit fully to free movement after Brexit but would expand the rights of migrants to bring family members to the UK. Ahead of the manifesto launch, Jeremy Corbyn said he would want his government to allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people in a sign Labour would want a liberal immigration policy overall. However, the Labour leader stopped short of saying free movement would be allowed to continue in its current form, arguing instead for immigration to help with shortages in the NHS and for an expansion of the rights of migrants to bring family members to the UK. Speaking on Sunday on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, he said: \u201cA lot of EU nationals have made their homes in this country and made a massive contribution to our society \u2026 many of those families have been through unbelievable stress. So they absolutely must have the right to remain and bring their families here. \u201cAlso, there are also huge economic demands. There are 40,000 nurse vacancies in the NHS, partly because so many EU nationals have left. We have a shortage of doctors. We cannot exist in isolation. \u201cTherefore there has to be migration into Britain in order to maintain our economy and our services. That will be reflected in our policy that you see on Thursday.\u201d Pressed again on whether free movement would continue, Corbyn said: \u201cThere will be a lot of movement.\u201d The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto said free movement would end at the point of Brexit. This election\u2019s manifesto is not committed to carrying out Brexit, so the position will be that free movement would remain if the UK stays in the EU but it would be revised as part of any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour. Any Labour-negotiated deal would be likely to adopt a regime that is very close to the current arrangements in order to maintain single-market access, making sure that expanded rights of family reunion are part of the offer. A motion passed by the Labour conference argued for the UK to \u201cmaintain and expand\u201d free movement, which its organisers intended to mean an expansion of free movement to apply to countries across the world. However, Corbyn argued the movers of the motion only meant an expansion of family reunion rights. \u201cI agree with the principle there has to be the right of joining your spouse or whatever in this country,\u201d he said. The Tories have tried to make immigration a battleground issue, arguing that the Labour conference motion would mean open borders and immigration of 840,000 people a year to the UK. Labour\u2019s manifesto will make no such commitment to open borders and is likely to say that any new immigration regime with the EU would be negotiable as part of a Labour-led deal if Brexit goes ahead. The position was thrashed out at Labour\u2019s meeting on Saturday to determine the manifesto. Other major policies are expected to include higher income tax for those earning more than \u00a380,000, reversing corporation tax cuts, bringing all free schools and academies under local authority control and a large programme of renationalising utilities, broadband, railways and the postal service. Labour is also expected to bring in a form of windfall tax on oil and gas companies and continue with plans to ask firms to hand 10% of shares to workers. The party is not expected to go as far as putting all private schools into public ownership and seizing their assets, which was passed at conference, but it is likely to commit to closing tax loopholes that mean they get preferential treatment. The party\u2019s Brexit position had already been settled at conference, with Labour planning to negotiate its own Brexit deal and then hold a special conference to decide the party\u2019s position before a second referendum within six months. The Conservative party gave more details of its own plans for a post-Brexit immigration regime on Sunday, saying it would want migrants to be treated equally wherever they come from in the world, based on their skills. Under the Tory plans, the vast majority of immigrants would have to have a job, apart from highly skilled scientists and entrepreneurs. The Conservatives would also restrict access to benefits for both EU and non-EU nationals so that migrants would have to wait five years before getting them. The Tories would stop child benefit being sent abroad to support children who do not live in the UK and increase the annual cost for new migrants of accessing NHS treatment from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625. Asked about the Conservatives\u2019 immigration proposals, the security minister, Brandon Lewis, told Sky: \u201cAnybody who\u2019s already here and is part of the EU settled status scheme, their rights are protected, they are absolutely clearly protected and in place. \u201cThis will be for new people coming from the EU once we\u2019ve left the European Union under a future immigration system.\u201d Lewis also stressed that the party would not be setting \u201carbitrary\u201d targets for the level of migration but it would want overall levels to fall.",

Meanwhile, a nondescript pizza chain restaurant in Woking has been thrust into the limelight after the prince named it as an alibi location for allegations he engaged in sex with one of Epstein\u2019s alleged trafficking victims. The Coalition government is resisting a Senate order to release documents relating to its scandal-ridden regional jobs and investment package after the revelation that the eight most highly recommended projects, ranked by departmental analysis on a merit-based system, did not receive funding. An LNP donor who gave more than $25,000 since 2018 was one successful recipient, receiving more than $260,000 towards the expansion of a cattle hide processing facility \u2013 but it\u2019s not known what ranking that particular project was given or whether it was recommended. A spokeswoman for the Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, has said the \u201csignificant majority\u201d of RJIP projects approved were in line with advice provided by the department. Australia The Black Eyed Peas star will.i.am has accused an \u201coverly aggressive\u201d Qantas flight attendant of being racist after the rapper was met by police on his arrival at Sydney airport, following a dispute about the performer not following PA announcements. Opaque third-party crowdfunding websites contributed $43,000 to Jim Molan\u2019s re-election campaign, prompting questions once again about Australia\u2019s weak donations regulations. The ultimately unsuccessful \u201crogue\u201d campaign drew one anonymous donation of $10,000, a potential loophole for future political fundraising approaches. Margaret Atwood will tour Australia early next year, buoyed by the success of her Booker-prize winning sequel to her seminal 1985 hit, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The world Police and students have clashed at a Hong Kong university as the protests that have engulfed the former British colony become increasingly more violent. Teargas and water cannons have been met with molotov cocktails a day after China\u2019s President Xi Jinping made his first public remarks on the six-month crisis. Floods have closed Venice\u2019s St Mark\u2019s Square after a third significant high water level was recorded this week, with the damage bill already expected to top \u20ac1bn. Samoa has issued a state of emergency and shut all its schools after a deadly measles outbreak that has led to at least six deaths across the island nation. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a former wartime defence chief, has been elected Sri Lanka\u2019s new president, sparking concerns about increasing racial tensions given the outstanding allegations of torture levelled at the brother of former president Mahinda. Recommended reads John Safran is back \u2013 reigniting his fascination with religion and ritual and all things occult. Gone are the public crucifixions, personal exorcisms and encounters with voodoo doctors that helped his rise to prominence with John Safran vs God, writes Jenny Valentish. But has the outspoken satirist entirely outrun criticism from some of his earlier offensive stunts? \u201cI don\u2019t assume everyone\u2019s coming from a good place \u2026 It\u2019s a case-by-case thing, whether I take on board a criticism,\u201d he says. One of the most original songwriters around, New Zealand\u2019s Aldous Harding, is also profoundly unnerving. \u201cOn stage and in videos, the strangeness of Harding is intensified,\u201d writes Jude Rogers. \u201cTake the video for her new single, Zoo Eyes: she\u2019s dressed like an overpainted clown from a Jodorowsky film. At festivals this summer, she wore burnt-orange workmen\u2019s clothes and a porkpie hat, her eyes twitching, her mouth gurning like a silent film comedian.\u201d Yet she\u2019s also incredibly popular \u2013 making bold artistic statements and choices in an era that she considers to be typified by a fundamental fear of failure and an aversion to risk. Listen Recycling in Australia is broken. With millions of tonnes sent to Asia every year, what is the solution now that many overseas nations have said \u201cno more\u201d? On this episode of Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates speaks with Adam Morton to discuss what the domestic processing options might look like. Sport Max Verstappen has won a dramatic Brazilian Grand Prix in which teammates Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc took each other out, and Lewis Hamilton denied Thailand\u2019s Alexander Albon a first-ever podium finish. Colin Kaepernick has called on the NFL and franchise owners to \u201cstop running from the truth\u201d, questioning whether he\u2019s been given a \u201clegitimate process\u201d in his bid to restart his playing career, three years after it stalled after his anthem protests. There are few things more enjoyable for A-League season ticket holders than watching a local youngster come good. As the eye-catching Sam Silvera and the almost invisible Louis D\u2019Arrigo showed, this can come in contrasting fashions, writes Jonathan Howcroft. Media roundup Australia\u2019s foreign minister has labelled an explosive leaked document from within the Chinese Communist party in which Ji Xinping callled for \u201cno mercy\u201d against Muslim minorities as \u201cdisturbing\u201d, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. Fierce bushfires have forced a Queensland hospital to \u201cself-evacuate\u201d, writes the Courier-Mail, with campers on Moreton Island also being urged to leave immediately. And a former Labor police minister signed off on a $2.8m taxpayer-funded payment to Nicola Gobbo, claims the Herald Sun, as the Lawyer X scandal expands in scope. Coming up An inquest begins into Melbourne\u2019s deadly 2017 Bourke Street rampage, with up to 70 witnesses expected to give evidence. The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, is due back in a London court facing attempts to extradite him to the US. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 A \u00a31m Banksy sculpture up for sale at Sotheby\u2019s has been stolen and is being sold illegally, a London artist has claimed. According to Andy Link, he initially \u201ckidnapped\u201d the statue depicted a man slumped with a traffic cone on his head, called The Drinker, and attempted to ransom it back to Banksy, but the secretive artist never offered more than \u201c\u00a32 towards a can of petrol\u201d to destroy the work.

She and Giovanni say lovely things about each other, then take to the floor to \u2018My First, My Last, My Everything\u2019 by Barry White. They both slayed, but it\u2019s time to sashay away. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd1a5648f08aab51e1c0ceb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-17T19:54:23.337Z\">7.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Craig has a battle with his decision, but saves Saffron and AJ.

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s IT for our annual Blackpool outing \u2013 thank you all for coming along and being amazing. As mentioned yesterday I\u2019m off to watch the show next week, so there will be a stand-in liveblogger for Saturday night. Please play nicely, and I\u2019ll be back on Sunday so pick up the reins through to Christmas. Come and say hi on Twitter @heidistephens if you\u2019re passing, and have a great week! Hx Michelle gets a best bits montage, which means we\u2019re definitely at the sharp end of the competition. She and Giovanni say lovely things about each other, then take to the floor to \u2018My First, My Last, My Everything\u2019 by Barry White. They both slayed, but it\u2019s time to sashay away. Craig has a battle with his decision, but saves Saffron and AJ. Motsi and Bruno do likewise, which means MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI are leaving the Strictly dancefloor. Based on this weekend\u2019s performance, it was the right decision, much as it pains me to see them go. Watching Michelle and Giovanni\u2019s Vogue homage again, it\u2019s easy to see why a lot of people would think this was pretty light on content for a street/commercial routine. It references a pretty niche moment in pop music history that a lot of people won\u2019t get at all; I salute Michelle for going there, but it could be her ticket out of Strictly. That said, can we acknowledge Giovanni\u2019s dedication to striking a pose? He looks incredible. Dance off time! First up it\u2019s Saffron and AJ\u2019s Quickstep. The footwork is incredibly fast, but that looked pretty polished. Undoubtedly one of their best dances, she should be proud of that. I think this may be the end of the road for Michelle and Giovanni, Saffron and AJ got significantly better scores last night. On paper, neither of them deserves to be in the bottom two, but that\u2019s the way Strictly goes. So who is joining Saffron and AJ in tonight\u2019s dance off? Karim and Amy are safe, along with Emma and Anton and Alex and Neil. Which means MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI are in the dance off. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Westlife singing a medley of their greatest hits. I have a bit of a soft spot for Westlife, don\u2019t @ me. Next week when I\u2019m in the studio I get Andrea Bocelli and *checks notes* \u201cBruno Tonioli welcoming everyone back from Blackpool with his rendition of Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You\u201d. Please send thoughts and prayers. Saffron is a bit tearful about being in the dance-off. I think it\u2019s been a while since someone last told Saffron she couldn\u2019t have something she wanted. So who is safely through to next week, and who is in tonight\u2019s bottom two? Kelvin and Oti are safe, along with Chris and Karen. First couple in the dance-off: SAFFRON AND AJ. Chris Ramsay is definitely the people\u2019s favourite this series, helped along by some sugar-fuelled Blackpool scoring from the judges. On the upside, we don\u2019t have to watch that Salsa again. Last night on Strictly: one of my favourite shows of the series. Loved Alex and Neil\u2019s girl power Paso, and Karim and Amy\u2019s Charleston and Kelvin and Oti\u2019s Jives were both proper showstoppers. Well done for Anton getting his first ever Strictly tens despite drafting in some superfluous backing dancers to do the heavy lifting. Also loved the risk Michelle took with her Couple\u2019s Choice, it clearly meant a lot to her. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in feathery silver chain mail with both shoulders present and correct, Claudia in head-to-toe tiger print. It\u2019s considered a neutral in Blackpool. And we\u2019re off! Tonight\u2019s opening Blackpool extravaganza starts off with old Nadiya looking at the moon, dreaming of Johannes. Hey, we\u2019ve all been there. But now they\u2019re young again, and they\u2019ve taken all the Strictly lampposts to Blackpool. This is proper swishy-dress ballroom and I love it. Aww, Nadiya and Johannes are getting married. Could that not have been Graziano? Pulled myself away from S3 of The Crown earlier to catch the Countryfile Casual Weather, courtesy of Chris Fawkes in a smart navy shirt and charcoal slacks, with not so much as a rolled-up sleeve. I can only assume he\u2019d come from a gastropub lunch with the in-laws and didn\u2019t have time to change into jeans and manly plaid. Evening all, and welcome back for the Blackpool Results Show! I trust we\u2019re all feeling suitably jaded after too many cocktails and a night spent on that seafront tram, using Sooty as a pillow. It was a great show last night, but now it\u2019s time to say goodbye to another Strictly couple. Kick off is at 7.15pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! So that\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s show \u2013 I\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 7.15pm for the Blackpool results. I also wanted to say happy birthday to Ella \u2013 about seven years ago I promised her dad (my friend Chris) that if I was still doing this liveblog when she was 14 I\u2019d take her to Strictly, as that\u2019s the youngest age you\u2019re allowed in the studio. Somehow I\u2019m still here, and today is Ella\u2019s 14th birthday. Which means next Saturday I\u2019m taking her to Strictly. Thank you all for joining in down below \u2013 am off to read all your comments, and I\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow! Keeeep dancing for the rest of your Saturday, Hx And with that the dancing is done, and the voting lines are open! Time for a look at the leaderboard \u2013 Karim and Amy and Kelvin and Oti are at the top of the Tower, whilst Michelle and Giovanni are eating chips in the rain. I\u2019m currently very worried that it\u2019s going to be Chris and Karen vs. Michelle and Giovanni in the dance-off, and Chris is going to win. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Karim and Amy, Craig isn\u2019t ready to unleash his ten just yet. Craig thought it as clean, precise and tight \u2013 absolutely brilliant. Motsi is speechless \u2013 she can\u2019t give more than a ten but Karim can have her hairpiece or her clothes. God I love Motsi. Shirley thought it was absolutely flawless, and it was hard to tell who was the professional. Bruno reiterates that Karim reminds him of a young Gene Kelly, the whole show tonight has been spectacular. Tens all round? Karim\u2019s outfit is quite an alarming rainbow of colours, including a pair of yellow trousers that make him look like Fireman Sam at Mardi Gras. But you can\u2019t deny the man can dance \u2013 his footwork is incredible. Lovely details, great energy \u2013 LOVED that. Great finish to a pretty great Blackpool show. And finally tonight it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Happy\u2019 by C2C featuring Derek Martin. This is a great song for a Charleston, and I can\u2019t wait to see what tricks and treats Karim and Amy have up their sleeve (a bit late for Halloween, but we\u2019ll take it anyway). Karim messed up last week and had a rough ride from the judges, hopefully this Charleston will see him back in his performance comfort zone. Scores: 8,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 32 for Michelle and Giovanni, apparently the Couple\u2019s Choice free pass is no more. I think of lot of viewers won\u2019t have got that at all, am worried for Michelle this week. Bruno thought it was a great tribute to the mother of all divas. Craig wanted more definition in the vogue armography, but he loved the high styling and the sentiment. Motsi loved how Michelle is on her own kind of trip (LOL), and the message behind the dance was so important. Shirley thought Michelle used the music to its fullest, it had attitude and great sentiment. This is the least traditional Strictly dance ever, but I love how Michelle is owning it and Giovanni is well and truly leaning in. This won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea (being mostly armography and walking about), but I loved it. It\u2019s time for MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing their Couple\u2019s Choice \u2013 a Street/Commercial routine to \u2018Vogue\u2019 by Madonna. Everything about this sounds incredible, all it needs is Johannes in heels as one of the superfluous backing dancers and I will die a happy woman. The VT with Michelle\u2019s family is glorious, she dedicates this dance to the mothers out there who fight for their kids, and the LGBT community who have always been there for her. Dusty in here. Scores: 8,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 35 for Saffron and AJ. AJ has won fourteen titles on the sprung floor in Blackpool. Drink everything. Shirley thought Saffron managed the speed very well, but there were a few missteps. Bruno thought it captured the spirit of the jazz age, and Saffron managed the changes of pace well. Craig thought Saffron\u2019s elbow was dragging towards the end, but he loved the routine. Motsi thought Saffron was fearless and bold, and she looked like a ballroom queen. This has a charming 1920s feel, although a cream and gold dress when you\u2019ve reached Beefy Oxo levels of fake tan might have been a bad call. Saffron doing a pretty good job of keeping up, but the timing is a bit off in places and the superfluous backing dancers are even more annoying than usual. Nice sliding split at the end, a solid job of an incredibly demanding Quickstep. Next up it\u2019s SAFFRON AND AJ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Quickstep to \u2018Marvellous Party\u2019 by Beverley Knight. Last week AJ choreographed a beautiful Waltz that was well within Saffron\u2019s range; I\u2019m fully prepared for that to be a one-off, and for Saffron to spend this dance sprinting after AJ like he\u2019s just snatched her handbag. In their VT, AJ has mentioned both the size and the sprung nature of the floor. I think that\u2019s a full house! Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Kelvin and Oti. Kelvin made Motsi\u2019s life, it was out of this world. Shirley is speechless, Kelvin\u2019s footwork was superb. Bruno thought it was a Jive of the first degree \u2013 a professional standard. Craig thought the chassees could have been a bit lighter, but the strength and stamina were formidable. Lovely Jive footwork from Kelvin, including some random flying press ups, just because he can. But of course what we\u2019re all really looking at is how amazing Oti looks in horizontal stripes. If this is what prison is like, I will gladly relinquish my freedom. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Jailhouse Rock\u2019 from Smokey Joe\u2019s Caf\u00e9. Right now I think Kelvin and Oti are the ones to beat this year, they\u2019ve got so many great dances to revisit during final week and Oti is definitely due a glitterball win. Kelvin\u2019s wheeled out his nan! It\u2019s not on the bingo, but a Blackpool nan is a down in one. Scores: 8,8,9,9 \u2013 a total of 34 for Alex and Neil. Oh, we\u2019re not over-marking EVERYONE then. Good to know. Craig thought the hair was going to be the star, but Alex was powerful and theatrical, and really really great. Motsi was so proud of Alex, she let go and attacked the dance despite a few small issues. Shirley thought it was a pure girl Paso, Alex led the pack and held her own. Bruno thought it was like the Queen of Sheba leading a tribe of Amazons, which I don\u2019t think is how the story went but whatever. Really not sure about those outfits \u2013 it\u2019s a bit My Chemical Romance does Pirates of the Caribbean. That said, Alex is absolutely smashing this Paso \u2013 I love the attitude and attack. It\u2019s not technically perfect, but I think this might be one of my favourite Strictly Pasos ever. It\u2019s time for ALEX AND NEIL! This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Run The World (Girls)\u2019 by Beyonce. My hopes for this are higher than Bruno on candyfloss \u2013 we haven\u2019t really seen Fierce Alex yet. Scores: 8,9,10,10 \u2013 a total of 37 for Emma and Anton. My goodness, we have peaked early. Those are Anton\u2019s first ever tens on Strictly Come Dancing in 17 years. BIG DAY. Bruno thought it was glamorous, classy and sophisticated, a great job. Craig thought it had beautiful movement around the floor, although Emma\u2019s face was like a china doll with only one expression. Motsi thought Emma looked divine and the dance was amazing, her best dance so far. Shirley thought it was beautifully executed, by far Emma\u2019s best dance. I do love a traditional American Smooth, and this has got bags of elegance and charm. Emma loses her top line a bit, but there are few lovely lifts and some nice footwork. Enjoyed that. Incidentally if you squint a bit, Emma\u2019s dress looks like the bleeding corpse of a dead swan. Next in the slot of death it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! This week they\u2019re dancing the American Smooth to \u2018Let\u2019s Face the Music and Dance\u2019 by Ella Fitzgerald. This is very much Anton\u2019s comfort zone, but unless they can get top marks from the judges there may still be trouble ahead. In their VT, Anton takes Emma to the winter gardens to talk about all the trophies he\u2019s won. DRINK. Sooty is reading the Terms &amp; Conditions, despite him not being able to talk. Claudia has lost it. Scores: 7,8,9,9 \u2013 a total of 33 for Chris and Karen. It\u2019s going to be that kind of night, isn\u2019t it? Shirley loved how Chris opened the show, he brought his groove. Bruno enjoyed the ride \u2013 it was infectious fun, Salsa spiced up with hip hop and Chris\u2019s hips are starting to unclog. Craig thought it lacked flow and hip rotation, but the timing wasn\u2019t bad and Chris has upped his game. Motsi (sparkly polar bear with giant chandelier earrings, love it) thought it was slick and energetic. I had hoped that most of this Salsa was going to take place in the rollercoaster, but sadly not. I think the combo of hot pink trousers, lurid shirt and trainers is supposed to be a distraction from Chris doing a total of four bars of actual Salsa \u2013 the rest is mostly jigging about in a constipated fashion. I miss Dev. First up tonight it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Uptown Funk\u2019 by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars. Weirdly, this is the first time this song has ever featured on Strictly, let\u2019s see what Chris can bring to the party. In the VT, Chris is on a dayglo tram explaining Sooty to Karen. Sure, why not. Sprung floor mention! DRINK! Out come the stars! Oh my goodness, Michelle as Marie Antoinette is a DREAM. I\u2019ll explain the reference later for anyone who wasn\u2019t a huge Madonna fan in 1990. Wait, what ELSE were you doing? All our judges come out carrying Blackpool tat, including Bruno with some candyfloss. DRINK. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH \u2013 END OF THE PIER SPECIAL: Tess in yet another roasting bag (is she sponsored by Bacofoil?), Claudia in an ill-fitting sparkly suit. Blackpool obviously counts a feem week, so we get a bonus opening performance. There\u2019s quite a lot going on, involving all our stars, neon musical instruments and copious fringing. It\u2019s spectacularly camp and I love it. And we\u2019re off! Cue footage of the crew packing some glitterballs to take to Blackpool. The stars are on their way up north and they\u2019re absolutely buzzing about it. SEAGULL DRINK. This week\u2019s episode of Pointless appears to be set in an acid house party in 1989. That said, Alexander Armstrong looks great in a pink blazer. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 BLACKPOOL SPECIAL!

      "bodyText": "Jason Stein The former special adviser to Amber Rudd and spokesman for Liz Truss was hired by Prince Andrew in September to mastermind his PR fightback \u2013 but left by mutual consent two weeks ago after his advice to reject the Newsnight interview request was ignored. It was reportedly suggested that Andrew should instead focus on charitable work and then agree to two newspaper interviews next year. His Twitter profile says he is now a director at Finsbury Global, a strategic communications firm that specialises in \u201ccreating, sustaining, protecting and rebuilding reputation capital\u201d. Amanda Thirsk Private secretary to Prince Andrew and director of his Pitch@Palace Global operation. It is understood that Thirsk clashed with Stein and pushed hard for Andrew to do the interview in the face of his initial scepticism, persuading him that it was the best way to draw a line under the rumours about the nature of his relationship with convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A former banker, she joined Andrew\u2019s office in 2012. Described by one colleague as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who thinks \u201cthe Duke has done nothing wrong \u2026 All he did was go and see his friend.\u201d Emily Maitlis The lead presenter of Newsnight who was widely praised for her forensic interview technique and had practised with editor Esme Wren standing in for Andrew in rehearsals. Speaking before the interview on Friday\u2019s Newsnight, she told fellow presenter Kirsty Wark the interview was \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe what it feels like to be sitting in Buckingham Palace, opposite the Queen\u2019s son, Prince Andrew, and quizzing him about his sexual history,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter Epstein\u2019s death, the talks intensified \u2013 we had to make it clear it would be no holds barred.\u201d Samantha McAlister A BBC journalist since 2003, she joined Newsnight in 2011, where she is prized for her ability to secure hard-to-get interviews. Her LinkedIn profile says she is \u201cused to persuading reluctant individuals to participate in a globally renowned news programme\u201d. The former barrister and European debating champion has previously booked interviews with former FBI director James Comey and former US president Bill Clinton, and was described on Saturday by Newsnight editor Esme Wren as \u201cindefatigable\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to correct descriptions of Epstein\u2019s offending.",

The group\u2019s final two games kick off at 5pm GMT, but already we know that Kosovo will finish in third place, the Czech Republic in second and England first, with the only uncertainty being whether Bulgaria, who host the Czechs in Sofia, can get the point they need to climb off the foot of the table at Montenegro\u2019s expense. But thanks to Uefa\u2019s merry if mightily confusing bonus extra qualifying play-off bonanza stage both Bulgaria and Kosovo (because of their performances in the Nations League) will have another chance, whatever happens to them today, and Montenegro will thus be the only team from the group to actually be eliminated at the end of it, even if they don\u2019t finish bottom of it.</p> <p>So, that\u2019s cleared that up.</p> <p>Thus nothing of great significance rests on this game. But Gareth Southgate was right to say in the build-up that \u201cseeding could be crucial\u201d, and England need to win to guarantee that they will be in the top group of seeds for the Euro 2020 final tournament draw (5pm GMT on Saturday 30 November, diary fans), which would probably make their progress through the tournament a great deal smoother, and as an added bonus would guarantee that they play all their group games at Wembley.</p> <p>Happily, Kosovo is one of the rare corners of Europe that does not yet dislike the British, and something akin to a carnival atmosphere is expected at the Stadiumi Fadil Vokrri in Pristina (Fadil Vokrri was a fine footballer and later president of the Kosovan FA, who died last year aged 57).

      "bodyText": "Southgate reaction Ben Fisher\u2019s player ratings ... Nick Ames on Raheem Sterling ... And that\u2019s all from me. Thanks for your company. Bye! David Hytner has filed his match report, and here it is: England have cut a swathe through their Euro 2020 qualifying group, advancing to the finals on the back of a run of free-scoring and expressive performances and, once again, they had too much for lowlier ranked opponents here. It was a display of control from Gareth Southgate\u2019s young team, which was marked by Harry Winks\u2019s first-half goal \u2013 his first in an England shirt \u2013 and glossed by a late surge that showed how ruthless they can be when they find their connections. Much more here: Southgate is also asked about Raheem Sterling\u2019s reintegration after last week\u2019s kerfuffle. \u201cYou have to work through any difficulties that you might have,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole group have done that really well and I think we come out of this stronger than we started it frankly.\u201d Gareth Southgate has his post-match chat: I think it was a tight game. It was a tough test for us really. A difficult pitch, in particular, lots of people slipping, but we needed a tighter game. It was the sort of challenge I was quite happy that we got. We had to withhold spells of pressure, gave them a few half-chances that on another night would have been more of a problem, but our counter-attacking was absolutely ruthless. Alex [Oxlade-Chamberlain] has been a real plus with the power of his running, and the attacking threat he gives us. Harry Winks was excellent both games. He took the ball well in moments tonight when we needed calming. His ability to receive the ball under pressure and keep his calmness really settles the team. The set plays in particular are something we need to have a look at. There have been too many people free in the box and chances given away. We\u2019re always looking to improve, there\u2019s still work to do, but I can\u2019t fault the players with what they\u2019ve done in this qualifying campaign. England were not that great here, and the scoreline flatters them considerably. But there is some serious attacking talent in this squad, Marcus Rashford came off the bench to score a lovely goal and all was well. This has not been one of England\u2019s all-time hardest qualifying groups, but it\u2019s been won with ease. Harry Kane is happy: Difficult game. Difficult pitch. We\u2019d already won the group so the mentality isn\u2019t always easy to go again. We got 1-0 up, went through a few spells when they had a bit of pressure but we soaked it up and towards the end of the game, when space started to open up, we were clinical. It\u2019s a clean sheet. We know we could improve, but tonight was difficult, the pitch was poor and it was hard to play, so there were always going to be mistakes. I don\u2019t remember Pope making too many saves. Next time and when we play better teams, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re on it. Harry Winks, one of two England players to score their first international goals today, has a chat: It\u2019s a dream come true to score for my country. It\u2019s one I never really thought would happen, but to score the first goal was a great moment for me. I like to consider myself as someone who can be in the pivot or be a No8. The manager told me what he wanted from the role and I tried my best to deliver that. There\u2019s always moments we need to improve on, but we were excellent today, and ruthless. Czech Republic, runners-up in Group A, have a goal difference of +2. England\u2019s is +31. 90+3 mins: And that\u2019s it! England storm into the pot of Euro 2020\u2019s top seeds with a comfortable win! And a farewell gift makes it four! Dresevic collects the ball from his goalkeeper, tries to take it round Kane and, at the worst possible moment, falls over. Kane taps it to Mount, who finishes in style! 90 mins: Rashford\u2019s goal is his ninth in his last 10 appearances for club and country. He has brought some welcome pace and urgency to England\u2019s forward line. 88 mins: In today\u2019s other Group A game, Bulgaria are beating the Czech Republic 1-0. Vasil Bozhikov scored in the 56th minute, heading in from a free kick. 87 mins: Rashford collects a long ball and tricks his way past Aliti, but not past Kololli. 86 mins: Kane has now scored in each of his last six England games. It is only the second time since the Second World War that any England player has done this. The last one? A certain Harry Kane, between October 2017 and July 2018. 84 mins: England\u2019s final substitution now, and Tomori has come on for Alexander-Arnold. He is playing at right back. And a third! Rashford passes infield to Sterling, who carries the ball towards the heart of the area before passing back to his left for Rashford, who curls it inside the far post with a first-time shot! 82 mins: Kosovo\u2019s final change sees Rashani replace Nuhiu. 79 mins: England keep the ball for an absolute age, mostly in their own half. Then Mings dinks it upfield to Winks and suddenly the move changes pace. Rice drives forward before finding Sterling, and he outpaces Rachica on the right before sending in a cross that deflects off Aliti to leave Kane with a tap-in! England make it safe! 75 mins: Chance for Kosovo! They break after an England free-kick, Rashica exchanges passes with Zhegrova and as he runs into the area Pope rushes out of goal prematurely and then also falls over, but Rice gets back to throw a foot in the way of the ball! 72 mins: A couple more changes. Mason Mount replaces Oxlade-Chamberlain for England, and Zhegrova replaces Hadergjonaj for Kosovo. 69 mins: Kosovo break, and a couple of nice passes release Hadergjonaj, who runs down the inside right channel before shooting. His effort though is both underpowered and poorly placed, and Pope saves. 67 mins: A nice run from Rashford, who speeds down the left, tricks his way into the area and then, having left two defenders on the turf, can\u2019t decide whether to pass, shoot or keep running, and while he hesitates the ball is taken away from him. 65 mins: Kosovo make their first substitution, bringing Halimi on for Berisha. 61 mins: Save! And then England hit a post! They move down the left. Chilwell passes to Rashford, takes the ball back and shoots low across goal. Muric tips it wide, and Sterling catches the ball before it goes behind and pulls back to Kane, whose first-time effort crashes against the near post and away to safety! 59 mins: Eventually Kosovo fling a long ball onto Chilwell\u2019s head, and he nods it down to Hudson-Odoi. The Chelsea winger runs all the way to the edge of Kosovo\u2019s area without a hint of a challenge before shooting over. And that\u2019s his last touch, with Marcus Rashford replacing him. 58 mins: \u201cIt has English hubris written all over it,\u201d writes Philip Ritson of this game, as Kosovo pass the ball about a bit. \u201cToo many changes, an unbalanced midfield, lacklustre start to the second half and the distraction of the Sterling/Gomez saga. Kosovo will win this 2:1.\u201d 55 mins: England win a free kick on the left. This half they have only attacked from free kicks, and even then poorly. This one goes behind for a goal kick. 53 mins: Rrahmani totally fluffs a free header! He runs onto the ball, just beyond the far post, and with Pope completely exposed gets his effort completely wrong, the ball spinning well wide of goal. It\u2019s turned behind for another corner, which is cleared. 52 mins: Another Kosovo corner. England haven\u2019t got into this half at all. 50 mins: Close! The corner is headed clearish to Berisha, whose shot is going well wide before Rrahmani gets a touch to it, after which it goes much less wide! But still wide. 49 mins: Kosovo cross from the right, cross from the left and cross from the right again, without England dealing with any of it at all well. In the end Oxlade-Chamberlain shanks a clearance out of play for a corner. 48 mins: Kololli earns the day\u2019s first booking for stopping Sterling from running onto a return pass from Oxlade-Chamberlain. The pass was anyway a bit overhit, so he probably wouldn\u2019t have reached it anyway. 46 mins: The second half has begun. The players are back out, with both teams unchanged. The second half is about to begin! It has not been a memorable half of football. Winks and Rice are I fear not an ideal partnership in central midfield, and with Kosovo doing most of their attacking down the wings the latter hasn\u2019t contributed a great deal. Perhaps a more offensive midfielder would help England a bit more in this game, even if it leaves the centre a little underdefended. 45 mins: England pass the ball about a bit as the seconds until half-time tick down, and after absolutely no stoppage time, the referee blows his whistle. England have the lead at the break! 43 mins: Mings\u2019 back-pass is a bit wide of Pope, who is a bit slow to react, and Kosovo have a freebie corner. 42 mins: From just outside the area, Celina takes a touch to set himself and then shoots over the bar. \u201cOne of my best friends worked in an embassy in Pristina for a time - had nothing but good things to say about the lovely people in a country that\u2019s looking to move forward,\u201d writes Tom Hopkins. \u201cIn fact, she did some work with the Kosovo National Ballet and their main grumble was that every producer they brought in from elsewhere just wanted to do things about war.\u201d Yes, that must be a frustration. 38 mins: A bit of wind appears to have gone out of the game\u2019s sails since the goal. Sterling has shifted from the right to the left, with Hudson-Odoi moving in the other direction, and looks much happier for it. 35 mins: Hadergjonaj gets into a fine crossing position on the right, but curls the ball straight to Pope. They look a fine side in search of a cutting edge. 33 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain feints to shoot but instead conjures a lovely pass to Winks, whose first touch is lovely. Dresevic looks well placed to make a challenge but instead he takes a step back and Winks can run into the area, convince Muric he\u2019s about to shoot to his right, wait for him to commit and then shoot to the left! Suddenly, Kosovo\u2019s til-now steadfast defence opens up, and England take the lead! 30 mins: Save! Berisha dances into England\u2019s penalty area, and might have gone down when Sterling challenged. Instead he loses the ball, England break and in the end Hudson-Odoi dances into Kosovo\u2019s penalty area, but when he eventually shoots Muric makes an easy save. 28 mins: Rice just fails to cut out a pass just outside Kosovo\u2019s penalty area. Had he got a toe to it, it would have deflected to a lonely Kane in a very dangerous spot. Anyway, he didn\u2019t. As you were. 26 mins: Another shot from long range, this from Dresevic, but it goes wide. Kosovo are probably shading this game at the moment, even if they don\u2019t seem that interested in getting into England\u2019s penalty area. 24 mins: Another shot! Rashica took it, and it was arrowing right into the corner, but it was from a shade over 30 yards so Pope had time to make the save. 23 mins: Kosovo win a corner, from which Rrahmani heads straight into a defender. In Sofia, the day\u2019s other Group A game is also goalless. 22 mins: Sterling knocks the ball back to Alexander-Arnold and then sprints into the area after the chipped return pass, but Muric comes out to claim. There\u2019s quite a lot of imprecision about both sides\u2019 passing, probably because the pitch is not entirely reliable. 20 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain brings Aliti down, revenge perhaps for the earlier foul he suffered. Or just an innocent bit of gentle kicking. Either way. 17 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain is on the turf again, this time after losing his footing. He beats the earth again, but only in frustration. 15 mins: Chance for England! Chilwell picks up the ball in his own half and runs in a straight line down the left flank until level with the penalty spot, from where he crosses low to Kane. He controls and lays it back to Sterling, whose shot is saved by a diving Muric. 14 mins: Winks is seeing a lot of the ball. He feeds Sterling on England\u2019s right, but the cross is overhit and bounces out for a throw-in. 12 mins: ...Muric comes out confidently to claim the ball when it arrives. 11 mins: Oxlade-Chamberlain is down again, this time because Aliti kicked his ankle. Alexander-Arnold will swing the ball into the area. 8 mins: The right flank has been a centre of sloppiness for England so far, with Sterling giving the ball away a couple of times, and now Alexander-Arnold doing so too. 7 mins: Save! A cross from the left, and Nuhiu beats Mings to the header - neither player bothering to jump - and heads goalwards, but Pope is well placed and stops it. 6 mins: A bit of gentle sparring to start the game, largely concentrated within 15 yards of the halfway line. 3 mins: He\u2019s back up, and is playing on! After initially clutching a knee and beating the turf and generally looking very poorly, he recovered pretty quickly. Oxlade-Chamberlain has already had three serious knee injuries and appears thoroughly likeable, so that was a heart-in-mouth moment as well as a knee-in-hands one. 2 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain is down, and hurt! 1 min: A shot! It\u2019s taken Kosovo 28 seconds, but Hadergjonaj\u2019s 20-yarder is weak and easily stopped by Pope. 1 min: Peeeeeep! The home side get the game started! They have sung their anthems. A violinist has blatantly mimed to Kosovo\u2019s. And we\u2019re almost ready for action! The players are in the tunnel! It\u2019s very, very white in there. The floor is white. The ceiling is white. The walls are white. England are dressed all in white. England continue to deal with a deluge of praise, thanks and general appreciation as kick-off approaches: Gareth Southgate has a chat, firstly about Kosovo and the welcome England have experienced there: Incredible. We had a bit of a heads-up on that, but yeah, it\u2019s a massive occasion for Kosovo and we\u2019ve got to be prepared for that on the pitch. They didn\u2019t play so well at the weekend so there\u2019ll be a reaction from that, and obviously we\u2019re a big scalp. He talks about the game as \u201ca chance to have a bit of a look at a couple of players we need to have a closer look at before the summer\u201d, with Nick Pope and Callum Hudson-Odoi on trial today. But he says he also \u201cwanted to get a balance today of some consistency from what we did in the last game\u201d, hence keeping the same full-backs. I think it\u2019s fair to say that this is not the reception England are used to receiving when they play away: The Kosovo manager, Bernard Challandes, seems quite impressed by this England team: We know exactly against who we will play and we have seen in the last game and all this campaign, England has the best potential offensive in the world now. For me, it\u2019s the first favourite for the next European Championship, with this offensive potential. It\u2019s an advantage for us to play here. There\u2019s a big, big enthusiasm behind the team. People are very proud of the team. Unfortunately we have only 13,000 spectators, but I think the players of Kosovo have a good feeling with the support, and that can help, particularly today. We never lost here, but we never played against such a team as England also. A peek inside the Kosovo dressing room suggests that they are partial to the occasional biscuit: Here\u2019s a handy Kosovan line-up with bonus formation: In case you\u2019ve already forgotten September\u2019s Wembley goalfest between these sides, here\u2019s a reminder: Kosovo\u2019s line-up: Muric, Hadergjonaj, Aliti, Rashica, Celina, Rrahmani, V Berisha, Vojvoda, Kololli, Dresevic, Nuhiu. England\u2019s team is in, and it looks like this: Pope, Alexander-Arnold, Maguire, Mings, Chilwell, Winks, Rice, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Hudson-Odoi, Sterling, Kane. Hello world! And so, for Euro 2020 Qualifying Group A, it ends. The group\u2019s final two games kick off at 5pm GMT, but already we know that Kosovo will finish in third place, the Czech Republic in second and England first, with the only uncertainty being whether Bulgaria, who host the Czechs in Sofia, can get the point they need to climb off the foot of the table at Montenegro\u2019s expense. But thanks to Uefa\u2019s merry if mightily confusing bonus extra qualifying play-off bonanza stage both Bulgaria and Kosovo (because of their performances in the Nations League) will have another chance, whatever happens to them today, and Montenegro will thus be the only team from the group to actually be eliminated at the end of it, even if they don\u2019t finish bottom of it. So, that\u2019s cleared that up. Thus nothing of great significance rests on this game. But Gareth Southgate was right to say in the build-up that \u201cseeding could be crucial\u201d, and England need to win to guarantee that they will be in the top group of seeds for the Euro 2020 final tournament draw (5pm GMT on Saturday 30 November, diary fans), which would probably make their progress through the tournament a great deal smoother, and as an added bonus would guarantee that they play all their group games at Wembley. Happily, Kosovo is one of the rare corners of Europe that does not yet dislike the British, and something akin to a carnival atmosphere is expected at the Stadiumi Fadil Vokrri in Pristina (Fadil Vokrri was a fine footballer and later president of the Kosovan FA, who died last year aged 57). Here\u2019s a Nick Ames story on that special relationship: And here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s big match team news update and preview thingy:",

      "bodyText": "A new wave of figurative painters \u2013 many of whom are women of colour \u2013 are breathing new life into a form that has traditionally been dominated by white male artists and has been described as \u201canachronistic, inert, crusty\u201d. Joy Labinjo was a star at Frieze London last month. The 24-year-old, who has already had two major solo shows: Recollections at Tiwani Contemporary in London and Our histories cling to us, which is currently on at the Baltic in Gateshead, has become one of the most in-demand young British artists. Labinjo is not alone. This year there has been Faith Ringgold\u2019s lauded show at the Serpentine; Claudette Johnson\u2019s first major solo exhibition since 1990 at Modern Art Oxford; London-based Kudzanai-Violet Hwami\u2019s paintings at Gasworks in Vauxhall; the British-Liberian painter Lina Iris Viktor at Autograph in Hackney; and in October, Christina Quarles opened a show full of abstract figures at Hepworth Wakefield. In the US, Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald have embraced the form \u2013 ultimately resulting in their presidential portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama. Next March, the Nigerian-American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola \u2013 known for her obsidian drawings of black subjects \u2013 will bring a site-specific installation to the Barbican. A month earlier, Whitechapel Gallery will open a major exhibition focused on the new figurative movement called Radical Figures: Painting in the New Millennium, featuring Quarles and Tschabalala Self \u2013 another star of Frieze this year. Lydia Yee, chief curator at the Whitechapel Gallery, said that for many of the new generation of figurative artists, painting minority ethnic subjects was a way to redress the lack of diversity in major institutions and to experiment with the limits of the form. \u201cFor them, figurative painting is about subject matter, as opposed to abstraction or other forms of painting that are less representational,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s radical both in terms of the social and political elements of what these artists are doing, but also in the kind of experimental nature of the way they\u2019re painting.\u201d Labinjo said her interest in figurative painting came from studying Sonia Boyce, and after attending the Saatchi\u2019s Painters\u2019 Painters exhibition, which included work by contemporary artists such as Martin Maloney and Dexter Dalwood. \u201cIt was supposed to be the greatest painters of the 20th century. They were all white men,\u201d said Labinjo, who began painting her own Nigerian family from photos in an album. The idea of addressing the balance is a key element to the revival of figurative painting and drawing, according to the art critic and author Eddie Chambers, who said black artists had far fewer \u201cimages of self-affirmation\u201d than their white contemporaries. \u201cImages that say \u2018I am here\u2019, \u2018I am important\u2019, \u2018my stories are important\u2019 \u2013 these are, I think, some of the motivations behind the use of figuration,\u201d he said. But despite the popularity of Labinjo and other artists at Frieze \u2013 most of the work she had at the fair sold out a few hours after the preview opened \u2013 data shows the hype around young, female, minority ethnic artists has not offset the huge discrepancies seen in the art world. Last year a joint investigation by In Other Words and Artnet found that American museums dedicated only 7.6% of their exhibitions to the work of African American artists \u2013 with the Studio Museum in Harlem, which has helped develop black talent including Kerry James Marshall, accounting for more than a third of the total. More research this year found that only 11% of all acquisitions and 14% of exhibitions at 26 large American museums over the past decade were of work by female artists. Despite the figures, Charlotte Jansen, the editor-at-large of Elephant magazine, thinks there is a wider cultural shift that is hard to measure. Jansen sees a link between the new wave of figuration and the resurgence of interest in radical black feminist writing by Octavia Butler, bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison and Angela Carter, who have become influential among a younger generation and \u201cdefinitely give a sense of history, purpose and solidarity among the under-represented\u201d. Jansen also puts the trend down to the influence of west African studio photographers such as Malick Sidib\u00e9 and Seydou Ke\u00efta, who found subjects in their immediate surroundings. \u201cI think that\u2019s had an effect on the way a lot of younger painters are working,\u201d said Jansen. \u201cEspecially the approach of going back into your own visual history, family photo albums, collected and found pictures and exploring your identity through that \u2013 something that artists like Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Joy Labinjo and Kudzanai-Violet Hwami have done.\u201d Labinjo said: \u201cI think just by painting black figures, it\u2019s politicised. But I don\u2019t see myself as a political artist. I just see myself as a figurative painter, but \u2013 because of the time we\u2019re in now \u2013 the paintings are loaded.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 because an earlier version misnamed Modern Art Oxford as Oxford Modern.

Nick Pope, on his first England start, was not extended in goal. The slippery pitch did not help the players\u2019 confidence and there were errors on both sides during a slow-burning first half, when Kosovo\u2019s high press asked questions of England in possession. Southgate felt that Harry Maguire and Winks brought calmness when they set the play. It was not Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s game, as he made a succession of loose passes in the first-half, but he did dart from left to right before shooting too close to Muric. England also threatened in the 15th minute after Chilwell\u2019s run and cross and a Kane lay-off for Sterling. The winger\u2019s shot drew a save from Muric. Kosovo flickered from a pair of corners at the start of the second half and it was a worry from an England point of view to see the space that Amir Rrahmani managed to find on both occasions. On the second his far-post header was wild. England had advertised the second goal. Kane hit the near post from Sterling\u2019s pull-back after a Chilwell incision while Sterling was denied by Aliti\u2019s saving challenge. Oxlade-Chamberlain sparked that move when he won the ball and found Kane and the Liverpool midfielder would hear praise from Southgate, who said he had shown his qualities in the No8 role. Yet Oxlade-Chamberlain looked distraught when he was substituted. Did he feel that the occasion had gone to his plan? When Kane scored the second goal, it was the prompt for the grandstand finish and Southgate could also introduce Fikayo Tomori at right-back for his debut. England have tougher tests ahead. They will approach them with confidence.",

      "bodyText": "Anyhow, that\u2019s about us - we\u2019l be back in a fortnight, when the season will close in Abu Dhabi. It promises to be another jazzer. Ta-ra! Phew! That was yet another belting race - we\u2019ve been waiting for a Hamilton-Verstappen duel, and it did not disappoint. And, as we said at the start, Verstappen is the coming man. Next season is going to be very special, and Red Bull are ready. Mercedes, and Hamilton, have work to do. Here\u2019s Giles Richards\u2019 report from Interlagos. Hamilton (Mercedes) 396 Bottas (Mercedes) 314 Verstappen (Red Bull) 260 Leclerc (Ferrari) 249 Vettel (Ferrari) 230 Gasly (Toro Rosso) 95 Sainz Jr (McLaren) 92 Albon (Red Bull) 84 Verstappen enjoys the Netherlands national anthem. Odds and sods: that fourth place equals Sainz\u2019s best-ever F1 finish, and Giovinazzi\u2019s sixth is now his. Of course, Hamilton might lose that third place, if the stewards penalise him for the Albon incident. But, in the meantime: 1. Verstappen 2. Gasly 3. Hamilton 4. Sainz Jr 5. Raikkonen 6. Giovinazzi 7. Ricciardo 8. Norris 9. Perez 10. Kvyat 11. Magnussen 12. Hulkenberg 13. Russell 14. Grosjean 15. Albon 16. Kubica Vettel, Stroll, Leclerc, Bottas did not finish Gasly is buzzing. It\u2019s his first podium, and he says he\u2019s made many in other motorsport, but this is something special. He also enjoyed his finish with Hamilton, trying to get low in the car. Hamilton says the gap to take Albon was there but then it closed and he massively apologises. Red Bull were quicker on the straights, he says, and he took a lot of risks, giving it everything he could to win. Barichello says Verstappen looked unbeatable today and Hamilton agrees there was nothing he could\u2019ve done. He had the speed around the corners but not on the straights. Verstappen tells Barichello that Hamilton was very quick and they twice played good moves to beat him. He says he controlled the race and had great fun out there. He was pushing glat-out to be close to Hamilton when they restarted and he knew he had DRS and great top speed so was confident he could pull it off. But spare a thought for poor Alex Albon, whos podium was confiscated by a Hamiltonian shunt. Pierre Gasly, meanwhile, is a-whoopin an a-hollerin - he is ecstatic with that finish and rightly so. It wasn\u2019t exactly vintage but, as Ryan Giggs would say, he'd\u2019ve took it. That was more or less a perfect weekend from Verstappen. Pole, then a brilliant drive, great tactics, and a win despite various unforeseen circumstances. He is going to be a danger next season. Gasly is second - his first podium - with Hamilton third. Lap 71/71 Hamilton might find himself penalised for that, but Albon made an error offering the space. Hamilton\u2019s car is slightly mangled. Lap 70/71 Verstappen leads by 1.547s but HAVE A LOOK! Lap 70/71 Verstappen absolutely streaks away! Albon is second but Hamilton nails Gasly and is in behind! Lap 69/71 Off goes the safety car, and we\u2019re going to have two laps of mania! Lap 69/71 There\u2019s bare debris on the track, so no chance of a swift restart. I\u2019d love to check out Ferrari\u2019s team meeting, because Vettel and Leclerc will have some opinions. Lap 69/71 Presumably this is now going to be a safety-car finish, in which case Mercedes have pitted Hamilton off the podium! We can laugh, and so can he given he\u2019s champion ... but being a champion means not finding stuff like that laughable. Lap 68/71 So who was at fault for that carash? Vettel seemed to blame Leclerc, but it was he who moved off the line, though in a sense both are unlucky - the contact was so minor, it\u2019s amazing that it\u2019s caused so much damage to both cars. Lap 67/71 Hamilton pits, and all of a sudden we\u2019re going to have i don\u2019t even know what! We might get some extra laps, but Hamilton is now fourth; how\u2019s he improving on second from there, in whatever\u2019s left? Lap 66/71 Leclerc diddles Vettel down the inside! That\u2019s very nice ... but they get close, kiss sides, and BOTH ARE OUT OF THE RACE! Lap 65/71 This race is over as far as first place goes, but there\u2019s all manner of shenaniga going on behind them. Vettel defends and attack from Leclerc, as does Giovinazzi from Ricciardo. Lap 64/71 Vettel has DRS and he hacks at Albon! This is Albon\u2019s first go up top with the big dawgs and he\u2019s handling it well! He closes the door! Lap 63/71 3.071s the lead now, and Hamilton only has 0.783s on Albon. Vettel and Leclerc are both within striking distance ... and Lap 62/71 Verstappen leads by 2.45s and it\u2019s hard to see Hamilton closing that gap - there\u2019s more chance he gets diddled by Albon, I\u2019d say. Lap 61/71 That pit was a great call by Red Bull. Hamilton just couldn\u2019t keep up, though we need to say that Verstappen drove a gorgeous bend to force them home. Lap 61/71 That was brilliant by Verstappen, and behind him, Albon nails Vettel and Leclerc to take third! And now he goes for Hamilton! Lap 60/71 Verstappen goes! He bousts around the outside, Hamilton fights back, they\u2019re wheel to wheel, and Verstappen has the legs on him! Verstappen leads! What a call from Red Bull! Lap 60/71 \u201cCome on mate, you\u2019ve done this once already on the same compound,\u201d Verstappen is told. Hamilton tries to back him into Vettel and off they go! Lap 59/71 The safety car will go away at the end of this lap. Hamilton is not pleased with his predicament. Lap 59/71 Christian Horner says Mercedes would\u2019ve done the opposite of whatever his team did, so they took the attacking option, conceding place for pace. Lap 58/71 We\u2019ve gone from not needing a safety car to having one on for TIME. Another two laps more, reckon commentary, on the basis that it\u2019s a short circuit and the way needs to be clear for everyone. Lap 58/71 When this gets going again, Hamilton won\u2019t just have Verstappen on his arse - Vettel and Leclerc also have the tyres and speed to get into him. Lap 57/71 \u201cThe safety car needs to speed up, man - jeez,\u201d Hamilton tells his team. Lap 56/71 Verstappen is on softs, and is desperate to see the back of the safety car to deploy his advantage. What a race this is going to be! What a race this is! Lap 56/71 Hamilton leads, and it looks like the two cars between them will move out of the way when the safety car does one. That\u2019s going to be a while, though. Lap 55/71 Whos going to pit ... Hamilton or Verstappen? It\u2019s Verstappen! Will he have the pace to chase him down? Lap 54/71 Bottas did a good job, but nonetheless it comes out, and it\u2019s going to be a sprint! Lap 53/71 Hamilton has taken the lead down to 0.981! He\u2019s nearly in DRS range, but Verstappen says he didn\u2019t slow down enough for the yellow flags! More on that presently! Lap 52/71 Smoke coming out the back of Bottas\u2019s car, but he smashes the gas anyway, nabbing the DRS to have a shy at Leclerc ... but he can\u2019t get by and that\u2019s that for him! He pulls out of the race and parks up safely to avoid a safety car situation. Lap 51/71 Albon pits, so Leclerc moves up to fourth and Bottas to fifth. Meanwhile, Hamilton whittles Verstappen\u2019s lead down to 1.149s... Lap 50/71 Vettel and Ferrari realise it\u2019s hopeless and pit. Verstappen now leads, by 1.520s from Hamilton. He then extends the gap to 1.624, and looks good for the W. Lap 49/71 Bottas, in sixth, has a go at Leclerc with DRS and looks like he\u2019s making it count ... but no! Excellent defence from Leclerc, but Bottas has a pace issue. Lap 49/71 Verstappen will be on Vettel in one lap\u2019s time; \u201cneeds more power,\u201d Hmailton tells his team. That\u2019s not one you hear often. Lap 48/71 Verstappen sets a personal best lap for the race that\u2019s quicker than Hamilton by 0.3. Vettel is not long for this lead. Lap 47/71 Hamilton and Verstappen are lapping a second quicker than Vettel, and Hmailton is lapping 0.2 quicker than Verstappen. Lap 46/71 Mercedes did well to get in first - the gap between Hamilton and Verstappen is less than it was before the stops. Vettel leads by 5.391... Lap 45/71 In goes Verstappen and that\u2019s another bazzing stop, 1.9s, and he exits the pits ahead of Hamilton, who also has Magnussen to contend with - he\u2019s between them. Vettel now leads; do his tyres have the pace to keep him in front for another 26 laps? Lap 44/71 Hammertime! Hamilton gets out ahead of Albon, in third, and Verstappen will surely respond immediately. Lap 44/71 And Hamilton goes in! Can they get it done before Albon, in fourth, goes through the Senna S? Lap 43/71 Verstappen leads by 2.814s, as Hamilton asks his team What\u2019re you waiting for?\u201d He\u2019s had enough and wants to come in. Lap 42/71 Bottas goes first! He\u2019s on hards now, and comes out in sixth, ahead of Gasly. That\u2019s good news for Red Bull, because he\u2019s not now in Verstappen\u2019s way Lap 41/71 The next round of stops will decide this race - who\u2019ll blink first? Hamilton is still complaining about his tyres, so perhaps it\u2019ll be him. Lap 40/71 Verstappen ploughs on, and it\u2019s windy. Lap 39/71 Bottas loses some pace - great news for Verstappen. The gap is 23s or so, and might Red Bull bring him in now while the going\u2019s good? Lap 38/71 Verstappen has to get through maybe ten more laps before he pits, and hasn\u2019t opened enough of a lead over Bottas to be sure of coming out in front of him. That\u2019s a right boon for Hamilton and Vettel. Lap 37/71 Verstappen Hamilton Vettel Bottas Albon Leclerc Gasly Raikkonen Giovinazzi Perez Lap 36/71 Vettel can\u2019t make an impression - he\u2019s 12.889 behind Verstappen, and Bottas in fourth is 22.104s down. That\u2019s a nice pit-stop window for the leader. Lap 35/71 We hit halfway and if Hamilton goes in now he\u2019ll come out ahead of Leclerc. He does not. Lap 34/71 Might Mercedes bring Hamilton in soon to stick him on hards? If they leave alone, he\u2019s relying on others suffering to win. Lap 33/71 Hamilton lost half a second on the previous lap and his tyres are looking a little ragged. Lap 32/71 Verstappen is a proper threat next term, I\u2019d say. Mercedes can\u2019t rely on Hamilton\u2019s driving - they need to work on their speed down the straights. Lap 31/71 One good stop might do it for Verstappen here, because Vettel isn\u2019t really closing the distance. Hamilton will need some kind of mechanical or driver error to compete by the looks of things ... but we can\u2019t be underestimating his brilliance. Lap 30/71 Leclerc is told to follow \u201cPlan C\u201d and then pits, changing to hards - they\u2019ll be expected to carry him home, I shouldn\u2019t wonder. Verstappen leads by 2.317s, with Vettel 12.808s behind. Lap 29/71 \u201cI think we\u2019ve gone for the wrong tyre,\u201d Hmailton tells his team. We should be on the medium. And as if to prove his point, Vettel, on mediums, records the fastest lap of the race and takes out Leclerc, who\u2019s yet to pit. Lap 28/71 As we thought: on the radio, Hamilton tells his team he can\u2019t keep up with Verstappen, but he\u2019s actually going faster through the middle section of the lap. Lap 27/71 In goes Bottas and Verstappen now leads by 2.128s. That\u2019s a pretty nifty gap because it\u2019s hard to see how Hamilton finds the pace to get by him; Vettel, with hsi one-stop strategy, almost seems a likelier challenger now. Lap 26/71 Vettel goes in, and might just manage a one-stopper. Meanwhile, Bottas leads by 0.582 and Verstappen is behind ready to nail him with the DRS. Lap 25/71 1. Vettel 2. Bottas 3. Verstappen 4. Hamilton 5. Leclerc 6. Albon 7. Grosjean 8. Norris 9. Sainz Jr 10. Stroll Lap 24/71 We see the Kubica intervention again, and that was very naughty from Williams - we could see it happening, so you can be sure his team did BUT EXCUSE ME WHILE I INTERRUPT MYSELF BECAUSE HAMILTON HAS DRS AND HE NAILS VERSTAPPEN ON THE INSIDE BUT VERSTAPPEN CLOSES THE DOOR! Lap 23/71 Here we go! Hamilton zooms by Leclerc ...but Verstappen does too! AND NOW VERSTAPPEN NAILS HAMILTON TOO! Hamilton tires to fight back with the DRS but he can\u2019t, and might that be the race?! Lap 22/71 Verstappen goes in and that\u2019s a brilliant change! Out he goes, on used softs - the ones he saved from qualifying - BUT WILLIAMS RELEASE KUBICA INTO HIS PATH! HE\u2019S BEHIND HAMILTON! Lap 21/71 \u201cDon\u2019t miss this shot\u201d Hamilton tells his team and he goes into the pits! He puts on softs - used softs! - so he\u2019ll definitely be stopping twice! Meanwhile, Verstappen is having grief with Russell and Kubica as he laps them, and he and his team need to decide whether or not to come in. Surely they\u2019ll come in? Lap 20/71 Lets have a rundown: 1. Verstappen 2. Hamilton 3. Vettel 4. Bottas 5. Albon 6. Leclerc 7. Gasly 8. Raikkonen Lap 19/71 Verstappen is losing patience with his tyres and the back of his car is moving around. Hamilton isn\u2019t quite yet the favourite, but things are tilting his way. Lap 18/71 It\u2019s reckoned that Hamilton will be able to go four or five laps longer than Verstappen, but for the time being he\u2019s not making inroads into a lead that\u2019s back up at 2.402s. Lap 17/71 Vettel\u2019s Ferrari is starting to struggle on its tyres. He\u2019s 4.202s behind Verstappen. Lap 16/71 Elsewhere, Harold Winks has given England the lead in Kosovo. You can follow that one here. Lap 15/71 In commentary, they speculate that Verstappen\u2019s vibration is what has encouraged Hamilton, while Ricciardo is give a five-second penalty for that Magnussen affair. Lap 14/71 It looks like Hamilton wants to have a go at Verstappen, and has trimmed his lead to roughly two seconds. Lap 13/71 \u201cWho do you think is more likely to be be a future world champion - Verstappen or Leclerc?\u201d asks @TAFKABB. \u201cOr one of the other young guns? Austin?\u201d I reckon Verstappen will be the closest challenger next season - Leclerc still has a lot to learn, though the speed and skill are obviosly in place. Lap 12/71 Verstappen says he\u2019s picked up some vibration on the left front, but in general is happy with his tyres. I\u2019m kind of surprised he\u2019s not extending his lead but perhaps is trying to savr the car. Lap 11/71 Verstappen leads Hamilton by 2.358s, with Vettel roughly the same behind him. 9/71 As a result of that little tussle, Magnussen is down to 18th and Ricciardo is last. Leclerc, meanwhile, gains on Gasly... and that\u2019s him into sixth! His car is an absolute unit. Lap 8/71 Ricciardo has a chunk of front wing hanging off! Magnussen squeezed him into a turn, he spun uphill and off the track, and that\u2019ll be a pit situation. Lap 8/71 Ricciardo, in 14th, is worrying Magnussen ahead of him. I thought Ricciardo might be the next driver to make it happen, but at the moment we\u2019re looking at Leclerc and Verstappen. Lap 7/71 Leclerc gets behind Raikkonen, into his slip, bit of assistance, and that\u2019s an easy pass! He\u2019s seventh now, and is on a right old boust. Lap 6/71 In commentary, they just think that Verstappen and his car are quick, especially in the middle of the lap. In fifth, Albon is gaining on Bottas - there\u2019s a second or so between them. Lap 5/71 Leclerc nails Grosjean and is up to eighth now. Given a fair wind, he will be special. Lap 4/71 Verstappen leads by 2.483. Lap 3/71 Hamilton has told his team he thinks Verstappen is going for it, so is on a two-stop strategy. I doubt Hamilton will think he can go as quickly, so will try to it in a oner and hope the time saved is enough. Lap 3/71 Leclerc is now up to tenth after a battle with Norris; since taking him out, he\u2019s also taken Giovinazzi. Lap 2/71 Hamilton\u2019s move to get around Vettel on the outside was very nice indeed. Lap 1/71 Leclerc is up to 13th already, and then he gets by Norris. 1. Verstappen 2. Hamilton 3. Vettel 4. Bottas 5. Albon 6. Gasly 7. Grosjean 8. Raikkonen Lap 1/71 Verstappen pulls away as Hamilton has to defend from Vettel but we\u2019re set for a serious old ding-dong! Lap 1/71 Red red red red ... and out! Vettel gets away well but Verstappen shuts him off ... and Hamilton diddles Vettel! Right then, eyes down! Every driver in the top 10 is in soft compounds; the formation lap begins. We\u2019re nearly there... Five of the last six races here have been won by the driver who started in pole. Given Verstappen\u2019s speed too, it\u2019ll take something nifty or wild to stop him. \u201cLewis Hamilton induing rancour in Bernie Ecclestone,\u201d emails Charlie Rossiter. \u201c Add to reasons to be cheerful!\u201d Ha! It was a very odd deal - he was set up with a closed question, effectively: Hamilton winning is great for British motorsport - and for some reason couldn\u2019t bring himself to answer \u201cyes\u201d. Gasly, who\u2019s sixth on the grid, says conditions are very different from yesterday - it\u2019s 16, 17 degrees hotter, he\u2019s told, but in his opinion the difference is even more notable. Rubens Barichello says he used to live five minutes away from the track when he was a kid, and he misses not competing. He hopes that one day, his son will be involved. Bernard Ecclestone thinks it\u2019ll be a good race and can\u2019t see a reason why it won\u2019t be. He thinks Vettel will win and hopes they all get around the first corner safely. He\u2019s not sure it\u2019s good that Lewis Hamilton won his sixth title - I\u2019m sensing rancour. Max Verstappen is \u201cfeeling good\u201d. It\u2019s a new dawn, it\u2019s a new day, it\u2019s a new life for him. Anthem time. Low-key banger, this one. Alex Albon is further back than he\u2019d like but hopes to do something. Robert Kubica is \u201ckind of looking forward to it\u201d - he says he\u2019s had a tough second half of the year, and it\u2019s hot, and it\u2019s windy. Otherwise, it\u2019s all good. Someone from Mercedes says they\u2019re struggling with qualifying and straight-line speed, but hope to get it sorted over the break. Christian Horner compares the start here - ok, \u201chere\u201d - to that at Brands Hatch, with a slope, and says that Mercedes are quick but his team have a good chance of winning. Martin Brundle is about to go around talking to people wishing ill upon him. Morality question: someone has left a packet of milk chocolate Hobnobs \u201cin the usual place\u201d. How many is it acceptable for me to cleanse? a) 1-6 b) all of them, snooze you lose What do you get if you cross a car with packet of tabs? Genius. F1 would\u2019ve been a doddle for Andrew Windsor, given his imperviousness to sweating. Please excuse me. Sky are showing us some Senna porn. The crowd look, er, amped. Get into the mood. 1. Verstappen (Red Bull) 2. Vettel (Ferrari) 3. Hamilton (Mercedes) 4. Bottas (Mercedes) 5. Albon (Red Bull) 6. Gasly (Toro Rosso) 7. Grosjean (Haas) 8. Raikkonen (Alfa Romeo) 9. Magnussen (Haas) 10. Norris (McLaren) 11 Ricciardo (Renault) 12. Giovinazzi (Alfa Romeo) 13. Hulkenberg (Renault) 14. Leclerc (Ferrari) 15. Perez (Racing Point) 16. Kvyat (Toro Rosso) 17. Stroll (Racing Point) 18. Russell (Williams) 19 Kubica (Williams) 20. Sainz Jr (McLaren) We\u2019ve got two races of this season still to go, but next season is already underway. Can anyone show Lewis Hamilton that they\u2019ll close the gap, never mind best him over the stretch? Max Verstappen might just have the talent, and he\u2019s getting closer to having the car. His Red Bull has carried him to pole, and a decent winter in the factory will at least put him in with a chance when it all goes off again. But, in the meantime, he\u2019ll fancy himself today. He was about to win Interlagos last term until, hilariously, Esteban Ocon tried to unlap himself and ended up shunting the leader off the track. Ahahahahahahaha! Excuse me. Words and handbags were later exchange, and we can only hope for more of the same today. Flag: 5.10pm GMT, 3.10pm local time",

      "bodyText": "Aboriginal people were forced to collect wood for their own pyres in at least four cases of mass killing in Western Australia, a practice that was still happening as late as 1926, new research reveals. The Killing Times \u2013 a collaboration between Guardian Australia and the University of Newcastle\u2019s colonial frontier massacre research team \u2013 has found that some of the most violent episodes in our colonial past took place well into the 1920s, in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Government forces, including soldiers, police, magistrates and native police, were involved in more than half of all massacres recorded between the 1820s and the 1930s. The Killing Times map has been updated today with 57 new sites. With this broader national picture we can reveal: About 97% of people killed in these massacres were Aboriginal men, women and children Massacres became more violent, systematic and calculated over time The average number of Indigenous deaths increased over time, before declining in the 1900s, but massacres continued up to 1928 Colonist deaths in massacres stop almost entirely from the early 1900s onwards Reprisal for killing civilians was the most common justification, with 111 attacks sparked by the death of a colonist \u201cOpportunity\u201d attacks were the second most common, and the majority were planned with government involvement or sanction At least 65 massacres of Indigenous people were in retaliation for the killing or theft of livestock, or theft of property \u201cJust about all of the massacres in the first 30 years [of colonisation] are carried out by government forces,\u201d said Prof Lyndall Ryan, who heads the University of Newcastle research team. \u201cThere\u2019s always police involved in the story, right across Australia. \u201cAs the frontier starts to expand, it\u2019s less likely to be British soldiers, but soldiers who\u2019ve left the regiment and been appointed as magistrates, or mounted police. \u201cThey don\u2019t lose their military bearing, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d Events were recorded in graphic detail in newspapers, journals, court documents and even a 1926 royal commission but, with the exception of Myall Creek in New South Wales in 1838, no perpetrators were ever convicted. At Mount Bryan in South Australia in 1844, William Carter killed an Aboriginal family, including a pregnant woman and her unborn child. Carter reported it in horrific detail to magistrates. He was never charged with a crime; the magistrates said \u201cthe whites appear to have acted with great moderation.\u201d At York, WA, in 1837, a pastoralist kept ears as souvenirs after a killing for which nobody was tried or convicted. The Swan River Guardian newspaper described the actions \u2013 endorsed by the military, led by Lieutenant Bunbury \u2013 as medieval. Barbarities of the Middle Age have been committed even by boys and servants, who shot the unarmed woman, the unoffensive child, and the men who kindly showed them the road in the bush; the ears of the corpses have been cut off, and hung up in the kitchen of a gentleman, as a signal of triumph. The Swan River Guardian, 16 November 1837 More than 20 massacres took place in the 20th century \u2013 half of them in the years after the first world war. The accounts of these later killings \u2013 as told by perpetrators as well as survivors \u2013 are utterly horrifying. The late Hector Chunda Jandany\u2019s father and grandfather were killed by colonists in the Kimberley. The Gija artist and senior lawman often spoke and painted about what happened. Of the Jail House creek killings in 1900, Chunda said: \u201csome kartiya [white people] bin round em up the blackfellas, put em chains around their necks. They used to drive em like a mob of cattle. They took em to the right place, Jail Creek. Then they were carting woodback to the place where they were camping, then tie them up, like a dog. \u201cAll the kartiya get em their guns, line em up every girl and boy and shoot em down. Whang, all the children on the rocks. [Smash their skulls on the rocks.] Chuck em kerosene, put em on the firewood and chuck all em them dead bodies in the firewood place, put em kerosene and chuck em matches. \u201cKartiya bin finish em up, killed the lot.\u201d Aboriginal people were killed and their bodies burned at Panton River in the east Kimberley in the 1880s, and again at Kariyarri in the Pilbara in the 1890s. At Linnekar Gorge in 1896 a descendant of survivors, David Turner, said \u201ckartiya come there to shoot blackfellas for no reason. Gather all the blackfellas and tie em up with chains. Told blackfellas to get all the wood, stack em on the wood heapStarted shooting the blackfellas with the chains (still on). They had a bottle of kerosene and just pour em on and burn it up.\u201d The practice continued well into the 20th century. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In 1924, according to oral history passed down by survivors, a group of Gija and Worla men were convicted of killing a bullock at Bedford Downs station.

There are still many sites awaiting verification, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. \u201cWe\u2019ll never have the whole list but what we\u2019ve got is really confronting enough,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cThe cover-up has been so profound and this is just a very important part of it. The cover-up of massacres is an important part of white Australia.\u201d The Killing Times is based on data from the Colonial Frontier Massacre Digital Map Project led by Prof Lyndall Ryan at the University of Newcastle\u2019s Centre for the 21st Century Humanities.

Officials were dismissing pleas for the removal of high-pressure laminate panels similar to those used at the Cube in Bolton as recently as a fortnight ago, the Guardian has learned. In August, owners of flats in high-rise blocks wrapped in combustible cladding in other parts of Greater Manchester asked the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, for help to find the money to strip their buildings of all kinds of combustible cladding. It took almost three months for an official to respond that money would be made available to remove only the specific kind of aluminium composite cladding (ACM) used at Grenfell Tower, and not the high-pressure laminate (HPL) cladding used in Bolton and on thousands of other homes. The official said that \u201cgovernment intervention to provide funding for the removal of unsafe ACM cladding is wholly exceptional\u201d and \u201dwas based on the unparalleled fire risk ACM poses\u201d.

      "body": "<p>There was a moment towards the end of Emily Maitlis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtBS8COhhhM\" title=\"\">extraordinary interview</a> with Prince Andrew when she was unable to conceal her astonishment at what she was hearing. Did he, Ms Maitlis had asked, feel any sense of shame at his association with the convicted child sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein? \u201cDo I regret that he [Epstein] has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,\u201d was the prince\u2019s reply. \u201cUnbecoming?\u201d said Ms Maitlis incredulously. \u201cHe was a sex offender.\u201d</p> <p>It was an exchange that summed up a grotesque mismatch between the Duke of York\u2019s language and demeanour, and the gravity of the allegations which continue to surround him; between the obtuse self-absorption of a prince and what we know of the appalling sexual exploitation of teenage girls by his friend. Not once did Prince Andrew\u2019s thoughts turn to the sex trafficking victims who <a href=\"https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_a6b958df-fb3b-4f2b-acf6-aca11c6c2624&amp;lang=en-us&amp;inline=false\" title=\"\">found themselves forced to perform sexual acts</a> with Epstein and others. No sympathy was expressed on their behalf; no sense of outrage. This lack of empathy revealed a man focused only on his own exculpation. It gave a damning insight into a sense of entitlement that hardly helped his cause.</p> <p>The single mistake Prince Andrew admitted to was his decision to visit Epstein in New York in December 2010, following the financier\u2019s release from prison. This was, he claimed, to break off relations face to face, though he was unable to convincingly explain why he stayed for four days at Epstein\u2019s home, even attending a dinner party held in his honour. Again, the sense of entitlement came through. It was just, he said, \u201ca convenient place to stay\u201d. Even the mistake of visiting Epstein was down to an excess of virtue. The desire to speak directly to Epstein was attributable to his \u201ctendency to be too honourable\u201d.</p> <p>When questioned about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2019/nov/17/prince-andrew-denies-having-sex-with-teenager-instead-took-daughter-for-pizza-in-woking-video\" title=\"\">Virginia Giuffre</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2019/nov/17/prince-andrew-denies-having-sex-with-teenager-instead-took-daughter-for-pizza-in-woking-video\" title=\"\">, who alleges that she was forced to have sex</a> with Prince Andrew when she was 17, the prince flatly stated that he had no recollection of ever having met her. He did not remember an evening in the home of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s girlfriend, when he was photographed with his arm around Ms Giuffre\u2019s bare waist. On the supposed night in question, in March 2001, he did though remember that he was at home with his family, having been to the Pizza Express in Woking.</p> <p>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this disastrous interview was that an entitled lifestyle, and its consequences, formed part of Prince Andrew\u2019s case for his own defence. According to Ms Giuffre\u2019s legal team, \u201cyou could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on\u201d. But people often acted differently around royals, observed the prince. Perhaps Epstein had changed his behaviour patterns. And living in an institution like Buckingham Palace, one grew used to lots of people coming and going without really taking it in. This at least rang true. Prince Andrew came across as a man rendered incapable by privilege of normal processes of discernment, moral judgment and empathy.

      "bodyText": "There was a moment towards the end of Emily Maitlis\u2019s extraordinary interview with Prince Andrew when she was unable to conceal her astonishment at what she was hearing. Did he, Ms Maitlis had asked, feel any sense of shame at his association with the convicted child sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein? \u201cDo I regret that he [Epstein] has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,\u201d was the prince\u2019s reply. \u201cUnbecoming?\u201d said Ms Maitlis incredulously. \u201cHe was a sex offender.\u201d It was an exchange that summed up a grotesque mismatch between the Duke of York\u2019s language and demeanour, and the gravity of the allegations which continue to surround him; between the obtuse self-absorption of a prince and what we know of the appalling sexual exploitation of teenage girls by his friend. Not once did Prince Andrew\u2019s thoughts turn to the sex trafficking victims who found themselves forced to perform sexual acts with Epstein and others. No sympathy was expressed on their behalf; no sense of outrage. This lack of empathy revealed a man focused only on his own exculpation. It gave a damning insight into a sense of entitlement that hardly helped his cause. The single mistake Prince Andrew admitted to was his decision to visit Epstein in New York in December 2010, following the financier\u2019s release from prison. This was, he claimed, to break off relations face to face, though he was unable to convincingly explain why he stayed for four days at Epstein\u2019s home, even attending a dinner party held in his honour. Again, the sense of entitlement came through. It was just, he said, \u201ca convenient place to stay\u201d. Even the mistake of visiting Epstein was down to an excess of virtue. The desire to speak directly to Epstein was attributable to his \u201ctendency to be too honourable\u201d. When questioned about Virginia Giuffre, who alleges that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17, the prince flatly stated that he had no recollection of ever having met her. He did not remember an evening in the home of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s girlfriend, when he was photographed with his arm around Ms Giuffre\u2019s bare waist. On the supposed night in question, in March 2001, he did though remember that he was at home with his family, having been to the Pizza Express in Woking. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this disastrous interview was that an entitled lifestyle, and its consequences, formed part of Prince Andrew\u2019s case for his own defence. According to Ms Giuffre\u2019s legal team, \u201cyou could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on\u201d. But people often acted differently around royals, observed the prince. Perhaps Epstein had changed his behaviour patterns. And living in an institution like Buckingham Palace, one grew used to lots of people coming and going without really taking it in. This at least rang true. Prince Andrew came across as a man rendered incapable by privilege of normal processes of discernment, moral judgment and empathy. This interview did not in any way achieve the closure he intended it to deliver. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to correct a description of Epstein\u2019s offending.",

The first priority, surely, has to be to stop that, and if it means voting Labour, we must vote Labour. And then, as Len McCluskey once said about the EU, remain and reform. Ruth Brandon London \u2022 Only one party has significantly eroded inequality over the past century, not least by gifting us the welfare state: Labour. Now we have a Labour leadership proud of this past and ably equipped to advance on those earlier achievements. It\u2019s curious that those apparently concerned about discrimination and xenophobia have nothing to say about the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, which presided over the racist \u201cgo home\u201d campaign targeting migrants, dramatically increased poverty, and hiked university tuition fees threefold while cutting funding to state education. The disenchantment, anger and powerlessness provoked by those policies likely contributed to the result of the 2016 EU referendum. Unlike the privately educated historians who signed the anti-Labour letter you published last week \u2013 Antony Beevor, Tom Holland and Dan Snow \u2013 I am only able to be a historian thanks to free comprehensive and university education. On 12 December I\u2019ll vote for the only party committed to giving the next generation the opportunities that I and millions of others benefited from \u2013 Labour.

We also need to know now if there are any lawful means by which Mr Johnson could possibly suppress publication of the report if he gains a majority in parliament. If so, it is all the more vital that the report is released before the election, otherwise there will be a permanent question mark over the validity not only of 2016 and 2107 votes, but also over this election. And the nation will become perhaps even more bitterly divided than at present, with the legitimacy of the referendum \u2013 and of any mandate Mr Johnson might get \u2013 put in doubt.

      "bodyText": "Terry O\u2019Neill, who has died aged 81 after suffering from cancer, was a paparazzo at heart, truest to his cheeky self when snapping off reportage shots. Most of his career predated digital photography; he clicked away, printing up contact sheets from the negative rolls to discover whether his vigilance had been rewarded with a single perfect frame. That was how he caught Brigitte Bardot in 1971, a cigar between her teeth as the wind swept her hair, or football manager Brian Clough in 1965, forehead-down on the barrier of what was then called Hartlepools United\u2019s stand. O\u2019Neill searched his contacts for the realisation of a hoped-for visual idea, and also just to find out what was there. Which was a lot, whether subjects reacted to his blarney (the Queen gave one of the most genuine camera smiles of her reign after he told her a horse-racing joke), or took charge of the shoot, as did David Bowie, to whom O\u2019Neill was court photographer. He was Elton John\u2019s preferred picture-taker, likewise Led Zeppelin, the Who and Queen (the band). When O\u2019Neill spotted a young Bruce Springsteen in a carpark on Sunset Boulevard under a billboard to promote his make-it-or-bust Born to Run album in 1975, he seized the moment to take the last pre-fame image of the Boss. Born in Romford, then in Essex, O\u2019Neill was the son of Irish immigrants who settled in Heston, on the capital\u2019s western edges. He never intended to be a photographer and was pushed towards the Catholic priesthood, but left school at barely 15 to play drums in gigs. After national service he hoped to join the British Overseas Airways Corporation as a steward, in order to reach the US to play jazz, but BOAC only offered an apprenticeship as a technical photographer, and so he took it. In 1959, for an assignment on human emotion, he pointed his Agfa at an aged gent napping among African dignitaries in London Airport\u2019s sole terminal, who turned out to be the then home secretary, Rab Butler. A passing hack suggested which paper would buy the image and with that came \u00a325 and O\u2019Neill\u2019s entry to Fleet Street, with a Daily Sketch staff job from 1959. The tabloid was a lads\u2019 paradise of novelty stunts, including Laurence Olivier dragging up for the London Palladium. That O\u2019Neill sometimes did not know who the important people were saved him from nerves. He capitalised on his youth and music tastes to trail and photograph the just-hatched Beatles through television studios, or blinking in unfamiliar daylight. The Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham then asked him to cover his wards, so O\u2019Neill shot them in a cafe between TV sessions; Keith Richards acquired his first suitcase when O\u2019Neill suggested the Stones all be given them so that they would look like a touring band as he dragged them down Tin Pan Alley. O\u2019Neill sauntered easily on to film sets in Europe and then Hollywood. How did he win cooperation from the beautiful people, especially women stars chary of their appearance? \u201cCompliments. More compliments, that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, well \u2026 you could add a few more compliments.\u201d Male stars, a disgruntled Steve McQueen aside, adopted O\u2019Neill as an amiable pal, happy to stay invisible despite his handsome looks. Frank Sinatra, on the recommendation of his ex-wife Ava Gardner, let O\u2019Neill melt into his heavy crew for weeks; Michael Caine never minded when O\u2019Neill recorded him yet again snoring in a recliner. And he was a therapeutic listener. Peter Sellers would ring up regularly at 2am, and O\u2019Neill would then go round to the actor\u2019s home to give ear to his loneliness. To do that, O\u2019Neill had to slip away from his first wife, the actor Vera Day, to whom he was married for 13 years. The marriage ended after he moved to Los Angeles at the height of his success, despite him commuting for a while back to London by Concorde at the weekends. In 1977, he made a stunt of Faye Dunaway\u2019s portrait the morning after she had won best actress Oscar for Network: statue, newspapers, a Beverly Hills pool, and Dunaway, bemused. They began a relationship and were married for four years in the 1980s, during which time he fell into movie production at Dunaway\u2019s behest (including Mommie Dearest, 1981) and a depression so deep he eventually called his old friend the celebrity tailor Doug Hayward to tell him that he felt like taking his own life. Hayward ordered him on to a plane back to Britain. O\u2019Neill was candid about his many relationships, from centrefold models thrilled by his London accent who pursued him through the Playboy Mansion, via Jean Shrimpton, to the domestic monarch Martha Stewart in the late 80s; Eric Clapton pointed her out to O\u2019Neill in a restaurant, and O\u2019Neill immediately chased her, napkin over arm, pretending to be a waiter. Stewart housed him, fed him, bought him a kitten, and he fled after six months, still burned from his last marriage, which had ended in 1987. By then he had been out of photography for too long to return at the same level; he considered becoming a picture editor before saying to a colour supplement editor, as he so often had done in the past, \u201cListen, I got an idea.\u201d The idea was a series of portraits of new 90s faces, which restarted his career, but many layers of management and PR were now interposed between celebrity and lens, and O\u2019Neill was soon bored by long days waiting for a half-hour slot with his subject, buffered by legions of intermediaries. When granted the old freedom \u2013 invited to preparations for the Nelson Mandela birthday concert in 2008, for instance, or snatching a few frames of Amy Winehouse in the same year \u2013 the pix had their old vivacity. Most photographers threw away contact sheets like Kleenex, but O\u2019Neill kept many, most of them better than usable (including Raquel Welch, in a fur bikini, tied to a cross, which was shot 30 years before it was eventually published, and Muhammad Ali with his mum). They became the basis first for a modest licensing business, then for multiple exhibitions and books that sustained him in retirement. O\u2019Neill was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in 2004, and received the society\u2019s centenary medal in 2011. He was appointed CBE last month. His final marriage was to the model agency chief Laraine Ashton. The couple divided their London house between them, so both could retreat rather than leave. She survives him, as do his two children from his marriage to Day, and a son, Liam, from his marriage to Dunaway. \u2022 Terence Patrick O\u2019Neill, photographer, born 30 July 1938; died 17 November 2019",

      "bodyText": "Support for Pete Buttigieg, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and millennial mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has surged among Democrat primary voters in Iowa, according to a new poll that puts him around 10 points ahead of his nearest rivals. The poll, released by CNN, the Des Moines Register and Mediacom on Saturday, placed Buttigieg\u2019s support at 25% of likely caucus-goers in the key early voting state, with fellow candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden in a three-way tie for second place at 15%. The new poll, conducted with 500 likely Democratic caucus-goers and having a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points, shows a consistent improvement in support for Buttigieg, 37, who was a relative unknown when he announced his candidacy earlier this year. Given its role as the first state to vote in the presidential primaries, Iowa is key to most Democratic candidates\u2019 strategies, and is set to vote on 3 February. Since 2000, every Democrat who has won the Iowa caucuses has gone on to win the presidential nomination of their party. A Monmouth University poll last week that also showed Buttigieg leading in the state, through by a lesser margin of three points. In that poll, Buttigieg stood at 22%, Biden at 19%, Warren 18% and Sanders at 13%. None of the other candidates reached double digits. Prior polls have shown support for Buttigieg, Biden, Warren and Sanders essentially even. Buttigieg described the latest numbers as \u201cextremely encouraging, obviously. At the same time, there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d Speaking after the poll came out at a democratic convention in Long Beach, California, the t37-year-old military veteran said his campaign had felt \u201ca lot of momentum on the ground\u201d. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer &amp; Co, which conducted the latest poll, said the latest figure pointed to a \u201cnew status\u201d for Buttigieg who, at 72%, showed the highest favorability of all the candidates. \u201cThere have been four candidates that have sort of jostled around in a pack together, but he has a sizable lead over the nearest contender \u2013 nine points,\u201d Selzer told the Des Moines Register. Since June, Biden, Warren and Buttigieg have all taken turns atop the poll. Though never top among Iowa Democrats, Sanders has been consistently in the top four. In the latest poll, 63% of Iowans said Buttigieg\u2019s views are about right. Only 7% said his views are too liberal, while 13% felt they are too conservative. The new poll came a day after former president Barack Obama warned the crowded field of Democratic White House hopefuls not to veer too far to the left because it would alienate voters. Though Obama did not mention anyone by name, the message he delivered before a room of Democratic donors in Washington on Friday was a clear word of caution about the candidacies of Warren and Sanders, who are seen as two of the top-tier candidates in the crowded field. Buttigieg and Biden are considered more moderate candidates. In the \u201cabout right\u201d category, Buttigieg was trailed by Biden at 55%, Warren at 48% and Sanders at 37%. But a majority (53%) found Sanders views \u201ctoo liberal\u201d. But Buttigieg\u2019s surge of support in predominantly white, early-voting states like Iowa maybe be hard to translate in more diverse states where he is still relatively unknown. Political commentators said Buttigieg\u2019s numbers underscored how fluid the race for the Democratic nomination remains. \u201cThis is still a very fluid race,\u201d former congresswoman Mia Love, the only black Republican woman in Congress, told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s State of the Nation. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look far to see each of these candidates being at the top of the polls and a month later they\u2019re down because that makes them the one to attack. \u201cHe\u2019s more than just a Goldilocks,\u201d she continued. \u201cPeople are seeing something they like in how he presents himself and how he\u2019s trying to reach across to a broad part of the electorate. One of his opportunities is that people are still getting to know him.\u201d Joan E Greve and the Associated Press contributed to this report",

Clare Chapman has served since March 2015 as one of nine commissioners on the government\u2019s Low Pay Commission tasked with setting the national living wage, the legal minimum hourly rate. She was appointed as a G4S director in September. G4S has faced repeated controversies over its treatment of workers and users of government services. In September, it said it will end its involvement in the immigration and asylum sector following a scandal at a detention centre near Gatwick. As one of the world\u2019s largest public-sector employers, with 546,000 staff across 90 countries, G4S could also benefit from lower minimum wage requirements. Norway\u2019s government pension fund announced last Thursday it had banned shares in G4S from its $1.1tn (\u00a3850bn) investment portfolio, after its ethics watchdog found an \u201cunacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations\u201d. In response to the Guardian\u2019s inquiries about Chapman\u2019s appointment, Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said the latest question mark over G4S\u2019s treatment of migrant workers \u201cthreatens the integrity of the Low Pay Commission\u201d. He said: \u201cSuccessive Tory governments have made a mockery of the public appointments system, filling key roles with cronies and allowing conflicts of interest that damage trust in government.\u201d He added that the Labour party would \u201coverhaul the public appointments system so it serves the many\u201d. The alleged mistreatment of migrant workers employed by G4S outlined in the report by Norway\u2019s Council of Ethics took place before Chapman\u2019s appointment. The company said it was endeavouring to improve working conditions. In an emailed statement, Chapman said: \u201cAs the company has stated, G4S is committed to ensuring that migrant workers are treated with dignity and respect at all times. \u201cThe company has carried out an investigation into the matters raised by the [Norwegian] Council on Ethics and has been implementing an action plan to ensure [workers\u2019] welfare and protection across its businesses in the Middle East. \u201cThe [corporate and social responsibility] committee of G4S is overseeing the implementation of the plan and continues to review progress on an ongoing basis.\u201d The Tory party said: \u201cAll board members of public bodies act in accordance with the Cabinet Office\u2019s codes of conduct. This includes guidance on managing outside interests. \u201cThe Conservative government is ending low pay by increasing the national living wage to \u00a310.50 by 2024, and cutting the age threshold to 21 [from 25].\u201d The Council of Ethics\u2019 report on G4S found that workers mainly from India, Pakistan and Nepal \u2013 working in Qatar and the UAE \u2013 were subjected to misinformation about working conditions, restrictions on freedom of movement and \u201cdebt bondage\u201d from high recruitment fees. The council noted that some of G4S\u2019s practices were indicators of forced labour, a type of modern slavery, under the conventions of the UN International Labour Organisation. Only 12 other companies are on the pension fund\u2019s blacklist on human rights concerns, and none of them are listed on either US or western European stock markets. The other 12 include a number of Asian shipping lines, a Taiwanese shipbreaker, and a Polish property developer. As well as G4S, Chapman is a non-executive director at Heidrick &amp; Struggles, an American recruitment company, and Weir Group, a British mining and oil engineering company that has been praised for reforms that lowered maximum executive pay packets. Chapman has previously served in senior human resources roles at BT and Tesco, while as director general of workforce for the National Health Service she had responsibility for 2.2 million workers. Luke Hildyard, executive director of the High Pay Centre, which monitors pay inequality, said: \u201cBeing ultra-charitable, one could argue that having a low pay commissioner, who hears about the experiences and perspectives of low-paid workers in that role, on the G4S board might help the company towards reforming its barbaric employment practices. \u201cAt the same time, having a representative of a company whose business model is so focused on low-paid labour on the body that advises the government on minimum wage levels is potentially a huge conflict of interest. \u201cIt will certainly damage perceptions of the advice given by the commission.

Told from the perspective of Safran, who is Jewish, the satirical comedy-documentary series was about the limits of interfaith and crosscultural love. In it, Safran encourages a Palestinian film crew member to covertly provide a sample to an Israeli sperm bank in an attempt to bridge the Middle Eastern divide by making a half-Palestinian, half-Jew (a Jewestinian); disguises himself as a black man (in part by painting his skin) and uses the N-word in Chicago, in order to experience life in someone else\u2019s shoes (<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gmy9a/john-safran-braces-himself-for-the-fallout\">as he later told Vice</a>); and is transformed into a ladyboy while wondering if his desire for Eurasian women is creepy or not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2017/may/16/john-safran-in-australia-we-dont-get-religion\">John Safran: 'In Australia we don't get religion'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back then, a reviewer from <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/crucifixion-just-the-first-offence-for-safran-20090922-ge83vw.html\">the Age condemned it</a>, and the Herald Sun wondered if he\u2019d gone too far. The Australian Family Association spokesman John Morrissey described the show as \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201cthe lowest point in the history of Australian television\u201d.</p> <p>But many saw value in it too. Alice Pung\u2019s sympathetic Monthly essay on Safran\u2019s Race Relations<em>,</em> cannily titled <a href=\"https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2010/january/1267671938/alice-pung/border-crossings\">Border Crossings</a>, reflected: \u201cIn Safran\u2019s world, there is no sanctioned way to behave in a social setting \u2026 There are no set rules or rituals \u2026 no moral compass points, because \u2018everything is just so confusing\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Of the critiques, which were circulating again last week, Safran says, \u201cI don\u2019t assume everyone\u2019s coming from a good place \u2026 It\u2019s a case-by-case thing, whether I take on board a criticism.</p> <p>\u201cOften, if there\u2019s a curveball thrown at you, or a criticism, it can be helpful in that it\u2019s the next thing you can address. There\u2019s been so much in my work that has been me responding to an obstacle. I don\u2019t just think, \u2018This is bad\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the last word should go to the anonymous woman who speaks at the beginning of each Audible episode. \u201cThis program contains disturbing content,\u201d she says. \u201cListener discretion is advised.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 John Safran vs The Occult is available on Audible on 19 November, and is free for a limited time.</em></p>",

Clearly, if I\u2019m talking to someone who\u2019s a huge racist and violent, the starting point is, \u2018I think that\u2019s awful.\u2019 If people are going to have that much bad faith [in their misinterpretation], I reckon in response I\u2019m allowed to have bad faith in them, and say, how much do you actually think that and how much are you just trying to have an angle for your own think-piece?\u201d He shakes it off. \u201cAnyway.\u201d The criticisms of his methods that had me frantically drinking water largely pertain to Race Relations, produced by Princess Pictures (on whose watch both Safran and Chris Lilley have donned blackface). Told from the perspective of Safran, who is Jewish, the satirical comedy-documentary series was about the limits of interfaith and crosscultural love. In it, Safran encourages a Palestinian film crew member to covertly provide a sample to an Israeli sperm bank in an attempt to bridge the Middle Eastern divide by making a half-Palestinian, half-Jew (a Jewestinian); disguises himself as a black man (in part by painting his skin) and uses the N-word in Chicago, in order to experience life in someone else\u2019s shoes (as he later told Vice); and is transformed into a ladyboy while wondering if his desire for Eurasian women is creepy or not. Back then, a reviewer from the Age condemned it, and the Herald Sun wondered if he\u2019d gone too far. The Australian Family Association spokesman John Morrissey described the show as \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201cthe lowest point in the history of Australian television\u201d. But many saw value in it too. Alice Pung\u2019s sympathetic Monthly essay on Safran\u2019s Race Relations, cannily titled Border Crossings, reflected: \u201cIn Safran\u2019s world, there is no sanctioned way to behave in a social setting \u2026 There are no set rules or rituals \u2026 no moral compass points, because \u2018everything is just so confusing\u2019.\u201d Of the critiques, which were circulating again last week, Safran says, \u201cI don\u2019t assume everyone\u2019s coming from a good place \u2026 It\u2019s a case-by-case thing, whether I take on board a criticism. \u201cOften, if there\u2019s a curveball thrown at you, or a criticism, it can be helpful in that it\u2019s the next thing you can address. There\u2019s been so much in my work that has been me responding to an obstacle. I don\u2019t just think, \u2018This is bad\u2019.\u201d Perhaps the last word should go to the anonymous woman who speaks at the beginning of each Audible episode. \u201cThis program contains disturbing content,\u201d she says. \u201cListener discretion is advised.\u201d \u2022 John Safran vs The Occult is available on Audible on 19 November, and is free for a limited time.",

      "bodyText": "Not one of the top eight projects recommended for funding under the government\u2019s regional grants program was successful across a swathe of Coalition-held seats in Queensland. The revelation comes as the government resists a Senate order to release documents relating to its administration of the scandal-ridden regional jobs and investment packages (RJIP), suggesting it may claim public interest immunity. According to departmental information supplied to the auditor general, none of the eight project applications that were assessed in the Wide Bay-Burnett region by the department as being the most worthy were awarded funding by the ministerial panel overseeing the scheme. The Wide Bay-Burnett region, which covers the four Coalition-held seats of Wide Bay, Fairfax, Hinkler and Flynn, was also the area where two known political donors received grant funding, meaning the projects were preferred over at least eight higher-ranked projects without explanation. While the top-ranked projects scored between 81 and 87 out of a possible 100 according to the merit-based scoring system used by the department, they were all overlooked for less worthy projects. The lowest ranked application that was approved for funding had a score of just 58 out of 100, placing it among the worst on the department\u2019s ranking list at 56 out of 61 projects assessed for the region. As reported in Guardian Australia, Teys Australia Murgon Pty Ltd, an LNP donor, received $267,406 towards a $567,406 expansion of its beef cattle hide processing facility in Murgon \u201cto enable increased production throughput, resilience in the marketplace, and employment opportunities\u201d. According to the Queensland Electoral Commission, Teys Australia has given $25,930 to the Liberal National party since 2018. Another donor, Nolan Meats Pty Ltd, received a $5m grant towards a $10m meat processing expansion to double production capacity from 550 to 1,100 cattle per day. Nolan Meats disclosed a $3,000 donation to the LNP in November 2017. Guardian Australia is not suggesting that the political donations represent a quid pro quo for taxpayer-funded grants. It is also not known how these two projects were scored by the department, or whether they were among those that were recommended. Labor has indicated it will continue to pursue the Coalition over the grants scheme, which was the subject of a scathing federal audit, and which may yet be examined by parliament\u2019s audit committee. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ministerial panel which made the funding decisions at odds with the department\u2019s recommendations predominantly claimed that the reason for rejecting their advice was because the scoring system had \u201coverstated\u201d two criteria in the merit assessment process, according to the auditor general. In most cases this related to the criteria outlining \u201cthe level of net economic benefit\u201d of the project for the business and the region, including job creation, and the \u201cvalue for money\u201d test. But the auditor general found that in cases where ministers wanted to award funding to applications that had not been recommended, they claimed it was these same criteria that had been \u201csignificantly understated\u201d. Crucially, the auditor general said that the ministerial panel meetings that overturned the recommendations were not attended by departmental officials and were not minuted, and the projects were never independently re-scored before being awarded funding. The ministerial panel that decided the grants in Wide Bay-Burnett was chaired by the then infrastructure minister, Darren Chester, and comprised the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, and the Liberal senators James McGrath and Michaelia Cash. The department and McCormack\u2019s office are refusing to release details of which projects were funded against the advice of the department, nor which projects missed out even though the department wanted them to be funded. A spokeswoman for McCormack told Guardian Australia that the \u201csignificant majority\u201d of RJIP projects approved were in line with advice provided by the department. \u201cHowever it is the responsibility and role of the panel to make considered decisions, not to just \u2018tick and flick\u2019 departmental recommendations,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government does not disclose information relating to individual project scores, recommendations, or applicant information as many applications contain information that is commercial in confidence.\u201d According to the auditor general\u2019s report, the ministerial panel declined to fund 28% of grants recommended by officials, and approved 17% of projects that had not been recommended to them. In total, there were 132 applications where the panel\u2019s ultimate funding decision differed from the departmental recommendation. Last week, Guardian Australia revealed the Coalition awarded a $205,000 grant to a dog breeder to build an aquaculture project on the south coast, with the venture to be funded by raising $5m in \u201caqua token\u201d cryptocurrency that offered a return to investors based on the price of fish. The project has stalled. Another project in the same electorate received $750,000 while possibly trading insolvent, and in another instance, a grant in north Queensland was provided to a bus and ferry project that is losing money and is unlikely to happen for two more years. The auditor general has also revealed that two projects that were granted co-funding exemption were given the reprieve in breach of the program\u2019s guidelines. Labor\u2019s shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, called on the government to release documents relating to the scheme. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the audit and subsequent media coverage that Coalition ministers did not administer this program transparently and in accordance with their own guidelines,\u201d she said. \u201cMichael McCormack must release the documents as ordered by the Senate and provide a full explanation of the ministerial panels\u2019 approach.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Returning Liberal senator Jim Molan\u2019s re-election campaign was bankrolled with $43,000 from opaque third-party crowdfunding websites, prompting concerns about their use as political fundraising vehicles. Molan ran what many viewed as a rogue campaign in the lead-up to the 2019 election, after his party reduced him to an unwinnable spot on its ticket. Molan\u2019s campaign took the unusual step of raising campaign funds via online crowdfunding sites, outside of more standard Liberal fundraising processes. Molan himself opened a fundraising page on MyCause, through which he received $10,417 from 81 donations, most of which were small donations of less than $100. A separate fundraising page was opened on GoFundMe by John Crawford, an ally of Molan\u2019s, who said the funds would be used for the \u201cpurchasing of signs, T-shirts, how-to-vote cards and advertising\u201d to support Molan\u2019s re-election. The GoFundMe page lists $32,665 donations from 104 donors, including one $10,000 donation from an anonymous source. Molan said he had no control over that page and did not receive the funds from it directly. He has not declared the GoFundMe donations to the electoral commission in his individual candidate disclosure. The use of crowdfunding sites as fundraising vehicles has prompted concern among integrity experts because of the relatively lax way they treat the identity of donors. On MyCause, for example, it is possible to use a false name and an anonymised email address to make a donation, with no need to enter a physical street address or other identifying information. The recipient of the donation will only see the name, anonymised email, and the amount donated. By contrast, donating to the Liberal party online requires a name, phone number and physical address, which can be cross-checked against the electoral roll to verify a donor\u2019s identity. Grattan Institute researcher Kate Griffiths said crowdfunding websites made it difficult to ascertain the true identity of donors. \u201cCandidates and parties can\u2019t be sure of the source of their donations when using these types of fundraising methods,\u201d Griffiths told the Guardian. New laws were introduced prior to the May 2019 election to ban donations from foreign donors. Both crowdfunding websites associated with Molan\u2019s campaign advise potential donors they must comply with the foreign donation laws. But it is unclear how precisely the organisers of the crowdfunding websites could have ensured they were not receiving money from those outside Australia. Griffiths says the current rules are flawed because they effectively put the onus on the donor to declare whether or not they are \u201cforeign\u201d. \u201cIt is very difficult to identify and prevent foreign donations, so a better system would provide greater transparency of major donors (whoever they are) and limit political spending during election campaigns to reduce the influence of any donation,\u201d she said. Molan said he was only accountable for the MyCause website, which had only received small donations from a large number of donors. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThat website raised $10,417 from 81 donations; 19 of 81 were anonymous, for a total of $1,930 of $10,417,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone can open that website and look at the figures; and all except three were $100 or below, and the three larger ones were single donations of a $500 and two of $200.\u201d Molan has already lodged his donation disclosure return for the campaign with the Australian Electoral Commission. His disclosure only records him receiving $11,243, and does not include the money raised via GoFundMe. Molan said he did not have to declare the money donated to the GoFundMe page because it was run by John Crawford, and he did not receive any of the money directly. The Liberal party also suggested disclosure of the money was not its responsibility. \u201cThird-party campaigners\u2019 electoral disclosure obligations are a matter for them,\u201d a spokesman said. Australia\u2019s weak donation laws will hide the identities of the GoFundMe and MyCause donors from the public regardless. Candidates and parties were only compelled to disclose donations of above $13,800 to the public at the time of the election, and all the contributions on the crowdfunding sites remained below that threshold. \u201cAustralia\u2019s donations rules are full of holes: the donations disclosure threshold is too high and it is all too easy to split donations or hide donations from banned donors,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cParliament should improve the visibility of political donations by lowering the donations disclosure threshold to $5,000, requiring political parties to aggregate multiple donations from the same donor, and requiring more timely release of donations information.\u201d Griffiths said the best way to limit the influence of money in politics is by limiting campaign expenditure, therefore reducing the value of donations and influence of the donor. Molan\u2019s bid for re-election at the May election was unsuccessful. But he has since been pre-selected to replace the outgoing Arthur Sinodinos, who has been appointed the next Australian ambassador to the United States.",

A rare case of an episode of SNL picking up steam as it went along, the end result was much better than the awful cold open seemed to promise. Styles acquitted himself nicely, supplementing his knack for broad comedy with his song and dance skills. One imagines that he\u2019ll grow even stronger as a comic performer during future appearances.",

Around 380,000 patients with toothache are choosing to head to their GPs who cannot provide dental treatment, costing the NHS over \u00a320 million a year. Around 135,000 patients per year are also estimated to attend A&amp;E units with dental problems, at a cost of \u00a318 million.</p> \n   <p>Today\u2019s measures are also aimed at improving children\u2019s oral health. More than 100 children a day have rotting teeth removed in hospital, when nine in ten cases could have been prevented.

Scotland Yard announced yesterday that it was assessing two allegations of electoral fraud in relation to the claims. Farage accused Boris Johnson\u2019s party of corruption. Is he calling Ann Widdecombe a liar? Perhaps he is, I don\u2019t know. Ann Widdecombe made it perfectly clear she received two phone calls, from a senior official in number 10, offering her a job on the negotiating team if she stood down as an election candidate. Fact. Jeremy Corbyn has told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show his government would allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people, in a sign Labour would look to keep a liberal immigration regime with Europe if Brexit goes ahead. The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto said free movement would end at the point of Brexit, but a motion passed by Labour conference argued for the UK to \u201cmaintain and expand\u201d free movement.

We\u2019ve sent rebuttals with all the links and all the evidence is there,\u201d she told the Guardian. You can read the full story here. Guardian environment correspondents Sandra Laville and Matthew Taylor report that the Conservative party\u2019s record on tackling the climate crisis has been condemned by leading scientists and former government advisers. Experts have accused the Conservatives of copying right-wing politicians in the US by deliberately weakening environmental protections. Meanwhile, new analysis by Labour reveals environmental policies put forward since 2017 and opposed by the Tories would have led to emissions reductions of over 70m tonnes a year by 2030 \u2013 more than the annual emissions of Portugal. Conservative politicians have criticised Angela Eagle \u2013 former Labour leadership hopeful \u2013 for retweeting this image of the foreign secretary. She has dismissed it as a joke: Labour\u2019s candidate in Ashfield in Nottinghamshire \u2013 Gloria de Piero\u2019s old seat \u2013 has tweeted pictures of her office with its windows smashed. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: The force was called to Outram Street in Sutton on November 17, 2019 at around 10.30am following reports of criminal damage. The incident is believed to have happened between 5.30pm on Saturday to 10am on Sunday. A number of windows have been smashed. If you saw the incident or have any information please call 101 quoting incident number 266 of 17 November 2019. The Guardian\u2019s northern correspondent Nazia Parveen reports that housing and fire chiefs have criticised the government over a \u201ccladding lottery\u201d and called for an overhaul in UK fire safety regulations after a fire at student flats in Bolton. An investigation has been launched after more than 200 students were evacuated when a fire ripped through the upper part of the town-centre six-storey building, which is cladded in high-pressure laminate (HPL) material. The mayor of Salford city council, Paul Dennett, who leads the Greater Manchester\u2019s high rise taskforce set up after the Grenfell tragedy, said it was an industrial crisis and called on the government to invest more funds in what he described as a \u201ccladding lottery\u201d. You can read the full story here: Labour has claimed that its living wage commitments would give workers who earn the national minimum wage at least \u00a39,000 more by 2024 than the Tories. The party has said: Coupled with Labour\u2019s pledge to not raise income tax or national insurance contributions for the bottom 95% of earners, this means a worker on the minimum wage will be at least \u00a36,000 better off after tax. Analysis of latest ONS figures on earnings also shows that Labour\u2019s pledge to immediately introduce a \u00a310 an hour Real Living Wage for all workers over 16 will give approximately 7.5 million people a pay rise, including over 1.2 million young people. The current minimum wage is \u00a38.21 for people 25 and over and \u00a34.35 for 16-17 year olds. The Conservatives have responded with a statement from chief secretary to the treasury, Rishi Sunak: Since 2010, under the Conservatives, the lowest paid workers have \u00a34,500 more in their pockets thanks to increases in the living wage and tax cuts. Whilst we\u2019ve been working to make sure you keep more of the money you earn, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour would take the equivalent of a month\u2019s extra wages from you after hitting you with higher taxes to pay for their spending splurge. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent, Peter Walker, commenting on Conservative immigration plans. See Raab\u2019s comments from earlier. The SNP has issued a statement in response to the BBC and Sunday Times investigation that accuses the UK government and the British army of covering up the killing of children in Afghanistan and Iraq. Journalists have obtained documents that allegedly contain evidence implicating troops in killing children and the torture of civilians. The reports claim to have obtained new evidence from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British soldiers in Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The government closed IHAT and Operation Northmoor in 2017, after Phil Shiner, a solicitor who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off from practising law amid allegations he had paid people in Iraq to find clients. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC earlier: All of the allegations that had evidence have been looked at by the armed forces prosecuting authorities, because we want to have accountability where there\u2019s wrongdoing ... What we\u2019re quite rightly doing is making sure spurious claims or claims without evidence don\u2019t lead to the shadow of suspicion, the cloud of suspicion hanging over people who\u2019ve served their country for years on end. And we\u2019ve got the right balance. Jeremy Corbyn has told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show his government would allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people, in a sign Labour would look to keep a liberal immigration regime with Europe if Brexit goes ahead. The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto said free movement would end at the point of Brexit, but a motion passed by Labour conference argued for the UK to \u201cmaintain and expand\u201d free movement. The Labour leader said: A lot of EU nationals have made their homes in this country and made a massive contribution to our society. A lot of British people lie in different parts of the EU and many of those families have been through unbelievable stress. So they absolutely must have the right to remain and bring their families here. You can read our full report here. Labour has pledged this morning to scrap charges for dental checkups, giving everyone in England the right to a \u201cfree teeth MOT\u201d. The proposals, estimated to cost \u00a3450m a year, would eliminate band-one dentistry charges, which were introduced by the NHS in 1951. The foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said it is not \u201cremotely likely\u201d that the UK will leave the EU without a deal. Also speaking to Marr, Raab initially declined to get into \u201chypothetical negotiating objectives\u201d when asked if a no-deal would take place if the UK failed to secure its fishing objectives in trade talks. But he later replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s remotely likely\u201d. Critics have warned a no-deal Brexit could still occur at the end of 2020 given the lack of time to negotiate the future relationship between the UK and EU. The US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri has told ITV\u2019s Exposure that Boris Johnson brutally cast her aside \u201clike some one-night stand\u201d, leaving her \u201cheartbroken\u201d since he became prime minister and the controversy over their four-year relationship became public. The full interview will be aired on ITV\u2019s Exposure this evening. Here\u2019s our story. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics this morning, Brexit party leader Nigel Farage insisted that claims the party\u2019s candidates were offered jobs by the Conservatives to persuade them to stand aside were \u201cfact\u201d. Scotland Yard announced yesterday that it was assessing two allegations of electoral fraud in relation to the claims. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics this morning, Brexit party leader Nigel Farage insisted that claims the party\u2019s candidates were offered jobs by the Conservatives to persuade them to stand aside were \u201cfact\u201d. It has been claimed that Brexit figures \u2013 including Ann Widdecombe \u2013 were offered post-election roles or peerages as part of an attempt to get them to stand down at the general election, something the Conservatives have denied. Scotland Yard announced yesterday that it was assessing two allegations of electoral fraud in relation to the claims. Farage said: Is he calling Ann Widdecombe a liar? Perhaps he is, I don\u2019t know. Ann Widdecombe made it perfectly clear she received two phone calls, from a senior official in number 10, offering her a job on the negotiating team if she stood down as an election candidate. Fact. You can agree with Ann\u2019s views in life or disagree, but the fact that she\u2019s a very honest woman, I think nobody would ever disagree with. Fact. Fact number two, [Boris Johnson\u2019s chief strategic adviser] Sir Eddie Lister, rang up our candidate for Peterborough, offering him a job in higher education if he stood down as a candidate. They\u2019re the things that are already out in the open. What I have said, John, is there was actually a package put together, in which eight senior figures of the Brexit party would go to the house of Lords and be offered a place in the negotiating team. It\u2019s corruption. It\u2019s corruption. The Brexit party leader said the situation showed how absolutely \u201crotten and broken\u201d politics has become. Labour\u2019s Kensington parliamentary candidate Emma Dent Coad is to report her Lib Dem rival \u2013 and former Tory MP \u2013 Sam Gyimah to the police over claims he made that she \u201cwas part of all the discussions that went on\u201d regarding the cladding that was on Grenfell Tower. Dent Coad won the marginal constituency from the Conservatives by 20 votes in 2017. Under the representation of the people act it is illegal for any person to \u201cpublish any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate\u2019s personal character or conduct, unless he or she can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing that statement to be true\u201d. The Liberal Democrats have sent a legal letter to the BBC about leader Jo Swinson being left out of the broadcaster\u2019s election TV debate. In the letter sent to the corporation\u2019s director-general Tony Hall, the party\u2019s lawyers said that the exclusion of Swinson was \u201cclearly unlawful\u201d. The party has already launched a High Court challenge against ITV over its decision not to include Swinson in the debate it has arranged. The \u2018BBC Prime Ministerial Debate\u2019 on Friday 6 December will see a head-to-head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn live from Southampton. ITV is to hold \u2018Johnson v Corbyn: The ITV Debate\u2019 this coming Tuesday. The Lib Dem letter reads: The BBC\u2019s approach is fundamentally disrespectful to the many millions of people who strongly support remaining in the EU. It ignores their concerns, their right to be heard and to be represented. People need to hear the arguments about Remain and Leave in a balanced way, but the leaders of the Labour Party and Conservative Party both want Britain to leave the EU. That means the BBC\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate has no place for those who take the opposite view. As you should be aware, the BBC is under a strict legal obligation to achieve \u2018due impartiality\u2019 in its election broadcasting. The exclusion of any voice of Remain in the leaders\u2019 debate will clearly put the BBC in breach of that obligation. The SNP have similar complaints and they are taking legal action against ITV over its exclusion from a general election debate. Speaking to Andrew Marr this morning, the party\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: We\u2019ll be in court tomorrow, because it\u2019s grossly unfair. [...] We are the third party at Westminster. We\u2019ve been in the government in Scotland for the last 12 years, we\u2019re leading the polls in Scotland at 42% in the YouGov poll last week. And we\u2019ve got to recognise that the public take their views from these debates. Deborah Mattinson, a founding partner of research and strategy consultancy BritainThinks, has written in the Observer that very little seems to be getting through to voters in the election campaign so far. \u201cWhat have you picked up about the election so far?\u201d I asked a focus group of undecided voters last week. Although they had plenty to say about policies, parties and politicians, their confident chatter died away fast. Eye contact was avoided. No one could think of anything that related to the campaign. A recent poll found a similar lack of engagement. Four thousand voters were asked what \u201cincidents, events, stories etc\u201d they had noticed. The winning score, at 42%, was for \u201cnone\u201d. In second place came the 5% mentioning Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s Grenfell remarks. Just 2% mentioned \u201cBrexit\u201d and 1% NHS funding. The shadow home secretary has responded to comments by Michael Gove in the Mail on Sunday. He wrote: Under EU rules, European nationals arriving here have preferential access to free NHS care whereas other migrants have to wait until they\u2019ve paid into the system and secured settled status, a process which typically takes five years. It\u2019s unfair that people coming from European countries can access free NHS care without paying in while others make significant contributions. Abbott points out that EU workers pay taxes like everybody else, so it is wrong to say they aren\u2019t \u201cpaying in\u201d. Here are some highlights from this morning\u2019s political broadcast interviews. Jeremy Corby told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show that he would want his government to allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people if he became the next prime minister. Asked whether Labour would pledge to end free movement in its election manifesto \u2013 as it did in its 2017 manifesto \u2013 the Labour leader said we would have to wait until the document is unveiled on Thursday. A lot of EU nationals have made their homes in this country and made a massive contribution to our society. A lot of British people live in different parts of the EU and many of those families have been through unbelievable stress. So they absolutely must have the right to remain and bring their families here. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr that it was now \u201cnot remotely likely\u201d that the UK would leave the UK without a deal. \u201cCould we leave without a deal?\u201d said Marr. \u201cI think it\u2019s, no,... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s remotely likely,\u201d Raab responded. Asked about claims that the Tories offered peerages and jobs to Brexit Party figures in return for them standing aside, security minister Brandon Lewis told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge On Sunday: We have not offered any deals to anybody. I think what\u2019s rather surreal with this conversation, not least of all is the fact that actually as chairman I removed Ann Widdecombe\u2019s membership of the Conservative Party because she had joined the Brexit Party - that\u2019s completely in breach of our constitution - but also because we\u2019re the party saying we need to get a clear Conservative majority, we are fighting these seats to get Brexit done and deliver for people. Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth refused to say whether immigration would increase or decrease under a Labour government. We want a balanced approach to immigration and what that means for the NHS is if a hospital trust thinks that a surgeon or a nurse or a midwife is qualified enough to come to our country to care for our sick and our elderly and offers them that opportunity, then they should be allowed to come to our country to care for our sick and our elderly. Here are some more details on Labour\u2019s dentistry announcement. The party has pledged to scrap band one dentistry charges, giving everyone a free teeth MOT with their dentist, including checks for oral cancers. They say this will save money in the long run, taking pressure off GPs and hospitals. The British Dental Association has estimated that the measures would cost \u00a3450m per year. Here are some key passages from the announcement: Charges put people off from going to their dentist, and actively undermines prevention - nearly 1 in 5 patients delay going to the dentist because they can\u2019t afford to see one ... The current system is also putting pressure on the wider NHS. Around 380,000 patients with toothache are choosing to head to their GPs who cannot provide dental treatment, costing the NHS over \u00a320 million a year. Around 135,000 patients per year are also estimated to attend A&amp;E units with dental problems, at a cost of \u00a318 million. Today\u2019s measures are also aimed at improving children\u2019s oral health. More than 100 children a day have rotting teeth removed in hospital, when nine in ten cases could have been prevented. Tooth decay remains the leading reason for hospitals admissions among 5 to 9 year olds, and are more than double those for tonsillitis. Corbyn says that their proposals for re-nationalisation are \u201cvery, very modest\u201d. The water companies are failing and so is Royal Mail. He finishes the interview by saying he is \u201cdetermined to win it and looking forward to winning it on 12 December\u201d. On the party\u2019s pledge to give people free dental check-ups, Corbyn says that the measure would actually save money because it would prevent more expensive \u2013 and painful \u2013 problems emerging. \u201cYou should look at expenditure as investment in the future,\u201d he says. Asked if he agrees with army chief Nick Carter\u2019s comment that NATO was the most successful military alliance in history, Corbyn says he wouldn\u2019t define it as that but as \u201ca product of an attempt to bring people together after the second world war\u201d. On Trident, Corbyn says the nuclear deterrent would part of \u201cnuclear non-proliferation discussions\u201d if he became prime minister. The real insecurities in the world are not the same as they were in the Cold War, he says, they are more to do with cyber-security. Corbyn is asked about the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford\u2019s insistence that his party would insist on a Scottish independence referendum in the first year of a Labour government. Corbyn says he cannot promise that. \u201cWe are not doing deals with anybody, we are not forming coalition,\u201d he says. The issue of an independence referendum should not come \u201cin the early years of a Labour government\u201d, says Corbyn. He says the SNP will have a choice between bringing in a Tory government with all its austerity measures and a progressive Labour government. We paid \u00a311bn into the EU budget last year to access the bloc\u2019s market. Would Corbyn agree to that, says Marr. The Labour leader says it depends how much they were asking for but that we need to maintain access to EU markets. Corbyn is asked if the Labour party\u2019s manifesto will repeat its 2017 promise to end free movement. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait until Thursday [when the Labour manifesto will be unveiled] to find out the wording of it,\u201d says Corbyn. A lot of EU nationals have made their homes here and make a massive contribution to this society, he says. They should be able to remain. Marr asks the Labour leader about his party\u2019s conference motion to \u201cextend free movement\u201d. Corbyn says he thinks the movers of the motion had in mind \u201cfamily reunion\u201d, so allowing people to bring members of their family to the UK from outside the EU. (The Conservative party is interpreting the motion as meaning the extension of free movement to other countries.) Will free movement end if we leave the EU? \u201cThere will be an awful lot of movement,\u201d says Corbyn. Corbyn is on Marr. Asked if he wanted the UK to leave the EU or not, he said he would put that choice to the British people and that he wanted \u201ca close relationship with the EU\u201d. \u201cWe will negotiate a credible option of leaving and put that along side remain and put that to the British people,\u201d he said, adding that negotiations with the EU would start as soon as they entered government. Marr points out that most of the senior members of the shadow cabinet have said they would campaign to remain in any second referendum. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to take with me into those negotiations,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cHowever people voted in the referendum, they didn\u2019t vote to loose their job, they didn\u2019t vote for a deregulated society,\u201d he says. A Labour-negotiated deal would be put to the party\u2019s conference as well as to parliament, he says. Labour would back a customs union with the EU. \u201cWe have to be realistic about where British trade is at the moment\u201d, says Corbyn, and about half of UK trade is done with the EU. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab is on Marr, talking about Conservative plans on immigration \u2013 some of which have been set out this morning. Asked about the previous target of getting immigration down to 10s of thousands, Raab says that \u2013 speaking as the son of a refugee \u2013 he thinks that immigration can be very beneficial, but that people coming to the UK should have to wait five years before they can claim benefits and that they should pay into the NHS. His party has said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of migrants will need a job offer to come to the UK to work if they form the next government, regardless of where they are from in the world. They say there will be a small number of exceptions, including high-skilled scientists and those who want to come to the UK to start a business. Asked what groups of migrant workers the party wanted fewer of in the UK, Raab said he didn\u2019t want to stigmatise groups. He said he wanted to invest in innovation so that the UK was more productive and he wanted to reduce the need for cheap labour from abroad. The Conservatives have pledged that access to benefits will be equalised between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world, meaning non-UK citizens will typically need to wait five years before they are able to claim benefits. Under current rules, EU migrants can access welfare and services after being in the UK for three months. The party said it would put an end to the practice of child benefit being sent abroad to support children who do not live in the UK and that it would increase the immigration health surcharge from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625. They said the change will raise more than \u00a3500m a year. The surcharge was introduced in 2015 in a clampdown on so-called \u201chealth tourism\u201d, and has previously been doubled from \u00a3200 to \u00a3400. Good morning and welcome to Politics live. Prince Andrew\u2019s bombshell interview with Emily Maitlis for BBC\u2019s Newsnight last night is likely to dominate this morning\u2019s news agenda. The Duke of York claimed that he could not have had sex with a teenage girl in the London home of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell because he was at home after attending a children\u2019s party at Pizza Express in Woking. You can read the full story here and some analysis here. In politics news, the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri has told ITV\u2019s Exposure that Boris Johnson brutally cast her aside \u201clike some one-night stand\u201d, leaving her \u201cheartbroken\u201d since he became prime minister and the controversy over their four-year relationship became public. The full interview will be aired on ITV\u2019s Exposure this evening. Writing in the Observer, Jeremy Corbyn has said the Labour government will pass an emergency \u201cNHS protection\u201d law if it wins the general election, to ensure that powerful US pharmaceutical companies cannot infiltrate the health service and dramatically force up the price of drugs. The party has also pledged to provide free NHS dental check-ups for everyone in England this morning. Corbyn said that over half of adults and 40% of children haven\u2019t been to the dentist in the last year. If you don\u2019t go to the dentist for check-ups, you end up storing up problems in the long term. Over 100,000 are admitted to hospital every year because of problems with their teeth. The Labour leader is due on the Andrew Marr show shortly. I\u2019ll bring you the latest from that.",

      "body": "<p>On Saturday afternoon, it was just an ordinary Pizza Express in Woking. By Sunday morning, it had become the focus of international media attention, second only to Salisbury\u2019s branch of Zizzi on the list of Britain\u2019s most notorious pizza places.</p> <p>The local outlet of the popular chain was catapulted into the spotlight alongside the restaurant that was temporarily closed after a novichok attack last year after Prince Andrew\u2019s Newsnight interview on Saturday. In the interview, the Duke of York explained that a visit to the Woking venue on 10 March 18 years ago was his alibi for the allegation that on the same day he had sex with Virginia Giuffre, then aged 17, one of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s alleged trafficking victims.</p> <p>Giuffre, whose surname was then Roberts, claims that the pair danced at Tramp nightclub \u2013 where Andrew was said to have been sweating profusely \u2013 before going back to the Belgravia home of Epstein\u2019s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.</p> <p>But while Andrew had \u201cno recollection\u201d of meeting Giuffre, he said his visit to the food chain with his daughter Beatrice for a birthday party was especially memorable because it was a \u201cvery unusual\u201d thing for him to do. \u201cI\u2019ve only been to Woking a couple of times and I remember it weirdly distinctly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as somebody reminded me of it, I went, \u2018Oh yes, I remember that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In spite of its new-found notoriety, business continued as usual at the Pizza Express as unsuspecting customers arrived for lunch on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cHas it closed?\u201d one asked, looking nonplussed at the press pack and camera waiting outside, before entering hurriedly. Staff, meanwhile, were tight-lipped, with one young waitress telling the Guardian that the restaurant would \u201cnot answer any questions\u201d.</p> <p>Husband and wife Mike and Amanda Bibby have lived in Woking for more than three decades and strolled past the pizzeria on one of their weekly five-mile walks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ac437713928db243cbb39d14bd913ed4fec762e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ac437713928db243cbb39d14bd913ed4fec762e/0_8_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike and Amanda Bibby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike and Amanda Bibby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Walawalkar/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOh my gosh.

I think that was in December 1994.\u201d</p> <p>The couple said that they had seen Andrew\u2019s daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, \u201cloads\u201d seven miles away in Sunningdale, but never Woking.</p> <p>Twins Brian and Trevor Woodcock, both born and raised in Woking, were also among the passersby. \u201cI used to work in an office block across the road \u2026 It\u2019s got to be 25 years ago,\u201d said Trevor, wondering if he may have been on shift at the time of the Prince\u2019s supposed visit.

      "bodyText": "On Saturday afternoon, it was just an ordinary Pizza Express in Woking. By Sunday morning, it had become the focus of international media attention, second only to Salisbury\u2019s branch of Zizzi on the list of Britain\u2019s most notorious pizza places. The local outlet of the popular chain was catapulted into the spotlight alongside the restaurant that was temporarily closed after a novichok attack last year after Prince Andrew\u2019s Newsnight interview on Saturday. In the interview, the Duke of York explained that a visit to the Woking venue on 10 March 18 years ago was his alibi for the allegation that on the same day he had sex with Virginia Giuffre, then aged 17, one of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s alleged trafficking victims. Giuffre, whose surname was then Roberts, claims that the pair danced at Tramp nightclub \u2013 where Andrew was said to have been sweating profusely \u2013 before going back to the Belgravia home of Epstein\u2019s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. But while Andrew had \u201cno recollection\u201d of meeting Giuffre, he said his visit to the food chain with his daughter Beatrice for a birthday party was especially memorable because it was a \u201cvery unusual\u201d thing for him to do. \u201cI\u2019ve only been to Woking a couple of times and I remember it weirdly distinctly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as somebody reminded me of it, I went, \u2018Oh yes, I remember that.\u2019\u201d In spite of its new-found notoriety, business continued as usual at the Pizza Express as unsuspecting customers arrived for lunch on Sunday. \u201cHas it closed?\u201d one asked, looking nonplussed at the press pack and camera waiting outside, before entering hurriedly. Staff, meanwhile, were tight-lipped, with one young waitress telling the Guardian that the restaurant would \u201cnot answer any questions\u201d. Husband and wife Mike and Amanda Bibby have lived in Woking for more than three decades and strolled past the pizzeria on one of their weekly five-mile walks. \u201cOh my gosh. We have been coming here for at least 20 years,\u201d said Amanda, 53. \u201cWe come for Mother\u2019s Day, birthdays \u2013 all of the family events because it is easy for everybody.\u201d Asked whether she could recall her first visit, she took a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cI remember one of the first times when the children were tiny, it was winter time \u2026 I had the most amazing chicken caesar salad I ever had. I think that was in December 1994.\u201d The couple said that they had seen Andrew\u2019s daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, \u201cloads\u201d seven miles away in Sunningdale, but never Woking. Twins Brian and Trevor Woodcock, both born and raised in Woking, were also among the passersby. \u201cI used to work in an office block across the road \u2026 It\u2019s got to be 25 years ago,\u201d said Trevor, wondering if he may have been on shift at the time of the Prince\u2019s supposed visit. The 50-year-old added: \u201cBut no, I didn\u2019t see him here.\u201d He has been to the restaurant multiple times but, asked if he could remember his first, he simply said: \u201cNo, to be honest.\u201d Ian Spain has lived on the road adjacent to Pizza Express for 37 years but has visited it on few occasions, preferring instead to make his pizza at home. \u201cIt is not something you would say is remarkable,\u201d said the 53-year-old. \u201cThere has not been any gossip on the street. I\u2019m sure if he did go there, he must have kept a very low-profile.\u201d The town\u2019s Pizza Express listing on Google has been inundated with fake reviews since the duke\u2019s interview aired last night. \u201cIt has been 18 years since I visited, but I remember it like it was yesterday,\u201d wrote someone using the name David Branwood. \u201cI was sweating profusely. So were all the other customers. It was hot. But one man, one mysterious man, was ice-cool, sweat-free,\u201d it continued, a dig at the duke\u2019s claims that he lost the ability to sweat following an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war. While the seemingly nondescript restaurant has left a lasting impression on Prince Andrew, the memories appeared to be far less vivid for its neighbours.",

      "body": "<p>Just after calling the general election, Boris Johnson\u2019s government made two almost simultaneous policy announcements that encapsulated the longstanding contradictions of environmental policy over the past decade.</p> <p>His decision to announce a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/02/fracking-banned-in-uk-as-government-makes-major-u-turn\">moratorium on fracking</a> \u2013 which, as the Labour party pointed out, was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/04/cuadrilla-vows-new-data-to-overturn-uk-fracking-moratorium\">temporary commitment</a> rather than a ban \u2013 made headlines and was heralded as a signal of green intentions, but the go-ahead for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/03/government-under-fire-after-approval-of-new-coal-mine-in-cumbria\">new deep coalmine</a> in Cumbria was slipped out to little fanfare.</p> <p>The conflicting signals were in keeping with a decade of environmental policy under the Conservative-led coalition and two Tory governments, during which U-turns and flip-flops have cheered and infuriated campaigners and green businesses alike. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/11/conservatives-25-year-green-plan-main-points-at-a-glance\">25-year environment plan</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\">target for net zero carbon emissions by 2050</a> have been highlights since the last general election, but the policies needed to implement them remain mired in confusion.</p> <p>\u201c[There has been] a disjunction between the government\u2019s willingness to say the right things, and even to put them into legally binding targets, and their unwillingness to make the tough choices we need to achieve them,\u201d said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. \u201cThe 2050 net zero target, while not as soon as we would like, is a real achievement. [But] it is still accompanied by road-building, new licences for oil drilling, a third runway at Heathrow and stubborn opposition to onshore wind and solar.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group of green businesses, said: \u201cThe story of the last 10 years is also that of a missed opportunity to cut emissions in key areas such as buildings and transport. We have seen incredibly slow progress.\u201d</p> <p>Planning rules for onshore windfarms were changed and subsidies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/22/fears-for-future-of-uk-onshore-wind-power-despite-record-growth\">drastically scaled back</a> from 2018, since when scarcely any new onshore windfarms have been built. Meanwhile, solar installations \u2013 vaunted under the coalition \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/home-solar-panel-installations-fall-by-94-as-subsidies-cut\">have plummeted</a> after incentives for households were taken away. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/theresa-may-pledges-to-freeze-fuel-duty-for-ninth-consecutive-year\">nine-year freeze</a> on fuel duty, at a cost of \u00a39bn a year to the Treasury, has buoyed fossil fuels and contributed to a 3% rise in transport emissions in the last five years.</p> <p>There have been similar reversals in housing, one of the biggest sources of emissions. As chancellor, George Osborne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/uk-scraps-zero-carbon-home-target\">scrapped the zero carbon homes standard</a> on the eve of its planned introduction in 2016.

While greenhouse gas emissions from energy generation have fallen, largely owing to the long-term shift away from coal, carbon from transport has grown.</p> <p>There has also been an impact on jobs, with a drop of nearly a third in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/renewable-energy-jobs-in-uk-plunge-by-a-third\">number of renewable energy jobs</a>, according to the union Prospect, and job losses in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/18/uk-energy-saving-efforts-collapse-after-government-slashes-subsidies\">home energy efficiency</a>. Mike Clancy, Prospect\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe last decade has been a masterclass in overpromising and underdelivering on environmental policy. This election needs to be a wake-up call that the climate emergency needs a serious rethink on austerity.\u201d</p> <p>Policies for the natural environment and animal welfare also hang in the balance.

      "bodyText": "Just after calling the general election, Boris Johnson\u2019s government made two almost simultaneous policy announcements that encapsulated the longstanding contradictions of environmental policy over the past decade. His decision to announce a moratorium on fracking \u2013 which, as the Labour party pointed out, was a temporary commitment rather than a ban \u2013 made headlines and was heralded as a signal of green intentions, but the go-ahead for a new deep coalmine in Cumbria was slipped out to little fanfare. The conflicting signals were in keeping with a decade of environmental policy under the Conservative-led coalition and two Tory governments, during which U-turns and flip-flops have cheered and infuriated campaigners and green businesses alike. A 25-year environment plan and a target for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 have been highlights since the last general election, but the policies needed to implement them remain mired in confusion. \u201c[There has been] a disjunction between the government\u2019s willingness to say the right things, and even to put them into legally binding targets, and their unwillingness to make the tough choices we need to achieve them,\u201d said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. \u201cThe 2050 net zero target, while not as soon as we would like, is a real achievement. [But] it is still accompanied by road-building, new licences for oil drilling, a third runway at Heathrow and stubborn opposition to onshore wind and solar.\u201d Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group of green businesses, said: \u201cThe story of the last 10 years is also that of a missed opportunity to cut emissions in key areas such as buildings and transport. We have seen incredibly slow progress.\u201d Planning rules for onshore windfarms were changed and subsidies drastically scaled back from 2018, since when scarcely any new onshore windfarms have been built. Meanwhile, solar installations \u2013 vaunted under the coalition \u2013 have plummeted after incentives for households were taken away. A nine-year freeze on fuel duty, at a cost of \u00a39bn a year to the Treasury, has buoyed fossil fuels and contributed to a 3% rise in transport emissions in the last five years. There have been similar reversals in housing, one of the biggest sources of emissions. As chancellor, George Osborne scrapped the zero carbon homes standard on the eve of its planned introduction in 2016. The number of existing homes fitted with new insulation had collapsed by early 2016 and has never recovered, after the government ended home insulation programmes. While ministers talked up the prospects of electric vehicles to tackle the climate emergency and the air pollution that contributes to 40,000 premature deaths a year, tax breaks that encouraged their purchase were scrapped last year. In June, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said sales of the cars had plunged by nearly 12% year on year. Before the government promised under Theresa May to phase out diesel cars in 2040, it fought a bitter campaign in the courts to avoid having to meet clean air requirements. There has also been confusion over the planned expansion of Heathrow: Boris Johnson promised to \u201clie in front of the bulldozers\u201d, while Theresa May\u2019s cabinet backed the developers. These mixed signals across a wide variety of areas have produced mixed results. While greenhouse gas emissions from energy generation have fallen, largely owing to the long-term shift away from coal, carbon from transport has grown. There has also been an impact on jobs, with a drop of nearly a third in the number of renewable energy jobs, according to the union Prospect, and job losses in home energy efficiency. Mike Clancy, Prospect\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe last decade has been a masterclass in overpromising and underdelivering on environmental policy. This election needs to be a wake-up call that the climate emergency needs a serious rethink on austerity.\u201d Policies for the natural environment and animal welfare also hang in the balance. While the government recently promised small-scale animal welfare improvements such as banning primates as pets and microchipping cats, a new influx of Tory MPs could result in a challenge to the hunting ban, and the party still firmly supports the controversial badger cull. Farmers, usually reliably Conservative in their voting patterns across most of England, have been promised taxpayer funding to reduce emissions and air pollution and preserve wildlife, but the agriculture and environment bills that would enable these policies have been left in limbo. The UK will next year host the most important climate conference since the signing of the 2015 Paris agreement. That will mean unprecedented scrutiny for the new government\u2019s plans, and an opportunity to bring coherence to what has often been a piecemeal approach to environmental policy \u2013 and to prove that the UK\u2019s environmental commitments will be upheld after Brexit. \u201cOver the last 10 years we\u2019ve seen a few steps forward for the environment, but the scales are heavily tipped towards policies which spell disaster for people and the planet,\u201d said Dave Timms, head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a climate and ecological emergency. Tough regulation and massive investment in the right places are what we urgently need.\u201d",

Luke Clark, from Renewable UK, the renewable energy industry trade association, said the government in the last five years had excluded onshore wind and solar from the competitive market for renewable projects, which had led to an 80% fall in onshore wind installed in 2018, compared with the previous 12 months. \u201cIf [we] are not using cheap sources like onshore wind and solar, we are slowing down the process of how quickly we can achieve decarbonisation,\u201d said Clark. \u201cTo tackle the climate emergency, we need all these options.\u201d Greg Archer, a director of the zero-emissions pressure group Transport &amp; Environment, in a new analysis of the Conservatives\u2019 nine-year freeze on fuel duty, said the policy had put the equivalent of 2.5m additional cars on the road. \u201cConservative action to tackle transport emissions has been a story of wrong priorities, little action and missed opportunities, and whilst it has talked green, transport emissions have flatlined for 10 years,\u201d said Archer. \u201cGrants for electric cars have been cut and are scheduled to end in March 2020, stalling progress.\u201d In addition, UK aviation emissions were forecast to continue to rise, but the government was advocating additional runways, including the Heathrow third runway and new terminals, said Archer. Next year will be a critical in the fight to tackle the climate crisis, with the UK hosting the most important climate conference since the 2015 Paris agreement was signed. Experts say that will lead to unprecedented scrutiny of the environment policies of the new government, which will set the tone for the international response to the escalating global emergency. A Guardian investigation earlier this year found Conservative MPs were almost five times as likely to vote against climate action as legislators from other parties. Boris Johnson was among several dozen MPs, mostly Conservatives, who recorded the worst possible score of zero on the Guardian\u2019s climate scorecard of MPs. Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, said: \u201cThe Conservatives have taken world-leading action to tackle climate change \u2013 legislating to achieve net zero, reducing emissions by a quarter since coming to office in 2010, and boosting renewables to record levels. \u201cWe have set manageable targets that will bring society with us. Corbyn\u2019s Labour would ban people from using their cars or taking flights, and their plans have been slammed by their own unions as \u2018utterly unachievable\u2019. \u201cOnly Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will get Brexit done so we can continue tackling climate change while successfully growing our economy.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>No matter who you speak to, the general consensus will be that the results of Great Britain\u2019s tour of the southern hemisphere tell only half the story of a trip that most of their supporters will be keen to forget. Was this on par with the dismal tour of 1999, when the Lions were humiliated by Australia and New Zealand and struggled to beat even the local Australian side Burleigh Bears? Maybe not, but even so, there are questions to be asked about what happens now.</p> <p>Wayne Bennett was keen to stress in the aftermath of all four of Great Britain\u2019s defeats that their opponents \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/tonga-invitational-xiii-great-britain-rugby-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Tonga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/09/great-britains-tour-reaches-new-lows-with-heavy-loss-to-new-zealand\" title=\"\">New Zealand</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/papua-new-guinea-great-britain-match-report-rugby-league\" title=\"\">Papua New Guinea</a> \u2013 were simply better than them. That much is true, but the Lions were dull, uninspiring to watch and simply outclassed. That is before you even begin to assess selection policies, off-field perception and much more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2019/nov/12/great-britain-lions-coach-wayne-bennett-new-zealand\">Wayne Bennett has failed as Great Britain Lions coach</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lingering feeling that this was England\u2019s national side in another name was palpable before the players even departed from home following Bennett\u2019s squad announcement. So would the hierarchy have done anything different in that regard? \u201cI\u2019ll stand by our selection policy 100%,\u201d the Rugby Football League\u2019s Kevin Sinfield says. It is hard to argue with his approach \u2013 but the make-up of the squad is exactly why Great Britain\u2019s return felt hollow anyway.</p> <p>Sinfield is quick to point out that rugby league\u2019s Lions should not be compared to their rugby union counterparts \u2013 and with no domestic leagues of any strength to speak of in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, he is right. You do not just give prestigious Test caps away to players because they are non-English: but the whole sport knew that, save for maybe one or two exceptions, this was going to be an English squad.</p> <p>\u201cFundamentally, we\u2019re trying everything we can to win a home World Cup in 2021 with England but we threw everything we could at this Great Britain tour from a performance perspective,\u201d Sinfield says. \u201cIt\u2019s legitimately unfair to compare this concept to what happens in union.\u201d Which is why, unfortunately, Great Britain as a concept in rugby league has run its course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5b27b40a80fa8dfbfd6d06f27f86c3ae5ad6d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5b27b40a80fa8dfbfd6d06f27f86c3ae5ad6d3/0_120_3596_2157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Britain\u2019s coach Wayne Bennett, who is also in charge of England, is under pressure after the heavy losses to New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Britain\u2019s coach Wayne Bennett, who is also in charge of England, is under pressure after the heavy losses to New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kai Schw\u00f6rer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>England are building towards that World Cup and the dynamics of this tour \u2013 where the Lions have been without mainstays such as Sean O\u2019Loughlin and Sam Burgess \u2013 suggests the national side is in a period of transition. There is also the unavoidable feeling that this tour, irrespective of the results, has failed to live up to the hype that a first GB tour in 12 years provided when it was announced.</p> <p>Sinfield concedes that. \u201cGreat Britain was the reason I picked up a rugby ball, but the dynamics have changed. Bringing it back was always going to be about seeing what the interest was like in the southern hemisphere but prior to PNG, there hadn\u2019t been a full stadium. Maybe the appetite isn\u2019t quite what it was made out to be \u2013 and that will be part of the post-tour review.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/09/great-britains-tour-reaches-new-lows-with-heavy-loss-to-new-zealand\">Great Britain's tour reaches new low with heavy loss to New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bennett\u2019s own future will also be part of the review when the touring party returns this week. Public feeling for the 69-year-old \u2013 who rarely visits England and barely watches Super League by his own admission \u2013 has never been lower in England, with many feeling the time is right for him to move on now his contract has expired.</p> <p>Apportioning all the blame at Bennett\u2019s door is harsh given the injuries he has had to contend with, but after such a miserable tour and his decision to take a lopsided squad with six halves and barely any three-quarters \u2013 a move that backfired badly after injuries quickly ruled out one of the two wingers, Ryan Hall, and the only true centre, Oliver Gildart \u2013 many feel Bennett has run his course.</p> <p>So what happens now? \u201cMy dialogue with Wayne has always been excellent,\u201d Sinfield says. \u201cHe\u2019s made a huge impact on how we\u2019re developing but we\u2019ll take a break after the tour and make a call. We\u2019ve got an idea on where we would like to go. I don\u2019t want to use the word transition, but with the players not here, this was always going to be a bumpy road.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec6fcab789a4bfac77c492c9db768634df343590\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec6fcab789a4bfac77c492c9db768634df343590/0_31_5314_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rugby Football League\u2019s Kevin Sinfield stood by the Lions \u2018selection policy 100%\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rugby Football League\u2019s Kevin Sinfield stood by the Lions \u2018selection policy 100%\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA Wire/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no shortage of candidates to replace Bennett. English rugby league has some talented young coaches such as London\u2019s Danny Ward and Salford\u2019s Ian Watson, who were on the tour. The former Wigan coach Shaun Wane would also be a hugely popular choice if Bennett\u2019s deal is not renewed.</p> <p>Sinfield insists there have been positives from the tour. \u201cThe squad have been exemplary, we\u2019ve not had one off-field issue,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve fulfilled their PR duties and there\u2019s been stuff going on that people watching at home may not see. However, I have an understanding of the criticism we\u2019ve received.\u201d</p> <p>Rugby league is proud of its rich history and its triumphs over adversity. Great Britain have always been an important part of that. But England are now undoubtedly the priority and a rebuilding job is required following a disastrous tour.</p> <p>However, unless the rest of the home nations can strengthen their standing, then the Lions concept should now be consigned to history.</p>",

      "bodyText": "No matter who you speak to, the general consensus will be that the results of Great Britain\u2019s tour of the southern hemisphere tell only half the story of a trip that most of their supporters will be keen to forget. Was this on par with the dismal tour of 1999, when the Lions were humiliated by Australia and New Zealand and struggled to beat even the local Australian side Burleigh Bears? Maybe not, but even so, there are questions to be asked about what happens now. Wayne Bennett was keen to stress in the aftermath of all four of Great Britain\u2019s defeats that their opponents \u2013 Tonga, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea \u2013 were simply better than them. That much is true, but the Lions were dull, uninspiring to watch and simply outclassed. That is before you even begin to assess selection policies, off-field perception and much more. The lingering feeling that this was England\u2019s national side in another name was palpable before the players even departed from home following Bennett\u2019s squad announcement. So would the hierarchy have done anything different in that regard? \u201cI\u2019ll stand by our selection policy 100%,\u201d the Rugby Football League\u2019s Kevin Sinfield says. It is hard to argue with his approach \u2013 but the make-up of the squad is exactly why Great Britain\u2019s return felt hollow anyway. Sinfield is quick to point out that rugby league\u2019s Lions should not be compared to their rugby union counterparts \u2013 and with no domestic leagues of any strength to speak of in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, he is right. You do not just give prestigious Test caps away to players because they are non-English: but the whole sport knew that, save for maybe one or two exceptions, this was going to be an English squad. \u201cFundamentally, we\u2019re trying everything we can to win a home World Cup in 2021 with England but we threw everything we could at this Great Britain tour from a performance perspective,\u201d Sinfield says. \u201cIt\u2019s legitimately unfair to compare this concept to what happens in union.\u201d Which is why, unfortunately, Great Britain as a concept in rugby league has run its course. England are building towards that World Cup and the dynamics of this tour \u2013 where the Lions have been without mainstays such as Sean O\u2019Loughlin and Sam Burgess \u2013 suggests the national side is in a period of transition. There is also the unavoidable feeling that this tour, irrespective of the results, has failed to live up to the hype that a first GB tour in 12 years provided when it was announced. Sinfield concedes that. \u201cGreat Britain was the reason I picked up a rugby ball, but the dynamics have changed. Bringing it back was always going to be about seeing what the interest was like in the southern hemisphere but prior to PNG, there hadn\u2019t been a full stadium. Maybe the appetite isn\u2019t quite what it was made out to be \u2013 and that will be part of the post-tour review.\u201d Bennett\u2019s own future will also be part of the review when the touring party returns this week. Public feeling for the 69-year-old \u2013 who rarely visits England and barely watches Super League by his own admission \u2013 has never been lower in England, with many feeling the time is right for him to move on now his contract has expired. Apportioning all the blame at Bennett\u2019s door is harsh given the injuries he has had to contend with, but after such a miserable tour and his decision to take a lopsided squad with six halves and barely any three-quarters \u2013 a move that backfired badly after injuries quickly ruled out one of the two wingers, Ryan Hall, and the only true centre, Oliver Gildart \u2013 many feel Bennett has run his course. So what happens now? \u201cMy dialogue with Wayne has always been excellent,\u201d Sinfield says. \u201cHe\u2019s made a huge impact on how we\u2019re developing but we\u2019ll take a break after the tour and make a call. We\u2019ve got an idea on where we would like to go. I don\u2019t want to use the word transition, but with the players not here, this was always going to be a bumpy road.\u201d There are no shortage of candidates to replace Bennett. English rugby league has some talented young coaches such as London\u2019s Danny Ward and Salford\u2019s Ian Watson, who were on the tour. The former Wigan coach Shaun Wane would also be a hugely popular choice if Bennett\u2019s deal is not renewed. Sinfield insists there have been positives from the tour. \u201cThe squad have been exemplary, we\u2019ve not had one off-field issue,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve fulfilled their PR duties and there\u2019s been stuff going on that people watching at home may not see. However, I have an understanding of the criticism we\u2019ve received.\u201d Rugby league is proud of its rich history and its triumphs over adversity. Great Britain have always been an important part of that. But England are now undoubtedly the priority and a rebuilding job is required following a disastrous tour. However, unless the rest of the home nations can strengthen their standing, then the Lions concept should now be consigned to history.",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s general election candidate for Kensington and Chelsea has said she will report her Liberal Democrat rival to the police, alleging he made a false statement implying she had a role, as a local councillor, in discussing the flammable cladding used on Grenfell Tower. Emma Dent Coad, who became MP for the west London constituency in 2017 and is an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, said Sam Gyimah\u2019s claims were \u201cshameful\u201d and accused him of whipping up false rumours that could lead to her being the target of violence. She said she had given him several days to withdraw his comments and a complaint to the Metropolitan police under the Representation of the People Act would be issued later on Sunday. Dent Coad said: \u201cIf this is a political game, shame on him. We\u2019ve sent rebuttals with all the links and all the evidence is there. Even if I had been on those committees, there is no way that a backbench opposition councillor would have made those decisions. But I wasn\u2019t on those committees at that time and I can prove it. \u201cThat\u2019s really, really dangerous talk.

Hot on the heels of working out how you plan to spend Christmas comes the realisation of <em>how much</em> you plan to spend. Presents, food and trips out swiftly add up.</p> <p>Of course, there are lots of ways to celebrate that do not require a big outlay. But if there are things you know you want to do or buy, and your budget is not limitless, some quick-fix savings will help.</p> <h2><strong>Plan your supermarket shop</strong></h2> <p>For many people, the biggest expense is food. Amy Sheppard, a food writer who shares tips and recipes on Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amysheppardfood/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@amysheppardfood</a>, says her top tip for reducing the cost of eating is meal-planning. \u201cSo many people go to the supermarket with no idea what they are going to cook, and they end up spending more as a result,\u201d she says. She plans seven to 10 meals in advance, and says this allows her to better plan how to use leftovers.</p> <p>Sheppard schedules one or two of these store-cupboard meals a week. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing your meal-planning it doesn\u2019t have to be elaborate dinners every day. If you plan to have a tin of soup, or a jacket potato, you will save a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>Include planning for lunch and snacks \u2013 grabbing food on the go is more expensive than taking in provisions. A packet of six apples at Tesco costs \u00a31.20, while some sandwich shops will charge 50p just for one. Multipacks of Walkers crisps cost \u00a31.50 for six packs versus 65p for a single bag.

      "bodyText": "Selfridge\u2019s may have opened its Christmas shop in July, but most of us are only just starting to think seriously about the festive season. Hot on the heels of working out how you plan to spend Christmas comes the realisation of how much you plan to spend. Presents, food and trips out swiftly add up. Of course, there are lots of ways to celebrate that do not require a big outlay. But if there are things you know you want to do or buy, and your budget is not limitless, some quick-fix savings will help. Plan your supermarket shop For many people, the biggest expense is food. Amy Sheppard, a food writer who shares tips and recipes on Instagram at @amysheppardfood, says her top tip for reducing the cost of eating is meal-planning. \u201cSo many people go to the supermarket with no idea what they are going to cook, and they end up spending more as a result,\u201d she says. She plans seven to 10 meals in advance, and says this allows her to better plan how to use leftovers. Sheppard schedules one or two of these store-cupboard meals a week. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing your meal-planning it doesn\u2019t have to be elaborate dinners every day. If you plan to have a tin of soup, or a jacket potato, you will save a lot of money.\u201d Include planning for lunch and snacks \u2013 grabbing food on the go is more expensive than taking in provisions. A packet of six apples at Tesco costs \u00a31.20, while some sandwich shops will charge 50p just for one. Multipacks of Walkers crisps cost \u00a31.50 for six packs versus 65p for a single bag. The multipack bags are smaller than those sold individually, so better for you, and much cheaper at \u00a31 per 100g versus \u00a32. Jasmine Birtles, founder of the MoneyMagpie website, suggests going through your cupboards and using up the things you have been stashing at the back. \u201cEvery now and then, I only buy perishables that will go with what I have in the kitchen cupboard or the freezer.

      "bodyText": "NHS staff claim they are being prevented from speaking out during the election campaign because their bosses are applying rules about political neutrality too zealously. Health workers have been told not to get involved in any political debates on social media during the campaign. NHS organisations have also banned staff from appearing in uniform or featuring any of their equipment, such as an ambulance, in their online posts or profiles. Doctors, nurses and paramedics have told the Guardian that the instructions from their employers are oppressive and an attempt to stop them highlighting the fragile state of the NHS in the run-up to the 12 December poll. The health service has been a prominent issue in the campaign so far, with the Conservatives and Labour making a series of pledges about funding and staffing. Some NHS trusts appear to be imposing tighter restrictions on staff during the purdah period than those outlined in guidance that the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, sent to health service leaders on 5 November. The guidance was aimed at NHS bodies and stressed that in the campaign \u201cas always, the NHS must act and be seen to act with political impartiality, and its resources must not be used for party political purposes\u201d. But its section on \u201cstaff activism\u201d does not mention behaviour on social media. It says only: \u201cNHS employees are free to undertake political activism in a personal capacity but should not involve their organisation or create the impression of their organisation\u2019s involvement.\u201d Kevin McGee, the chief executive of Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS trust, recently wrote to all its staff saying they \u201cshould not use the trust\u2019s premises for political activism and should make every effort to preserve public professional neutrality, especially on social media.\u201d Many of the NHS\u2019s 1.5 million staff use social media, especially Twitter, to describe the pressure that the service is under. They often cite understaffing and lack of funding as key issues.

I feel I am being denied both my right to express myself freely and denied this opportunity to share my opinions on manifestos or party policy which the public may find valuable, given my extensive experience within the NHS.\u201d Health Education England has told its staff that during the campaign they should not use social networks \u201cor online forums, communities and other public online discussions in a way that will call into question your political impartiality regarding your professional role at HEE\u201d. Similarly, Pauline Howie, the chief executive of the Scottish ambulance service, recently wrote to her staff saying that during the campaign \u201cif you mention that you work for the Scottish ambulance service on your personal social media channels, you cannot get involved in any online activity, debate or discussion which is political in nature.\u201d NHS bodies are keen to ensure that staff who do debate political issues online do not mention which part of the health service they work for, in case it is seen to compromise their political impartiality. For example, the \u201cstaff activism\u201d section of East Midlands ambulance service\u2019s guidance to employees about the pre-election period says: \u201cNHS employees are free to undertake political activism in a personal capacity but should not involve their organisation or create the impression of their organisation\u2019s involvement. \u201cPlease be careful therefore with your personal social media accounts if you include where you work and/or photographs of you in uniform/with an EMAS vehicle feature in your profile.\u201d The Scottish government\u2019s advice to NHS bodies says staff \u201cshould not use their official premises, uniforms or equipment and should not make comments based on information not generally available to the public.\u201d Dr Kumail Versi, a specialist registrar in paediatrics, said: \u201cIn light of the political climate, it is shocking to see NHS bosses trying to stop doctors from speaking out about the deterioration of the NHS under the Tory government.

      "bodyText": "Why did Prince Andrew stay at Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s home and attend a dinner on his trip to \u2018break up\u2019 with the convicted child sex offender? In the Newsnight interview, the prince spoke for the first time about a stay at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan home five months after the convicted child sex offender left prison, a trip that included a party where the prince was \u201cguest of honour\u201d. But while he told Emily Maitlis the party \u201cwasn\u2019t quite as you put it\u201d and described Epstein\u2019s house as \u201ca convenient place to stay\u201d, some observers have asked why the prince could not have stayed elsewhere, why his stay lasted four days, and why he would attend such a dinner under any circumstances if he was bringing the relationship to an end. Others have also asked why, after stopping contact with Epstein in 2006 when he heard the financier was being investigated, the prince chose to re-establish contact in 2010 simply in order to say the relationship was over. What do the prince\u2019s claims, and the ongoing legal action in the US, mean for the FBI investigation and the potential involvement of UK authorities? As the FBI widens the scope of its investigation in an attempt to identify more of Epstein\u2019s victims, the prince\u2019s comments might attract even more attention to him. Alan Dershowitz, who defended Epstein on charges of sex trafficking, has said the prince would have no choice but to submit to questioning by US authorities should they decide to lodge a request. Scotland Yard has reportedly been briefed on the latest developments in the US, while Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection, has previously said it would be in the public interest for an investigation to take place after the Metropolitan police dropped an inquiry. Under what circumstances might he discuss the claims against him under oath? The prince said at the weekend he was prepared to testify under oath \u201cif push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so\u201d. Gloria Allred, the US lawyer acting for Epstein\u2019s victims, has called for the prince to answer questions under oath. She said: \u201cHe could just decide to appear and I think that would be the best action that he could take.\u201d How credible is the prince\u2019s claim that a condition caused by his Falklands War service left him unable to perspire? He was attempting to undermine Virginia Roberts\u2019 recollection that he was \u201cdripping with sweat\u201d after dancing with him in 2001 before the then 17-year-old allegedly had sex with him. But no sooner had the prince made the claim than a picture began circulating on social media showing him outside the nightclub Chinawhite in 2000, which some observers claimed appeared to show him sweating. Despite the prince\u2019s insistence that he always wears a suit and tie when going out in London, he is tieless and suitless in the photo. Anhidrosis is the inability to sweat normally. Causes include burns from radiation therapy, certain drugs, diabetes, alcoholism and hereditary issues. Why did he ignore a spin doctor\u2019s advice not to do the interview? It is not known why the prince believed the interview was a good idea and how it came to happen. Maitlis has said it went ahead after the Queen signed it off. Of potentially more significance is the departure of the prince\u2019s PR adviser, Jason Stein, who is understood to have left his post two weeks ago after telling the duke not to do the interview. With the prince now having invited potentially more scrutiny, as well as arguably having caused himself greater reputational damage, who will steady the ship at Buckingham Palace? How will he proceed with his \u2018Pitch@Palace\u2019 scheme from here? The prince has continued to travel the world, and attended a summit of south-east Asian leaders in Thailand this month as part of Pitch@Palace, the startup mentorship scheme he established and which hosts pitches by would-be entrepreneurs at Buckingham Palace. But the pressure on him could affect the way in which the scheme is viewed in the UK and elsewhere, not least by businesspeople, other agencies and businesses associated with it.

You could call some of these jokes first base, but I\u2019m not sure the one about his foreskin, or the one about people who smoke roll-up cigarettes being paedophiles, even get that far. There is a quip about a song on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/cbeebies\">CBeebies</a> show that\u2019s four parts setup to one part flatlining payoff; and there is an anecdote about soiling himself at Disneyland.</p> <p>But Beckett has a perky likability that\u2019s proof against duff jokes. There is blunt comedy to be found in the mix of unpretentiousness and south London lingo, such as when he imagines finding a coconut in an unexpected place: \u201cfuzzy bastard in me mixed nuts!\u201d A story about swimming in a Slovenian lake advertises his skills as a raconteur and gleeful self-satirist: the laughs are larded on as Beckett struggles to haul his tubby body out of the water and on to a pontoon.</p> <p>At the end the show trades in rudimentary humour \u2013 about Beckett\u2019s man boobs, for which he has many a lurid simile, and at the spectacle he makes of himself, with a slight sartorial adjustment, to close the show. It\u2019s more meat and potatoes than coq au vin, and intentionally so \u2013 but now and then, Beckett offers up something succulent to chew on.</p> <p>\u2022At <a href=\"https://www.robbeckettcomedy.com/\">Kings theatre, Glasgow</a>, on 19 November.

One odd routine \u2013 that lacks an ending \u2013 finds him fancying the drag queens in the musical Kinky Boots. In a later vivid anecdote, his family (\u201cI\u2019m related to some absolute fucking scum!\u201d) supply the ham at a friend\u2019s wedding. There\u2019s seldom anything interesting happening comedically. You could call some of these jokes first base, but I\u2019m not sure the one about his foreskin, or the one about people who smoke roll-up cigarettes being paedophiles, even get that far. There is a quip about a song on a CBeebies show that\u2019s four parts setup to one part flatlining payoff; and there is an anecdote about soiling himself at Disneyland. But Beckett has a perky likability that\u2019s proof against duff jokes. There is blunt comedy to be found in the mix of unpretentiousness and south London lingo, such as when he imagines finding a coconut in an unexpected place: \u201cfuzzy bastard in me mixed nuts!\u201d A story about swimming in a Slovenian lake advertises his skills as a raconteur and gleeful self-satirist: the laughs are larded on as Beckett struggles to haul his tubby body out of the water and on to a pontoon. At the end the show trades in rudimentary humour \u2013 about Beckett\u2019s man boobs, for which he has many a lurid simile, and at the spectacle he makes of himself, with a slight sartorial adjustment, to close the show. It\u2019s more meat and potatoes than coq au vin, and intentionally so \u2013 but now and then, Beckett offers up something succulent to chew on. \u2022At Kings theatre, Glasgow, on 19 November. Then touring.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 9am on a Monday morning in east London, and outside the wind and rain are crashing and bashing. Inside, a 31-year-old Australian chef called<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/19/josh-niland-knows-fish-here-are-his-top-tips-for-cooking-it-well\" title=\"\"> Josh Niland</a> paces the floor impatiently waiting for a fish to arrive. He\u2019s not especially picky what kind of fish it is, only that it is an excellent specimen, not much tampered with. But he knows that\u2019s a lot to ask: it\u2019s Monday after all, and the weekend\u2019s storms would have deterred all but the most intrepid boats from going out. So Niland has called in a favour and asked Nathan Outlaw, Britain\u2019s most celebrated fish chef, to source one for him from one of his contacts in Cornwall.</p> <p>Just before 10am, a hefty, elongated package is delivered and Niland unwraps it like a child. His eyes light up: it\u2019s a sea bass, around five kilos in weight. Its scales \u2013 its \u201carmour\u201d he calls it \u2013 are perfect, even the translucent webbing of the fins is completely intact, and its bright, bulbous eyes seem to follow you around the room. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people in London get a fish like this on Monday,\u201d says Niland. \u201cWe don\u2019t get a fish like this on Friday. But when you\u2019re the king of Cornwall\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Niland loves fish. He loves how difficult it is to prepare. He loves that most people find it very hard to cook. He loves that a lot of people have issues eating it, that they are put off by the smell, the texture or the notion that fish is somehow \u201cfeminine\u201d. He loves the fact that even people who do like fish would run a mile when presented with, say, head terrine or an appetiser made from fish eye balls. All of this makes his work more important, more vital. Since 2016, Niland has endeavoured to challenge all these convictions at his 34-seat Sydney restaurant, Saint Peter, and at his shop, Fish Butchery, a couple of doors down. For the rest of the world, he has his hyper-stylised Instagram account and he has now written the essential, enthralling <em>Whole Fish Cookbook</em>.</p> <p>Niland, who has boyish features and a whip of brown hair, slips on a pair of black latex gloves, which have become a signature. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit <em>Dexter</em>-y, when I\u2019ve got black gloves and 13 knives,\u201d he concedes. And for the next hour or so, he clinically \u201cbreaks down\u201d the sea bass, starting with taking long strips of scales, then turning his attention to the head, then lovingly disentangling the guts before, almost as an afterthought, preparing the fillets. It is estimated that only 43% of each fish and shellfish caught in the UK is eaten by humans; the bones, head and offal are either tossed away or ground into fishmeal. At Saint Peter and the Fish Butchery, Niland aims to use 90% in some form.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9f16d3788e0d851d1aca8ebe8b291a465125831\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9f16d3788e0d851d1aca8ebe8b291a465125831/0_780_2381_2379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Niland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Niland: \u2018Food was a comfort at a time when I was sick\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Palmer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a radical idea, but also an important one at a time when sustainability and waste are essential considerations in our food choices. And Niland has some inventive, funny and downright loopy suggestions for what you can cook. <em>The Whole Fish Cookbook</em> includes a recipe for a fish Kiev, with garlic butter spilling out of a King George whiting. There\u2019s a hot-smoked fish turducken, which Niland makes with a tuna loin inside cod inside a butterflied sea trout. There\u2019s also fish black pudding, swordfish bacon, guanciale made from fish cheeks and jowls and wild kingfish pastrami (with alternative fish suggestions if you are reliant on Atlantic waters). Desserts are not yet so advanced but a Saint Peter staple is the fish fat chocolate caramel slice.</p> <p>You might imagine Niland\u2019s offbeat approach to be divisive, but in fact the food world has formed a rare consensus. Jamie Oliver calls <em>The Whole Fish Cookbook</em> \u201ca mind-blowing masterpiece\u201d and threw a party for its publication in London in October; Nigella Lawson thinks Niland is \u201ca genius\u201d. There is praise too from the high chefs: both Noma\u2019s Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and Grant Achatz from Alinea in Chicago describe him as \u201cinspiring\u201d. Outlaw, who has devoted 20 years of his life to cooking fish, considers Niland nothing less than a game-changer. \u201cJosh has basically taken all the old ways of fish prep and cookery and thrown the bad ones out the window and turned what remains on its head,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Some of these testimonies are stamped on a blingy gold band across the cover of the book. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly aggressive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d smiles Niland.</p> <p>Niland\u2019s approach is often compared to that of Fergus Henderson, who pioneered \u201cnose-to-tail\u201d eating of pigs, sheep and cows when his restaurant St John opened in 1994. It\u2019s a hefty compliment, but Niland would like eventually to have a similar impact. \u201cYeah, I think the same thing could have been said for Fergus 25 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure back then there were plenty of avant-garde chefs taking the centre of the circle out of a fillet of beef and putting it with 12 different mushrooms and celebrating that in all its glory. Then Fergus comes along and unapologetically puts an oxtail on a plate with a fork in it, or a pipe of bone marrow with some toast next to it. It\u2019s not a middle finger to the system, but it\u2019s definitely, \u2018Don\u2019t forget there\u2019s all of this as well\u2026\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBecause if an animal gets killed, if a fish gets killed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/26/fin-to-gill-eating-cook-sustainably-heads-organs-bones\" title=\"\">you have to commit yourself to using the whole thing</a>,\u201d he goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, basic logic.\u201d</p> <p>If Niland comes across as driven, even evangelical, there\u2019s a reason. Two days after his eighth birthday, his mother noticed a lump under his ribcage. It was a childhood cancer known as Wilms\u2019 tumour and it was growing fast. \u201cToday is 14 October, so tomorrow it will be 23 years ago I had cancer,\u201d he recalls when we meet. \u201cI had to have my right kidney taken out, I had radiotherapy, I had 18 months of chemotherapy, and as a young man that was pretty scary. And relevant to who I am now, I feel that was a big rocket pack on my back at a very young age to think: \u2018Well, alright, everything can go sideways very quickly, so if I want anything I am going to go and get it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Niland grew up in Maitland, a couple of hours\u2019 drive north of Sydney in the Hunter Valley. His father had an accountancy business and his mother helped out with administrative duties. As a family, they were not especially interested in food, and certainly not fish; Niland recalls being traumatised as a child when his sister almost choked on a fish bone. But that gradually started to change as he recovered from cancer.</p> <p>\u201cFood was a comfort at a time when I was sick, food was very much something to look forward to as a treat,\u201d says Niland. \u201cI started really becoming infatuated with cooking when I was 13 or 14 and I had the opportunity to buy ingredients with Mum at the grocery store and cook a meal for everyone at home and see them actually really enjoy what they were eating. I loved the level of generosity there is in producing food.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The fish shop that has fillets of fish draped over ice is just the most ludicrous thing ever</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Niland left school as soon as he could and, rocket pack on, he moved to Sydney and started \u201ccherry-picking\u201d the skills he would need to open his own restaurant one day. An especially influential placement was two stints at Fish Face. There, chef Stephen Hodges was obsessive about the handling of fish, convinced that any contact with water should be minimised. Partly this was for the taste \u2013 it\u2019s much harder to get the skin on wet fish to crisp \u2013 but mainly it was for longevity. Wet fish, both Hodges and Niland believe, typically has more bacteria and will also spoil more quickly.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like the fish shop that has fillets of fish draped over ice is just the most ludicrous thing ever,\u201d says Niland. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t understand why someone is standing with a fire hose and re-spritzes the fish to make it look wet, because somehow that makes it feel more like its fresh and it\u2019s out of the water. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d</p> <p>The other formative experience was spending three months, aged 22,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/23/the-fat-duck-flies-again-heston-blumenthal\" title=\"\"> in the development kitchen at the Fat Duck.</a> When Niland arrived and was told he would be working on the <em>Heston Blumenthal at Home </em>cookbook, he wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cCall it the 22-year-old ego, but I thought that was the worst thing in the world,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you serious? I\u2019ve just flown all this way and now I\u2019m going to do a domestic cookbook?\u2019 I wanted to cook snail porridge and bacon and egg ice-cream.\u201d</p> <p>As it was, the Fat Duck\u2019s granular approach to ingredients and methodology made Niland rethink everything he thought he knew about cooking. Each Thursday, Blumenthal would set him tasks for the week, which might be learning how to poach an egg correctly or finding out why a lemon tart cracks. The next week he\u2019d report back. \u201cThey literally question everything,\u201d says Niland. \u201cNothing is too stupid to ask.\u201d The benefits of this experience can be now be found in the most playful parts of Saint Peter\u2019s menu, such as the dish that looks like a jelly doughnut but is actually smoked eel with beetroot jam. (As an aside, Niland has also recently adopted Blumenthal\u2019s dictum that all men in his kitchen should be clean shaven.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fc93e652fc37307869903e617d6e49aa0aadf38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc93e652fc37307869903e617d6e49aa0aadf38/859_2491_4815_6019/800.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Niland\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Niland: \u2018if a fish gets killed, you have to commit to using the whole thing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Palmer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since opening Saint Peter, Niland\u2019s own experimentation is going deeper and deeper. He has become passionate about dry-ageing: keeping fish in a low-temperature, low-moisture environment to find its \u201csweet spot\u201d. He continues to probe which species it works best with (Spanish mackerel, tuna, swordfish) and how far he can push it (around 20 days seems to be the maximum). He\u2019s also thought harder than almost anyone, at least in western cooking, to find uses for fish offal. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to master the gall bladder,\u201d he says, looking pained.</p> <p>But where, for some, Niland has pushed it too far is in the name of his shop. \u201cI copped a lot of emails and messages \u2013 and continue to do so \u2013 about how silly it is and how you shouldn\u2019t call a fish shop a butchery, it\u2019s a monger,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m like, \u2018Anything you can do to an animal, let\u2019s do to a fish.\u2019 Like, it\u2019ll work, whether it\u2019s a swordfish that looks like a T-bone or a cutlet of sea bass with a little polished French bone, or a beautiful butterflied red mullet that\u2019s got crumbs on it.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, you might be wondering if any of his findings are of use for even the most adventurous domestic cook. What\u2019s one thing we can do to improve the taste of fish at home? \u201cJust take the fish out of the plastic, out of the paper, and put it on a cake rack in your refrigerator,\u201d he says. \u201cLet the fan blow over it for a bit, so the skin dries out and when it comes time for cooking, whether you are baking, roasting, pan-frying, you\u2019ll find the skin is just far more pleasant to cook with rather than just being really wet. And you\u2019ll find your fish won\u2019t have nearly as much odour.\u201d</p> <p>Niland clearly wants to change the world, or at least how fish is sold, and how we eat it at home and in restaurants. It\u2019s not going to be easy and you sense he knows that. Although he comes across as highly focused and single-minded, a strange thing happened when he signed the lease for Saint Peter in 2016: it should have been the happiest day of his life, the result of 14 years\u2019 hard work, but suddenly he was overcome.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, I threw up in a bin in my solicitor\u2019s office, because I couldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019d just done,\u201d remembers Niland. \u201cAll throughout my cooking I wanted my own restaurant, but I didn\u2019t know it would come in the form of me personally signing things that would make me very heavily, personally responsible for the success or failure of the business. So, it all just became this wave of unwellness at once.\u201d</p> <p>Niland stops, perhaps reflecting on the impact he\u2019s had in just three years, and then deadpans: \u201cBut it turned out OK.\u201d</p> <h2>Crumbed sardine sandwich</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6173ce4111f2c81c4c6f2fc4af07b9e896e7e386\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6173ce4111f2c81c4c6f2fc4af07b9e896e7e386/0_506_5397_6747/800.jpg\" alt=\"Crumbed Sardine Sandwich Josh Niland The Whole Fish Cookbook\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Who doesn\u2019t love a crumbed fish sandwich on soft white bread? It\u2019s important to fry the sardines in ghee in a pan rather than deep-frying, as the flavour is much better and the cooking is easier to control. Yogurt tartare sauce (see recipe below) could be substituted with a hot sauce or mayonnaise, if you like. This sandwich is so versatile and a number of different fish work perfectly here, including herring, whiting or anchovies.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 2</strong></em><br><em><strong>For the sardine sandwich</strong></em><br><strong>plain </strong><strong>flour</strong> 150g <br><strong>eggs</strong> 4, lightly whisked<br><strong>white panko breadcrumbs</strong> 120g <br><strong>sardines</strong> 8 x 60g, scaled, gutted and butterflied<br><strong>ghee</strong> 70g<br><strong>sea salt flakes and freshly cracked black pepper</strong><br><strong>soft white bread</strong> 4 slices <br><strong>yog</strong><strong>urt tartare sauce</strong> 100g (see below)</p> <p><em><strong>For the yog</strong></em><em><strong>urt tartare sauce (makes enough for several servings)</strong></em><br><strong>natural yog</strong><strong>urt</strong> 375g <br><strong>French shallots</strong> 3 large, diced<br><strong>small salted capers</strong> 1 tbsp, rinsed, dried and finely chopped<br><strong>cornichons</strong> 60g, coarsely chopped <br><strong>flat-leaf </strong><strong>parsley leaves</strong> 2 tbsp, finely sliced</p> <p>To make the yogurt tartare sauce, stir all the ingredients together in a bowl.</p> <p>To make the sandwich, start by flouring, egg-washing and crumbing the butterflied sardines, being sure to leave the tails of the fish uncrumbed.</p> <p>Heat the ghee in a frying pan over a high heat and cook the crumbed sardines, in batches, on one side for 1 minute, or until golden and crisp, then the other side for a further 10-20 seconds.

Outlaw, who has devoted 20 years of his life to cooking fish, considers Niland nothing less than a game-changer. \u201cJosh has basically taken all the old ways of fish prep and cookery and thrown the bad ones out the window and turned what remains on its head,\u201d he says. Some of these testimonies are stamped on a blingy gold band across the cover of the book. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly aggressive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d smiles Niland. Niland\u2019s approach is often compared to that of Fergus Henderson, who pioneered \u201cnose-to-tail\u201d eating of pigs, sheep and cows when his restaurant St John opened in 1994. It\u2019s a hefty compliment, but Niland would like eventually to have a similar impact. \u201cYeah, I think the same thing could have been said for Fergus 25 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure back then there were plenty of avant-garde chefs taking the centre of the circle out of a fillet of beef and putting it with 12 different mushrooms and celebrating that in all its glory. Then Fergus comes along and unapologetically puts an oxtail on a plate with a fork in it, or a pipe of bone marrow with some toast next to it. It\u2019s not a middle finger to the system, but it\u2019s definitely, \u2018Don\u2019t forget there\u2019s all of this as well\u2026\u2019 \u201cBecause if an animal gets killed, if a fish gets killed, you have to commit yourself to using the whole thing,\u201d he goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, basic logic.\u201d If Niland comes across as driven, even evangelical, there\u2019s a reason. Two days after his eighth birthday, his mother noticed a lump under his ribcage. It was a childhood cancer known as Wilms\u2019 tumour and it was growing fast. \u201cToday is 14 October, so tomorrow it will be 23 years ago I had cancer,\u201d he recalls when we meet. \u201cI had to have my right kidney taken out, I had radiotherapy, I had 18 months of chemotherapy, and as a young man that was pretty scary. And relevant to who I am now, I feel that was a big rocket pack on my back at a very young age to think: \u2018Well, alright, everything can go sideways very quickly, so if I want anything I am going to go and get it.\u2019\u201d Niland grew up in Maitland, a couple of hours\u2019 drive north of Sydney in the Hunter Valley. His father had an accountancy business and his mother helped out with administrative duties. As a family, they were not especially interested in food, and certainly not fish; Niland recalls being traumatised as a child when his sister almost choked on a fish bone. But that gradually started to change as he recovered from cancer. \u201cFood was a comfort at a time when I was sick, food was very much something to look forward to as a treat,\u201d says Niland. \u201cI started really becoming infatuated with cooking when I was 13 or 14 and I had the opportunity to buy ingredients with Mum at the grocery store and cook a meal for everyone at home and see them actually really enjoy what they were eating. I loved the level of generosity there is in producing food.\u201d Niland left school as soon as he could and, rocket pack on, he moved to Sydney and started \u201ccherry-picking\u201d the skills he would need to open his own restaurant one day. An especially influential placement was two stints at Fish Face. There, chef Stephen Hodges was obsessive about the handling of fish, convinced that any contact with water should be minimised. Partly this was for the taste \u2013 it\u2019s much harder to get the skin on wet fish to crisp \u2013 but mainly it was for longevity. Wet fish, both Hodges and Niland believe, typically has more bacteria and will also spoil more quickly. \u201cI feel like the fish shop that has fillets of fish draped over ice is just the most ludicrous thing ever,\u201d says Niland. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t understand why someone is standing with a fire hose and re-spritzes the fish to make it look wet, because somehow that makes it feel more like its fresh and it\u2019s out of the water. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d The other formative experience was spending three months, aged 22, in the development kitchen at the Fat Duck. When Niland arrived and was told he would be working on the Heston Blumenthal at Home cookbook, he wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cCall it the 22-year-old ego, but I thought that was the worst thing in the world,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you serious? I\u2019ve just flown all this way and now I\u2019m going to do a domestic cookbook?\u2019 I wanted to cook snail porridge and bacon and egg ice-cream.\u201d As it was, the Fat Duck\u2019s granular approach to ingredients and methodology made Niland rethink everything he thought he knew about cooking. Each Thursday, Blumenthal would set him tasks for the week, which might be learning how to poach an egg correctly or finding out why a lemon tart cracks. The next week he\u2019d report back. \u201cThey literally question everything,\u201d says Niland. \u201cNothing is too stupid to ask.\u201d The benefits of this experience can be now be found in the most playful parts of Saint Peter\u2019s menu, such as the dish that looks like a jelly doughnut but is actually smoked eel with beetroot jam. (As an aside, Niland has also recently adopted Blumenthal\u2019s dictum that all men in his kitchen should be clean shaven.) Since opening Saint Peter, Niland\u2019s own experimentation is going deeper and deeper. He has become passionate about dry-ageing: keeping fish in a low-temperature, low-moisture environment to find its \u201csweet spot\u201d. He continues to probe which species it works best with (Spanish mackerel, tuna, swordfish) and how far he can push it (around 20 days seems to be the maximum). He\u2019s also thought harder than almost anyone, at least in western cooking, to find uses for fish offal. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to master the gall bladder,\u201d he says, looking pained. But where, for some, Niland has pushed it too far is in the name of his shop. \u201cI copped a lot of emails and messages \u2013 and continue to do so \u2013 about how silly it is and how you shouldn\u2019t call a fish shop a butchery, it\u2019s a monger,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m like, \u2018Anything you can do to an animal, let\u2019s do to a fish.\u2019 Like, it\u2019ll work, whether it\u2019s a swordfish that looks like a T-bone or a cutlet of sea bass with a little polished French bone, or a beautiful butterflied red mullet that\u2019s got crumbs on it.\u201d At this point, you might be wondering if any of his findings are of use for even the most adventurous domestic cook. What\u2019s one thing we can do to improve the taste of fish at home? \u201cJust take the fish out of the plastic, out of the paper, and put it on a cake rack in your refrigerator,\u201d he says. \u201cLet the fan blow over it for a bit, so the skin dries out and when it comes time for cooking, whether you are baking, roasting, pan-frying, you\u2019ll find the skin is just far more pleasant to cook with rather than just being really wet. And you\u2019ll find your fish won\u2019t have nearly as much odour.\u201d Niland clearly wants to change the world, or at least how fish is sold, and how we eat it at home and in restaurants. It\u2019s not going to be easy and you sense he knows that. Although he comes across as highly focused and single-minded, a strange thing happened when he signed the lease for Saint Peter in 2016: it should have been the happiest day of his life, the result of 14 years\u2019 hard work, but suddenly he was overcome. \u201cHonestly, I threw up in a bin in my solicitor\u2019s office, because I couldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019d just done,\u201d remembers Niland. \u201cAll throughout my cooking I wanted my own restaurant, but I didn\u2019t know it would come in the form of me personally signing things that would make me very heavily, personally responsible for the success or failure of the business. So, it all just became this wave of unwellness at once.\u201d Niland stops, perhaps reflecting on the impact he\u2019s had in just three years, and then deadpans: \u201cBut it turned out OK.\u201d Crumbed sardine sandwich Who doesn\u2019t love a crumbed fish sandwich on soft white bread? It\u2019s important to fry the sardines in ghee in a pan rather than deep-frying, as the flavour is much better and the cooking is easier to control. Yogurt tartare sauce (see recipe below) could be substituted with a hot sauce or mayonnaise, if you like. This sandwich is so versatile and a number of different fish work perfectly here, including herring, whiting or anchovies. Serves 2 For the sardine sandwich plain flour 150g eggs 4, lightly whisked white panko breadcrumbs 120g sardines 8 x 60g, scaled, gutted and butterflied ghee 70g sea salt flakes and freshly cracked black pepper soft white bread 4 slices yogurt tartare sauce 100g (see below) For the yogurt tartare sauce (makes enough for several servings) natural yogurt 375g French shallots 3 large, diced small salted capers 1 tbsp, rinsed, dried and finely chopped cornichons 60g, coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves 2 tbsp, finely sliced To make the yogurt tartare sauce, stir all the ingredients together in a bowl. To make the sandwich, start by flouring, egg-washing and crumbing the butterflied sardines, being sure to leave the tails of the fish uncrumbed. Heat the ghee in a frying pan over a high heat and cook the crumbed sardines, in batches, on one side for 1 minute, or until golden and crisp, then the other side for a further 10-20 seconds. Remove from the pan and season liberally. Cut the crusts off the bread. Spread some of the tartare sauce over two slices from edge to edge, then arrange four sardines on top. Add the remaining sauce and the remaining slices of bread. Serve with the golden edges of the sardines showing and the little tails exposed at one end.

Set two years after we first met the German-American clan (in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/19/benjamin-markovits-weekend-in-new-york-review\" title=\"\">A Weekend in New York</a>, </em>2018)<em>,</em> resentment and yearning prove hard to hide despite the festivities. Naturally, the novel is glutted with scenes of eating and drinking, but much recent upheaval needs digesting too. Susie is reconsidering an imminent family move to Oxford to support her husband\u2019s career, Nathan is pondering the moral purpose of becoming a federal judge and Jean is worried about introducing her boyfriend (and former boss) whose cancer remission spurred his decision to abandon his family. Yet retired professional tennis player Paul faces the most piquant dilemma because of a recent split from girlfriend Dana (<em>A Weekend in New York </em>centred upon how Paul\u2019s participation in the US Open exacerbated their rift). In the hopes of a reconciliation, matriarch Leisel has also invited Dana and her and Paul\u2019s four-year-old, Cal, but will such a contentious gamble pay off?</p> <p>Divided simply into sections that cover each day of this week-long get-together, the storytelling is a torrent of complicated behavioural minutiae: \u201cThis is how the morning wore on \u2013 family as information-producing machine\u2026 decision-requiring machine\u2026 argument-creating machine\u2026\u201d Yet the family drama is surpassed in ambition by the narration itself as it flits from the mind of one character to the next with a quicksilver ease.</p> <p>Critic David Lodge contends that embodying consciousness \u201cfrom the inside\u201d is the towering achievement of the novel.

      "bodyText": "In Christmas in Austin, novelist Benjamin Markovits rejoins the four Essinger siblings for a yuletide gathering at their parents\u2019 house in Texas. Set two years after we first met the German-American clan (in A Weekend in New York, 2018), resentment and yearning prove hard to hide despite the festivities. Naturally, the novel is glutted with scenes of eating and drinking, but much recent upheaval needs digesting too. Susie is reconsidering an imminent family move to Oxford to support her husband\u2019s career, Nathan is pondering the moral purpose of becoming a federal judge and Jean is worried about introducing her boyfriend (and former boss) whose cancer remission spurred his decision to abandon his family. Yet retired professional tennis player Paul faces the most piquant dilemma because of a recent split from girlfriend Dana (A Weekend in New York centred upon how Paul\u2019s participation in the US Open exacerbated their rift). In the hopes of a reconciliation, matriarch Leisel has also invited Dana and her and Paul\u2019s four-year-old, Cal, but will such a contentious gamble pay off? Divided simply into sections that cover each day of this week-long get-together, the storytelling is a torrent of complicated behavioural minutiae: \u201cThis is how the morning wore on \u2013 family as information-producing machine\u2026 decision-requiring machine\u2026 argument-creating machine\u2026\u201d Yet the family drama is surpassed in ambition by the narration itself as it flits from the mind of one character to the next with a quicksilver ease. Critic David Lodge contends that embodying consciousness \u201cfrom the inside\u201d is the towering achievement of the novel. Pivoting between the internal reactions of this family throng, Markovits pushes the free indirect style as far as it can go, perhaps further, given how some value judgments tumble into a strange no-man\u2019s land. The reader occasionally grapples with the epistemological uncertainty of whether to attribute a specific verdict to one of the characters or even the author: \u201cJean, who was sensitive to this kind of awkwardness, and good-hearted\u2026\u201d Plot is also curiously overshadowed: the question of Paul\u2019s marriage cannot gain much traction when Markovits is intent on ploughing up every lurking doubt. In its protean perspective on family dynamics, Christmas in Austin is a bravura feat, but the plethora of incidental detail sometimes makes it come across less like a novel than a live documentary feed: \u201cDana woke up, a little after five, when Jean used the bathroom.\u201d Momentous events do occur \u2013 loved ones die and relationships collapse \u2013 but their consequences are subsumed into the open-ended dramatic irresolution.

(Before dating Harding, Evans went out, for 10 years, with Welsh musician <a href=\"http://www.catelebon.com/\" title=\"\">Cate Le Bon</a>; the two women share band members these days, which must make arranging tours interesting.) But Harding doesn\u2019t know what the local scene\u2019s like, she says \u2013 just as she didn\u2019t in New Zealand: \u201cI spend\u2026 too much time\u2026 in my own head.\u201d</p> <p>She talks very slowly, deliberately, precisely. She\u2019s learning Welsh, she adds (she says it in the Welsh language, word by word, thinking her way through the sentence). \u201cI\u2019m very interested in how things sound. The details. Yes.\u201d</p> <p>Born in 1990, Harding began life as Hannah Sian Topp. Harding is her stepfather\u2019s surname; he married her Canadian folk singer and puppeteer mum, Lorina, when Hannah was a teenager. A question about her stepfather\u2019s influence on her life, which she has mentioned elsewhere, is rebuffed, as are others; she doesn\u2019t like to answer questions \u201cif I don\u2019t feel like the answer\u2019s going to come out in a natural, musical way\u201d.</p> <p>Her mother remains a huge part of her life. She was the martial arts master twirling sticks in the video to Harding\u2019s breakthrough 2017 single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4dVkoOMjLo\" title=\"\">Horizon</a>; her daughter appears in the video wearing black, eyes red-rimmed, possibly reaching out to her mother (although, as always with Harding\u2019s lyrics, the clues suggesting this are undone by other riddles and red herrings).</p> <p>A clip from 2009 is also online, of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgposeecVso\" title=\"\">Harding singing with her mother</a> in a Wellington bar. The song, Exactly What to Say, is one they co-wrote about a typically fraught mother-teenage daughter relationship. \u201cYou think that I don\u2019t listen, that I don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d Lorina sings, tenderly, \u201cbut the things that happened to me back then/ I don\u2019t want them to happen to you.\u201d Harding duets, a ponytailed, hoodie-wearing 19-year-old, singing towards the floor about wanting to learn from her own mistakes. Aldous arrived a few years later. \u201cThe name Hannah Harding sounded so much like a country singer. And Aldous\u2026\u201d She gurns. \u201cIt may have been me seeing an Aldous Huxley book, but there was no deep association. I just thought it was interesting and looked good written down. And I just slipped into her and didn\u2019t look back, as corny as that sounds.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00bec6e5d0fb47e4b6fb34144f646be59f648a4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00bec6e5d0fb47e4b6fb34144f646be59f648a4d/0_371_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldous Harding at Concorde 2 in Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Like a cross between Kristin Hersh and PJ Harvey: Aldous Harding at Concorde 2 in Brighton last May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harding hints at darker moments during her early 20s: times when she was \u201cdrinking too much\u201d and when things felt overwhelming; early interviews mention her taking acid at church and the songs on her eponymous debut are full of cries for help. That album certainly begins joltingly, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmJ-ft4Ig\" title=\"\">Stop Your Tears</a>, which she sang then like a long-lost, broken folk singer. \u201cI will never marry, my love,\u201d it begins. \u201cI will die waiting for the bells/ Death, come pull me under water/ I have nothing left to fear from hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been, like a lot of people, driven by fear,\u201d Harding says of that time. \u201cAlways focusing on the fire on the rope, as opposed to what the rope is coming from.\u201d She feels she\u2019s changing now. And by 2017\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/21/aldous-harding-party-review\" title=\"\">Party</a></em> (which documented her break-up with New Zealand singer-songwriter Marlon Williams, albeit abstractly), Aldous was getting bolder. Her performance of Horizon on <em>Later\u2026 With Jools </em><em>Holland</em> saw her wild-eyed, gesticulating theatrically, practically spitting into the camera. \u201cIt felt as if someone was like, \u2018Can I have a bite of you?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Have it all, then. Is that what you want?\u2019 And then, that feeling just went on and on.\u201d She was pleasantly surprised people responded to her, she says, \u201cbut also I wasn\u2019t surprised\u201d.</p> <p>Then came bolder artistic choices. In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHR3uEOkkSo\" title=\"\">video to </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHR3uEOkkSo\" title=\"\">Blend (2017)</a>, she dances in turquoise hotpants and bra, the camera objectifying her body as she glares at the viewer (comments on her YouTube page are, wisely, switched off). I recognised this as an outfit inspired by the Playboy Bunny scene from <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, I say, and she suddenly beams like a child. \u201cDo you love <em>Apocalypse Now</em>? I took to that film like a child with a toy! I felt like it was speaking to me and only me. It was like a puzzle. And a comfort.\u201d</p> <p>Why a comfort? Maybe it was the presence of Kurtz at the end of the river, she suggests. \u201cThe idea they were moving towards dread.\u201d And that was a comfort? \u201cYes! Do you ever have dread? Do you ever look at your life and go, \u2018Oh, God, there\u2019s so much more time to go!\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m the opposite, I say \u2013 worried about life going too fast.</p> <p>\u201cBut are you open? I\u2019m all, \u2018Oh, my God, there\u2019s so many hours in the day. So many years in my life left.\u201d She says later: \u201cThere are very few things in the world that make me feel a feeling, really.\u201d</p> <p>We discuss music that\u2019s made her feel things. Meat Loaf, she says: \u201cI love how the poetry and the strength of his voice made up for how ridiculous it was.\u201d Neil Young: \u201cIf I\u2019m feeling confused, I always listen to him, and go, \u2018That\u2019s how things should sound. In the sense that it\u2019s music that leaves me hopelessly baffled by his intentions, his secrets.\u201d She was also a huge fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/27/guardianobituaries.carolinesullivan\" title=\"\">Lisa \u201cLeft</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/27/guardianobituaries.carolinesullivan\" title=\"\"> Eye\u201d Lope</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/27/guardianobituaries.carolinesullivan\" title=\"\">s</a> from TLC. \u201cShe was so weird, so strange and so cute, but she was not vulnerable. I also realised I dance the way I do because of her: the arms up, the hips forward.\u201d She shows me, jutting out her chin.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgposeecVso\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bgposeecVso?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/bgposeecVso\">Watch Harding\u2019s duet with her mother in a bar in Wellington</a>. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Her recent album,<strong> </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/28/aldous-harding-designer-review\" title=\"\">Designer</a></em>, also has a foot twisting gently in the realm of pop, although its catchy songs still have wrigglier, murkier lyrical roots. Take the sweet guitar-pop of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEyFSww7GD4\" title=\"\">The Barrel</a>, full of puzzling phrases such as \u201cshow the ferret to the egg\u201d and more emotional ones, such as \u201cwhen you have a child, so begins the braiding/ And in that braid you stay\u201d. Her ever-changing voice also leads the mood of the songs: gently heavenly on Weight of the Planets, sadly stern on Heaven Is Empty. On the title track, Harding sings the lyric \u201cgive up your beauty\u201d with relish.</p> <p>She has never tried to make art that\u2019s arresting, she says. \u201cAll I ever wanted to do was to do something interesting.\u201d But she will admit that she\u2019s \u201ctrying to work out what\u2019s missing in music. I\u2019m trying to hold your focus as an unremarkable person trying to do something remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>And she\u2019s doing this while there\u2019s an aversion in her generation to admitting that you\u2019re even trying, she says. Why does she think this? \u201cBecause there is so much to lose. It\u2019s like when people go to acting school and someone will say, \u2018Now, I want you to scream at the top of your lungs\u2019 and they don\u2019t want to. They don\u2019t want to watch themselves fail.\u201d Fail at what? Harding\u2019s look lingers in my head long after I leave. \u201cFail at what is basically being human.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.aldousharding.com/\" title=\"\">Aldous Harding</a> tours the UK and </em><em>Ireland</em><em> from 29 November (at the O2 Institute </em><em>Birmingham</em><em>) to 7 December (at O2 Academy Bristol)</em></p>",

The song, Exactly What to Say, is one they co-wrote about a typically fraught mother-teenage daughter relationship. \u201cYou think that I don\u2019t listen, that I don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d Lorina sings, tenderly, \u201cbut the things that happened to me back then/ I don\u2019t want them to happen to you.\u201d Harding duets, a ponytailed, hoodie-wearing 19-year-old, singing towards the floor about wanting to learn from her own mistakes. Aldous arrived a few years later. \u201cThe name Hannah Harding sounded so much like a country singer. And Aldous\u2026\u201d She gurns. \u201cIt may have been me seeing an Aldous Huxley book, but there was no deep association. I just thought it was interesting and looked good written down. And I just slipped into her and didn\u2019t look back, as corny as that sounds.\u201d Harding hints at darker moments during her early 20s: times when she was \u201cdrinking too much\u201d and when things felt overwhelming; early interviews mention her taking acid at church and the songs on her eponymous debut are full of cries for help. That album certainly begins joltingly, with Stop Your Tears, which she sang then like a long-lost, broken folk singer. \u201cI will never marry, my love,\u201d it begins. \u201cI will die waiting for the bells/ Death, come pull me under water/ I have nothing left to fear from hell.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always been, like a lot of people, driven by fear,\u201d Harding says of that time. \u201cAlways focusing on the fire on the rope, as opposed to what the rope is coming from.\u201d She feels she\u2019s changing now. And by 2017\u2019s Party (which documented her break-up with New Zealand singer-songwriter Marlon Williams, albeit abstractly), Aldous was getting bolder. Her performance of Horizon on Later\u2026 With Jools Holland saw her wild-eyed, gesticulating theatrically, practically spitting into the camera. \u201cIt felt as if someone was like, \u2018Can I have a bite of you?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Have it all, then. Is that what you want?\u2019 And then, that feeling just went on and on.\u201d She was pleasantly surprised people responded to her, she says, \u201cbut also I wasn\u2019t surprised\u201d. Then came bolder artistic choices. In the video to Blend (2017), she dances in turquoise hotpants and bra, the camera objectifying her body as she glares at the viewer (comments on her YouTube page are, wisely, switched off). I recognised this as an outfit inspired by the Playboy Bunny scene from Apocalypse Now, I say, and she suddenly beams like a child. \u201cDo you love Apocalypse Now? I took to that film like a child with a toy! I felt like it was speaking to me and only me. It was like a puzzle. And a comfort.\u201d Why a comfort? Maybe it was the presence of Kurtz at the end of the river, she suggests. \u201cThe idea they were moving towards dread.\u201d And that was a comfort? \u201cYes! Do you ever have dread? Do you ever look at your life and go, \u2018Oh, God, there\u2019s so much more time to go!\u2019?\u201d I\u2019m the opposite, I say \u2013 worried about life going too fast. \u201cBut are you open? I\u2019m all, \u2018Oh, my God, there\u2019s so many hours in the day. So many years in my life left.\u201d She says later: \u201cThere are very few things in the world that make me feel a feeling, really.\u201d We discuss music that\u2019s made her feel things. Meat Loaf, she says: \u201cI love how the poetry and the strength of his voice made up for how ridiculous it was.\u201d Neil Young: \u201cIf I\u2019m feeling confused, I always listen to him, and go, \u2018That\u2019s how things should sound. In the sense that it\u2019s music that leaves me hopelessly baffled by his intentions, his secrets.\u201d She was also a huge fan of Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopes from TLC. \u201cShe was so weird, so strange and so cute, but she was not vulnerable. I also realised I dance the way I do because of her: the arms up, the hips forward.\u201d She shows me, jutting out her chin. Her recent album, Designer, also has a foot twisting gently in the realm of pop, although its catchy songs still have wrigglier, murkier lyrical roots. Take the sweet guitar-pop of The Barrel, full of puzzling phrases such as \u201cshow the ferret to the egg\u201d and more emotional ones, such as \u201cwhen you have a child, so begins the braiding/ And in that braid you stay\u201d. Her ever-changing voice also leads the mood of the songs: gently heavenly on Weight of the Planets, sadly stern on Heaven Is Empty. On the title track, Harding sings the lyric \u201cgive up your beauty\u201d with relish. She has never tried to make art that\u2019s arresting, she says. \u201cAll I ever wanted to do was to do something interesting.\u201d But she will admit that she\u2019s \u201ctrying to work out what\u2019s missing in music. I\u2019m trying to hold your focus as an unremarkable person trying to do something remarkable.\u201d And she\u2019s doing this while there\u2019s an aversion in her generation to admitting that you\u2019re even trying, she says. Why does she think this? \u201cBecause there is so much to lose. It\u2019s like when people go to acting school and someone will say, \u2018Now, I want you to scream at the top of your lungs\u2019 and they don\u2019t want to. They don\u2019t want to watch themselves fail.\u201d Fail at what? Harding\u2019s look lingers in my head long after I leave. \u201cFail at what is basically being human.\u201d Aldous Harding tours the UK and Ireland from 29 November (at the O2 Institute Birmingham) to 7 December (at O2 Academy Bristol)",

      "bodyText": "The value of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil giant has fallen below the $2tn target set by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after a tepid response from international investors to its stock market flotation. Saudi Aramco will sell up to 1.5% of the world\u2019s most profitable company at between 30 riyal and 32 riyal a share (around 600-610p per share) through its market debut, it announced on Sunday. This would value the company at between $1.6tn and $1.7tn. The listing on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul exchange is expected early next month and aims to raise between $24bn-$25.6bn (\u00a330.1bn-\u00a333bn) from investors in the Middle East to help reform the Saudi economy. Aramco will reveal the final price of its shares, and its valuation, by early next month although has yet to announce a date when its shares will begin to trade. The IPO was initially expected to be the largest market debut of any company, offering up to 5% of the company on both the Tadawul and an exchange in one of the world\u2019s largest financial centres. But after a series of delays to the listing, Aramco\u2019s IPO will offer a far smaller stake, mainly to investors in the Middle East, and may fall short of the $25bn raised by Chinese online retailer Alibaba\u2019s record debut in 2014. Aramco has scrapped plans to market the float to US investors in favour of a careful focus on Middle Eastern institutional investors and ultra-high net worth individuals in the region where the company is confident of support. Around 0.5% has been earmarked for Saudi retail investors, who have been promised tax cuts and a $75bn-a-year minimum dividend. Aramco is also courting investors in China and Russia to drum up investor support. But in meetings held with other international banks and hedge funds Aramco has reportedly faced a cooler reception, amid scepticism over its $2tn valuation.

Investors are also concerned about the company\u2019s close ties to the Saudi state, which has a worrying track record of human rights abuses, and its contribution to the global climate crisis. International banks have come under fire from green groups for undermining global efforts to tackle the climate crisis by supporting the Aramco listing. The banks hired to work on its market debut include Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.

As one of the few working-class British actors making a living in Hollywood, Oldman\u2019s portrayal of Winston Churchill \u2013 an eccentric English aristocrat \u2013 was worthy of the praise it received. However, it should not be forgotten that the film contained a number of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180328-did-darkest-hour-get-much-right\" title=\"\">historical fabrications</a> and uncritically glorified a man who, if alive today, would almost certainly be reviled for his <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html\" title=\"\">racist views</a>.

Calculated to appeal to sophisticated filmgoers, it followed a tested industry formula: produce a heroic depiction of a \u201cgreat Briton\u201d played by a beloved (usually posh) British actor, set in a romanticised old England, and watch the awards roll in. Nowadays all it seems an actor must do to warrant an Oscar nomination is portray a supposedly \u201cgreat Briton\u201d \u2013 think Judi Dench (Mrs Brown), Helen Mirren (The Queen), Colin Firth (The King\u2019s Speech), and Olivia Colman (The Favourite).</p> <p>Aside from making elites feel good about themselves, the British public laps these films up.

Inama Vigneto du Lot Soave Classico Italy 2016 (\u00a327, or \u00a324.30 as part of a mix six, majestic.co.uk) Soave doesn\u2019t have the best reputation, but its best producers make some of Italy\u2019s finest dry whites. Inama is one such, and this single-vineyard garganega, with its glossy texture and flavours of orchard fruit, almonds and macerated herbs, is a beauty.

Salicornia Reserva D\u00e3o, Portugal 2016 (\u00a36.99, Aldi) Somewhat overshadowed by the big reds and ports of the neighbouring Douro Valley, the red wines of the D\u00e3o can be every bit as good, with, in this case, a satisfying mix of savoury-meatiness, floral fragrance and plum and cherry fruit. Journey\u2019s End Kendal Lodge Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot/Cabernet Franc Stellenbosch, South Africa 2018 (\u00a38, Marks &amp; Spencer) A Cape claret blend of three Bordeaux varieties, this is an excellent value option for the big day roast, with a savoury character beneath the blackcurrant fruit and red berries, some pleasingly crunchy tannins and eucalyptus-infused freshness. Taste the Difference B\u00edo B\u00edo Chilean Pinot Noir Chile 2018 (\u00a38, Sainsbury\u2019s) The relative cool of the B\u00edo B\u00edo Valley in southern Chile has made it one of the country\u2019s best places for making pinot noir, and this is a very attractive example, with turkey-friendly red berries and currants and a hint of peppery spice. Pepp Blauer Zweigelt Weinvertel, Austria 2018 (\u00a38.50, thewinesociety.com) Austria\u2019s zweigelt often reminds me of youthful, fruit-driven styles of Rh\u00f4ne syrah, and this one has that region\u2019s combination of peppery notes and freshly picked blackberries. An exuberant red to liven up the post-Boxing Day coldcuts. Tesco Finest Saint-Chinian France 2017/2018 (\u00a39, Tesco) Always one of the best wines in Tesco\u2019s finest collection, both the 2018 (in stores from December) and the 2017 vintage of this Languedoc red blend offer a keen mix of dark blackberry fruit with plenty of rosemary herb and peppery spice. CVNE Roble Ribera del Duero, Spain 2018 (\u00a310, Morrisons) From one of the most consistent producers in Rioja, CVNE, this is a fine example of the tempranillo grape variety (or tinta del pa\u00eds is it\u2019s known locally). With minimal oak influence, it\u2019s an exuberant showcase of dark and juicy mulberry fruit succulence. Star buy: Famille Perrin Les Cardinaux C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages 2017 (\u00a310, reduced to \u00a37 from 11 Dec-2 Jan, the Co-op) La Famille Perrin is a rare wine company capable of scaling up their operation from boutique fine wines to high-production supermarket fare without sacrificing flavour or soul: this deep, spicy Ch\u00e2teauneuf-lite is a steal on the offer price.

Boschis Pianezzo Dolcetto di Dogliani Piedmont, Italy 2017 (\u00a317.95, philglas-swiggot.com; tannico.co.uk) Francesco Boschis takes dolcetto, generally regarded as the simplest of Piedmont\u2019s red wines, to a whole new level of lovely: unoaked, the pianezzo is explosively fruity and pure pleasure, with creamy black and red cherries. Domaine du Vieux Pressoir Les Silices Saumur Rouge France 2018 (\u00a318, redsquirrelwine.com) This is Loire cabernet franc at its purest: fragrant, silky and sappy, it\u2019s filled with summer berries and currants, unencumbered by oaky flavours (it\u2019s made in concrete rather than oak barrels), and a wonderful alternative to pricy bordeaux. Le Volte dell\u2019Ornellaia Tuscany, Italy 2016 (from \u00a319.99 Majestic, Noel Young, Hedonism Wine, Armit) A spin-off wine from Tenuta Ornellaia, one of the original big-name Super Tuscan producers in coastal Bolgheri, this is a wonderfully deep and stylishly polished blend of Bordeaux and Tuscan varieties with a slick of delicious dark fruit. Reds over \u00a320 Lemelson Thea\u2019s Selection Willamette Valley Pinot Noir Oregon, USA 2015 (\u00a321, The Wine Society) Oregon is now making some of the world\u2019s finest pinot noir, and this shows off the Pacific North West\u2019s answer to Burgundy at its most elegant and seductive, all perfectly captured red and black fruit, lacy tannins and great, refreshing length. Domaine de Fa Fleurie Beaujolais, France 2016 (\u00a322, yapp.co.uk) The Graillot family are synonymous with Crozes-Hermitage in the Rh\u00f4ne, but Maxime and Antoine\u2019s Beaujolais operation is making some stunning wines, too, with this fleurie a lithe, lipsmacking mix of pretty red fruit and subtle earthiness. Star buy Nin-Ortiz Planetes Priorat, Spain 2015 (from \u00a338, vincognito.co.uk; bottleapostle.com) Priorat is known for its ruggedly powerful reds based on old-vine garnacha and cari\u00f1ena, but here the impressive depth of dark fruit is tempered beautifully with a swirl of sweet spice, lavender, olives and the region\u2019s famous mineral zing. Cantina del Pino Barbaresco Albesani Piedmont, Italy 2015 (from \u00a343.80, laywheeler.com; stannarywine.com) If you\u2019re looking to buy the wine-lover in your life a present for laying down for years but which is drinkable now, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find better value than the complex, ethereal woodland scents and snare drum-brush texture of this exquisite nebbiolo. Sparkling wines Taste the Difference Pignoletto DOC Spumante Brut Emilia-Romagna, Italy NV (\u00a39, Sainsbury\u2019s) Very much operating in the same stylistic camp as prosecco, but coming from vineyards further south between Modena and Bolgona, this is a super-clean and pretty example of pignoletto with an easy-drinking, any-time-of day lightness and charm. Les Caves des Hautes C\u00f4tes Cr\u00e9mant de Bourgogne Burgundy, France 2017 (\u00a310, Marks &amp; Spencer) The cr\u00e9mants made in various French regions have improved massively in recent years, with Burgundy among the places making high-class, but cut-price champagne-alikes, such as this toasty, creamy, but fruity and balanced number. La Gioiosa Prosecco Superiore Millesimato Valdobbiadene Veneto, Italy 2018 (\u00a313.49, down to \u00a38.99 from 4 Dec-2 Jan 2020, Waitrose) On the Christmas offer price, this is excellent value for a textbook vivacious prosecco. With that classic blend of frivolous, icing sugar foam, pear juiciness and easy citrus freshness, it works as solo-aperitif and Spritz or Bellini base. Star buy: Hunter\u2019s Offshoot Sauvignon Blanc Pet Nat Marlborough, New Zealand 2019 (\u00a314.95, jeroboams.co.uk) Bottled while the wine is still fermenting \u00e0 la bottle-conditioned ale, and throwing up a cloudy sediment, this is a brilliantly made example of the p\u00e9tillant naturel style of fizz, with tang and zip and so much ripe fresh stone fruit-flavour. Casa Belfi Vino Bianco Biologico Frizzante Veneto, Italy 2017 (\u00a316.80, lescaves.co.uk) The winemaking methods mean this can\u2019t be called prosecco (it\u2019s unfiltered and with the second fermentation happening in bottle, rather than a tank). But its traditional, cloudy style is a riot of floral, savoury-yeasty, pithy citrus and appley flavour. Raventos i Blanc Blanc de Blancs Brut Conca del Riu Anoia, Spain 2016 (\u00a319.95, bbr.com) The Raventos family has dropped the cava name in favour of their local appellation, but they make some of the finest fizz in Catalonia, including this poised, refreshing blend of the traditional three cava varieties, with its appetisingly bitter finish. Devaux Oeil de Perdrix Ros\u00e9 Champagne France NV (\u00a324.99, or \u00a319.99 as part of a mix six, majestic.co.uk) Devaux\u2019s old favourite ros\u00e9 champagne is on really good form at the moment, and if you like a bit of colour and a red-fruit cast to your fizz, with a swirl of redcurrant and raspberry and satisfyingly creamy mousse, few are better value. Hattingley Valley Reserve Hampshire, England NV (\u00a329, Tesco) A quintessential modern English fizz from the talented winemaker Emma Rice, Hattingley\u2019s refined Hampshire-built house cuv\u00e9e mixes classic tingling raciness and fresh red apple fruitiness with an impressive depth of baker\u2019s shop richness. Domaine Pierre Gerbais Cuv\u00e9e R\u00e9serve Champagne, France NV (from \u00a330.95, thewhiskyexchange.com; josephbarneswines.com) A small family-owned producer based in the far south of Champagne, Domaine Pierre Gerbais makes wines of scintillating purity and mineral refreshment, with this a rare cuvee in the region that mixes pinot blanc with the chardonnay and pinot noir. Champagne Alfred Gratien Brut Champagne, France NV (\u00a339.50, greatwesternwine.co.uk) There are better-known champagne houses than Alfred Gratien, but few offer the consistency (or year-in-year-out value) of its non-vintage blend, which matches buttered-toast and tangy apple compote richness with a moreish rapier steeliness.",

In 2001, shortly after finishing his football career at Fulham (with Keegan) and then Charleroi, he took up work as a greengrocer at a fruit and vegetable company, where he would work until 2012. \u201cI would prepare the produce for customers. I did it for 11 years and didn\u2019t touch the money I earned in my football career. Up early, finishing late, that\u2019s what I wanted: a normal life. I\u2019m very proud of it. Otherwise when you stop football, you do nothing. You have no life.\u201d These days, alongside some TV punditry work in Belgium, he keeps busy by mucking out horses and preparing the stables for his wife\u2019s equestrian business. He seems happy and fulfilled. Albert\u2019s house near Charleroi, coincidentally where Keegan\u2019s England side played during Euro 2000, is full of Newcastle memorabilia: an aerial shot of St James\u2019 Park is the centrepiece of his living room, a small figurine of him wearing the black and white kit stands alongside family photos in the hall. There are plenty of winner\u2019s medals on show, though none from his time with Newcastle. One defeat, the 4-0 defeat by Manchester United in the 1996 Charity Shield, sticks out for Albert. \u201cWe were outplayed, hammered,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe had come back from Thailand and Japan in pre-season and honestly we were very tired. Some of their players like Roy Keane were professional and said nothing but some of the younger ones, they were taking the mickey, ridiculing us. \u201cIn the dressing room afterwards Keegan said nothing. But when they came to St James\u2019 Park later that year, Kevin just gave out the team sheet and said: \u2018Remember Wembley.\u2019 That was enough: we went out there and won 5-0.\u201d That result, and particularly Albert\u2019s audacious dink over Peter Schmeichel for Newcastle\u2019s fifth goal, remains arguably the best single moment of that era for Newcastle fans. And moments like that matter, especially if there is no trophy to celebrate. \u201cIt was a good goal,\u201d says Albert, smiling. \u201cAfter the match Keegan went around the dressing room shaking hands with everybody. He was delighted. We were given the next day off.\u201d",

She was in the heart transplant ward, and there were assessors coming to the house and reassessing her benefits. After she died, I found letters where she was arguing with people about not being able to get proper social care. It\u2019s a very common story.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1f3b4c7d81ad45d3e5367fe11ea5b0baf84d38ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f3b4c7d81ad45d3e5367fe11ea5b0baf84d38ef/23_36_750_958/391.jpg\" alt=\"Observer New Review cover art\" width=\"391\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cover artwork for the Observer New Review, where this article was published in print.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boxing Cover</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Jeremy Corbyn took over as Labour leader, Shaheen felt as if she had no home in any political party. She had studied PPE at Oxford, where the economics being taught struck her as \u201ccold and individualistic\u201d, and went on to do a PhD on economic inequality at Manchester.</p> <p>After working at thinktanks including the New Economics Foundation, she took over the <a href=\"http://classonline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Labour and Social Studies</a> in 2015. Two years later, a space opened up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever have a political hook for the ideas we were working on, but there it was in Labour\u2019s manifesto.\u201d</p> <p>She is keenly aware of the problems that need to be addressed in her constituency. \u201cOur local school here in Highams Park had a \u00a31.8m cut under the Conservatives, equivalent to 17 teachers. The local hospital in Whipps Cross needs proper redevelopment, and better infrastructure around that in terms of social care. In south Chingford, the more working-class part, the public transport is really bad. I know exactly how it feels, getting on that bus and it taking forever to get to Walthamstow Central.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21c672118b8a29924ffa44bd07666f15e4966fd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21c672118b8a29924ffa44bd07666f15e4966fd4/136_84_3224_2014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faiza Shaheen in her constituency office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faiza Shaheen photographed in her constituency office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It can be hard, though, to keep the focus on local matters. In the cafe, a young mother on the table next to us tells Shaheen that she would love to vote for her but doesn\u2019t want Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Moments later, she interrupts Shaheen to ask what she thinks about Brexit.</p> <p>Shaheen acknowledges the conflicts raging around both questions, but argues that the most important thing to focus on is booting the Tories out \u2013 a challenge which, locally, was helped last week when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/green-candidate-steps-aside-as-labour-targets-tory-held-chingford\" title=\"\">the Green party candidate stepped aside</a> to encourage tactical voting.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to spend all my time on the doorstep talking about Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d Shaheen says. \u201cI need to make the case as to why they should vote for me.\u201d The focus, she adds, should be on the policies, not individual personalities, \u201cand those are policies and principles that I couldn\u2019t be prouder of.\u201d</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/07/labour-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">antisemitism within the Labour party</a>, she says: \u201cWe didn\u2019t deal with it fast enough. I\u2019m not going lie and act like prejudices have somehow gone away from the party. Unfortunately there are people that are going to say awful things, and they need to be dealt with quickly. But it did highlight to me how an organisation needs to deal with institutional prejudice, because Labour is not the only one: there are very few institutions that are good at doing that.\u201d</p> <p>As for Brexit, which Shaheen considers \u201can epic waste of time\u201d, the question does come up, she says. \u201cBut to be honest, on the doorsteps, the things that people mostly want to talk about are the cuts to the schools and hospitals.\u201d</p> <p>Does she feel optimistic about her chances, and the next few years?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the best of times and the worst of times. When I see hundreds of volunteers turning up to our office, it just makes my heart buzz and I think, we can do this. But if the country votes for a Boris Johnson majority\u2026\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have five years to waste on the climate, on education, on the NHS\u2026 So I get moments of severe anxiety about what\u2019s going to happen if they win. But we need to block out the negativity. We need to get IDS out on 12 December. Let\u2019s keep focused on that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s your political hero?</strong><br>Nelson Mandela or Muhammad Ali. From an early age I was told that, when you see an injustice, you fight for what\u2019s right, no matter the consequences. And because I experienced racism at a really young age, I found an affinity with people like Mandela and Ali who were fighting racism.</p> <p><strong>Where do you get your news?</strong><br>A combination of what\u2019s trending on Twitter, and the <em>Financial Times</em> and the <em>Guardian</em>. I don\u2019t always agree with everything in the <em>FT</em>, but they put things in a very factual way, and I appreciate that. The<em> New York Times</em> as well, just to get a sense of what\u2019s going on in the world. Facebook is a problem for all kinds of reasons, but I\u2019ve got quite a lot of friends who are activists in different parts of the world and their Facebook posts have become trusted sources to me. I do listen to the <em>Today</em> programme on Radio 4 for a bit in the morning, just to get a sense of how they\u2019re framing things, but it drives me nuts and I always shout at the radio.</p> <p><strong>One thing you always take with you when doorstep campaigning</strong><br>There\u2019s a leaflet that\u2019s a bit old now that has a picture of me with my two old teachers, Mr Osborne and Mr Mahir, and I think people really connect with that. And it always makes me smile. They really encouraged me and saw potential in me and are just such an important part of my story.</p> <p><strong>How do you get away from politics?</strong><br>I watch Netflix. I\u2019m rewatching <em>Glee</em>. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/killianfox\">Killian Fox</a></strong> </p> <h2>John Finucane (Sinn F\u00e9in) v Nigel Dodds (DUP)</h2> <p><strong>North Belfast</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7f0813170edabf4225e1ff0ea42278955cc25dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7f0813170edabf4225e1ff0ea42278955cc25dc/0_143_7187_4766/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Finucane in Belfast City Hall in Northern Ireland. Picture By: Arthur Allison/ Pacemaker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Finucane photographed in Belfast City Hall, Northern Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Allison / Pacemaker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt obviously had a very defining influence on me,\u201d says John Finucane, the current lord mayor of Belfast, who is standing for Sinn F\u00e9in in North Belfast against Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s parliamentary leader. He is talking about the death of his father, who was murdered by the Ulster Defence Association, in collusion with the British security services, in February 1989. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/pat-finucane\" title=\"\">Pat Finucane</a> was eating a Sunday meal when two masked gunmen broke in and opened fire, shooting the human rights lawyer 14 times in front of his family, including John, who was eight at the time.</p> <p>What followed was a 30-year quest for justice, in which the family sought to clear Finucane\u2019s name (he was accused of being an IRA member) and to prove that the British state had colluded in the killing. David Cameron <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/12/pat-finucane-report-david-cameron-apologises\" title=\"\">apologised to the family</a> in 2012 but a full public inquiry has never been granted. \u201cIt exposed me to the very worst of politics,\u201d says Finucane, \u201cbut also the best of politics. It showed me that when people come together and work towards a common goal, progress can be achieved.\u201d</p> <p>Finucane went on to become a lawyer in Belfast, like his father, but moved into politics in 2017, when he made his first attempt to unseat Dodds. The bid wasn\u2019t successful, but he won Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s best ever result in North Belfast, closing the gap to just over 2,000 votes, which, he says, \u201cmade people see that what was once a very safe unionist seat is no longer safe\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Finucane, who is 39, ran for Belfast city council and was elected lord mayor in May. He believes his diverse background \u2013 his father was a Catholic from the Falls Road, his mother, Geraldine, a middle-class Protestant from east Belfast \u2013 makes him an ideal candidate to represent this still-divided city. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable in my political skin, with speaking and engaging with unionists and loyalists,\u201d he says, describing himself as \u201cmayor for all\u201d.</p> <p>If this election is to be defined by Brexit, that, Finucane believes, will give him an advantage in North Belfast, where the remain vote was marginally stronger in 2016. \u201cThe brand of politics that Nigel Dodds represents belongs in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have watched the DUP\u2019s destructive pact with the Tories and their clear attacks on the Good Friday agreement \u2013 not to mention the threat to our economy, to our rural and farming communities, and the way of life that we\u2019ve enjoyed since 1998.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For me to become an MP in a constituency where my father was killed would be exceptionally significant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By contrast, Finucane is pitching himself as a candidate of the future. \u201cI see a city that is progressive and forward-looking, that enjoys its European status and the rights that come with being in Europe. We want to make sure that our peace process is protected at all costs.\u201d</p> <p>To achieve this, he is comfortable with Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s decision to stand down in constituencies where rival candidates have a better chance of defeating the DUP. \u201cI think that\u2019s common sense; it\u2019s reacting to what voters want,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the DUP return with the same strength and hold the balance of power, then I think we are looking at a very dark future for our children, for our economy.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from the Brexit fallout, Finucane wants to tackle urgent social problems in North Belfast such as \u201chousing, mental health, suicide, dependency on prescription drugs\u201d. In this, he does not discriminate between communities. \u201cLoyalism has been failed in North Belfast as well. There are people in the loyalist areas who go to the food banks, just as people on the other side of the peace wall do. They don\u2019t have academic achievement to the level that they should, they don\u2019t have people going into jobs or traineeships. These are all problems that need to be addressed.\u201d</p> <p>Since Finucane stepped into politics, the past has echoed around him in unsettling ways. \u201cI\u2019ve had death threats,\u201d he says. \u201cRecently banners went up [on the Shankhill Road] trying to associate me with a very violent past \u2013 a reminder that there are those in our society who wish to drag us back.\u201d Some of the reaction \u201chas probably worried and upset my mum,\u201d he admits, \u201cand I have to advise my kids to be careful at times\u201d, but otherwise his family has been \u201cfairly relaxed and very supportive\u201d of his bid, and he insists he is undeterred.</p> <p>If Finucane does win, it will, he says, open a positive new chapter in a traumatic family history. \u201cIt would be exceptionally significant,\u201d he says, \u201cin a constituency where my father lived and was killed, as a result of collusion with the state, that his son then goes on to become an MP.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s your political hero?</strong><br>Martin McGuinness. I don\u2019t think there would be a peace process without him. He showed tremendous leadership, specifically forming that relationship with Ian Paisley, which people would not have thought possible. He was committed to delivering political solutions to everybody in society here and it\u2019s a shame that wasn\u2019t reciprocated.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a favourite political pundit?</strong><br>Brian Feeney, a columnist for the <em>Irish News</em> and a former SDLP councillor, is very astute. He\u2019s good at analysing current situations and seeing what\u2019s coming down the line.</p> <p><strong>One thing you always take with you when doorstep campaigning?</strong><br>Pen and paper, because invariably there are some issues raised, and when you\u2019re going round so many doors you need to make sure that you have a good note of them, so you can come back later and chase them up. <strong>KF</strong></p> <h2>Ali Milani (Labour) v Boris Johnson (Conservative)</h2> <p><strong>Uxbridge and South Ruislip</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7359090f18291a31d3d7cba11a77112955863ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7359090f18291a31d3d7cba11a77112955863ad/161_158_3058_2041/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Milani photographed in Uxbridge near his home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Milani photographed in Uxbridge near his home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBoris territory,\u201d says a man as the underground train pulls into Uxbridge, an imposing, modernist station with Ervin Boss\u00e1nyi stained-glass panels over the exit. Outside, in the high street, the safe-seat-for-incumbent-Tory-PM vibe continues: there are two huge, glass-fronted shopping malls, lots of flat whites and no boarded-up betting shops.</p> <p>But appearances can deceive. At the 2017 election, Boris Johnson\u2019s majority in west London\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/hes-got-a-battle-on-his-hands-could-uxbridge-unseat-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">cleaved in half</a> to just 5,034. No sitting prime minister has ever lost their seat, but the constituency is now rated \u201cvulnerable\u201d by Onward, the conservative thinktank, and it\u2019s on Labour\u2019s want-to-win list. \u201cSo it\u2019s, objectively, a marginal seat,\u201d says Ali Milani, the 25-year-old Labour candidate, with an almost giddy grin.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s headache in this area, Milani argues, is down to the three Hs: \u201cthe hospital, housing, Heathrow.\u201d The hospital is Hillingdon, the buildings of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/boris-johnson-drawn-into-row-over-unsafe-hillingdon-hospital\" title=\"\">have been described</a> by a senior NHS figure as \u201cthe worst of any hospital in London\u201d. But it is the plans for a third runway at Heathrow that offer Johnson\u2019s opponents a ready stick to swing at him. When he was elected in 2015, Johnson swore to constituents that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/25/boris-johnson-criticised-over-decision-to-miss-crunch-heathrow-expansion-vote\" title=\"\">\u201clie down with you in front of those bulldozers\u201d</a>. But in June this year, he dropped his opposition, stating he\u2019d \u201cchanged his view\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe country is finding out what this constituency has known for a really long time: this guy will say or do anything to get elected,\u201d says Milani when we meet at his small flat on the outskirts of Uxbridge. \u201cWe knew this guy was a charlatan and now the rest of the country\u2019s discovering it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnson will say or do anything to get elected. He\u2019s a charlatan, and now the country\u2019s discovering it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Milani is relishing the fight\u2013 he calls it \u201cBoris versus Ali\u201d, making it sound like an epic boxing match in the 1970s, not a clash for votes in suburbia. Every chance he has, he points out how different his world is from Johnson\u2019s. Milani is a Muslim and moved aged five to Wembley, north London, from Iran. He went to Brunel University, which is in Uxbridge, and was student union president as well as vice-president of the National Union of Students.</p> <p>Milani says he is a natural fit for the area, someone \u201cwho\u2019s local, who has worked here, studied here, had surgery in the local hospital, grew up on a council estate with a single mum \u2013 that connects with people\u201d.</p> <p>There is a problem, though: Uxbridge and South Ruislip voted 57% to leave the EU; Milani, who campaigned for remain, says he would do so again if there were a second vote. \u201cIt\u2019s getting it done with Labour as well, it\u2019s just getting it done in a different way,\u201d he insists. \u201cBut you\u2019d be surprised at how little Brexit comes up on the doorstep here. Honest to God. OK, since the European elections much more. But before then, I had it come up three times between November and May. You\u2019d think Brexit would come up at about 50% of the doors now, but way less: 15% or 20%.\u201d</p> <p>Milani has taken flack for antisemitic tweets he wrote when he was 16 and 17. He has apologised, and does so again this morning, a day when Jacob Rees-Mogg is being criticised for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense\" title=\"\">comments about the Grenfell </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense\" title=\"\">victims</a>. Rees-Mogg has also backtracked \u2013 does Milani think he should be forgiven, too? \u201cI wasn\u2019t a cabinet minister when I made the comments, I was a teenager,\u201d says Milani. Does he think Labour has done enough to root out antisemitism? \u201cSo as long as there\u2019s Jewish voices saying we haven\u2019t done enough, we haven\u2019t,\u201d he replies.</p> <p>In his flat, surrounded by ephemera from DC Comics, Milani clearly believes he can create \u201ca political earthquake\u201d. He glances over at his books, films and figurines of the Flash, Wonder Woman and Superman. \u201cMy friends take the piss,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThey\u2019re like: \u2018When you\u2019re talking to the press, can you please take this stuff down!\u2019 But there is just something about pure optimism, pure hope, and the good guy beating the bad guy that I think is worth holding on to.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s your political hero?</strong><br>I had a philosophy teacher at high school and college who nudged me in the direction of politics. He was amazing and pulled us back from engaging in conspiracy theories and things like that.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s one thing you always take with you when you go doorstep campaigning?</strong><br>A spatula so you can put a leaflet through a letterbox without getting your finger bitten by a dog. It happened to two of my activists and it\u2019s scared all of us into buying them!</p> <p><strong>What do you do to get away from politics?</strong><br>Football. Watching Manchester United is the only thing where for 90 minutes my brain doesn\u2019t think about politics and the campaign. It\u2019s often just as miserable with United these days, so I\u2019m not saying it lifts me up with joy, but it\u2019s about being able to disconnect from politics. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timlewis\">Tim Lewis</a></strong></p> <h2>Nicola Horlick (Liberal Democrat) v Greg Hands (Conservative)</h2> <p><strong>Chelsea and Fulham</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bd35fc71875579443a05c0678e41fdf7bba2ec6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bd35fc71875579443a05c0678e41fdf7bba2ec6/825_584_5400_3585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Horlick photographed in a Fulham pub before a meeting of Lib Dem volunteers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Horlick photographed in a Fulham pub before a meeting of Lib Dem volunteers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is, in my view, the most important general election of my lifetime,\u201d says Nicola Horlick in the conference room of a co-working space in Hammersmith, west London. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really old now.\u201d</p> <p>Horlick, who is 58 and best-known as a high-profile fund manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/sep/25/genderissues.theobserver\" title=\"\">aka \u201csuperwoman\u201d,</a> aka \u201cthe woman who had it all\u201d, has had a whirlwind political career. She applied to stand for the Liberal Democrats in early September and was approved as a candidate two weeks later. A couple of days after that, Horlick was told that she had been selected to contest the Chelsea and Fulham constituency, a safe Conservative seat since it was created in 2010 and just across the Thames from where she lives in Barnes. Last time out, Greg Hands, formerly chief secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron and a minister in the Department for International Trade under Theresa May, won 52% of the vote. The Liberal Democrat candidate in 2017 polled just 11%.</p> <p>Some people would be daunted by such statistics, but Horlick has made a career of defying outsized odds. Aged 28, she became the youngest director of Warburg investment bank. At Morgan Grenfell, part of Deutsche Bank, she grew assets from \u00a34bn to \u00a318bn in five years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have very, very strong views about what needs to be done to fix the NHS</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Horlick juggled her career with having six children, one of whom, Georgie, died from leukaemia in 1998 at the age of 12. \u201cI\u2019m a hugely competitive person as you may have gathered,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be defeated easily. Can you imagine? It would be a historic victory.\u201d</p> <p>Horlick\u2019s optimism comes from a single issue: Brexit. In the 2016 referendum, her constituents voted 70% for remain. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for people who have been lifelong Conservatives to contemplate voting Liberal Democrat, I understand that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not asking them to become members of the Lib Dems and vote the rest of their lives with us. I\u2019m asking them to lend me their vote on this one occasion, because this is a quasi-referendum. And these people are remainers, strong remainers. They were the people on the march on 19 October and still have their placard sitting in their front entrance halls.\u201d</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats\u2019 forthright position against Brexit is playing well on the doorsteps of west London, says Horlick. She is also emboldened by private polling that indicates the party has overtaken Labour and is now \u201cwithin touching distance\u201d of Hands.</p> <p>Although Hands campaigned for remain in the referendum \u2013 he has a German wife, bilingual children and speaks five languages \u2013 he has voted in support of proposals from both May and Boris Johnson to push Brexit through. Horlick clearly considers the Tory candidate to be vulnerable.</p> <p>Brexit dominates the conversation with Horlick, but she insists she is equally passionate about education, the environment and especially the NHS. Her daughter Georgie was treated for almost a decade by the NHS, mostly at Great Ormond Street, and Horlick has since become a non-executive director at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. She would quite fancy being health secretary one day. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced the NHS as the mother of a patient,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced it as a board member. And I have very, very strong views about what needs to be done to fix it.\u201d</p> <p>But before that, there\u2019s the small matter of unseating Hands and overturning his 8,188 majority. \u201cWe\u2019re already close,\u201d she says, with a smile of pure mischief. </p> <p><strong>Who is your political hero?</strong><br>In the Liberal party, Jo Grimond [leader from 1956-1967]. I met him a few times because my father was involved with the party and he was a great leader and a great guy.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s one thing you always take with you when you go doorstep campaigning?</strong><br>My rosette and my mobile phone because the electoral register is on our phones. It\u2019s got very hi-tech these days.</p> <p><strong>What do you do to get away from politics?</strong><br>I\u2019ve only just come into it! I\u2019m not sure I want to get away from it just at this moment.

On 2 September, the consultant neurologist from Hagley in the West Midlands went on Nick Ferrari\u2019s radio show on LBC and <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/special-shows/ring-rees-mogg/jacob-rees-mogg-rows-with-doctor-no-deal-brexit/\" title=\"\">asked Jacob Rees-Mogg</a>, a guest on the programme: \u201cWhat level of mortality rate are you willing to accept in the light of a no-deal Brexit?\u201d</p> <p>Nicholl had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/22/secret-cabinet-office-document-reveals-chaotic-planning-for-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">helped draw up contingency plans</a> for the supply of epilepsy and neuropathic drugs in the event of no deal, but he was so concerned about what he saw as the government\u2019s lack of engagement on the issue, which he believed could lead to the deaths of patients, that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqnUpi8dFcc\" title=\"\">he went on </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqnUpi8dFcc\" title=\"\">Newsnight</a></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqnUpi8dFcc\" title=\"\"> in April</a> to sound the alarm. When he posed his question on LBC, however, Rees-Mogg dismissed it as \u201cthe worst excess of Project Fear\u201d. Three days later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/rees-mogg-condemned-for-comparing-doctor-to-disgraced-anti-vaxxer-autism\" title=\"\">Rees-Mogg told the House of Commons</a> that Nicholl was as irresponsible as the disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield.</p> <p>\u201cGenuinely, I was speechless,\u201d says the 54-year-old, when we meet on the day of his Lib Dem campaign launch in Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire, where he is seeking to unseat the chancellor Sajid Javid. Nicholl, who was born in Northern Ireland but has lived most of his adult life in the West Midlands, has a cheerfully pugnacious manner, and on 5 September his speechlessness didn\u2019t last long. That afternoon, he stood outside Westminster with a megaphone and challenged Jacob Rees-Mogg \u201cto come out of the House of Commons and repeat what he said in public. If he does,\u201d he warned, \u201cI will sue.\u201d</p> <p>A few hours later, after widespread criticism, Rees-Mogg apologised. Nicholl accepted the apology, but the experience galvanised him. He had recently joined the Lib Dems, having quit Labour in 2018 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/owen-smith-sacked-from-labour-party-frontbench\" title=\"\">Owen Smith was sacked from the frontbench</a> for calling for a people\u2019s vote, and in October he announced his decision to stand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The choice here is between a politician who will flip-flop and\u00a0someone with a record of standing up and being counted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The odds are not with him \u2013 the Lib Dems took just 4.6% of the vote in Bromsgrove in the last election, compared to Javid\u2019s 62% \u2013 but Nicholl is not one to dodge a fight. After the Iraq war, he spent more than a decade campaigning on behalf of British prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, concluding with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/shaker-aamer-eat-drink-flight-us-authorities-spike-food\" title=\"\">the release of Shaker Aamer</a> in 2015. He has also campaigned for the NHS and, closer to home, against the closure of a gym at his local school.</p> <p>Nicholl\u2019s bete noire is Brexit, which he calls \u201ccompletely toxic\u201d, but he insists it\u2019s not his only focus. \u201cObviously the NHS is a big issue,\u201d he says, \u201cand I think the Lib Dems have got fairly sensible policies on the NHS \u2013 and on the climate emergency too.\u201d He also cites local issues such as the need for a bypass on the congested A38 and related concerns about air pollution.</p> <p>If he wins, Nicholl believes his experience as a neurologist will help amid the morass of Brexit \u2013 \u201cbecause you\u2019re used to dealing with complex situations and family dynamics. It\u2019s pretty stressful, and you\u2019ve got to try and come to a balanced view.\u201d</p> <p>But his focus is on defeating Javid. \u201cThe choice here is between a politician who will flip-flop according to whatever the direction the wind is blowing\u201d \u2013 he cites Javid\u2019s shifting stance on the proroguing of parliament, as well as Britain\u2019s EU membership \u2013 \u201cand someone who has a track record of standing up and being counted, even at risk to himself, and doing the right thing.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How do you get away from politics?</strong><br>My wife would probably say I don\u2019t.

The seat, created in 2010, was won by the former army officer Johnny Mercer for the Tories in 2015. He held it in 2017.</p> <p>The daughter of a former NHS nurse, Holloway is a grammar school girl who went to Cambridge and then worked on economic policy with a variety of businesses. She is the mother of a one-year-old girl and decided to seek the Labour nomination after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/31/theresa-may-clear-unfathomable-finds-deflated-newshound\" title=\"\">the 2017 election</a>. \u201cWhat I was hearing on the doorstep,\u201d she says, \u201cwas that the Tory government wasn\u2019t working for people in their day-to-day lives and yet the Tories increased their majority. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/21/labour-succeed-nationally-think-locally-plymouth\" title=\"\">I knew we had to do better to reconnect with people here.</a>\u201d</p> <p>She takes me for a cup of tea in a cafe adjoining a chip shop, in the heart of her constituency, and tells me what she has that will make the difference - roots. \u201cPeople connect with the fact that I was born and raised in Plymouth and I live here.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnny Mercer has never voted against the government, He's voted for every cut that's affected Plymouth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She and Keith Moore, a local volunteer and Momentum member who drives her around, explain that Plymouth is a city that feels cut off from the rest of the country. The motorway only goes as far as Exeter, which Plymothians see as rather leafy and genteel. On the way to the cafe, we pass through areas of social deprivation that have been revamped, they tell me, by the Labour council. </p> <p>What does she think of Mercer, the former army officer who was appointed by Boris Johnson as a junior minister in the Ministry of Defence?\u201cHe\u2019s called me \u2018not decent\u2019, \u2018a clown\u2019 and just last week \u2018the second biggest joke in Plymouth politics\u2019. When he does this, his supporters pile in. and often use misogynist language.</p> <p>\u201cPeople round here don\u2019t like that he self-styled as an independent when he was first elected. His record shows that he\u2019s never voted against the government. He\u2019s voted for every cut that\u2019s affected Plymouth. We\u2019re losing \u00a32m a week in Plymouth city council as a result of cuts in the government grant.\u201d</p> <p>She notes that Mercer is not from Plymouth. \u201cAnd for a lot of people to be rooted in the communities that you represent is really important. Many people feel that Plymouth is a bit of a pit-stop for him on route from his home somewhere in Cornwall. Also people are not particularly pleased that he thought it OK to take a second job. He relied a lot on his personal brand, but in just a few years he\u2019s shown that he\u2019s a careerist.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s all very well but the election is a national one and it\u2019s been called because of the impasse over an international issue \u2013 namely our relationship to the EU. Plymouth Moor View voted 67% to leave in the referendum. Is she having trouble getting across Labour\u2019s complex Brexit policy on the doorstep?</p> <p>Holloway\u2019s message to them is that within six months of being elected, a Labour government will negotiate a better Brexit deal than Boris Johnson\u2019s. What would it involve? A customs union? \u201cWe would have a new deal that would be a better deal, which we\u2019d then put to the country to see if they like it.\u201d</p> <p>Would she like it? \u201cI\u2019d have to see what it looked like. It would have to be a very high bar to be a better deal than remaining in the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>The other big issue she has to contend with is the Labour leader, whose leadership qualities have received some historically low polling results.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be honest, Jeremy is not people\u2019s favourite cup of tea,\u201d she says. She says she counters disapproval on the doorstep by telling constituents that Corbyn, the former chair of the Stop the War Coalition, supported the campaign to protect HMS Bulwark and HMS Albion \u2013 two Royal Navy assault-class ships based at Devonport \u2013 from proposed cuts. Anyway, she says, Plymothians are more concerned about cuts to the police, problems seeing a GP and under-investment in education.</p> <p>Holloway says she really enjoys campaigning, but in the post-Jo Cox era of politics, as opinions continue to polarise, the threat of physical attack is hard to ignore. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to come to terms with,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong>Who is your political hero?</strong><br>Keir Hardie.</p> <p><strong>Who is your favourite political pundit?</strong><br>I\u2019m not saying I always agree with either of them, but I\u2019m a big fan of Ash Sarkar and Ayesha Hazarika.

      "bodyText": "Faiza Shaheen (Labour) v Iain Duncan Smith (Conservative) Chingford and Woodford Green \u201cIt feels very personal to me,\u201d says Faiza Shaheen of her decision to stand for Labour in Chingford and Woodford Green, in north-east London. For one \u2013 unlike the incumbent Iain Duncan Smith, who lives in a mansion in Buckinghamshire \u2013 Shaheen grew up in the area, raised in north Chingford by parents from Fiji and Pakistan, and she lives not far from the quiet cafe where we meet in Highams Park. What makes this campaign even more personal is the fact that in 2017, shortly before Shaheen was asked to stand, her mother died. \u201cMy mum was really affected a lot by the cuts,\u201d she explains. \u201cShe had a heart condition, and because of the changes that Iain Duncan Smith brought in, she got majorly harassed. She was in the heart transplant ward, and there were assessors coming to the house and reassessing her benefits. After she died, I found letters where she was arguing with people about not being able to get proper social care. It\u2019s a very common story.\u201d Before Jeremy Corbyn took over as Labour leader, Shaheen felt as if she had no home in any political party. She had studied PPE at Oxford, where the economics being taught struck her as \u201ccold and individualistic\u201d, and went on to do a PhD on economic inequality at Manchester. After working at thinktanks including the New Economics Foundation, she took over the Centre for Labour and Social Studies in 2015. Two years later, a space opened up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever have a political hook for the ideas we were working on, but there it was in Labour\u2019s manifesto.\u201d She is keenly aware of the problems that need to be addressed in her constituency. \u201cOur local school here in Highams Park had a \u00a31.8m cut under the Conservatives, equivalent to 17 teachers. The local hospital in Whipps Cross needs proper redevelopment, and better infrastructure around that in terms of social care. In south Chingford, the more working-class part, the public transport is really bad. I know exactly how it feels, getting on that bus and it taking forever to get to Walthamstow Central.\u201d It can be hard, though, to keep the focus on local matters. In the cafe, a young mother on the table next to us tells Shaheen that she would love to vote for her but doesn\u2019t want Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. Moments later, she interrupts Shaheen to ask what she thinks about Brexit. Shaheen acknowledges the conflicts raging around both questions, but argues that the most important thing to focus on is booting the Tories out \u2013 a challenge which, locally, was helped last week when the Green party candidate stepped aside to encourage tactical voting. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to spend all my time on the doorstep talking about Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d Shaheen says. \u201cI need to make the case as to why they should vote for me.\u201d The focus, she adds, should be on the policies, not individual personalities, \u201cand those are policies and principles that I couldn\u2019t be prouder of.\u201d On antisemitism within the Labour party, she says: \u201cWe didn\u2019t deal with it fast enough. I\u2019m not going lie and act like prejudices have somehow gone away from the party. Unfortunately there are people that are going to say awful things, and they need to be dealt with quickly. But it did highlight to me how an organisation needs to deal with institutional prejudice, because Labour is not the only one: there are very few institutions that are good at doing that.\u201d As for Brexit, which Shaheen considers \u201can epic waste of time\u201d, the question does come up, she says. \u201cBut to be honest, on the doorsteps, the things that people mostly want to talk about are the cuts to the schools and hospitals.\u201d Does she feel optimistic about her chances, and the next few years? \u201cIt\u2019s like the best of times and the worst of times. When I see hundreds of volunteers turning up to our office, it just makes my heart buzz and I think, we can do this. But if the country votes for a Boris Johnson majority\u2026\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have five years to waste on the climate, on education, on the NHS\u2026 So I get moments of severe anxiety about what\u2019s going to happen if they win. But we need to block out the negativity. We need to get IDS out on 12 December. Let\u2019s keep focused on that.\u201d Who\u2019s your political hero? Nelson Mandela or Muhammad Ali. From an early age I was told that, when you see an injustice, you fight for what\u2019s right, no matter the consequences. And because I experienced racism at a really young age, I found an affinity with people like Mandela and Ali who were fighting racism. Where do you get your news? A combination of what\u2019s trending on Twitter, and the Financial Times and the Guardian. I don\u2019t always agree with everything in the FT, but they put things in a very factual way, and I appreciate that. The New York Times as well, just to get a sense of what\u2019s going on in the world. Facebook is a problem for all kinds of reasons, but I\u2019ve got quite a lot of friends who are activists in different parts of the world and their Facebook posts have become trusted sources to me. I do listen to the Today programme on Radio 4 for a bit in the morning, just to get a sense of how they\u2019re framing things, but it drives me nuts and I always shout at the radio. One thing you always take with you when doorstep campaigning There\u2019s a leaflet that\u2019s a bit old now that has a picture of me with my two old teachers, Mr Osborne and Mr Mahir, and I think people really connect with that. And it always makes me smile. They really encouraged me and saw potential in me and are just such an important part of my story. How do you get away from politics? I watch Netflix. I\u2019m rewatching Glee. Killian Fox John Finucane (Sinn F\u00e9in) v Nigel Dodds (DUP) North Belfast \u201cIt obviously had a very defining influence on me,\u201d says John Finucane, the current lord mayor of Belfast, who is standing for Sinn F\u00e9in in North Belfast against Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s parliamentary leader. He is talking about the death of his father, who was murdered by the Ulster Defence Association, in collusion with the British security services, in February 1989. Pat Finucane was eating a Sunday meal when two masked gunmen broke in and opened fire, shooting the human rights lawyer 14 times in front of his family, including John, who was eight at the time. What followed was a 30-year quest for justice, in which the family sought to clear Finucane\u2019s name (he was accused of being an IRA member) and to prove that the British state had colluded in the killing. David Cameron apologised to the family in 2012 but a full public inquiry has never been granted. \u201cIt exposed me to the very worst of politics,\u201d says Finucane, \u201cbut also the best of politics. It showed me that when people come together and work towards a common goal, progress can be achieved.\u201d Finucane went on to become a lawyer in Belfast, like his father, but moved into politics in 2017, when he made his first attempt to unseat Dodds. The bid wasn\u2019t successful, but he won Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s best ever result in North Belfast, closing the gap to just over 2,000 votes, which, he says, \u201cmade people see that what was once a very safe unionist seat is no longer safe\u201d. Earlier this year, Finucane, who is 39, ran for Belfast city council and was elected lord mayor in May. He believes his diverse background \u2013 his father was a Catholic from the Falls Road, his mother, Geraldine, a middle-class Protestant from east Belfast \u2013 makes him an ideal candidate to represent this still-divided city. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable in my political skin, with speaking and engaging with unionists and loyalists,\u201d he says, describing himself as \u201cmayor for all\u201d. If this election is to be defined by Brexit, that, Finucane believes, will give him an advantage in North Belfast, where the remain vote was marginally stronger in 2016. \u201cThe brand of politics that Nigel Dodds represents belongs in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have watched the DUP\u2019s destructive pact with the Tories and their clear attacks on the Good Friday agreement \u2013 not to mention the threat to our economy, to our rural and farming communities, and the way of life that we\u2019ve enjoyed since 1998.\u201d By contrast, Finucane is pitching himself as a candidate of the future. \u201cI see a city that is progressive and forward-looking, that enjoys its European status and the rights that come with being in Europe. We want to make sure that our peace process is protected at all costs.\u201d To achieve this, he is comfortable with Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s decision to stand down in constituencies where rival candidates have a better chance of defeating the DUP. \u201cI think that\u2019s common sense; it\u2019s reacting to what voters want,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the DUP return with the same strength and hold the balance of power, then I think we are looking at a very dark future for our children, for our economy.\u201d Aside from the Brexit fallout, Finucane wants to tackle urgent social problems in North Belfast such as \u201chousing, mental health, suicide, dependency on prescription drugs\u201d. In this, he does not discriminate between communities. \u201cLoyalism has been failed in North Belfast as well. There are people in the loyalist areas who go to the food banks, just as people on the other side of the peace wall do. They don\u2019t have academic achievement to the level that they should, they don\u2019t have people going into jobs or traineeships. These are all problems that need to be addressed.\u201d Since Finucane stepped into politics, the past has echoed around him in unsettling ways. \u201cI\u2019ve had death threats,\u201d he says. \u201cRecently banners went up [on the Shankhill Road] trying to associate me with a very violent past \u2013 a reminder that there are those in our society who wish to drag us back.\u201d Some of the reaction \u201chas probably worried and upset my mum,\u201d he admits, \u201cand I have to advise my kids to be careful at times\u201d, but otherwise his family has been \u201cfairly relaxed and very supportive\u201d of his bid, and he insists he is undeterred. If Finucane does win, it will, he says, open a positive new chapter in a traumatic family history. \u201cIt would be exceptionally significant,\u201d he says, \u201cin a constituency where my father lived and was killed, as a result of collusion with the state, that his son then goes on to become an MP.\u201d Who\u2019s your political hero? Martin McGuinness. I don\u2019t think there would be a peace process without him. He showed tremendous leadership, specifically forming that relationship with Ian Paisley, which people would not have thought possible. He was committed to delivering political solutions to everybody in society here and it\u2019s a shame that wasn\u2019t reciprocated. Do you have a favourite political pundit? Brian Feeney, a columnist for the Irish News and a former SDLP councillor, is very astute. He\u2019s good at analysing current situations and seeing what\u2019s coming down the line. One thing you always take with you when doorstep campaigning? Pen and paper, because invariably there are some issues raised, and when you\u2019re going round so many doors you need to make sure that you have a good note of them, so you can come back later and chase them up. KF Ali Milani (Labour) v Boris Johnson (Conservative) Uxbridge and South Ruislip \u201cBoris territory,\u201d says a man as the underground train pulls into Uxbridge, an imposing, modernist station with Ervin Boss\u00e1nyi stained-glass panels over the exit. Outside, in the high street, the safe-seat-for-incumbent-Tory-PM vibe continues: there are two huge, glass-fronted shopping malls, lots of flat whites and no boarded-up betting shops. But appearances can deceive. At the 2017 election, Boris Johnson\u2019s majority in west London\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip was cleaved in half to just 5,034. No sitting prime minister has ever lost their seat, but the constituency is now rated \u201cvulnerable\u201d by Onward, the conservative thinktank, and it\u2019s on Labour\u2019s want-to-win list. \u201cSo it\u2019s, objectively, a marginal seat,\u201d says Ali Milani, the 25-year-old Labour candidate, with an almost giddy grin. Johnson\u2019s headache in this area, Milani argues, is down to the three Hs: \u201cthe hospital, housing, Heathrow.\u201d The hospital is Hillingdon, the buildings of which have been described by a senior NHS figure as \u201cthe worst of any hospital in London\u201d. But it is the plans for a third runway at Heathrow that offer Johnson\u2019s opponents a ready stick to swing at him. When he was elected in 2015, Johnson swore to constituents that he would \u201clie down with you in front of those bulldozers\u201d. But in June this year, he dropped his opposition, stating he\u2019d \u201cchanged his view\u201d. \u201cThe country is finding out what this constituency has known for a really long time: this guy will say or do anything to get elected,\u201d says Milani when we meet at his small flat on the outskirts of Uxbridge. \u201cWe knew this guy was a charlatan and now the rest of the country\u2019s discovering it.\u201d Milani is relishing the fight\u2013 he calls it \u201cBoris versus Ali\u201d, making it sound like an epic boxing match in the 1970s, not a clash for votes in suburbia. Every chance he has, he points out how different his world is from Johnson\u2019s. Milani is a Muslim and moved aged five to Wembley, north London, from Iran. He went to Brunel University, which is in Uxbridge, and was student union president as well as vice-president of the National Union of Students. Milani says he is a natural fit for the area, someone \u201cwho\u2019s local, who has worked here, studied here, had surgery in the local hospital, grew up on a council estate with a single mum \u2013 that connects with people\u201d. There is a problem, though: Uxbridge and South Ruislip voted 57% to leave the EU; Milani, who campaigned for remain, says he would do so again if there were a second vote. \u201cIt\u2019s getting it done with Labour as well, it\u2019s just getting it done in a different way,\u201d he insists. \u201cBut you\u2019d be surprised at how little Brexit comes up on the doorstep here. Honest to God. OK, since the European elections much more. But before then, I had it come up three times between November and May. You\u2019d think Brexit would come up at about 50% of the doors now, but way less: 15% or 20%.\u201d Milani has taken flack for antisemitic tweets he wrote when he was 16 and 17. He has apologised, and does so again this morning, a day when Jacob Rees-Mogg is being criticised for his comments about the Grenfell victims. Rees-Mogg has also backtracked \u2013 does Milani think he should be forgiven, too? \u201cI wasn\u2019t a cabinet minister when I made the comments, I was a teenager,\u201d says Milani. Does he think Labour has done enough to root out antisemitism? \u201cSo as long as there\u2019s Jewish voices saying we haven\u2019t done enough, we haven\u2019t,\u201d he replies. In his flat, surrounded by ephemera from DC Comics, Milani clearly believes he can create \u201ca political earthquake\u201d. He glances over at his books, films and figurines of the Flash, Wonder Woman and Superman. \u201cMy friends take the piss,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThey\u2019re like: \u2018When you\u2019re talking to the press, can you please take this stuff down!\u2019 But there is just something about pure optimism, pure hope, and the good guy beating the bad guy that I think is worth holding on to.\u201d Who\u2019s your political hero? I had a philosophy teacher at high school and college who nudged me in the direction of politics. He was amazing and pulled us back from engaging in conspiracy theories and things like that. What\u2019s one thing you always take with you when you go doorstep campaigning? A spatula so you can put a leaflet through a letterbox without getting your finger bitten by a dog. It happened to two of my activists and it\u2019s scared all of us into buying them! What do you do to get away from politics? Football. Watching Manchester United is the only thing where for 90 minutes my brain doesn\u2019t think about politics and the campaign. It\u2019s often just as miserable with United these days, so I\u2019m not saying it lifts me up with joy, but it\u2019s about being able to disconnect from politics. Tim Lewis Nicola Horlick (Liberal Democrat) v Greg Hands (Conservative) Chelsea and Fulham \u201cThis is, in my view, the most important general election of my lifetime,\u201d says Nicola Horlick in the conference room of a co-working space in Hammersmith, west London. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really old now.\u201d Horlick, who is 58 and best-known as a high-profile fund manager, aka \u201csuperwoman\u201d, aka \u201cthe woman who had it all\u201d, has had a whirlwind political career. She applied to stand for the Liberal Democrats in early September and was approved as a candidate two weeks later. A couple of days after that, Horlick was told that she had been selected to contest the Chelsea and Fulham constituency, a safe Conservative seat since it was created in 2010 and just across the Thames from where she lives in Barnes. Last time out, Greg Hands, formerly chief secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron and a minister in the Department for International Trade under Theresa May, won 52% of the vote. The Liberal Democrat candidate in 2017 polled just 11%. Some people would be daunted by such statistics, but Horlick has made a career of defying outsized odds. Aged 28, she became the youngest director of Warburg investment bank. At Morgan Grenfell, part of Deutsche Bank, she grew assets from \u00a34bn to \u00a318bn in five years. Horlick juggled her career with having six children, one of whom, Georgie, died from leukaemia in 1998 at the age of 12. \u201cI\u2019m a hugely competitive person as you may have gathered,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be defeated easily. Can you imagine? It would be a historic victory.\u201d Horlick\u2019s optimism comes from a single issue: Brexit. In the 2016 referendum, her constituents voted 70% for remain. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for people who have been lifelong Conservatives to contemplate voting Liberal Democrat, I understand that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not asking them to become members of the Lib Dems and vote the rest of their lives with us. I\u2019m asking them to lend me their vote on this one occasion, because this is a quasi-referendum. And these people are remainers, strong remainers. They were the people on the march on 19 October and still have their placard sitting in their front entrance halls.\u201d The Liberal Democrats\u2019 forthright position against Brexit is playing well on the doorsteps of west London, says Horlick. She is also emboldened by private polling that indicates the party has overtaken Labour and is now \u201cwithin touching distance\u201d of Hands. Although Hands campaigned for remain in the referendum \u2013 he has a German wife, bilingual children and speaks five languages \u2013 he has voted in support of proposals from both May and Boris Johnson to push Brexit through. Horlick clearly considers the Tory candidate to be vulnerable. Brexit dominates the conversation with Horlick, but she insists she is equally passionate about education, the environment and especially the NHS. Her daughter Georgie was treated for almost a decade by the NHS, mostly at Great Ormond Street, and Horlick has since become a non-executive director at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. She would quite fancy being health secretary one day. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced the NHS as the mother of a patient,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced it as a board member. And I have very, very strong views about what needs to be done to fix it.\u201d But before that, there\u2019s the small matter of unseating Hands and overturning his 8,188 majority. \u201cWe\u2019re already close,\u201d she says, with a smile of pure mischief. Who is your political hero? In the Liberal party, Jo Grimond [leader from 1956-1967]. I met him a few times because my father was involved with the party and he was a great leader and a great guy. What\u2019s one thing you always take with you when you go doorstep campaigning? My rosette and my mobile phone because the electoral register is on our phones. It\u2019s got very hi-tech these days. What do you do to get away from politics? I\u2019ve only just come into it! I\u2019m not sure I want to get away from it just at this moment. I\u2019m trying to immerse myself more, not less. TL David Nicholl (Liberal Democrat) v Sajid Javid (Conservative) Bromsgrove The tipping point, for David Nicholl, came in the form of an unanswered question. On 2 September, the consultant neurologist from Hagley in the West Midlands went on Nick Ferrari\u2019s radio show on LBC and asked Jacob Rees-Mogg, a guest on the programme: \u201cWhat level of mortality rate are you willing to accept in the light of a no-deal Brexit?\u201d Nicholl had helped draw up contingency plans for the supply of epilepsy and neuropathic drugs in the event of no deal, but he was so concerned about what he saw as the government\u2019s lack of engagement on the issue, which he believed could lead to the deaths of patients, that he went on Newsnight in April to sound the alarm. When he posed his question on LBC, however, Rees-Mogg dismissed it as \u201cthe worst excess of Project Fear\u201d. Three days later Rees-Mogg told the House of Commons that Nicholl was as irresponsible as the disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield. \u201cGenuinely, I was speechless,\u201d says the 54-year-old, when we meet on the day of his Lib Dem campaign launch in Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire, where he is seeking to unseat the chancellor Sajid Javid. Nicholl, who was born in Northern Ireland but has lived most of his adult life in the West Midlands, has a cheerfully pugnacious manner, and on 5 September his speechlessness didn\u2019t last long. That afternoon, he stood outside Westminster with a megaphone and challenged Jacob Rees-Mogg \u201cto come out of the House of Commons and repeat what he said in public. If he does,\u201d he warned, \u201cI will sue.\u201d A few hours later, after widespread criticism, Rees-Mogg apologised. Nicholl accepted the apology, but the experience galvanised him. He had recently joined the Lib Dems, having quit Labour in 2018 after Owen Smith was sacked from the frontbench for calling for a people\u2019s vote, and in October he announced his decision to stand. The odds are not with him \u2013 the Lib Dems took just 4.6% of the vote in Bromsgrove in the last election, compared to Javid\u2019s 62% \u2013 but Nicholl is not one to dodge a fight. After the Iraq war, he spent more than a decade campaigning on behalf of British prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, concluding with the release of Shaker Aamer in 2015. He has also campaigned for the NHS and, closer to home, against the closure of a gym at his local school. Nicholl\u2019s bete noire is Brexit, which he calls \u201ccompletely toxic\u201d, but he insists it\u2019s not his only focus. \u201cObviously the NHS is a big issue,\u201d he says, \u201cand I think the Lib Dems have got fairly sensible policies on the NHS \u2013 and on the climate emergency too.\u201d He also cites local issues such as the need for a bypass on the congested A38 and related concerns about air pollution. If he wins, Nicholl believes his experience as a neurologist will help amid the morass of Brexit \u2013 \u201cbecause you\u2019re used to dealing with complex situations and family dynamics. It\u2019s pretty stressful, and you\u2019ve got to try and come to a balanced view.\u201d But his focus is on defeating Javid. \u201cThe choice here is between a politician who will flip-flop according to whatever the direction the wind is blowing\u201d \u2013 he cites Javid\u2019s shifting stance on the proroguing of parliament, as well as Britain\u2019s EU membership \u2013 \u201cand someone who has a track record of standing up and being counted, even at risk to himself, and doing the right thing.\u201d How do you get away from politics? My wife would probably say I don\u2019t. But I do enjoy going to the cinema. The last film I saw was Joker, which was great, a very disturbing film \u2013 Joaquin Phoenix must get an Oscar for it. I always thought Heath Ledger was brilliant, but Phoenix was even better. Where do you get your news? I subscribe to the Times and watch Channel 4 News. I am way too addicted to Twitter \u2013 apologies to my wife on that. Do you have a favourite pundit? Jon Snow, because he\u2019s polite, but gets the questions through. I think Newsnight is getting better and better \u2013 I\u2019ve been very impressed with Emma Barnett and Emily Maitlis. KF Charlotte Holloway (Labour) v Johnny Mercer (Conservative) Plymouth Moor View Charlotte Holloway is the 34-year-old Labour candidate for Plymouth Moor View, one of three constituencies in this Devonshire city, known for its naval docks and maritime history. The seat, created in 2010, was won by the former army officer Johnny Mercer for the Tories in 2015. He held it in 2017. The daughter of a former NHS nurse, Holloway is a grammar school girl who went to Cambridge and then worked on economic policy with a variety of businesses. She is the mother of a one-year-old girl and decided to seek the Labour nomination after the 2017 election. \u201cWhat I was hearing on the doorstep,\u201d she says, \u201cwas that the Tory government wasn\u2019t working for people in their day-to-day lives and yet the Tories increased their majority. I knew we had to do better to reconnect with people here.\u201d She takes me for a cup of tea in a cafe adjoining a chip shop, in the heart of her constituency, and tells me what she has that will make the difference - roots. \u201cPeople connect with the fact that I was born and raised in Plymouth and I live here.\u201d She and Keith Moore, a local volunteer and Momentum member who drives her around, explain that Plymouth is a city that feels cut off from the rest of the country. The motorway only goes as far as Exeter, which Plymothians see as rather leafy and genteel. On the way to the cafe, we pass through areas of social deprivation that have been revamped, they tell me, by the Labour council. What does she think of Mercer, the former army officer who was appointed by Boris Johnson as a junior minister in the Ministry of Defence?\u201cHe\u2019s called me \u2018not decent\u2019, \u2018a clown\u2019 and just last week \u2018the second biggest joke in Plymouth politics\u2019. When he does this, his supporters pile in. and often use misogynist language. \u201cPeople round here don\u2019t like that he self-styled as an independent when he was first elected. His record shows that he\u2019s never voted against the government. He\u2019s voted for every cut that\u2019s affected Plymouth. We\u2019re losing \u00a32m a week in Plymouth city council as a result of cuts in the government grant.\u201d She notes that Mercer is not from Plymouth. \u201cAnd for a lot of people to be rooted in the communities that you represent is really important. Many people feel that Plymouth is a bit of a pit-stop for him on route from his home somewhere in Cornwall. Also people are not particularly pleased that he thought it OK to take a second job. He relied a lot on his personal brand, but in just a few years he\u2019s shown that he\u2019s a careerist.\u201d That\u2019s all very well but the election is a national one and it\u2019s been called because of the impasse over an international issue \u2013 namely our relationship to the EU. Plymouth Moor View voted 67% to leave in the referendum. Is she having trouble getting across Labour\u2019s complex Brexit policy on the doorstep? Holloway\u2019s message to them is that within six months of being elected, a Labour government will negotiate a better Brexit deal than Boris Johnson\u2019s. What would it involve? A customs union? \u201cWe would have a new deal that would be a better deal, which we\u2019d then put to the country to see if they like it.\u201d Would she like it? \u201cI\u2019d have to see what it looked like. It would have to be a very high bar to be a better deal than remaining in the European Union.\u201d The other big issue she has to contend with is the Labour leader, whose leadership qualities have received some historically low polling results. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest, Jeremy is not people\u2019s favourite cup of tea,\u201d she says. She says she counters disapproval on the doorstep by telling constituents that Corbyn, the former chair of the Stop the War Coalition, supported the campaign to protect HMS Bulwark and HMS Albion \u2013 two Royal Navy assault-class ships based at Devonport \u2013 from proposed cuts. Anyway, she says, Plymothians are more concerned about cuts to the police, problems seeing a GP and under-investment in education. Holloway says she really enjoys campaigning, but in the post-Jo Cox era of politics, as opinions continue to polarise, the threat of physical attack is hard to ignore. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to come to terms with,\u201d she says. Who is your political hero? Keir Hardie. Who is your favourite political pundit? I\u2019m not saying I always agree with either of them, but I\u2019m a big fan of Ash Sarkar and Ayesha Hazarika. They\u2019re both entertaining and insightful. What do you do to get away from politics? My baby daughter turned one on the day the election was called \u2013 we took her to the Plymouth aquarium: it\u2019s fantastic.

      "body": "<h2>Roquefort pastries</h2> <p>\u201cNothing like a nice festive sherry to fortify the taste buds,\u201d says Auntie Jean, while quietly drinking a pre-prandial Christmas amontillado. This 11-year old, meanwhile, is helping to trim the sprouts by the sink with Dad, who mutters aside that he\u2019ll soon be pouring himself a gin and French once the bread sauce is put to simmer. I always thought that Dad\u2019s drink was absolute filth: half a tumbler of gin, with the remaining volume topped up with Noilly Prat. No ice. No lemon. And then he will probably sneak in a quick top-up while Mum, my brother, Auntie Jean and I are in the sitting room watching the Queen. All that having been said, our Christmas Day feast was always, but always, quite brilliant.</p> <p>Like Auntie Jean, amontillado was Mum\u2019s preferred sherry. As for finding a splendidly mature, dry oloroso, the very idea would have been nothing less than ridiculous. Five decades on, it remains the very nicest accompaniment to these cheese pastries. Serve the oloroso lightly chilled, please.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9addc74d5d34ee454caa14b5e645c0d36dc634b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9addc74d5d34ee454caa14b5e645c0d36dc634b/0_2211_6192_3714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roquefort pastries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roquefort pastries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Makes 24</strong></em><br><strong>all butter puff pastry</strong> 1 x 320g sheet <br><strong>egg</strong> 1, beaten</p> <p><em><strong>For the cheese filling</strong></em><br><strong>Roquefort cheese</strong> 100g <br><strong>Boursin cheese</strong> 80g <br><strong>egg yolk</strong> 1 <br><strong>plain flour</strong> 1 scant tbsp <br><strong>butter</strong> 25g <br><strong>cayenne</strong> \u00bc tsp</p> <p>With the long edge of the pastry facing you, cut the sheet of pastry into 4 equal quarters. Then cut each quarter in half, lengthways, to achieve 8 small rectangles</p> <p>Line a small, shallow tray with greaseproof paper cut to fit (you will need two sheets), then lay upon it 4 pieces of pastry. Cover with the second sheet, then place the remaining four pieces of pastry upon this. Place in the fridge (or more quickly, in the freezer) until firm; this is a good idea if you do not wish the pastry to become unmanageable and too soft (especially if the kitchen is warm) while folding and filling with the cheese mixture.</p> <p>To make the cheese filling, simply mix the ingredients together until smooth; I use a small food processor, but a whisk should do it. Scrape out into a small container and put to firm up in the fridge for about 30 minutes.</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.</p> <p>To assemble, dust a surface with flour, take two pieces of pastry at a time from the fridge (or freezer) and, again, long edge facing, roll each one out a little more \u2013 by about 2cm. Working quickly, lightly brush each piece with beaten egg, then put 3 teaspoons (don\u2019t over-fill) of the cheese mixture equally placed along it, allowing a small gap between each spoonful. Deftly fold over the front edge of the pastry to the back, and seal. Using the little finger, gently press down between each mound, including the ends, then cut into 3 equal pieces; I find the most efficient way is to use a crinkled pasta wheel, as one would form ravioli. Line a baking sheet with parchment, lay the 6 pieces out in a line, brush with beaten egg and pierce each piece with a fork. Repeat the process with the remaining 6 pastry pieces.</p> <p>Bake in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until golden and well-puffed; if two or three exude a little filling, don\u2019t despair, as these crunchy bits are just delicious.</p> <h2>Smoked salmon and cucumber mousse</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54a2f360a15f073abf1f3f239798344eafeec52a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54a2f360a15f073abf1f3f239798344eafeec52a/322_124_5554_6942/800.jpg\" alt=\"Smoked salmon and cucumber mousse.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoked salmon and cucumber mousse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some may say that this savoury fish mousse does not quite taste enough of fish \u2013 and they may be right. But here, the salmon flavour is subtle, quietly carried by cucumber and, chums to both, feathery dill. So many dishes today are mouth-slappingly pushy, whereas this rather dainty and well-behaved fluff \u2013 it is very lightly textured \u2013 is English cookery to a tee; or as it once used to be \u2026 One needs such a thing over what is often a period of relentless riches. Eat it with crisp toast, well buttered, and with fine linen napkins to hand.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4-6</strong></em><br><strong>cucumber</strong> \u00bd, peeled and grated<br><strong>salt</strong> 1 scant tsp <br><strong>smoked salmon</strong> 150g <br><strong>soured cream</strong> 100g <br><strong>cream cheese</strong> 100g <br><strong>cayenne pepper</strong> \u00bc tsp <br><strong>dill</strong> several small sprigs, fronds removed<br><strong>gelatine</strong> 2 leaves, soaked in cold water until softened<br><strong>double cream </strong>100ml <br><strong>egg whites</strong> 2 <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 1 tsp</p> <p>First, mix the cucumber with the salt, place in a colander and leave to drain for at least 30 minutes, suspended over a bowl (you will need the drippings). Meanwhile, put aside 30g of the smoked salmon, finely chop it, put into a small bowl and set aside. Place the remainder of the salmon, roughly chopped, in a small food processor and puree together with the soured cream and cream cheese until smooth. Add the cayenne and dill, then pulse-process until the dill is finely chopped into the mix. Decant into a medium bowl.</p> <p>Squeeze the excess moisture from the cucumber with your hands, then mix it together well with the chopped salmon. Now, take 2 tablespoons of the salty cucumber water and place in a small saucepan (discard the remaining water). Add to it the soaked gelatine leaves and gently warm through until melted. Leave to cool for a couple of minutes then thoroughly whisk into the creamed salmon. Place the bowl in the fridge until the mixture is beginning to firm up \u2013 about 30-40 minutes.</p> <p>To assemble everything, loosely whip the cream until it is only just holding peaks, then whisk the egg whites with the lemon juice until showing soft peaks. Loosen the creamed salmon mixture by whisking it, while also incorporating the chopped salmon and cucumber until evenly distributed. Finally, gently \u2013 but thoroughly \u2013 fold in the cream, then quickly and deftly followed by the egg whites. Once a pretty pink and green-speckled homogenous mixture has been achieved, decant into a Tupperware container, fix on the lid and put to chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours.</p> <p>To serve, dip a tablespoon into a jug of hot water and scoop out a couple of nice spoonfuls onto chilled, pretty plates. Serve just as is, with hot, buttered toast and, if you like, a few sprightly sprigs of watercress, or mustard and cress.</p> <h2>Grilled oysters with pastis and fennel crumbs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb0819875dedc1390e76d22e8944aae641db65d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb0819875dedc1390e76d22e8944aae641db65d7/0_1141_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grilled oysters with pastis and fennel crumbs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grilled oysters with pastis and fennel crumbs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This a new dish and, I feel, particularly special for Christmas feasting. There is no question that aniseed flavours are good when paired with hot oysters; just think Rockefeller. Here, however, fennel is used to good effect as a fine puree in the base of the shell, the warmed (just stiffened) oyster placed upon it and then a savoury butter/crumb to finish.</p> <p>When baked together in the oven until bubbling and crusted, the emerging scent is just marvellous. Try to find medium to small oysters, as it is a good thing if you can eat the cooked oyster from the shell in one complete spoonful.</p> <p>If you can find some, a little fennel pollen mixed into the crumb is a very good idea.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> I suggest that you cook the oysters in two batches, simply because having an oven that will accommodate 24 of them at one time may be impractical. Ergo: eat three each, cook more, repeat.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><br><strong>rock oysters</strong> 24, shucked (scrub the shells clean in hot water and reserve)</p> <p><em><strong>For the fennel pur</strong></em><em><strong>ee</strong></em><br><strong>fennel bulbs</strong> 2 small, about 400g, reserving any green fronds that are attached<br><strong>olive oil</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> a thick slice <br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 clove, crushed<br><strong>pastis</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>oyster juices</strong><br><strong>lemon</strong> juice of \u00bd</p> <p><em><strong>For the savoury butter</strong></em><br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 125g, softened<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 small clove, crushed to a paste<br><strong>tarragon</strong> leaves from 2-3 sprigs, finely chopped<br><strong>fennel fronds</strong> finely chopped<br><strong>Tabasco</strong> 3-4 shakes <br><strong>pastis</strong> 1 scant tbsp</p> <p><em><strong>For the fennel crumbs</strong></em><br><strong>fresh white breadcrumbs</strong> 40g <br><strong>fennel pollen</strong> optional<br><strong>olive oil </strong><strong>or olive-oil spray</strong></p> <p>Pop the oysters and their juices (strained, to catch any stray bits of shell) into a small pan and warm through over a gentle heat until just stiffened. Lift out with a slotted spoon and put to one side. Reserve the juices.</p> <p>To make the fennel puree, roughly chop the fennel, put into a saucepan and add all the other ingredients. Place over a moderate heat and bring up to a simmer. Pop on the lid and quietly cook until the fennel is very tender indeed. Remove the lid and cook fairly rapidly over a higher heat so that any liquid is reduced to not much more than a smear. Tip into a small food processor and whizz until very smooth (I use a Nutribullet for best results). Put aside.</p> <p>Pre-heat an overhead grill to medium-hot.</p> <p>For the savoury butter, simply whisk all the ingredients together until smooth. Spoon out onto a small piece of foil, roll it into a thick-ish sausage (about 3cm thick) and put in the freezer to firm up.</p> <p>To assemble, place a heaped teaspoon of fennel puree into the bottom of each shell and then top with an oyster. Remove the butter from the freezer and remove the foil. Using a small sharp knife, cut off thin slices and place one atop each oyster.</p> <p>Line an oven tray with slightly crumpled foil and arrange 12 oysters upon it. Evenly sprinkle the breadcrumbs over each oyster and trickle a little olive oil over each one (truly, however, for best results, an olive-oil spray will deliver the most even crust to each oyster, once cooked). Grill for 6-7 minutes, or until the oysters are golden crusted and bubbling around the edges. Leave for 5 minutes before eating, to avoid burnt tongues. Repeat with the remaining 12 oysters.</p> <h2>Roast goose stuffed with mashed potato</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1962b0dce6d5fb55b1d23e49a3f1e8a4d29e4a13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1962b0dce6d5fb55b1d23e49a3f1e8a4d29e4a13/238_216_5300_5635/941.jpg\" alt=\"Roast goose stuffed with mashed potato.\" width=\"941\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roast goose stuffed with mashed potato.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have never roasted a turkey for Christmas, not once. I have nothing against it and, quite simply, someone else has always been there to do it. The parents did, of course, in childhood and it remains as so memorable a turkey \u2013 with two gorgeous stuffings and such a delicious flavour \u2013 that, truly, I can savour it now. Was it down to the Aga? Possibly. If I am moved to cook a festive bird, it will be a fine goose.</p> <p>It is now 25 years since <em>Roast Chicken and Other Stories</em> was first published, but also on 10 December of that year, 1994 \u2013 and almost to the day \u2013 my first cookery column was published in the <em>Independent</em> newspaper. The American journalist Emily Green was my editor and, furthermore, came up with my opening byline: \u201cMr Hopkinson cooks his goose.\u201d</p> <p>The original recipe for this sumptuous bird was first alerted to me by the late, larger than life bon viveur of the highest (and, occasionally, lowest) order, Peter Langan. I think it was an Irish granny, or aunt, who had furnished him with the idea of mashed potato with which to stuff a goose. At Langan\u2019s Brasserie, in the old days, it appeared on the menu for the entire month of December. I just hope that it still does. Here is how Mr Langan once cooked his goose, most honourably interpreted \u2013 and updated \u2013 by one of his greatest fans.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 6-8</strong></em><br><strong>goose</strong> 1, dressed weight about 4.5kg or so, with giblets<br><strong>salt</strong><br><strong>plenty of freshly ground black pepper</strong><br><strong>potatoes</strong> 1.4kg, peeled, chopped into large chunks and rinsed<br><strong>spring onions</strong> 2 bunches, trimmed and sliced<br><strong>sage leaves</strong> 1 tbsp, chopped (optional, but I like it)</p> <p><em><strong>For the gravy</strong></em><br><strong>streaky bacon</strong> 4 rashers, chopped<br><strong>goose fat</strong> a small lump from inside the goose\u2019s cavity, chopped<br><strong>goose giblets</strong> all coarsely chopped up<br><strong>onion</strong> 1, chopped<br><strong>carrot</strong> 1, chopped<br><strong>celery</strong> 2 sticks, chopped<br><strong>calvados</strong> a small glass (or cognac)<br><strong>plain flour </strong>1 tbsp <br><strong>madeira</strong> 150ml <br><strong>chicken stock</strong> 400ml <br><strong>redcurrant jelly</strong> \u00bd tbsp</p> <p>I think that the Chinese method of pouring boiling water over the surface of a duck or goose is the best way to achieve a crisp skin. The skin of the bird must first be punctured many times with the point of a thin skewer or sharp knife. These little holes then expand on contact with the boiling water, allowing the subcutaneous layer of fat beneath to flow out. The bird should then be allowed to dry.</p> <p>If you have an electric fan, hang up the bird, directing the flow of air directly onto it. Do this by an open window and leave for a few hours, or preferably overnight. The original instruction 25 years ago is the simpler method of placing it on a wire rack by the same open window, turning it over from time to time. The fan method, however, remains the best, so if you have one, use it. The end result of all this palaver should be moist flesh and parchment-like skin without the usual goo. Believe me, it is worth doing.</p> <p>Before giving the goose the treatment as described above, remove the large lumps of fat which are visible just within the cavity. Cut off a small lump, then freeze the rest wrapped in a plastic bag for another occasion when you wish to simply roast the best potatoes.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7.</p> <p>Rub salt all over the goose and sprinkle some inside the cavity as well, together with plenty of pepper. Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, drain well and coarsely mash them; use an old fashioned hand-held manual masher for best results. Add the spring onions and sage (if using) then pack this mixture into the cavity of the goose. Lay it in a roomy roasting tin and place in the oven. Roast for 30 minutes and then turn the temperature down to 180C/gas mark 4. Cook for a further one and a half hours, or so. Be sure to occasionally remove the bird from the oven to tip out into a bowl the copious amount of fat that is generated.</p> <p>While the goose is cooking, make the gravy. Fry the bacon with the goose fat in a heavy bottomed saucepan, until both are crisp and browned. Incorporate the chopped giblets and cook until well coloured, followed by the vegetables, similarly treated. Drain off all but the merest modicum of fat, turn down the heat and add the calvados. Allow to bubble away until almost completely evaporated, then add the flour and let it brown a little, stirring constantly for a minute or two. Now pour in the madeira and stock, and add the redcurrant jelly. Bring up to a simmer (removing any scum that generates with a small ladle), stirring, and allow to quietly putter away for a good 40-45 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve into a clean pan, discarding the exhausted debris. Keep hot.</p> <p>To serve, scoop out the potato and pile onto a large, heated platter (some of the potato may have rudely exuded from the cavity while roasting, turning it exquisitely crisp), then carve the goose and lay neat slices upon it.

      "bodyText": "Roquefort pastries \u201cNothing like a nice festive sherry to fortify the taste buds,\u201d says Auntie Jean, while quietly drinking a pre-prandial Christmas amontillado. This 11-year old, meanwhile, is helping to trim the sprouts by the sink with Dad, who mutters aside that he\u2019ll soon be pouring himself a gin and French once the bread sauce is put to simmer. I always thought that Dad\u2019s drink was absolute filth: half a tumbler of gin, with the remaining volume topped up with Noilly Prat. No ice. No lemon. And then he will probably sneak in a quick top-up while Mum, my brother, Auntie Jean and I are in the sitting room watching the Queen. All that having been said, our Christmas Day feast was always, but always, quite brilliant. Like Auntie Jean, amontillado was Mum\u2019s preferred sherry. As for finding a splendidly mature, dry oloroso, the very idea would have been nothing less than ridiculous. Five decades on, it remains the very nicest accompaniment to these cheese pastries. Serve the oloroso lightly chilled, please. Makes 24 all butter puff pastry 1 x 320g sheet egg 1, beaten For the cheese filling Roquefort cheese 100g Boursin cheese 80g egg yolk 1 plain flour 1 scant tbsp butter 25g cayenne \u00bc tsp With the long edge of the pastry facing you, cut the sheet of pastry into 4 equal quarters. Then cut each quarter in half, lengthways, to achieve 8 small rectangles Line a small, shallow tray with greaseproof paper cut to fit (you will need two sheets), then lay upon it 4 pieces of pastry. Cover with the second sheet, then place the remaining four pieces of pastry upon this. Place in the fridge (or more quickly, in the freezer) until firm; this is a good idea if you do not wish the pastry to become unmanageable and too soft (especially if the kitchen is warm) while folding and filling with the cheese mixture. To make the cheese filling, simply mix the ingredients together until smooth; I use a small food processor, but a whisk should do it. Scrape out into a small container and put to firm up in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Pre-heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. To assemble, dust a surface with flour, take two pieces of pastry at a time from the fridge (or freezer) and, again, long edge facing, roll each one out a little more \u2013 by about 2cm. Working quickly, lightly brush each piece with beaten egg, then put 3 teaspoons (don\u2019t over-fill) of the cheese mixture equally placed along it, allowing a small gap between each spoonful. Deftly fold over the front edge of the pastry to the back, and seal. Using the little finger, gently press down between each mound, including the ends, then cut into 3 equal pieces; I find the most efficient way is to use a crinkled pasta wheel, as one would form ravioli. Line a baking sheet with parchment, lay the 6 pieces out in a line, brush with beaten egg and pierce each piece with a fork. Repeat the process with the remaining 6 pastry pieces. Bake in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until golden and well-puffed; if two or three exude a little filling, don\u2019t despair, as these crunchy bits are just delicious. Smoked salmon and cucumber mousse Some may say that this savoury fish mousse does not quite taste enough of fish \u2013 and they may be right. But here, the salmon flavour is subtle, quietly carried by cucumber and, chums to both, feathery dill. So many dishes today are mouth-slappingly pushy, whereas this rather dainty and well-behaved fluff \u2013 it is very lightly textured \u2013 is English cookery to a tee; or as it once used to be \u2026 One needs such a thing over what is often a period of relentless riches. Eat it with crisp toast, well buttered, and with fine linen napkins to hand. Serves 4-6 cucumber \u00bd, peeled and grated salt 1 scant tsp smoked salmon 150g soured cream 100g cream cheese 100g cayenne pepper \u00bc tsp dill several small sprigs, fronds removed gelatine 2 leaves, soaked in cold water until softened double cream 100ml egg whites 2 lemon juice 1 tsp First, mix the cucumber with the salt, place in a colander and leave to drain for at least 30 minutes, suspended over a bowl (you will need the drippings). Meanwhile, put aside 30g of the smoked salmon, finely chop it, put into a small bowl and set aside. Place the remainder of the salmon, roughly chopped, in a small food processor and puree together with the soured cream and cream cheese until smooth. Add the cayenne and dill, then pulse-process until the dill is finely chopped into the mix. Decant into a medium bowl. Squeeze the excess moisture from the cucumber with your hands, then mix it together well with the chopped salmon. Now, take 2 tablespoons of the salty cucumber water and place in a small saucepan (discard the remaining water). Add to it the soaked gelatine leaves and gently warm through until melted. Leave to cool for a couple of minutes then thoroughly whisk into the creamed salmon. Place the bowl in the fridge until the mixture is beginning to firm up \u2013 about 30-40 minutes. To assemble everything, loosely whip the cream until it is only just holding peaks, then whisk the egg whites with the lemon juice until showing soft peaks. Loosen the creamed salmon mixture by whisking it, while also incorporating the chopped salmon and cucumber until evenly distributed. Finally, gently \u2013 but thoroughly \u2013 fold in the cream, then quickly and deftly followed by the egg whites. Once a pretty pink and green-speckled homogenous mixture has been achieved, decant into a Tupperware container, fix on the lid and put to chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours. To serve, dip a tablespoon into a jug of hot water and scoop out a couple of nice spoonfuls onto chilled, pretty plates. Serve just as is, with hot, buttered toast and, if you like, a few sprightly sprigs of watercress, or mustard and cress. Grilled oysters with pastis and fennel crumbs This a new dish and, I feel, particularly special for Christmas feasting. There is no question that aniseed flavours are good when paired with hot oysters; just think Rockefeller. Here, however, fennel is used to good effect as a fine puree in the base of the shell, the warmed (just stiffened) oyster placed upon it and then a savoury butter/crumb to finish. When baked together in the oven until bubbling and crusted, the emerging scent is just marvellous. Try to find medium to small oysters, as it is a good thing if you can eat the cooked oyster from the shell in one complete spoonful. If you can find some, a little fennel pollen mixed into the crumb is a very good idea. Note: I suggest that you cook the oysters in two batches, simply because having an oven that will accommodate 24 of them at one time may be impractical. Ergo: eat three each, cook more, repeat. Serves 4 rock oysters 24, shucked (scrub the shells clean in hot water and reserve) For the fennel puree fennel bulbs 2 small, about 400g, reserving any green fronds that are attached olive oil 1 tbsp unsalted butter a thick slice garlic 1 clove, crushed pastis 1 tbsp oyster juices lemon juice of \u00bd For the savoury butter unsalted butter 125g, softened garlic 1 small clove, crushed to a paste tarragon leaves from 2-3 sprigs, finely chopped fennel fronds finely chopped Tabasco 3-4 shakes pastis 1 scant tbsp For the fennel crumbs fresh white breadcrumbs 40g fennel pollen optional olive oil or olive-oil spray Pop the oysters and their juices (strained, to catch any stray bits of shell) into a small pan and warm through over a gentle heat until just stiffened. Lift out with a slotted spoon and put to one side. Reserve the juices. To make the fennel puree, roughly chop the fennel, put into a saucepan and add all the other ingredients. Place over a moderate heat and bring up to a simmer. Pop on the lid and quietly cook until the fennel is very tender indeed. Remove the lid and cook fairly rapidly over a higher heat so that any liquid is reduced to not much more than a smear. Tip into a small food processor and whizz until very smooth (I use a Nutribullet for best results). Put aside. Pre-heat an overhead grill to medium-hot. For the savoury butter, simply whisk all the ingredients together until smooth. Spoon out onto a small piece of foil, roll it into a thick-ish sausage (about 3cm thick) and put in the freezer to firm up. To assemble, place a heaped teaspoon of fennel puree into the bottom of each shell and then top with an oyster. Remove the butter from the freezer and remove the foil. Using a small sharp knife, cut off thin slices and place one atop each oyster. Line an oven tray with slightly crumpled foil and arrange 12 oysters upon it. Evenly sprinkle the breadcrumbs over each oyster and trickle a little olive oil over each one (truly, however, for best results, an olive-oil spray will deliver the most even crust to each oyster, once cooked). Grill for 6-7 minutes, or until the oysters are golden crusted and bubbling around the edges. Leave for 5 minutes before eating, to avoid burnt tongues. Repeat with the remaining 12 oysters. Roast goose stuffed with mashed potato I have never roasted a turkey for Christmas, not once. I have nothing against it and, quite simply, someone else has always been there to do it. The parents did, of course, in childhood and it remains as so memorable a turkey \u2013 with two gorgeous stuffings and such a delicious flavour \u2013 that, truly, I can savour it now. Was it down to the Aga? Possibly. If I am moved to cook a festive bird, it will be a fine goose. It is now 25 years since Roast Chicken and Other Stories was first published, but also on 10 December of that year, 1994 \u2013 and almost to the day \u2013 my first cookery column was published in the Independent newspaper. The American journalist Emily Green was my editor and, furthermore, came up with my opening byline: \u201cMr Hopkinson cooks his goose.\u201d The original recipe for this sumptuous bird was first alerted to me by the late, larger than life bon viveur of the highest (and, occasionally, lowest) order, Peter Langan. I think it was an Irish granny, or aunt, who had furnished him with the idea of mashed potato with which to stuff a goose. At Langan\u2019s Brasserie, in the old days, it appeared on the menu for the entire month of December. I just hope that it still does. Here is how Mr Langan once cooked his goose, most honourably interpreted \u2013 and updated \u2013 by one of his greatest fans. Serves 6-8 goose 1, dressed weight about 4.5kg or so, with giblets salt plenty of freshly ground black pepper potatoes 1.4kg, peeled, chopped into large chunks and rinsed spring onions 2 bunches, trimmed and sliced sage leaves 1 tbsp, chopped (optional, but I like it) For the gravy streaky bacon 4 rashers, chopped goose fat a small lump from inside the goose\u2019s cavity, chopped goose giblets all coarsely chopped up onion 1, chopped carrot 1, chopped celery 2 sticks, chopped calvados a small glass (or cognac) plain flour 1 tbsp madeira 150ml chicken stock 400ml redcurrant jelly \u00bd tbsp I think that the Chinese method of pouring boiling water over the surface of a duck or goose is the best way to achieve a crisp skin. The skin of the bird must first be punctured many times with the point of a thin skewer or sharp knife. These little holes then expand on contact with the boiling water, allowing the subcutaneous layer of fat beneath to flow out. The bird should then be allowed to dry. If you have an electric fan, hang up the bird, directing the flow of air directly onto it. Do this by an open window and leave for a few hours, or preferably overnight. The original instruction 25 years ago is the simpler method of placing it on a wire rack by the same open window, turning it over from time to time. The fan method, however, remains the best, so if you have one, use it. The end result of all this palaver should be moist flesh and parchment-like skin without the usual goo. Believe me, it is worth doing. Before giving the goose the treatment as described above, remove the large lumps of fat which are visible just within the cavity. Cut off a small lump, then freeze the rest wrapped in a plastic bag for another occasion when you wish to simply roast the best potatoes. Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. Rub salt all over the goose and sprinkle some inside the cavity as well, together with plenty of pepper. Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, drain well and coarsely mash them; use an old fashioned hand-held manual masher for best results. Add the spring onions and sage (if using) then pack this mixture into the cavity of the goose. Lay it in a roomy roasting tin and place in the oven. Roast for 30 minutes and then turn the temperature down to 180C/gas mark 4. Cook for a further one and a half hours, or so. Be sure to occasionally remove the bird from the oven to tip out into a bowl the copious amount of fat that is generated. While the goose is cooking, make the gravy. Fry the bacon with the goose fat in a heavy bottomed saucepan, until both are crisp and browned. Incorporate the chopped giblets and cook until well coloured, followed by the vegetables, similarly treated. Drain off all but the merest modicum of fat, turn down the heat and add the calvados. Allow to bubble away until almost completely evaporated, then add the flour and let it brown a little, stirring constantly for a minute or two. Now pour in the madeira and stock, and add the redcurrant jelly. Bring up to a simmer (removing any scum that generates with a small ladle), stirring, and allow to quietly putter away for a good 40-45 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve into a clean pan, discarding the exhausted debris. Keep hot. To serve, scoop out the potato and pile onto a large, heated platter (some of the potato may have rudely exuded from the cavity while roasting, turning it exquisitely crisp), then carve the goose and lay neat slices upon it. Moisten the meat with a little gravy to give it a shine; decant the remainder into a sauce boat. For me, the only other accompaniment I would like here is a huge bowl of buttered sprouts and some apple sauce. But as for you, dear reader, I couldn\u2019t possibly comment. Happy Christmas! Barley \u2018pilaf\u2019 with black trumpet mushrooms The garlic and parsley chopped together in this vegetarian dish is, almost, the key to its absolutely delicious taste.

Onions a la monegasque This charming and very tasty recipe is of a kind that will please everyone at the table, and is just the loveliest thing to have around over Christmas; perfect with cold ham and turkey or just on their own, of course. The finest rendering of the dish (its origins may be found among the pages of Elizabeth David) were those cooked by Stephen Markwick at my 50th birthday party.

      "body": "<p>A few hours before I\u2019m due to meet Micheal Ward, I get a text from his publicist. The photoshoot for this interview has finished more than an hour early \u2013 could I come a bit sooner? I race to a caf\u00e9 in Blackheath, plush south London. When I arrive, Ward has already finished lunch. These shoots normally overrun, I say. How come this one was over so quickly? \u201cI tried to warn them I was a model,\u201d he smirks. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p> <p>He certainly seems to. A year ago, Ward was entirely unknown as an actor. He was working for the e-commerce sites of brands like JD Sports, modelling athleisure. (Apparently there\u2019s still a picture of him somewhere, deep in the bowels of the JD sports website.) Now 21, he\u2019s bagged leading roles in two of the most high-profile portrayals of British gang life in years. In the first, Netflix\u2019s revival of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/31/ronan-bennett-top-boy-series-three-interview-netflix-drake\" title=\"\">Top Boy</a></em>, he plays Jamie, an east London boy climbing the rungs of a Hackney drug-dealing gang while simultaneously looking after his two young brothers. And there\u2019s the upcoming feature film <em>Blue Story</em>, based on the spoken word performer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1lHfwjaSrnvrfmz1vCE01Q\" title=\"\">Rapman</a>\u2019s wildly popular YouTube series about south London gang violence, in which Ward plays the brother of a gang member who gets dragged into a postcode war.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5askXpPvUeA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5askXpPvUeA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Word on the street: trailer for Blue Story starring Micheal Ward</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ward is beaming about it all. He has the energy of someone who can\u2019t quite believe what\u2019s happening. He\u2019s just returned from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/24/bet-awards-2019-cardi-b-nipsey-hussle-beyonce-bruno-mars\" title=\"\">BET Awards</a>, in Atlanta, and he says he\u2019s never been in a room with so many celebrities: Lil\u2019 Kim, the rising rap star DaBaby. His excitement is infectious. When I ask him if he\u2019s enjoying himself he bursts into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cThe last two years have been the best two years of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you get a chance to travel, it\u2019s a big blessing. Then actually doing it for work? And it\u2019s <em>free</em>? I\u2019m enjoying it, boy. Everywhere I go it\u2019s good vibes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I come from that world.

His sentences are peppered with east London idioms and tend to begin with a \u201cyeah man\u201d and finish with a \u201cyou know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d He makes scripts full of London slang feel real and genuine, overcoming a common pitfall of lesser British dramas that try too hard with the grittiness. Now, when he reads something in a script that feels forced, he\u2019ll speak up, offer his opinion. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve got better at,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve started to say no. No one says \u2018bruv\u2019 and \u2018fam\u2019 in every sentence. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p> <p>Ward hopes <em>Blue Story</em> will become a timeless street movie in the vein of <em>Boyz n the Hood</em>, the 90s teen drama. Unlike <em>Top Boy</em>, which is fictional, <em>Blue Story</em> is drawn from real life; a number of former gang members consulted on the script and were present on set, confirming the accuracy of the actors\u2019 portrayals. It tells the truth about south London violence, Ward says. \u201cI come from that world. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve been involved in it, but I\u2019ve seen stuff that happens in <em>Top Boy </em>and <em>Blue Story</em> around me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cad01ceddbc007244b28b64db2f50d3471792b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad01ceddbc007244b28b64db2f50d3471792b40/625_815_5720_3433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We come from Jamaica, literally from the mud\u2019: Ward wears floral shirt by representclo.com; trousers by numeroventuno.com; gold chain by sergedenimes.com; and earring Micheal\u2019s own.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We come from Jamaica, literally from the mud\u2019: Ward wears floral shirt by <a href=\"https://representclo.com/\">representclo.com</a>; trousers by <a href=\"https://www.numeroventuno.com/en-gb/\">numeroventuno.com</a>; gold chain by <a href=\"https://www.sergedenimes.com/\">sergedenimes.com</a>; and earring Micheal\u2019s own.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Titlow/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ward was born in Jamaica, but he grew up in Romford, Essex, where every now and then he would watch a seemingly innocuous event escalate to dangerous levels. \u201cI\u2019ve seen fights happen over something so small it could have been left behind, but that\u2019s been brought back up, because of some personal vendetta.\u201d</p> <p>Ward has never lived anything other than a law-abiding life, he says.

He explains that after he moved to Romford, when he was four, he played football non-stop. He was earmarked by coaches as a potential star of the future and he thought football was going to be his ticket to greater things. He didn\u2019t want drama to take over. \u201cYou\u2019re just thinking: this is stopping me from progressing in what I actually want to do so bun drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI was hustling the dream, basically.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53549efa6698b77d66dd74dfa702caabc2ccb35f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53549efa6698b77d66dd74dfa702caabc2ccb35f/1493_569_4374_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Jamie, wearing an open puffa jacket, in Top Boy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the rise: as Jamie in <em>Top Boy</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Harris/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, slowly, acting took over anyway. Drama class became less of a chore and more something to look forward to. Once he\u2019d decided to go all in, he signed up to a performing arts college. One of his teachers took a shine to him and when she left the school to work for an acting agency, she signed Ward up and began booking him small roles in music videos. He dropped everything to audition for <em>Top Boy</em>, initially for Jamie\u2019s younger brother: a carefree, bookish character he felt he was similar to. But the producers asked him to come back and read for Jamie. He doesn\u2019t know what they saw in him. \u201cI haven\u2019t trained,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me to even get an agent without any training or experience \u2013 what did any of them see in me? It\u2019s just a weird situation.\u201d</p> <p>In any case, working on these projects has given Ward a taste for these kinds of heavily researched dramas. Those are the projects he wants to do more of. He\u2019s mooted for star turns in big-hitting films next year, but he\u2019s hesitant to say more. \u201cSure, I\u2019d love to do some Marvel or <em>Star Wars</em> stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I want to tell important stories. Ones that help people understand different walks of life.\u201d</p> <p><em>Blue Story is in cinemas nationwide from 22 November </em></p> <p><em>Fashion editor Helen Seamons</em></p>",

Ward has never bothered to delete anything from his social media accounts, so you can see every moan about school (\u201cactually finding maths difficult now, this is the shit that annoys me\u201d) and every excited spasm about upcoming events (\u201cmight be having a party if bare people can come\u201d). There\u2019s a moment I\u2019m particularly interested in: in January 2013 he tweeted: \u201cIn drama \u2013 some dead lesson #leaveit.\u201d But by March the following year he\u2019d changed his mind. \u201cPractising drama script,\u201d he tweeted, and then, a few weeks later, \u201cHappy about my drama mark.\u201d By the following year he seems fully invested: \u201cDrama performance today #letsgetit.\u201d What changed? He explains that after he moved to Romford, when he was four, he played football non-stop. He was earmarked by coaches as a potential star of the future and he thought football was going to be his ticket to greater things. He didn\u2019t want drama to take over. \u201cYou\u2019re just thinking: this is stopping me from progressing in what I actually want to do so bun drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI was hustling the dream, basically.\u201d But, slowly, acting took over anyway. Drama class became less of a chore and more something to look forward to. Once he\u2019d decided to go all in, he signed up to a performing arts college. One of his teachers took a shine to him and when she left the school to work for an acting agency, she signed Ward up and began booking him small roles in music videos. He dropped everything to audition for Top Boy, initially for Jamie\u2019s younger brother: a carefree, bookish character he felt he was similar to. But the producers asked him to come back and read for Jamie. He doesn\u2019t know what they saw in him. \u201cI haven\u2019t trained,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me to even get an agent without any training or experience \u2013 what did any of them see in me? It\u2019s just a weird situation.\u201d In any case, working on these projects has given Ward a taste for these kinds of heavily researched dramas. Those are the projects he wants to do more of. He\u2019s mooted for star turns in big-hitting films next year, but he\u2019s hesitant to say more. \u201cSure, I\u2019d love to do some Marvel or Star Wars stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I want to tell important stories. Ones that help people understand different walks of life.\u201d Blue Story is in cinemas nationwide from 22 November Fashion editor Helen Seamons",

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.marypoppinsonstage.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mary Poppins</a></strong> can be relied upon to return. We have watched her neat figure ascending skywards holding the umbrella with the green parrot\u2019s head so often \u2013 in PL Travers\u2019s books, watching the 1964 Disney film and in the recent sequel \u2013 her back ramrod straight, her hair glossily black as a wooden doll\u2019s. And though some of us might watch her depart with a lump in our throats, we have known that, somehow, she always finds her way back. Now, here she is again, practically perfect in every way, in a glorious revisiting of the 2004 Cameron Mackintosh musical, directed by Richard Eyre. You will not find a more theatrically escapist outing in London this winter.</p> <p>Zizi Strallen\u2019s delicious Mary Poppins is in love with herself \u2013 revelling in the pleasure of neatly tying the sash of a starched apron around her waist, of turning her toes out into first position, of patting her hair approvingly in the glass. She has sparkling eyes, a radiant smile and a carpet bag. Who could ask for more? And watch the way she heads upstairs, her head held high like a swan\u2019s. Nor does Strallen neglect the underlying mystery of the role because\u2026 who is Mary? On the face of it, she is a prude \u2013 rebuffing cheerful Bert\u2019s advances.

We have watched her neat figure ascending skywards holding the umbrella with the green parrot\u2019s head so often \u2013 in PL Travers\u2019s books, watching the 1964 Disney film and in the recent sequel \u2013 her back ramrod straight, her hair glossily black as a wooden doll\u2019s. And though some of us might watch her depart with a lump in our throats, we have known that, somehow, she always finds her way back. Now, here she is again, practically perfect in every way, in a glorious revisiting of the 2004 Cameron Mackintosh musical, directed by Richard Eyre. You will not find a more theatrically escapist outing in London this winter. Zizi Strallen\u2019s delicious Mary Poppins is in love with herself \u2013 revelling in the pleasure of neatly tying the sash of a starched apron around her waist, of turning her toes out into first position, of patting her hair approvingly in the glass. She has sparkling eyes, a radiant smile and a carpet bag. Who could ask for more? And watch the way she heads upstairs, her head held high like a swan\u2019s. Nor does Strallen neglect the underlying mystery of the role because\u2026 who is Mary? On the face of it, she is a prude \u2013 rebuffing cheerful Bert\u2019s advances. But Strallen, although suitably secretive, allows one to speculate idly about whether Mary might be more available to her \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d once our backs are turned.

      "bodyText": "Jos Buttler heads into his first Test back as England\u2019s full-time wicketkeeper claiming to have a \u201cnothing to lose\u201d attitude and a refreshed mind following the emotionally draining World Cup and Ashes summer. Buttler\u2019s first-innings 110 and some fine glovework behind the stumps were among the chief plus-points for England as they chewed over a slightly frustrating draw in their final warm-up before Thursday\u2019s first Test against New Zealand. The 29-year-old has averaged 36 with the bat since his recall to the side last summer and was their second highest run-scorer after Joe Root during this time. Yet with no defined role in the lower-middle order, he was also starting to look like a luxury a flaky England line-up could not necessarily afford. But Jonny Bairstow\u2019s low-key summer against the red ball \u2013 and a desire by Ed Smith, the national selector, to convince the Yorkshireman his future lies as a specialist batsman \u2013 has opened up a second chance for Buttler as wicketkeeper. And though Buttler declined to set any long-term targets here \u2013 perhaps in part due to Bairstow still coming to terms with the demotion, or his own previous struggle keeping in all formats back in 2015 \u2013 he feels energised by additional responsibility after five weeks off at the end of England\u2019s epic home summer. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing to lose with the bat or the gloves,\u201d said Buttler, whose sixth first-class century allied attack with defence, spread over three-and-half hours but with 11 fours and four sixes. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time to be involved with a new head coach [Chris Silverwood]. It\u2019s a new challenge and I\u2019m going to throw myself into it. \u201cIt was a tough summer \u2013 physically and emotionally \u2013 great fun, a huge challenge and one you look back on with real fondness. But it took a lot out of most of us. The time we have had off has been invaluable. \u201cI had a couple of net sessions at Somerset with Marcus Trescothick during this time. I really enjoyed that and got a lot out of it. It gave some building blocks to come here feeling in good touch.\u201d Buttler was speaking after England\u2019s three-day match against New Zealand A ended much like their previous visit to these shores: a lower-order rearguard leaving them two wickets short of forcing a win. In Christchurch 18 months ago a Test series was lost 1-0 because of it. Here in sleepy Whangarei, Root\u2019s men at least know it will mean little should they prevail come the main event. Having posted 405 all out in reply to New Zealand A\u2019s 302 for six declared on the opening day \u2013 something that ultimately made a game of it \u2013 the hosts began the final session on 129 for eight. Jofra Archer and Sam Curran had claimed three wickets apiece and with a mere 26-run lead on the board, victory was in sight. But Will Sommerville and Ajaz Patel, two spinners with precisely zero first-class half-centuries between them, dug in for a stand of 22.4 overs and 40 runs that prompted handshakes once Root decided enough was enough. All five members of the attack attempted to pick the lock, as well as the captain himself, but none succeeded. Now there is a caveat of course. England\u2019s bowlers were never going to truly pop a lung so close to the main event, even if Silverwood had lobbied for the fixture to carry first-class status and thus ensure something was always riding on it. But on a flat pitch, Archer\u2019s importance as a potential game-breaker overseas stood out again, something slightly worrying in itself given the 24-year-old fast bowler is yet to play his first Test match away from home. Having put Hamish Rutherford out of the game on day one \u2013 the batsman suffering concussion after being struck on the helmet \u2013 Archer made immediate inroads at the start of the home side\u2019s second innings.

      "body": "<p>On the six-hour boat ride down the Iriri river to Manolito, there is almost no other traffic and only a handful of small homes. At its widest and calmest, the vast expanse of water is a flawless mirror of blue sky and green canopy. At its narrowest and roughest, the water churns around boulders eroded into the shapes of battlements and breaching whales. Parrots fly above the treetops. Fish feast on fallen blossoms. Kingfishers perch on riverside branches while herons await their prey on midstream rocks with their wings outstretched. White and yellow butterflies stumble across the river at remarkable speeds.</p> <p>It is in this idyllic setting, deep inside the Amazon rainforest, that a nascent alliance of traditional communities, climate activists and academics is re-imagining what the world\u2019s greatest forest was, what it can be and who can best defend it.</p> <p>The gathering in Manolito, a riverine community of half a dozen wooden buildings in Terra do Meio (Middle Earth), contrasts sharply with what is happening elsewhere in the rainforest. Manmade fires continue to ravage swathes of Brazilian land. Scientists say the forest must be protected if the world is to avoid dangerous levels of global heating, yet the government of the far-right president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/26/fires-are-devouring-the-amazon-and-jair-bolsonaro-is-to-blame\" title=\"\">Jair Bolsonaro </a>has given the green light to farmers, miners and loggers to enter the region and cut down trees. The results will be apparent on Monday, when the government releases the latest annual deforestation figures.</p> <p>The forest\u2019s traditional guardians<strong> </strong>\u2013 indigenous, riverine and quilombola (descendent of rebel slaves) communities \u2013 are expecting the worst and starting to fight back. Forging new alliances with young activists from Europe, they hope the connections will lead to more international support and greater overseas prominence for their long struggle to defend their land against invasion.</p> <p>The line-up in Manolito is eclectic. Extinction Rebellion organisers from the UK and school climate strikers from Belgium have worked alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/20/this-much-i-know-nadya-tolokonnikova-pussy-riot\" title=\"\">Nadya Tolokonnikova</a> from the Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot, learning about the forest\u2019s history and role, and sharing ideas on how to defend it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/archive-zip/giv-3902P476i98gVO5O/\" data-alt=\"Brazil map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/archive-zip/giv-3902P476i98gVO5O/\">Brazil map</a> </figure>  <p>Although it is 12 hours by bus and boat from the nearest city, this stronghold of nature is no longer far from the frontline of devastation.

This leaves them powerless to stop further intrusions. Anthropologists say they are now among the most endangered tribes in Brazil.</p> <p>There are other traditional forest dwellers looking for new allies, as they face the most hostile government since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/30/brazil-bolsonaro-regime-military-dictatorship\" title=\"\">military dictatorship </a>that ended in 1985. The indigenous shaman and figurehead <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO_Fd4AbNbU\" title=\"\">Davi Kopenawa Yanomami </a>sees hope in the youth climate movement that has spread across the world in the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of thinking and it\u2019s very strong. The young from the cities are listening to the cry of the Amazon. They see the fire and the deforestation and they know that you can\u2019t keep killing trees,\u201d he said. All the world is talking about the Amazon. It\u2019s very good. The new generation wants to save the life of the forest and the planet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d332c0d0bb839505ebb430c4cfd428ec9fde4d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d332c0d0bb839505ebb430c4cfd428ec9fde4d8/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Forest Cop participants prepare to plants a rich mix of plants in Terra do Meio in the heart of the Amazon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Forest Cop participants prepare to plants a rich mix of plants in Terra do Meio in the heart of the Amazon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lilo Clareto/ISA/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The event\u2019s name \u2013 Amazon: Centro do Mundo \u2013 is a mission statement as much as a slogan on the participants\u2019 T-shirts. The message is simple: if humanity is serious about dealing with the climate crisis and the collapse of natural life-support systems, the priority should be protection of the world\u2019s biggest rainforest and its guardians in indigenous, riverine and quilombola communities.</p> <p>A key objective of the gathering \u2013 which is seen as a Forest COP \u2013 is to show that much of what the outside world believes about the Amazon is wrong. That it is more central to planetary life-support systems than most people realise. As well as being home to the richest biodiversity, and sequestering more carbon dioxide than any other land region, it is also a vital part of the planet\u2019s cooling system.</p> <p>The meeting room doubled as a classroom. Conditions were basic \u2013 half a dozen wooden benches, four tables and a blackboard \u2013 but the lessons were cutting-edge: several of Brazil\u2019s leading academics shared groundbreaking research on climate science, anthropology and archeology that upturned the popular history of the Amazon as an uninhabited, disease-ridden wilderness civilised by European colonialists and their descendants.</p> <p>The rainforest functions as the heart of the world, according to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/antonio_donato_nobre\" title=\"\">Earth scientist Antonio Nobre</a>. Even more than sucking CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere, the forest\u2019s most crucial role is to pump water \u2013 the blood of the planet \u2013 through rivers and across the skies in the form of vapour, he says. This is done by the transpiration of billions of plants. Over time, satellite data of the world\u2019s photosynthesis (essentially the green areas seen from space) shows the most regular pulse across the tropics, with by far the most vibrant beat in the Amazon. \u201cWhen we are hot, we sweat. The forest does this \u2013 pushing 20bn tonnes of water vapour into the atmosphere each day. It\u2019s part of the cooling system of the world,\u201d said Nobre. \u201cThe relationship between the forest and water is extremely important.\u201d</p> <p>This is nature at its most vibrant and super-diverse \u2013 but the forest is also far less wild than many realise. Brazil\u2019s leading archeologist, Eduardo Neves of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, came into the gathering with a ceramic fragment and a handful of black soil he had picked up outside. This, he said, was a sign the forest in this area was cultivated.</p> <p>The Amazon rainforest is made up of 360bn trees from at least 16,000 species (compared with just 72 species of trees in all of the United States, according to the scientists at the meeting). But just over 1% of the species account for almost half of the trees. Many of this super-dominant group were trees used by humans, such as acai (the most common tree in the forest), which is a primary source of nutrition in the Amazon. This is unlikely to be an accident, according to Neves. \u201cThis shows that the forest is not just the product of natural forces, it was nurtured by indigenous knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>This was remarkably sustainable. For about 10,000 years, the indigenous residents of the forest cleared less than 0.5% of the Amazon while planting productive trees that enriched the soil and increased biodiversity, Neves said. The population thrived, reaching at least 8 million before European colonialists arrived, bringing diseases such as malaria, influenza and measles that \u2013 along with slavery and violence \u2013 wiped out 90% of the Amazon\u2019s indigenous population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3027a12f4b989815969d83e955e713ef83901744\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3027a12f4b989815969d83e955e713ef83901744/0_0_3543_2372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anita Juruna, a Brazilian indigenous activist, and British climate strike student Elijah McKenzie-Jackson at the alternative climate conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anita Juruna, a Brazilian indigenous activist, and British climate strike student Elijah McKenzie-Jackson at the alternative climate conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lilo Clareto/ISA/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the past half-century, it is the forest that has suffered. A fifth of the Brazilian Amazon has been lost. Mega-projects are a major threat. Bebere Bemarai, of the Xikrin people, said his community at Trincheira Bakaja was affected by a series of new mega-projects as well as the centuries-old threats from land-grabbers and miners. The Amazon\u2019s biggest dam, Belo Monte, which goes into full operation next year, has already devastated the Xingu river, killing fish and ruining livelihoods, he said. Next he fears a renewed push for a giant new Canadian gold mine, Belo Sun, in the same region. \u201cEvery day is a struggle. In every region it\u2019s the same,\u201d he told the group. \u201cOur people will go to fight with you. Let\u2019s help our families.\u201d</p> <p>Tribes that were once enemies are now allying with each other and joining hands with two other former enemies \u2013 ribeirinhos (descendants of rubber tappers from the northeast) and quilombolas (descendants of rebel African slaves). These traditional forest dwellers share a common threat of encroachment by companies, government authorities and land-grabbers as the Amazon opens up and economic and political pressures increase.</p> <p>Maria do Socorro Silva, a quilombola leader from Barcarena, is opposing a mine \u2013 powered by the Belo Monte dam \u2013 and a Norwegian-owned alumina processing factory. \u201cThe company destroyed everything. They took my past and my future,\u201d she told the meeting. \u201cThe river is poisoned. Future generations are born dead. The people of the forest aren\u2019t protected. We decided to sacrifice our generation. We eat our poisoned food, but we don\u2019t sell.\u201d</p> <p>Without them, the forest is more vulnerable. More than cattle or soy, the biggest single driver of deforestation is land-grabbing for property speculation. Scarcely a tenth of the cleared land is put to use. Clearing forest increases the value of land 50- to 100-fold. With so much at stake, anyone standing in the way is dangerous, which is perhaps why only those with an attachment to the land are willing to risk their lives.</p> <p>Mauricio Torres, a social scientist at the University of Par\u00e1, said it was no coincidence that deforestation stopped at the borders of indigenous territory and the extractive reserves of indigenous people. It\u2019s not because the state is protecting those areas but because the residents defend their land. That\u2019s also why these areas have the highest murder rates,\u201d he said in a talk after a dinner of locally produced food. \u201cThe only reason this area is still beautiful is because of the victories of the local riverine people who fought for it. I\u2019ve been studying this most of my life, and what I have learned is the best way to protect the forest is to support the traditional families who live there.\u201d</p> <p>To do this, some participants at the meeting proposed an international boycott of products that degrade the Amazon, such as soy and beef, and greater promotion of sustainable native fruits, such as acai and cupua\u00e7u. Others said nature \u2013 particularly the rainforests \u2013 should be put at the heart of discussions at the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/news/cop25-will-take-place-in-madrid-from-2-to-13-december-2019\" title=\"\">United Nations climate talks </a>that will be held in Madrid next month. Other plans will be discussed at greater length at a bigger civil society meeting in Altamira.</p> <p>Some of the European visitors said they were already revising how they see climate action. \u201cThe people of the forest and the forest itself completely depend on each other. This has changed the way I think. It\u2019s not man and nature. They depend on each other. They can thrive together. That\u2019s the big thing I will be taking back. The problem is not humans, it is the system,\u201d said Alejandra Piazzolla, an XR Youth campaigner who recently graduated from university.</p> <p>Others said it made them appreciate that only focusing on emissions reductions can hurt some of the poorest communities, who are left with destructive dams and mines that provide the minerals for wind and solar farms. \u201cWe need to rebuild the forest because it is our heart. But we need to learn from the people here how to do that. It\u2019s not just about new technology. It\u2019s about the way we live. We can\u2019t just focus on climate change. We have to focus on climate justice,\u201d said Adelaide Charlier, an 18-year-old climate striker from Belgium, who spent six weeks on a sailboat to reach Brazil to keep her carbon emissions as close to zero as possible.</p> <p>Tiana Jacout, an Extinction Rebellion organiser from Somerset, said she would urge the organisation to include global justice among its demands. \u201cThe Amazon now feels really, really personal. It\u2019s impossible to come here and not fall in love with the forest and the river and the people. And it is impossible to think that anyone would destroy that.\u201d</p> <h2>Land-grabbers</h2> <p>The biggest single driver of deforestation is property speculation. Wealthy individuals from faraway cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba hire grileiros (land-grabbers) to invade and clear the forest, then bribe officials to secure ownership rights. The value of the land increases 50- to 100-fold. Most of it goes unused.</p> <h2>Mining</h2> <p>Tens of thousands of garimpeiros (illegal miners) clear forest and poison rivers while prospecting for gold. Even greater damage is done by corporate mega-mines, such as the one being planned at Belo Sun.</p> <h2>Logging</h2> <p>The vast majority of timber in Brazil is cut illegally.

      "bodyText": "On the six-hour boat ride down the Iriri river to Manolito, there is almost no other traffic and only a handful of small homes. At its widest and calmest, the vast expanse of water is a flawless mirror of blue sky and green canopy. At its narrowest and roughest, the water churns around boulders eroded into the shapes of battlements and breaching whales. Parrots fly above the treetops. Fish feast on fallen blossoms. Kingfishers perch on riverside branches while herons await their prey on midstream rocks with their wings outstretched. White and yellow butterflies stumble across the river at remarkable speeds. It is in this idyllic setting, deep inside the Amazon rainforest, that a nascent alliance of traditional communities, climate activists and academics is re-imagining what the world\u2019s greatest forest was, what it can be and who can best defend it. The gathering in Manolito, a riverine community of half a dozen wooden buildings in Terra do Meio (Middle Earth), contrasts sharply with what is happening elsewhere in the rainforest. Manmade fires continue to ravage swathes of Brazilian land. Scientists say the forest must be protected if the world is to avoid dangerous levels of global heating, yet the government of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has given the green light to farmers, miners and loggers to enter the region and cut down trees. The results will be apparent on Monday, when the government releases the latest annual deforestation figures. The forest\u2019s traditional guardians \u2013 indigenous, riverine and quilombola (descendent of rebel slaves) communities \u2013 are expecting the worst and starting to fight back. Forging new alliances with young activists from Europe, they hope the connections will lead to more international support and greater overseas prominence for their long struggle to defend their land against invasion. The line-up in Manolito is eclectic. Extinction Rebellion organisers from the UK and school climate strikers from Belgium have worked alongside Nadya Tolokonnikova from the Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot, learning about the forest\u2019s history and role, and sharing ideas on how to defend it. Although it is 12 hours by bus and boat from the nearest city, this stronghold of nature is no longer far from the frontline of devastation. Most of Terra do Meio (a mosaic of conservation areas, indigenous territory and reserves) is inside Altamira \u2013 the huge municipality that has suffered the most fires, the worst deforestation and the highest murder rate in the Amazon. To get here, the participants travelled through the indigenous territory of Cachoeira Seca, which has been invaded by so many land-grabbers and illegal miners that the small population of Arara Indians are outnumbered 10 to one in their own land. This leaves them powerless to stop further intrusions. Anthropologists say they are now among the most endangered tribes in Brazil. There are other traditional forest dwellers looking for new allies, as they face the most hostile government since the military dictatorship that ended in 1985. The indigenous shaman and figurehead Davi Kopenawa Yanomami sees hope in the youth climate movement that has spread across the world in the past year. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of thinking and it\u2019s very strong. The young from the cities are listening to the cry of the Amazon. They see the fire and the deforestation and they know that you can\u2019t keep killing trees,\u201d he said. All the world is talking about the Amazon. It\u2019s very good. The new generation wants to save the life of the forest and the planet.\u201d The event\u2019s name \u2013 Amazon: Centro do Mundo \u2013 is a mission statement as much as a slogan on the participants\u2019 T-shirts. The message is simple: if humanity is serious about dealing with the climate crisis and the collapse of natural life-support systems, the priority should be protection of the world\u2019s biggest rainforest and its guardians in indigenous, riverine and quilombola communities. A key objective of the gathering \u2013 which is seen as a Forest COP \u2013 is to show that much of what the outside world believes about the Amazon is wrong. That it is more central to planetary life-support systems than most people realise. As well as being home to the richest biodiversity, and sequestering more carbon dioxide than any other land region, it is also a vital part of the planet\u2019s cooling system. The meeting room doubled as a classroom. Conditions were basic \u2013 half a dozen wooden benches, four tables and a blackboard \u2013 but the lessons were cutting-edge: several of Brazil\u2019s leading academics shared groundbreaking research on climate science, anthropology and archeology that upturned the popular history of the Amazon as an uninhabited, disease-ridden wilderness civilised by European colonialists and their descendants. The rainforest functions as the heart of the world, according to Earth scientist Antonio Nobre. Even more than sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere, the forest\u2019s most crucial role is to pump water \u2013 the blood of the planet \u2013 through rivers and across the skies in the form of vapour, he says. This is done by the transpiration of billions of plants. Over time, satellite data of the world\u2019s photosynthesis (essentially the green areas seen from space) shows the most regular pulse across the tropics, with by far the most vibrant beat in the Amazon. \u201cWhen we are hot, we sweat. The forest does this \u2013 pushing 20bn tonnes of water vapour into the atmosphere each day. It\u2019s part of the cooling system of the world,\u201d said Nobre. \u201cThe relationship between the forest and water is extremely important.\u201d This is nature at its most vibrant and super-diverse \u2013 but the forest is also far less wild than many realise. Brazil\u2019s leading archeologist, Eduardo Neves of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, came into the gathering with a ceramic fragment and a handful of black soil he had picked up outside. This, he said, was a sign the forest in this area was cultivated. The Amazon rainforest is made up of 360bn trees from at least 16,000 species (compared with just 72 species of trees in all of the United States, according to the scientists at the meeting). But just over 1% of the species account for almost half of the trees. Many of this super-dominant group were trees used by humans, such as acai (the most common tree in the forest), which is a primary source of nutrition in the Amazon. This is unlikely to be an accident, according to Neves. \u201cThis shows that the forest is not just the product of natural forces, it was nurtured by indigenous knowledge.\u201d This was remarkably sustainable. For about 10,000 years, the indigenous residents of the forest cleared less than 0.5% of the Amazon while planting productive trees that enriched the soil and increased biodiversity, Neves said. The population thrived, reaching at least 8 million before European colonialists arrived, bringing diseases such as malaria, influenza and measles that \u2013 along with slavery and violence \u2013 wiped out 90% of the Amazon\u2019s indigenous population. Over the past half-century, it is the forest that has suffered. A fifth of the Brazilian Amazon has been lost. Mega-projects are a major threat. Bebere Bemarai, of the Xikrin people, said his community at Trincheira Bakaja was affected by a series of new mega-projects as well as the centuries-old threats from land-grabbers and miners. The Amazon\u2019s biggest dam, Belo Monte, which goes into full operation next year, has already devastated the Xingu river, killing fish and ruining livelihoods, he said. Next he fears a renewed push for a giant new Canadian gold mine, Belo Sun, in the same region. \u201cEvery day is a struggle. In every region it\u2019s the same,\u201d he told the group. \u201cOur people will go to fight with you. Let\u2019s help our families.\u201d Tribes that were once enemies are now allying with each other and joining hands with two other former enemies \u2013 ribeirinhos (descendants of rubber tappers from the northeast) and quilombolas (descendants of rebel African slaves). These traditional forest dwellers share a common threat of encroachment by companies, government authorities and land-grabbers as the Amazon opens up and economic and political pressures increase. Maria do Socorro Silva, a quilombola leader from Barcarena, is opposing a mine \u2013 powered by the Belo Monte dam \u2013 and a Norwegian-owned alumina processing factory. \u201cThe company destroyed everything. They took my past and my future,\u201d she told the meeting. \u201cThe river is poisoned. Future generations are born dead. The people of the forest aren\u2019t protected. We decided to sacrifice our generation. We eat our poisoned food, but we don\u2019t sell.\u201d Without them, the forest is more vulnerable. More than cattle or soy, the biggest single driver of deforestation is land-grabbing for property speculation. Scarcely a tenth of the cleared land is put to use. Clearing forest increases the value of land 50- to 100-fold. With so much at stake, anyone standing in the way is dangerous, which is perhaps why only those with an attachment to the land are willing to risk their lives. Mauricio Torres, a social scientist at the University of Par\u00e1, said it was no coincidence that deforestation stopped at the borders of indigenous territory and the extractive reserves of indigenous people. It\u2019s not because the state is protecting those areas but because the residents defend their land. That\u2019s also why these areas have the highest murder rates,\u201d he said in a talk after a dinner of locally produced food. \u201cThe only reason this area is still beautiful is because of the victories of the local riverine people who fought for it. I\u2019ve been studying this most of my life, and what I have learned is the best way to protect the forest is to support the traditional families who live there.\u201d To do this, some participants at the meeting proposed an international boycott of products that degrade the Amazon, such as soy and beef, and greater promotion of sustainable native fruits, such as acai and cupua\u00e7u. Others said nature \u2013 particularly the rainforests \u2013 should be put at the heart of discussions at the United Nations climate talks that will be held in Madrid next month. Other plans will be discussed at greater length at a bigger civil society meeting in Altamira. Some of the European visitors said they were already revising how they see climate action. \u201cThe people of the forest and the forest itself completely depend on each other. This has changed the way I think. It\u2019s not man and nature. They depend on each other. They can thrive together. That\u2019s the big thing I will be taking back. The problem is not humans, it is the system,\u201d said Alejandra Piazzolla, an XR Youth campaigner who recently graduated from university. Others said it made them appreciate that only focusing on emissions reductions can hurt some of the poorest communities, who are left with destructive dams and mines that provide the minerals for wind and solar farms. \u201cWe need to rebuild the forest because it is our heart. But we need to learn from the people here how to do that. It\u2019s not just about new technology. It\u2019s about the way we live. We can\u2019t just focus on climate change. We have to focus on climate justice,\u201d said Adelaide Charlier, an 18-year-old climate striker from Belgium, who spent six weeks on a sailboat to reach Brazil to keep her carbon emissions as close to zero as possible. Tiana Jacout, an Extinction Rebellion organiser from Somerset, said she would urge the organisation to include global justice among its demands. \u201cThe Amazon now feels really, really personal. It\u2019s impossible to come here and not fall in love with the forest and the river and the people. And it is impossible to think that anyone would destroy that.\u201d Land-grabbers The biggest single driver of deforestation is property speculation. Wealthy individuals from faraway cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba hire grileiros (land-grabbers) to invade and clear the forest, then bribe officials to secure ownership rights. The value of the land increases 50- to 100-fold. Most of it goes unused. Mining Tens of thousands of garimpeiros (illegal miners) clear forest and poison rivers while prospecting for gold. Even greater damage is done by corporate mega-mines, such as the one being planned at Belo Sun. Logging The vast majority of timber in Brazil is cut illegally. The forest trails opened by loggers are often later used as access routes by land grabbers. Farming Cattle ranching has devastated the Amazon as trees are cut down to create pastures. Soy monocultures are an increasing threat, particularly in the south. Many of these products are sold in Europe, the US, China and Japan. Infrastructure projects Since the military dictatorship began building the Trans-Amazonian highway in the 1970s, deforestation has increased. As well as other roads, hydroelectric dams are submerging more forest and bringing more people to the region.",

I want some enlarged prostate avenger to emerge from the political wilderness and say: \u201cIf you let my country go now, that\u2019ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don\u2019t, I will look for you, I will find you and I will beat you in an election through legitimate democratic mechanisms.\u201d But I am not sure such a figure exists. And anyway, in the words of every Liam Neeson action movie villain ever, at the end of the day: \u201cIt was all just business. It wasn\u2019t ever personal.\u201d Stewart Lee\u2019s new book, March of the Lemmings, is available now, as is a download and actual DVD of his last standup show, Content Provider.

      "body": "<p>In 2015, while standing in front of a series of portraits by the American photographer Larry Sultan in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Pat Martin suddenly found himself in tears. \u201cFor weeks my friends had been telling me, \u2018You have to see the Sultan retrospective, you\u2019ll love it,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I did, but it triggered me. It was the first time I cried from seeing photographs that weren\u2019t personal to me.\u201d</p> <p>The portraits in question were of Sultan\u2019s elderly parents, whom he had photographed throughout the 1980s when they were living in a retirement community in Palm Springs. He called the series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/02/larry-sultan-pictures-from-home-review\" title=\"\">Pictures </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/02/larry-sultan-pictures-from-home-review\" title=\"\">from Home</a> </em>and, in a related text, described their deeper motivation: \u201cI realise that beyond the rolls of film and the few good pictures, the demands of my project and my confusion about its meaning, is the wish to take photography literally. To stop time. I want my parents to live for ever.\u201d</p> <p>Martin, a young Los Angeles-based photographer still struggling to define his own style, found the Sultan exhibition overwhelming but not in the way he had expected. \u201cThe portraits were just so beautiful but, alongside that, there was this realisation that, however good I became as a photographer, I could never make those kinds of images. I remember thinking, I don\u2019t know my father and I don\u2019t know if my mother will reach old age. My family album starts with me being born and continues for just a few of my birthdays. Then, it\u2019s just blank. Completely blank. Nothing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d5375c88b37b488db906c891bb8425e945ae96a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5375c88b37b488db906c891bb8425e945ae96a1/0_0_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Martin\u2019s mother in one of the portraits from the series Goldie that won Martin the prize.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gail and Beaux, 2018, one of the two portraits from the series Goldie (Mother) that won Martin the Taylor Wessing prize.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pat Martin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pat Martin was three years old when his father, who made that truncated family album, disappeared from his life, leaving him and his older brother, Drew, with their mother, Gail. So began an anxious, intermittently chaotic upbringing that lasted until he was 17, defined to a great degree by his mother\u2019s struggles with addiction and mental health issues. As a child, he was caught up in the fallout of her troubled life: her dramatically shifting moods; the coming and going of her equally wayward friends; her sudden, unexplained absences, which he later found out were often due to protracted spells in drug rehabilitation clinics. As an adult of 27, he is still addressing the issues of confusion and shame that linger from that uncertain time. \u201cI\u2019m dealing with it in therapy,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don\u2019t plan to stop any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>Although Martin did not know it at the time, his emotional reaction to Larry Sultan\u2019s <em>Letters From Home </em>was a pivotal moment in a creative journey that culminated in a glittering evening at the National Portrait Gallery, London, earlier this month, when to his surprise he was announced as the winner of the 2019 Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait prize. Though Martin\u2019s name was unfamiliar to most of the photography insiders present, his portraits, arranged in a line in an adjacent gallery, had been causing a stir all evening. Intimate, raw, direct, they portrayed an elderly woman in often arresting close-up, her dyed auburn hair framing pale, heavy features. In one, she is staring sternly at the camera, clutching a tiny dog, and wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a large dog face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5771b600970137208d5eeeeea1add0fb2c4d5006\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5771b600970137208d5eeeeea1add0fb2c4d5006/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Martin, winner of the NPG Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait prize, photographed outside the National Portrait Gallery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pat Martin, winner of the NPG Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait prize, photographed outside the National Portrait Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amit Lennon/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most intimate, though, is the most powerful. In it, her face fills the frame and her mottled skin is a landscape of lived experience, while her averted gaze conveys a brooding preoccupation. It is titled <em>Mom (our last one)</em>. It was taken just two months before his mother\u2019s death in January of this year.</p> <p>\u201cAll the photographs submitted to the Taylor Wessing award are judged blind,\u201d says Magda Keaney, senior curator of photographs at the gallery and one of this year\u2019s judges. \u201cWith Pat\u2019s work, as with the others, we had no idea of the narrative behind the portraits or even his name or age. All we had were the images and the titles \u2013 and <em>Mom (our last one) </em>is, of course, a significant title.\u201d</p> <p>The judges were struck above all, she says, by the tension in his portraits. \u201cThey are tender images, but his gaze is unflinching. He is portraying his mother as she is. His technique is incredibly sophisticated for one so young \u2013 the pose, the proximity, the play of the light. The apparent simplicity of his portraits belies his ability.\u201d</p> <p>A few days after the awards ceremony, I meet Pat Martin at the National Portrait Gallery. Neatly dressed, softly spoken and quietly self-assured, he is, he says, adjusting to the surreal events of the previous days. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8121973695e92209fe93904d1edab6f00546ffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8121973695e92209fe93904d1edab6f00546ffb/0_0_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mom (Our Last One) from the series Goldie (Mother) by Pat Martin, 2018\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mom (our last one), the other prize-winning portrait from the series Goldie (Mother).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pat Martin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt still feels strange to me that the winning portrait is also my last true portrait of my mother,\u201d he says of <em>Mom (our last one).</em> \u201cThe session was almost exactly two months before her death. I didn\u2019t know then that it was going to be the last one, but there was a poignancy to it. Her best friend had just passed on. I wanted to make her feel better, distract her by taking some portraits, but it didn\u2019t work. No response. I put the camera away and I didn\u2019t take any proper portraits for the next month, then her health collapsed.\u201d</p> <p>Gail had been grappling with respiratory problems for several years. On one occasion, she had called him from a hospital bed in the middle of night after having been admitted for acute breathing problems.

His early childhood is shrouded in vague memories, half-truths and hand-me-down stories \u2013 and his mother remained unforthcoming to the end. \u201cI tried to get her to open up, but it was so frustrating. It was like talking to a child, really. And, of course, it was painful for her. There were moments when I\u2019d get some answers but mostly it was: \u2018I don\u2019t want to live in the past, only the present.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His childhood was marked most of all by her absences, which heightened his sense of anxiety. \u201cWhen I think back on my childhood,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s really just the inconsistency of my mother\u2019s presence that is very evident.\u201d</p> <p>One of Martin\u2019s earliest memories is of being looked after by some of his mother\u2019s friends and his sense of unease in their presence. Once, aged five, he awoke to find himself alone in the apartment. \u201cI guess my brother had said goodbye to me, but I had been half-asleep. When I woke up and no one was there, I ran outside, scared and crying. The manager of my building found me and brought me in.\u201d A friend of the family, who had been tasked with looking after the five-year-old child, was asleep in another room and remained unaware of the unfolding drama.</p> <p>A few years later, when his mother relapsed again, Martin\u2019s older brother, exasperated by her broken promises, left the family home for good. Drew and Gail did not communicate for several years, finally reconciling after Drew had children of his own. Throughout all this turmoil, the bond between mother and younger son somehow remained intact and even deepened.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to say that my mom wasn\u2019t messed up all the time,\u201d says Martin, \u201dShe was a functioning parent most of the time. She worked as a nurse. She would take me to and from school, make me my lunch. My mother loved me. I was such an extension of her happiness. I knew she was proud that I was her son and I looked so much like her. Plus, because of what we came though \u2013 having very little money, living from paycheck to paycheck, food stamps \u2013 we had a rapport based on our shared experience.\u201d </p> <p>Through his childhood and teenage years, his father would call him from time to time, their brief awkward chats only emphasising the distance between them. \u201cThere\u2019d be moments when he was kind of there in those phone calls,\u201c says Martin, looking down and fiddling with his watchstrap. \u201cI knew he was out there somewhere with his wife and his three daughters. Somewhere else.\u201d Speaking about his father, his body language shifts. He becomes fidgety and his sentences become clipped, his voice colder. When he turned 18, they attempted a reunion, but it ended badly. He has not heard from his father since his mother\u2019s death. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why, and that angers me,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3273496652be2168481c4b0fb97a901c28422009\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3273496652be2168481c4b0fb97a901c28422009/0_0_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"From the series Goldie (Mother) by photographer Pat Martin shown as part of his Taylor Wessing series.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From the series Goldie (Mother), shown as part of his Taylor Wessing series at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pat Martin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all that, he does not appear to be carrying a lot of anger or bitterness. \u201cI try and tell myself that I\u2019m not angry,\u201d he replies, \u201cbut I am. Less so, but it\u2019s still there. My mum was a trigger for my anger for so long, but when I learned that she had been diagnosed as bipolar, that helped explain a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Likewise the details of his mother\u2019s own fractured childhood which he pieced together from various stories he heard from her and those who knew her: a father who rejected her from birth, who beat her throughout her childhood and disowned her when, aged 19, she gave birth to his older brother, Drew. \u201cMy older brother is black,\u201d says Martin, \u201cwhich is another detail in the mix.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I realised I did not need to hold this secret any more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All this illumination came late to Martin, emerging fitfully in the years of reconciliation that followed his mother\u2019s final relapse \u2013 the point where she reached the place that recovering addicts refer to as rock bottom. That drama began when he was 17 and they were evicted from their apartment for rent arrears. He was subsequently taken in by the family of his best friend and he lived for a time, he says, smiling, \u201cunder their staircase like Harry Potter.\u201d He remembers it as a period of \u201chappiness and stability\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, his mother was free-falling. \u201cFor a whole year, we barely saw each other,\u201d he says, \u201cShe was going through it again, homeless, living in her car. I only found that out when she called to ask me to pick up the car from the police station. She had gotten arrested. She had the stuff in her car. A couple of days later, she called again to tell me she was going into rehab and gave me all the details.\u201d</p> <p>From that moment onwards, Pat Martin\u2019s mother seems finally to have found some peace. Three years out of rehab, she was finally reconciled with Drew, and her grandchildren became the focus of a newfound optimism that, though fragile, prevailed until her death. It was Drew, a photographer himself, who encouraged his younger brother to pursue the medium that has helped him make sense of this chaotic family narrative and, in doing so, create the searingly honest portraits that, even without the narrative behind them, have an emotional heft rare in contemporary photography.</p> <p>Which prompts one last question: why has he chosen to reveal that narrative in such painful detail? Why, in short, did he choose to tell his extraordinary story?</p> <p>\u201cI chose to tell it for myself.\u201d he replies without hesitation. \u201cThroughout middle school, high school, all my formative years, I hid the facts of my life. I didn\u2019t want anyone to see me as the poor kid with the mother who had a problem. One part of making this work for the past three years was the realisation that my mother would not be around for ever. The other part was the realisation that I did not need to hold this secret any more. When I talk to my brother about it, he puts it very simply: \u2018It\u2019s the truth.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>An exhibition of this year\u2019s Taylor Wessing prize shortlisted works is at the <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/taylor-wessing-photographic-portrait-prize-2019/exhibition/\" title=\"\">National Portrait Gallery</a>, London, until 16 February</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In 2015, while standing in front of a series of portraits by the American photographer Larry Sultan in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Pat Martin suddenly found himself in tears. \u201cFor weeks my friends had been telling me, \u2018You have to see the Sultan retrospective, you\u2019ll love it,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I did, but it triggered me. It was the first time I cried from seeing photographs that weren\u2019t personal to me.\u201d The portraits in question were of Sultan\u2019s elderly parents, whom he had photographed throughout the 1980s when they were living in a retirement community in Palm Springs. He called the series Pictures from Home and, in a related text, described their deeper motivation: \u201cI realise that beyond the rolls of film and the few good pictures, the demands of my project and my confusion about its meaning, is the wish to take photography literally. To stop time. I want my parents to live for ever.\u201d Martin, a young Los Angeles-based photographer still struggling to define his own style, found the Sultan exhibition overwhelming but not in the way he had expected. \u201cThe portraits were just so beautiful but, alongside that, there was this realisation that, however good I became as a photographer, I could never make those kinds of images. I remember thinking, I don\u2019t know my father and I don\u2019t know if my mother will reach old age. My family album starts with me being born and continues for just a few of my birthdays. Then, it\u2019s just blank. Completely blank. Nothing.\u201d Pat Martin was three years old when his father, who made that truncated family album, disappeared from his life, leaving him and his older brother, Drew, with their mother, Gail. So began an anxious, intermittently chaotic upbringing that lasted until he was 17, defined to a great degree by his mother\u2019s struggles with addiction and mental health issues. As a child, he was caught up in the fallout of her troubled life: her dramatically shifting moods; the coming and going of her equally wayward friends; her sudden, unexplained absences, which he later found out were often due to protracted spells in drug rehabilitation clinics. As an adult of 27, he is still addressing the issues of confusion and shame that linger from that uncertain time. \u201cI\u2019m dealing with it in therapy,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don\u2019t plan to stop any time soon.\u201d Although Martin did not know it at the time, his emotional reaction to Larry Sultan\u2019s Letters From Home was a pivotal moment in a creative journey that culminated in a glittering evening at the National Portrait Gallery, London, earlier this month, when to his surprise he was announced as the winner of the 2019 Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait prize. Though Martin\u2019s name was unfamiliar to most of the photography insiders present, his portraits, arranged in a line in an adjacent gallery, had been causing a stir all evening. Intimate, raw, direct, they portrayed an elderly woman in often arresting close-up, her dyed auburn hair framing pale, heavy features. In one, she is staring sternly at the camera, clutching a tiny dog, and wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a large dog face. The most intimate, though, is the most powerful. In it, her face fills the frame and her mottled skin is a landscape of lived experience, while her averted gaze conveys a brooding preoccupation. It is titled Mom (our last one). It was taken just two months before his mother\u2019s death in January of this year. \u201cAll the photographs submitted to the Taylor Wessing award are judged blind,\u201d says Magda Keaney, senior curator of photographs at the gallery and one of this year\u2019s judges. \u201cWith Pat\u2019s work, as with the others, we had no idea of the narrative behind the portraits or even his name or age. All we had were the images and the titles \u2013 and Mom (our last one) is, of course, a significant title.\u201d The judges were struck above all, she says, by the tension in his portraits. \u201cThey are tender images, but his gaze is unflinching. He is portraying his mother as she is. His technique is incredibly sophisticated for one so young \u2013 the pose, the proximity, the play of the light. The apparent simplicity of his portraits belies his ability.\u201d A few days after the awards ceremony, I meet Pat Martin at the National Portrait Gallery. Neatly dressed, softly spoken and quietly self-assured, he is, he says, adjusting to the surreal events of the previous days. \u201cIt still feels strange to me that the winning portrait is also my last true portrait of my mother,\u201d he says of Mom (our last one). \u201cThe session was almost exactly two months before her death. I didn\u2019t know then that it was going to be the last one, but there was a poignancy to it. Her best friend had just passed on. I wanted to make her feel better, distract her by taking some portraits, but it didn\u2019t work. No response. I put the camera away and I didn\u2019t take any proper portraits for the next month, then her health collapsed.\u201d Gail had been grappling with respiratory problems for several years. On one occasion, she had called him from a hospital bed in the middle of night after having been admitted for acute breathing problems. Afterwards, he remembers being \u201csuddenly aware that I would not have her in my life much longer.\u201d He began shooting portraits of her soon after she was discharged, slowly moving from observational shots to more considered portraits. That, too, was a pivotal moment. \u201cBefore then, I was just another photographer fishing for images on the street and taking portraits of my friends. I wasn\u2019t really feeling anything from it. My mom was the first subject that really made me want to go deeper, though it was a while before I took that on.\u201d How, though, did she take to the experience? \u201cShe was used to me always having a camera in my hand,\u201d he says, \u201cso I don\u2019t think she really thought about it too much. For her, it was more that I was directing my energy towards her.\u201d So was it a kind of collaboration? He pauses. \u201cMost of the time, yes, but at other times, no. My mom was not an easy subject. She would get bored quickly, like my young nephews do. Or impatient. If she was in a bad mood, it\u2019d be, \u2018Are you done?\u2019 or \u2018I really don\u2019t want to do this right now.\u2019\u201d Martin has edited down hundreds of images of his mother to just 10 portraits which, he says, \u201cmeet the standard I have set for myself\u201d. His touchstones are Emmet Gowin and Sally Mann, photographers for whom family is the most intimate and self-revealing subject. Martin\u2019s portraits of his mother are currently part of a bigger, ongoing series, \u201cessentially about my constructed family: my nephews, my brother and his partner, my girlfriend\u2019s family, some older folks that call me their grandson. It\u2019s the family I have chosen for myself.\u201d Winning the prize, he says, has helped him in his grieving, but I suspect that, like Larry Sultan, he is realising that family portraits of departed loved ones do not so much stop time, as remind us of the cruelty of its inexorable passing.

Somewhere else.\u201d Speaking about his father, his body language shifts. He becomes fidgety and his sentences become clipped, his voice colder. When he turned 18, they attempted a reunion, but it ended badly. He has not heard from his father since his mother\u2019s death. \u201cI don\u2019t really know why, and that angers me,\u201d he says. For all that, he does not appear to be carrying a lot of anger or bitterness. \u201cI try and tell myself that I\u2019m not angry,\u201d he replies, \u201cbut I am. Less so, but it\u2019s still there. My mum was a trigger for my anger for so long, but when I learned that she had been diagnosed as bipolar, that helped explain a lot.\u201d Likewise the details of his mother\u2019s own fractured childhood which he pieced together from various stories he heard from her and those who knew her: a father who rejected her from birth, who beat her throughout her childhood and disowned her when, aged 19, she gave birth to his older brother, Drew. \u201cMy older brother is black,\u201d says Martin, \u201cwhich is another detail in the mix.\u201d All this illumination came late to Martin, emerging fitfully in the years of reconciliation that followed his mother\u2019s final relapse \u2013 the point where she reached the place that recovering addicts refer to as rock bottom. That drama began when he was 17 and they were evicted from their apartment for rent arrears. He was subsequently taken in by the family of his best friend and he lived for a time, he says, smiling, \u201cunder their staircase like Harry Potter.\u201d He remembers it as a period of \u201chappiness and stability\u201d. Meanwhile, his mother was free-falling. \u201cFor a whole year, we barely saw each other,\u201d he says, \u201cShe was going through it again, homeless, living in her car. I only found that out when she called to ask me to pick up the car from the police station. She had gotten arrested. She had the stuff in her car. A couple of days later, she called again to tell me she was going into rehab and gave me all the details.\u201d From that moment onwards, Pat Martin\u2019s mother seems finally to have found some peace. Three years out of rehab, she was finally reconciled with Drew, and her grandchildren became the focus of a newfound optimism that, though fragile, prevailed until her death. It was Drew, a photographer himself, who encouraged his younger brother to pursue the medium that has helped him make sense of this chaotic family narrative and, in doing so, create the searingly honest portraits that, even without the narrative behind them, have an emotional heft rare in contemporary photography. Which prompts one last question: why has he chosen to reveal that narrative in such painful detail? Why, in short, did he choose to tell his extraordinary story? \u201cI chose to tell it for myself.\u201d he replies without hesitation. \u201cThroughout middle school, high school, all my formative years, I hid the facts of my life. I didn\u2019t want anyone to see me as the poor kid with the mother who had a problem. One part of making this work for the past three years was the realisation that my mother would not be around for ever. The other part was the realisation that I did not need to hold this secret any more. When I talk to my brother about it, he puts it very simply: \u2018It\u2019s the truth.\u2019\u201d An exhibition of this year\u2019s Taylor Wessing prize shortlisted works is at the National Portrait Gallery, London, until 16 February",

      "body": "<p>Late last year Spotify presented me with my Top 100 most listened to tracks of 2018 and, as ever when I\u2019m presented with some unknown version of myself, I couldn\u2019t wait to analyse it. Like a dog returning to its vomit, nothing fascinates me more than my own alien excretions. I could spend the rest of my life contorting my brain to view tagged pictures of myself, attempting to understand how others see me. But there it was, above the other great heroes of my year, Leonard Cohen and Ariana Grande. In the number one spot was White Noise. Not just White Noise \u2013 \u201cWhite Noise For Babies\u201d. I had listened to nothing all year as much as I had listened to flat soundscapes designed to soothe infants.</p> <p>I first came to white noise shortly after I moved to London from Dublin. I left Ireland in a hurry, with no good plans in place, no real reason to have come, and so lived for two years in a constant stressful flux. I worked temp jobs, I sub-let my bedroom, I relied on the generosity of my best friend to top up my Oyster card when I had nothing left. I felt flayed. London left nothing to the imagination.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as though I had moved from a village \u2013 Dublin is a major city, after all, and I\u2019d spent six years there after leaving home \u2013 but I was not prepared for what it felt like to constantly be physically shoved against strangers, how you could hear their mouth noises and video games and stupid voice notes all the time. How it was normal to live with five people instead of one or two, and how they might all be near you when you wanted to make a cup of tea at midnight. How there was never a moment of any day when you were alone until you climbed into your bed still sticky from fumes and the terrible food you conceded to eat on the journey back \u2013 weeping pathetically into your gummy M&amp;S wrap \u2013 and how that aloneness, though you\u2019d longed for it all day, would feel so embarrassing and awful.</p> <p>That was when I began to listen to white noise. I had complained to a friend that my bedroom allowed all the noise of my household into it when I was trying to work and she suggested I listen to rain sounds. It started doing so there at my desk when I was writing, and then the tube to whatever office I was temping at, and the bus from that office to a terrible date, and then again on the dawn journey home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It not only drowns out my thoughts, but doesn\u2019t actually allow them to exist at all for the time that I\u2019m listening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When the rain noises didn\u2019t seem to quite block out my surroundings any more I moved on to pure white noise, which combines aural frequencies to produce a gratifyingly neutral effect. The panic attacks I was accustomed to became fewer and fewer. When I stood on the tube grasping the clammy handrail at 7am, my heart rarely hammered as it once had. The noise kept everything more or less the same, obliterating my nerves. I squeezed my eyes shut and it was almost like not being alive at all.</p> <p>Noise pollution is no joke. The World Health Organisation estimates that 1m healthy life years are lost per year in Europe to traffic noise. Aircraft noise is proven to negatively impact the reading skills of children who live near airports. As well as the broad impact on social health, sufferers of sound sensitivity have high levels of comorbidity with anxiety and depression, and sufferers of post- traumatic stress disorder have been shown to have heightened brain responses to sudden sounds.</p> <p>My boyfriend laughs at me sometimes out of genuine bemusement. He is an amazingly sane and un-neurotic individual. A motorbike will zoom past too suddenly. On holiday, in our hotel, a cleaner knocks on the door to ask if we want the room serviced and I outright scream with shock. An insect will buzz too loudly in my ear.</p> <p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d he said, after I shouted at that bluebottle, \u201cyou\u2019re so terrified by the world.\u201d</p> <p>After I learned to love white noise for what it did for me in public, I began to love it in private, too. Once, while enduring a panic attack in bed having checked my bank balance, I turned it on. It was a Sunday early evening, my worst time; the time at which the world you\u2019ve been able to deny for a sweet evening or two begins to grind its gears again. I put a white noise playlist on my headphones and lay there under the heavy sheet of it until my body stopped shuddering and I was feeling as blank as the sound itself. I was able to sleep because it had exhausted me and, therefore, I was able to work the next day, and for that alone I began to consider it a kind of magic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The story of me and white noise is also the story of me and half a lifetime\u2019s worth of ways to avoid going mad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A 2018 study published by Oxford University Press showed white noise can improve functioning in adults with attention deficit disorder. Another in the same year in South Korea suggested weighted white noise \u2013 which attempts to account for the particular wave frequencies found in sufferers of depression \u2013 can have a positive effect. In Taiwan, a 2018 survey of people living with dementia showed it can provide a simple way to reduce their agitation.</p> <p>White noise itself is simply a random mixture of sound frequencies, but what it\u2019s used for by me and others like me is often an attempt at a kind of augmented auditory life. It\u2019s a modern, western habit that is too new in general populations for there yet to be much solid research on its effects. But adapting to a stressful environment by creating a personal soundscape is nothing new.</p> <p>Rupert Cox is an anthropologist concerned with aural experiences and the effect of noise on human health and the environment. He has conducted long-term research in Japan and Guam. He tells me about a family in Tokyo that remains living and working on their farm adjacent to the runway at Narita Airport, decades after fierce clashes erupted between government and civilians over its establishment. \u201cThey built a soundproof room for themselves to sleep in. What\u2019s interesting is that, of course, the sleeping is at night when the planes aren\u2019t flying. Even so, they need this environment to sleep properly. The effects of noise on health are often experienced as sleep disorders. They\u2019ve created an environment that\u2019s obviously very quiet, but it\u2019s more than just quiet. It produces its own particular sort of sound where all you can hear is yourself.\u201d</p> <p>On the island of Okinawa, the unpredictable and overwhelming noise of jets belonging to the US military base cause health problems for more than 17,000 people in the vicinity and is estimated to trigger about 10 fatal heart attacks a year. Cox\u2019s Japanese colleague observed that the engine noise triggers memories of the Pacific War. People find ways to focus on natural noise to offset the military noise intrusion, to focus on the sound of the sea and summer winds. One individual, a war survivor hikes with his wife to the north of the island, to a rainforest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>White noise is the only self-medication I have found that does me no actual harm</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A film made by Cox and his collaborators about their research was named <em>Zawawa</em>, an onomatopoeic word to describe the sound of sugar cane fields and the noise of leaves wrapping themselves around stalks. It was also written into a song by the postwar Japanese composer Naohiko Terashima, the word repeated 42 times. The people of the island, Cox says, are always playing and listening to music.</p> <p>What white noise does for me when I\u2019m listening to it alone in bed at night is to saturate my brain. It not only drowns out my thoughts, but doesn\u2019t actually allow them to exist at all for the time that I\u2019m listening. And as any person who\u2019s ever been mad will tell you, that\u2019s the end goal when you\u2019re suffering.</p> <p>The story of me and white noise is also the story of me and half a lifetime\u2019s worth of ways to avoid going mad. It\u2019s the story of mental chaos and haphazard, amateur ways you find to quiet it down. There were other attempted methods before white noise came along. There was drinking, of course. If there\u2019s a thought which can\u2019t be silenced by a certain amount of alcohol, I have yet to find it. Even the potential of alcohol can do it for me most of the time. A large glass of red wine set in front of me can be calming, even when I don\u2019t drink it. But we know how that ends.</p> <p>There was sex, too, because sex works like drinking does. It lets you be entirely in one moment without any of the moments that preceded it or those which will follow coming in the edges. But the sex was often with men, and men in their 20s who want casual sex are usually more trouble than they\u2019re worth \u2013 even for one night.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There will be times when no noise I can find will be loud enough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was physical self-injury. A doctor told me once that instead of doing what I did, I should press an ice cube to my forearm, or I should flick an elastic band against my wrist. I nearly laughed in his face.</p> <p>White noise is the only self-medication I have found that does me no actual harm. There are other versions of what it is \u2013 the kinds of television and films I watch when I am too tired or depressed to think are a kind of white noise. They, too, are a means to saturate myself totally, with nothing that has the ability to make me feel or think. When I was most depressed I put a <em>Mad Men</em> box set on every night for a year as I tried fruitlessly to sleep, not able to bear the idea of one moment without someone else\u2019s voice filling my head.</p> <p>White noise has helped me to be still, avoid the ridiculous ice cubes and rubber bands and those even worse things. And yet, it worries me that I am pumping so much absence into myself. It worries me that I am drowning out thoughts instead of learning to hear them.</p> <p>I can\u2019t imagine my life without white noise now, but I think quite a lot about what it means, and whether I should be all right with depending on it. I think that about everything I depend on, though, to be fair. I think it even about personal relationships. What about when everyone I love dies, I think \u2013what am I doing depending on them, when they\u2019re just going to die? Part of what makes me unwell, I\u2019ve come to understand, is my inability to appreciate anything which makes me less unwell.</p> <p>I think it about medication, too, which I have not taken in almost a year. I have always felt guilty taking antidepressants, because it feels to me that my sickness is not chemical but emotional, that the things that make me sick are also part of the things that make me happy. There are things I will always question about whether medication should be prescribed for problems that seem more social than physiological. And about just how mentally present a human should expect themselves to be, about what I owe myself and the people around me, if it\u2019s right or wrong to forcibly ignore my material reality quite so often. Sometimes I have needed pills to get me out of bed in the morning. Right now I don\u2019t, but I know I probably will again, that there will be times when no noise I can find will be loud enough.</p> <p>For now, maybe it\u2019s all right that white noise helps me sleep, helps me travel, helps me be still. Maybe it\u2019s all right to be comforted, however saccharine and simple that comfort, to put on a playlist for babies, to wait for other, different, noises that might come later. To keep still and be very quiet, until they are ready to come clear.</p> <p><em>Megan Nolan\u2019s debut novel Acts of Desperation will be published by Jonathan Cape in 2021</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Late last year Spotify presented me with my Top 100 most listened to tracks of 2018 and, as ever when I\u2019m presented with some unknown version of myself, I couldn\u2019t wait to analyse it. Like a dog returning to its vomit, nothing fascinates me more than my own alien excretions. I could spend the rest of my life contorting my brain to view tagged pictures of myself, attempting to understand how others see me. But there it was, above the other great heroes of my year, Leonard Cohen and Ariana Grande. In the number one spot was White Noise. Not just White Noise \u2013 \u201cWhite Noise For Babies\u201d. I had listened to nothing all year as much as I had listened to flat soundscapes designed to soothe infants. I first came to white noise shortly after I moved to London from Dublin. I left Ireland in a hurry, with no good plans in place, no real reason to have come, and so lived for two years in a constant stressful flux. I worked temp jobs, I sub-let my bedroom, I relied on the generosity of my best friend to top up my Oyster card when I had nothing left. I felt flayed. London left nothing to the imagination. It wasn\u2019t as though I had moved from a village \u2013 Dublin is a major city, after all, and I\u2019d spent six years there after leaving home \u2013 but I was not prepared for what it felt like to constantly be physically shoved against strangers, how you could hear their mouth noises and video games and stupid voice notes all the time. How it was normal to live with five people instead of one or two, and how they might all be near you when you wanted to make a cup of tea at midnight. How there was never a moment of any day when you were alone until you climbed into your bed still sticky from fumes and the terrible food you conceded to eat on the journey back \u2013 weeping pathetically into your gummy M&amp;S wrap \u2013 and how that aloneness, though you\u2019d longed for it all day, would feel so embarrassing and awful. That was when I began to listen to white noise. I had complained to a friend that my bedroom allowed all the noise of my household into it when I was trying to work and she suggested I listen to rain sounds. It started doing so there at my desk when I was writing, and then the tube to whatever office I was temping at, and the bus from that office to a terrible date, and then again on the dawn journey home. When the rain noises didn\u2019t seem to quite block out my surroundings any more I moved on to pure white noise, which combines aural frequencies to produce a gratifyingly neutral effect. The panic attacks I was accustomed to became fewer and fewer. When I stood on the tube grasping the clammy handrail at 7am, my heart rarely hammered as it once had. The noise kept everything more or less the same, obliterating my nerves. I squeezed my eyes shut and it was almost like not being alive at all. Noise pollution is no joke. The World Health Organisation estimates that 1m healthy life years are lost per year in Europe to traffic noise. Aircraft noise is proven to negatively impact the reading skills of children who live near airports. As well as the broad impact on social health, sufferers of sound sensitivity have high levels of comorbidity with anxiety and depression, and sufferers of post- traumatic stress disorder have been shown to have heightened brain responses to sudden sounds. My boyfriend laughs at me sometimes out of genuine bemusement. He is an amazingly sane and un-neurotic individual. A motorbike will zoom past too suddenly. On holiday, in our hotel, a cleaner knocks on the door to ask if we want the room serviced and I outright scream with shock. An insect will buzz too loudly in my ear. \u201cOh baby,\u201d he said, after I shouted at that bluebottle, \u201cyou\u2019re so terrified by the world.\u201d After I learned to love white noise for what it did for me in public, I began to love it in private, too. Once, while enduring a panic attack in bed having checked my bank balance, I turned it on. It was a Sunday early evening, my worst time; the time at which the world you\u2019ve been able to deny for a sweet evening or two begins to grind its gears again. I put a white noise playlist on my headphones and lay there under the heavy sheet of it until my body stopped shuddering and I was feeling as blank as the sound itself. I was able to sleep because it had exhausted me and, therefore, I was able to work the next day, and for that alone I began to consider it a kind of magic. A 2018 study published by Oxford University Press showed white noise can improve functioning in adults with attention deficit disorder. Another in the same year in South Korea suggested weighted white noise \u2013 which attempts to account for the particular wave frequencies found in sufferers of depression \u2013 can have a positive effect. In Taiwan, a 2018 survey of people living with dementia showed it can provide a simple way to reduce their agitation. White noise itself is simply a random mixture of sound frequencies, but what it\u2019s used for by me and others like me is often an attempt at a kind of augmented auditory life. It\u2019s a modern, western habit that is too new in general populations for there yet to be much solid research on its effects. But adapting to a stressful environment by creating a personal soundscape is nothing new. Rupert Cox is an anthropologist concerned with aural experiences and the effect of noise on human health and the environment. He has conducted long-term research in Japan and Guam. He tells me about a family in Tokyo that remains living and working on their farm adjacent to the runway at Narita Airport, decades after fierce clashes erupted between government and civilians over its establishment. \u201cThey built a soundproof room for themselves to sleep in. What\u2019s interesting is that, of course, the sleeping is at night when the planes aren\u2019t flying. Even so, they need this environment to sleep properly. The effects of noise on health are often experienced as sleep disorders. They\u2019ve created an environment that\u2019s obviously very quiet, but it\u2019s more than just quiet. It produces its own particular sort of sound where all you can hear is yourself.\u201d On the island of Okinawa, the unpredictable and overwhelming noise of jets belonging to the US military base cause health problems for more than 17,000 people in the vicinity and is estimated to trigger about 10 fatal heart attacks a year. Cox\u2019s Japanese colleague observed that the engine noise triggers memories of the Pacific War. People find ways to focus on natural noise to offset the military noise intrusion, to focus on the sound of the sea and summer winds. One individual, a war survivor hikes with his wife to the north of the island, to a rainforest. A film made by Cox and his collaborators about their research was named Zawawa, an onomatopoeic word to describe the sound of sugar cane fields and the noise of leaves wrapping themselves around stalks. It was also written into a song by the postwar Japanese composer Naohiko Terashima, the word repeated 42 times. The people of the island, Cox says, are always playing and listening to music. What white noise does for me when I\u2019m listening to it alone in bed at night is to saturate my brain. It not only drowns out my thoughts, but doesn\u2019t actually allow them to exist at all for the time that I\u2019m listening. And as any person who\u2019s ever been mad will tell you, that\u2019s the end goal when you\u2019re suffering. The story of me and white noise is also the story of me and half a lifetime\u2019s worth of ways to avoid going mad. It\u2019s the story of mental chaos and haphazard, amateur ways you find to quiet it down. There were other attempted methods before white noise came along. There was drinking, of course. If there\u2019s a thought which can\u2019t be silenced by a certain amount of alcohol, I have yet to find it. Even the potential of alcohol can do it for me most of the time. A large glass of red wine set in front of me can be calming, even when I don\u2019t drink it. But we know how that ends. There was sex, too, because sex works like drinking does. It lets you be entirely in one moment without any of the moments that preceded it or those which will follow coming in the edges. But the sex was often with men, and men in their 20s who want casual sex are usually more trouble than they\u2019re worth \u2013 even for one night. There was physical self-injury. A doctor told me once that instead of doing what I did, I should press an ice cube to my forearm, or I should flick an elastic band against my wrist. I nearly laughed in his face. White noise is the only self-medication I have found that does me no actual harm. There are other versions of what it is \u2013 the kinds of television and films I watch when I am too tired or depressed to think are a kind of white noise. They, too, are a means to saturate myself totally, with nothing that has the ability to make me feel or think. When I was most depressed I put a Mad Men box set on every night for a year as I tried fruitlessly to sleep, not able to bear the idea of one moment without someone else\u2019s voice filling my head. White noise has helped me to be still, avoid the ridiculous ice cubes and rubber bands and those even worse things. And yet, it worries me that I am pumping so much absence into myself. It worries me that I am drowning out thoughts instead of learning to hear them. I can\u2019t imagine my life without white noise now, but I think quite a lot about what it means, and whether I should be all right with depending on it. I think that about everything I depend on, though, to be fair. I think it even about personal relationships. What about when everyone I love dies, I think \u2013what am I doing depending on them, when they\u2019re just going to die? Part of what makes me unwell, I\u2019ve come to understand, is my inability to appreciate anything which makes me less unwell. I think it about medication, too, which I have not taken in almost a year. I have always felt guilty taking antidepressants, because it feels to me that my sickness is not chemical but emotional, that the things that make me sick are also part of the things that make me happy. There are things I will always question about whether medication should be prescribed for problems that seem more social than physiological. And about just how mentally present a human should expect themselves to be, about what I owe myself and the people around me, if it\u2019s right or wrong to forcibly ignore my material reality quite so often. Sometimes I have needed pills to get me out of bed in the morning. Right now I don\u2019t, but I know I probably will again, that there will be times when no noise I can find will be loud enough. For now, maybe it\u2019s all right that white noise helps me sleep, helps me travel, helps me be still. Maybe it\u2019s all right to be comforted, however saccharine and simple that comfort, to put on a playlist for babies, to wait for other, different, noises that might come later. To keep still and be very quiet, until they are ready to come clear. Megan Nolan\u2019s debut novel Acts of Desperation will be published by Jonathan Cape in 2021",

      "body": "<p>Cerys Matthews was given two books as a child that she has held on to ever since. The first was Roger Phillips\u2019s <em>Wild Food</em>, the classic forager\u2019s handbook, which first sent her out into the woods and beaches in the west Wales of her growing up. The second was <em>Soodlum\u2019s </em><em>Selection of Irish Ballads</em>, which inspired a lifelong understanding of music as storytelling, a philosophy that she carried her through her years as \u201cQueen of Britpop\u201d with the band Catatonia, to the present of her much-loved BBC Radio 6 Music show.</p> <p>The spirit of those childhood volumes also forms a thread through Matthews\u2019s latest creation: a cookbook that doubles as a loose-limbed memoir, traveller\u2019s notebook and poetry chapbook with a built-in Spotify playlist. Anyone who\u2019s had the pleasure of listening to Matthews<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00llg30\" title=\"\"> on Sunday morning radio</a> over the past decade will know that she is equally at home with the music of India, north Africa and the deep south of America, as with the Celtic folk tradition in which she grew up. <em>Where the Wild Cooks Go</em> extends that restless global curiosity to kitchens and flavours.</p> <p>She has suggested we meet at <a href=\"http://www.woodlandsrestaurant.co.uk/#home-section\" title=\"\">Woodlands</a>, a south Indian vegetarian restaurant just off Regent Street, that she has been coming to for a decade \u2013 and which has been here for nearly 40 years. She arrives excitedly, telling me in her lyrical phrasing about her cab ride here, in which the driver had given her a recipe for polenta with an okra sauce that his Antiguan mother used to make. She had returned the compliment by explaining how lemon grass would protect him from midges on a planned visit to Anglesey that weekend.</p> <p>Chatting, Matthews betrays an endless appetite for the ways of the world. In her rock star years (she first found fame in a T-shirt bearing the legend \u201cfastrising lagersoakedriproaringpoptart\u201d) that appetite expressed itself in a frenzied touring schedule and thirsty hedonism. That hectic spirit has matured into an immersive delight in eclectic tastes and experiences. When we meet she has just returned from a family holiday in Italy which involved tours of vineyards in Chianti, afternoons foraging for cocktail ingredients, lessons from pasta-makers, and some serious rock climbing \u2013 she shows me the white-knuckle pictures on her phone \u2013 her \u201clatest midlife crisis\u201d, an obsession she picked up from a trip to Everest base camp this year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My father was a huge influence. You don\u2019t realise how much influence you have, even on your most contrary children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sanjay Kumar, the manager at Woodlands, brings out a selection of sizzling dishes and Matthews\u2019s eyes brighten at each one. We share dahi poori, puffed wheat with rich sambar stew, onion and pepper fritters, and a vegetable mixed grill with a tandoori paneer. Matthews punctuates her eating with throaty expressions of joy. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go for it.\u201d \u201cOh yum!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love south Indian food,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss the meat at all. Sambar is quite complex to cook but it is one of greatest comfort foods ever. So many different flavours.\u201d We divide the plate of paneer with a tandoori cauliflower and coriander chutney.</p> <p>\u201cMy grandmother used to make a version of paneer and called it cuckoo\u2019s cheese,\u201d she says. \u201cAll it is, is warmed-up milk with a bit of acid in it to make the solids separate. You can then just squeeze it through an old T-shirt.\u201d</p> <p>Matthews, who turned 50 this year, has become vegetarian gradually. The six years she spent living and making music in Nashville after Catatonia split in 2001 put her off farmed meat. When she met her second husband, Steve Abbott, a music producer, who had been a vegetarian for years, she restricted the carnivorous part of her diet to game \u201cbecause of my love of wildness\u201d. Later, after her daughter became vegetarian, she eventually followed suit.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t in her genes. Matthews comes, as she says with a laugh, from \u201ca line of Welsh faggot makers\u201d on her mother\u2019s side. Her grandfather was known locally as Chaco de Faggot de Dung Merchant. \u201cHe used to collect horse manure for his vegetables, and his family sold homemade faggots in Neath market.\u201d She includes the family\u2019s century-old recipe in her book.</p> <p>Her mother did not inherit that love of local flavour. For a long while when Matthews was small, her mum ate only chicken and chips. Things changed when the family took their first cheap package holidays and she started experimenting a bit with a paella pan. Later, when neighbours from Gujarat became close friends, \u201cshe started cooking proper curries, the works\u201d as well as traditional Welsh caul.</p> <p>Matthews\u2019s restless soul comes more from her father, she suggests, a farmer who became a doctor. \u201cHe was a great Iberophile. His idea of fun on holiday was to drive up into the mountains in Spain until we were lost,\u201d she says. She pauses. Her dad died last year. \u201cWe played lots of his favourite songs [at the bedside] and all howled out,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a huge influence on me. I think as a father you don\u2019t realise how much influence you have, even on your most contrary children, if you talk about things you really love.\u201d</p> <p>One result of that influence was that Matthews took off for Spain aged 18 with a backpack and her guitar with a mission to learn flamenco. When her busking wasn\u2019t earning enough she took a job as a family help in a little village outside Barcelona. \u201cThe mother was from Valencia and they laughed at my cooking to start with, but she showed me how and I came away with a brilliant understanding of vegetables and ways of cooking them.\u201d She smiles. \u201cWhen I semi-retire I would love to do it all again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm just a farmer's wife born out of time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is hard to imagine Matthews idle. As well as her radio show and her three kids, she also organises the annual <a href=\"https://www.thegoodlifeexperience.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Good Life Experience </a>festival of food and music in Flintshire, north Wales. The original idea was to create somewhere that kids like hers could climb trees and make music and cook out of doors as she had done as a child on a farm. It has grown to attract DJs and cooks from around the world. Roger Phillips, the forager, is a perennial fixture, taking groups into the woods to find mushrooms and edible plants.</p> <p>Matthews tries to use her foraging skills wherever she is in the world. \u201cThe more knowledge you have about edible things the freer you are,\u201d she says. \u201cCome Brexit I\u2019ll be chomping on wild sorrel, scrumping nettles in London.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f992f76e25b87f074a06f021c0027638e1bcda5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f992f76e25b87f074a06f021c0027638e1bcda5/0_701_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Woodlands restaurant, Panton Street, Piccadilly, 15/10/2019 Sophia Evans for The Observer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>They ate<br>Cerys and Tim shared </strong><em>Dahi poori \u00a35; crispy onion and pepper bhajia \u00a35; mixed vegetable and paneer grill \u00a313; masala dosa \u00a39.50; angoori kofta \u00a38.50; steamed rice \u00a33.50; naan \u00a32.90</em> <br><strong>They drank<br></strong><strong>Cerys and Tim shared </strong><em>Bottle of house Italian red \u00a323</em> <strong><br></strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now plates of thali and dumplings have arrived at the table. Matthews briefly examines how they have been put together before tucking in. One of the pleasures of her book is the way it answers that quintessentially British question: \u201cWhat shall we eat tonight? Chinese? Italian? Mexican? Indian?\u201d She covers 15 countries, and wishes she could have included Thailand \u2013 \u201cbut my knowledge was not quite there\u201d. She aims to make up that gap in a forthcoming visit to Bangkok. From time to time in the culinary journey there are hints of her former life. \u201cDeath by chocolate\u201d is a cocktail of Tia Maria, vodka and half a pint of Guinness that she invented with Ian Brown of the Stone Roses back in the day. When I ask if there are elements of that life she misses, she suggests simply that \u201cyou are either on the horse or not on the horse,\u201d though she hasn\u2019t quite given up on the idea that \u201cI might yet get a transit van and throw my guitar in the back.\u201d</p> <p>What music is she making?</p> <p>\u201cI potter around at home on GarageBand. I don\u2019t record stuff, really, I just play guitar and sing. And, as with the playlists in the book I listen to music while I cook. That is what we all do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>She has a gift for making the new life sound as exciting as the old: cooking vegan welsh cakes with chia seeds with her daughter, raiding her local corner shop in Westbourne Park for bunches of mint and dill and Turkish tomatoes and slabs of tamarind and dried mulberries.</p> <p>Does her creative curiosity ever falter?</p> <p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just a farmer\u2019s wife born out of time,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone loves great food, good music, a brilliant poem. That is just people. That is what we all used to have. I think we need to get it back.\u201d</p> <p><em>Where the Wild Cooks Go (Particular Books, \u00a325) is out now.

The spirit of those childhood volumes also forms a thread through Matthews\u2019s latest creation: a cookbook that doubles as a loose-limbed memoir, traveller\u2019s notebook and poetry chapbook with a built-in Spotify playlist. Anyone who\u2019s had the pleasure of listening to Matthews on Sunday morning radio over the past decade will know that she is equally at home with the music of India, north Africa and the deep south of America, as with the Celtic folk tradition in which she grew up. Where the Wild Cooks Go extends that restless global curiosity to kitchens and flavours. She has suggested we meet at Woodlands, a south Indian vegetarian restaurant just off Regent Street, that she has been coming to for a decade \u2013 and which has been here for nearly 40 years. She arrives excitedly, telling me in her lyrical phrasing about her cab ride here, in which the driver had given her a recipe for polenta with an okra sauce that his Antiguan mother used to make. She had returned the compliment by explaining how lemon grass would protect him from midges on a planned visit to Anglesey that weekend. Chatting, Matthews betrays an endless appetite for the ways of the world. In her rock star years (she first found fame in a T-shirt bearing the legend \u201cfastrising lagersoakedriproaringpoptart\u201d) that appetite expressed itself in a frenzied touring schedule and thirsty hedonism. That hectic spirit has matured into an immersive delight in eclectic tastes and experiences. When we meet she has just returned from a family holiday in Italy which involved tours of vineyards in Chianti, afternoons foraging for cocktail ingredients, lessons from pasta-makers, and some serious rock climbing \u2013 she shows me the white-knuckle pictures on her phone \u2013 her \u201clatest midlife crisis\u201d, an obsession she picked up from a trip to Everest base camp this year. Sanjay Kumar, the manager at Woodlands, brings out a selection of sizzling dishes and Matthews\u2019s eyes brighten at each one. We share dahi poori, puffed wheat with rich sambar stew, onion and pepper fritters, and a vegetable mixed grill with a tandoori paneer. Matthews punctuates her eating with throaty expressions of joy. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go for it.\u201d \u201cOh yum!\u201d \u201cI love south Indian food,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss the meat at all. Sambar is quite complex to cook but it is one of greatest comfort foods ever. So many different flavours.\u201d We divide the plate of paneer with a tandoori cauliflower and coriander chutney. \u201cMy grandmother used to make a version of paneer and called it cuckoo\u2019s cheese,\u201d she says. \u201cAll it is, is warmed-up milk with a bit of acid in it to make the solids separate. You can then just squeeze it through an old T-shirt.\u201d Matthews, who turned 50 this year, has become vegetarian gradually. The six years she spent living and making music in Nashville after Catatonia split in 2001 put her off farmed meat. When she met her second husband, Steve Abbott, a music producer, who had been a vegetarian for years, she restricted the carnivorous part of her diet to game \u201cbecause of my love of wildness\u201d. Later, after her daughter became vegetarian, she eventually followed suit. It wasn\u2019t in her genes. Matthews comes, as she says with a laugh, from \u201ca line of Welsh faggot makers\u201d on her mother\u2019s side. Her grandfather was known locally as Chaco de Faggot de Dung Merchant. \u201cHe used to collect horse manure for his vegetables, and his family sold homemade faggots in Neath market.\u201d She includes the family\u2019s century-old recipe in her book. Her mother did not inherit that love of local flavour. For a long while when Matthews was small, her mum ate only chicken and chips. Things changed when the family took their first cheap package holidays and she started experimenting a bit with a paella pan. Later, when neighbours from Gujarat became close friends, \u201cshe started cooking proper curries, the works\u201d as well as traditional Welsh caul. Matthews\u2019s restless soul comes more from her father, she suggests, a farmer who became a doctor. \u201cHe was a great Iberophile. His idea of fun on holiday was to drive up into the mountains in Spain until we were lost,\u201d she says. She pauses. Her dad died last year. \u201cWe played lots of his favourite songs [at the bedside] and all howled out,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a huge influence on me. I think as a father you don\u2019t realise how much influence you have, even on your most contrary children, if you talk about things you really love.\u201d One result of that influence was that Matthews took off for Spain aged 18 with a backpack and her guitar with a mission to learn flamenco. When her busking wasn\u2019t earning enough she took a job as a family help in a little village outside Barcelona. \u201cThe mother was from Valencia and they laughed at my cooking to start with, but she showed me how and I came away with a brilliant understanding of vegetables and ways of cooking them.\u201d She smiles. \u201cWhen I semi-retire I would love to do it all again.\u201d It is hard to imagine Matthews idle. As well as her radio show and her three kids, she also organises the annual Good Life Experience festival of food and music in Flintshire, north Wales. The original idea was to create somewhere that kids like hers could climb trees and make music and cook out of doors as she had done as a child on a farm. It has grown to attract DJs and cooks from around the world. Roger Phillips, the forager, is a perennial fixture, taking groups into the woods to find mushrooms and edible plants. Matthews tries to use her foraging skills wherever she is in the world. \u201cThe more knowledge you have about edible things the freer you are,\u201d she says. \u201cCome Brexit I\u2019ll be chomping on wild sorrel, scrumping nettles in London.\u201d By now plates of thali and dumplings have arrived at the table. Matthews briefly examines how they have been put together before tucking in. One of the pleasures of her book is the way it answers that quintessentially British question: \u201cWhat shall we eat tonight? Chinese? Italian? Mexican? Indian?\u201d She covers 15 countries, and wishes she could have included Thailand \u2013 \u201cbut my knowledge was not quite there\u201d. She aims to make up that gap in a forthcoming visit to Bangkok. From time to time in the culinary journey there are hints of her former life. \u201cDeath by chocolate\u201d is a cocktail of Tia Maria, vodka and half a pint of Guinness that she invented with Ian Brown of the Stone Roses back in the day. When I ask if there are elements of that life she misses, she suggests simply that \u201cyou are either on the horse or not on the horse,\u201d though she hasn\u2019t quite given up on the idea that \u201cI might yet get a transit van and throw my guitar in the back.\u201d What music is she making? \u201cI potter around at home on GarageBand. I don\u2019t record stuff, really, I just play guitar and sing. And, as with the playlists in the book I listen to music while I cook. That is what we all do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She has a gift for making the new life sound as exciting as the old: cooking vegan welsh cakes with chia seeds with her daughter, raiding her local corner shop in Westbourne Park for bunches of mint and dill and Turkish tomatoes and slabs of tamarind and dried mulberries. Does her creative curiosity ever falter? She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just a farmer\u2019s wife born out of time,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone loves great food, good music, a brilliant poem. That is just people. That is what we all used to have. I think we need to get it back.\u201d Where the Wild Cooks Go (Particular Books, \u00a325) is out now.

Marco Kurz was voiceless through laryngitis, but his team up front were toothless. A returning Robbie Kruse still a long way short of the fitness he needs to give Toivonen the support he so desperately deserves.</p> <p>They slump to eighth on the table, Victory - in what is starting to really feel like a club in trouble.

There are three <strong>W-League</strong> games, two <strong>A-League</strong> games and all of this is highlighted by a Big Blue double-header at Kogarah, which from personal experience I can say is a ripper of a place to watch football (or any sport, for that matter). Fans in attendance at Netstrata Jubilee Stadium will also be treated to the sublime skills of my second-born son, who\u2019ll be doing his darnedest to find the back of the net in a small-sided game at half-time of the A-League game between Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory. It\u2019s a lovely day, it\u2019ll be close to a sellout and the Kogarah playing surface will be like a billiard table. But he\u2019ll likely think little of it. Youth is wasted on the young.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "It wasn\u2019t a classic, by any stretch of the imagination, but it was certainly a more engaging second half. After a cagey opening Sydney FC\u2019s midfield slowly began to exert it\u2019s authority on the match, dominating possession, dictating tempo, but the final third opportunities were limited before the break. Ola Toivonen\u2019s class header just before the break set the game up for a fascinating second stanza, but as soon as Sydney got one, you just felt they\u2019d run over the top of an undermanned Victory XI. Marco Kurz was voiceless through laryngitis, but his team up front were toothless. A returning Robbie Kruse still a long way short of the fitness he needs to give Toivonen the support he so desperately deserves. They slump to eighth on the table, Victory - in what is starting to really feel like a club in trouble. Sydney FC conversely rise two second on the table, with the knowledge that rivals City slipped up away to Brisbane. A fair crowd in to take this one in. And they got their entertainment, eventually. Thanks for your company today as we welcome back the W-League. Another full picnic of sports action for your Sunday! 90 + 4 min: Victory in a good area, this could be one of their last chances to attack, but it ends with an aimless cross that evades anyone. Just about sums up their attacking threat tonight, Toivonen aside. And there\u2019s the whistle! It\u2019s no classic, but the 51st Big Blue ends with a much-expected Sydney FC win. Even if it took them a while to get there. 90 + 2 min: A time-sapping sub as Barbarouses makes way for Buhagiar. Job done for the former Victory man who passed up the chance to play for his national team, New Zealand, this international window. 89 min: Five minutes added on is the word from the sideline, so Victory still a chance to pinch something here. It\u2019s a fast counter and it\u2019s Barbarouses who feeds Brandon O\u2019Neill inside the box - it\u2019s a great ball, and the midfielder can\u2019t quite dig the shot out of his feet. But what a save from Thomas! The Victory custodian flew off his line, and stood tall to block that effort. 86 min: Big chance! It\u2019s Caceres who flashes a cross across the face after fine lead up play from Grant - but his ball just evades the outstretched legs of not one but two Sydney teammates. They\u2019re increasingly looking more likely for a third, the home side. 84 min: The danger is of course, that in trying to chase the game, Victory will increasingly leave themselves open at the back - at it\u2019s Barbarouses who fires a stinging effort just past Thomas\u2019 right-hand upright. 81 min: Now it\u2019s the onus on Victory to force the play, which in truth, it\u2019s hard to know where the spark might come from. We\u2019re yet to see too much of Kruse, but there\u2019s no question marks over his quality. Can they get the flying winger more into this contest? 78 min: Traore gets across well to deny a crossing opportunity, but he concedes a corner in front of the Sydney FC home supporters. McGowan rises, but he can\u2019t direct his header on target, and Kruse watches it harmlessly wide. 75 min: Migden Basha goes in the book for a tug-back on Barbarouses, and as suspected, it\u2019s a first appearance of the 2019/20 a-League season for Zullo who comes on for the previously booked Retre. 72 min: And suddenly the Cove are back in full voice. Terrific frontrunners, it must be said. And it\u2019s Marco Kurz\u2019s turn to cut a forlorn figure on the touchline. 68 min: It\u2019s Grant with the chest down, and who should pop up to knock that home at the second attempt - Kosta Barbarouses! His first effort came back off the crossbar, but he made no mistake with the second, and in a matter of minutes, they\u2019ve turned this around Sydney! Remarkable stuff, you can\u2019t script this. He\u2019s lain dormant for most of this game, the former Victory man, like a serpent awaiting the summer rays, but he only needed one invitation. 67 min: Steve Corica also deciding to shuffle the pack, as Baumjohann makes way for former City player Anthony Caceres. 65 min: And despite him being one of the smallest men on the pitch, it\u2019s Le Fondre with a thumping header from further out - but that one just sails over! And Kurz has seen enough - the youngster Hope trots off, and it\u2019s a first appearance in 2019/20 for Robbie Kruse. What an impact could the Socceroo star have? 62 min: And there is the equaliser! From the corner it\u2019s Ryan McGowan who wins a first header, it flies sidewise to Le Fondre, and it\u2019s the Englishman who deflects a second header past Thomas and the flailing Victory defenders on the line. They\u2019re back in it, Sydney - and all of a sudden, it feels like we might yet have more goals in this one! 60 min: And a first close up of Corica looking tense / pensive on the bench (tensive?) They\u2019re still yet to register a shot on target, Sydney FC, with an hour gone. And that said, it\u2019s Ninkovic who finally gets an effort on target - as he draws a brilliant save from Thomas with a stinging left-foot strike. And they have a corner, Sydney. And a big result coming through from Newcastle, where Craig Deans\u2019 women have not just dragged one back, but they\u2019ve denied a star-studded Melbourne City an opening round win. Teigan Collister with a 67th minute equaliser. They had all the possession in the world, City - but they couldn\u2019t do much with it. Shades of Sydney FC v Melbourne Victory in the A-League? Well done, Newcastle - a strong point, and let\u2019s hope they can build on that. 53 min: Oh my! That was superb from Toivonen - it had dip, it had swerve, and it had Redmayne beaten in the Sydney FC goal - but it drifted just wide off the corner of the frame! A lovely strike, but it\u2019s close but no cigar. 52 min: And a second yellow of the contest, as Paulo Retre follows his teammate Alexander Baumjohann into the book. That could be an extra incentive to see a first start for the season off the bench for the returning Michael Zullo. Watch that space. And now it\u2019s Grant that\u2019s upended Toivonen in a handy position, and the Big Swede lines one up from a very dangerous area. Imagine. 50 min: Brattan tries one from 35m out. It seemed a bit ambitious, but in fairness that wasn\u2019t a million miles off the target. Still, they\u2019ll be looking to fashion better openings than that, the home side. 48 min: So it\u2019s onus on Sydney to come up with something. Victory will be more than content to sit deep, to look to counter and to try and secure the result late on as the game becomes more expansive. Second half! 45 min: It\u2019s a low-energy Steve Corica chatting to the Fox Sports commentary team at half-time. He keeps it pretty tight, but you can tell he\u2019s tense about how things have gone so far. Some HT musing from some of our favourite scribes across the A-League. Here\u2019s NZ Herald / FoxSports commentator Jason Pine suggesting somebody\u2019s perhaps carrying a side: And the best crossover finance/A-League writer going around, the Australian\u2019s John Stensholt: I\u2019m with John - I definitely think there\u2019s been a bit of rope-a-dope about Kurz\u2019s midweek protestations. Let\u2019s see what arises in the second half. And if you missed the earlier news out of the WBBL - firstly, what a finish to the game, and secondly, some concern over injury to one of the stars of the competition, Ellyse Perry. This from AAP: Superstar Ellyse Perry has suffered an apparent shoulder injury as her Sydney Sixers lost a WBBL thriller to the Melbourne Renegades. Perry stood up clutching her right shoulder in pain after tumbling while fielding on the Drummoyne Oval boundary, although she remained on the field. Courtney Webb hit a six off the last ball to give the Renegades a two-run victory, as they chased down the Sixers\u2019 total of 4-139 and rose to fourth on the ladder, one spot behind the Sixers. Half-time: Sydney FC 0-1 Melbourne Victory Well, there\u2019s the whistle, and is that the breakthrough that could spark this contest? They\u2019ve not had a lot to hang their hat on, Victory - perhaps only two meaningful attacks all game, but they\u2019ve got the lead. What can Sydney do to prise this contest open? Goal! Sydney FC 0-1 Melbourne Victory (Toivonen) 43 min: Thomas in no hurry to restart things, he eventually pumps it long and finds Hope in a decent area. In fitting with the match so far perhaps, they recycle possession and play back. Oh wow - they go wide again, and this time it\u2019s a terrific cross in from Hope, and who\u2019s lurking at the far post to nod it home? The Big Swede! Redmayne beaten from an acute angle - a terrific header, and do we have a football game now, ladies and gentlemen! And if you joined us for GOALS, forgettaboutit. But if you missed this from earlier, here\u2019s a match report from Das Wunder von Redcliffe, where Robbie Fowler\u2019s men did City like eleven Steve MacQueens, all on motorbikes: 39 min: Sydney look to release through Grant, but it\u2019s Brown who tracks back to marshall the FC flying fullback. It\u2019s an interesting one to watch - they do nominally have two left backs on the pitch, Victory: is that perhaps the best way to stop one of the best attacking threats in the league? 35 min: Sydney FC look to release Grant down the right with a terrific crossfield ball, but the Victory defence shuffles well to stifle the attack. He\u2019s up against one of the best left backs in the league, in Adama Traore in truth. A big chance for Le Fondre, who hits an effort on the pivot - and it\u2019s only just wide! A fine, improvised strike from a player who knows where the goal is. And a belated HT update from the W-League, where would you believe it, it\u2019s Emily van Egmond who\u2019s given her new side the lead against her home city town, Newcastle. The Matildas\u2019 midfielder splitting the teams with a goal in the 22nd minute. They\u2019re still absolutely bossing the possession, over 3/4s of it enjoyed by City, but few clear cut chances created by either side. 30 min: Ninkovic looks to invite Brattan for a shot from range, but the Victory defence shuffles to prevent any clear line of sight on goal. Baumjohann looks to release Barbarouses down the right, but it\u2019s just slightly overhit. It\u2019s just lacking, dare you say it, a bit of quality so far this contest. 27 min: Victory look to play out of pressure, but Traore\u2019s pass just evades Toivonen. Sydney FC\u2019s move then breaks down before Victory fail to break quickly - this pitch perhaps playing a factor as the pace comes off Josh Hope\u2019s pass forward. 23 min: It\u2019s a header for Toivonen - but it flies over! He grabs his head in despair, the big Swede. What a chance that was! Brown was the man over the set piece, he faked to go short before firing into the mix, and Victory\u2019s key man was able to find hald a yard of space, but he\u2019s fired that 50cm over Redmayne\u2019s crossbar. Big let off, Sydney FC. 22 min: Luke Brattan tries to thump one from deep, but Victory get bodies in the way to block the shot. A rare counter-attack opportunity for the visitors, and they\u2019ve earned a corner. What can they make from this? 19 min: Sydney probing as Victory continue to drop deeper. McGowan with a decent cross that finds Le Fondre inside the box, but he\u2019s shut down very quickly and he can\u2019t get a clean shot away. 15 min: Sydney FC starting to infinitesimally wrest the balance of power in midfield, as they win another freekick from a handy area. This time Baumjohann goes deep and finds Grant past the back stick, but his header back across can\u2019t pick out a teammate. Another half warning shot. 12 min: Early freekick in a promising area for the home side. It\u2019s Baumjohann over it, after Donachie caught Barbarouses in what you\u2019d have to say was a very soft foul. The German pumps it into a useful area, but it\u2019s cleared well by Victory with Ninkovic lurking. 10 min: A first shot in anger as Le Fondre lashes an effort from just outside the box. He connected well, but it was always flying high. Lawrence Thomas not tested, but his eyes would have lit up for a second or two when he saw that one arrowing his way. 7 min: Sydney FC now with it at the back. It\u2019s a cagey start to this one - both sides content to size each other out. You\u2019d expect that a little from Kurz\u2019s under-manned team, but could the home side have shown a little more ambition early on? 4 min: The youngster Lauton has it down Victory\u2019s right. He appears to be starting at right back in Roux\u2019s absence. It\u2019s so far been plenty of possession at the back for the visitors - Sydney appear relatively happy to sit off a little, and force their opponents to make the early running. Kick-off! 1 min: It\u2019s the big Swede Ola Toivonen who gets us underway, he plays back and Victory enjoy some early touches. And it\u2019s Corey Brown playing ahead of Adama Traore down Victory\u2019s left. So that\u2019s one mystery solved. We\u2019re not too far away from kick-off at Jubilee Park, where having just endured a W-League game the pitch is not in complete tip-top state. Big responsibility on the shoulders of Victory skipper Ola Toivonen you\u2019d imagine, tonight. While for Sydney FC it\u2019s a taste of the other shade of blue for former favourite Kosta Barbarouses. What price for a goal tonight? We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this one - fire us a tweet or email to join the conversation. Without further ado, here\u2019s the team lists therefore: Sydney FC are more or less how you\u2019d imagine they\u2019d line up, with Rhyan Grant returning from Socceroos duty to slot straight back in at right back. Michael Zullo returns from injury to the bench, while the pace of Trent Bugahiar could also be a late-game factor. Melbourne Victory have had to shuffle the pack, but there\u2019s still enough about this XI to be competitive. Leigh Broxham could drop to CB in the absence of Thomas Deng you\u2019d suggest, with Corey Brown filling in at right back for Storm Roux (away with NZ) or pushing Adama Traore further forward at left wing. Youngsters Lesiotis, Lauton and Hope get a huge opportunity to press their cases for future selection, while experienced visa signing Kiki Dobras will start from the bench. Plenty of chat flying round about what kind of team Melbourne Victory might actually get on the pitch this week, given the ridiculous situation of it being an international weekend, with both Socceroos and Olyroos selections dragging players away. Marco Kurz has raged publicly about this all week - a shame that the fixture was agreed upon by both clubs, so you\u2019d imagine some tough conversations between coach and club hierarchy. They\u2019re also shorn a few players due to injury - the big news though is that star recruit Robbie Kruse is available for selection, and could make his second-stint Victory debut off the bench. Imagine how that could play out. So - plenty more football to come, not least the very first Steve Corica v Marco Kurz, Sydney FC v Melbourne Victory A-League Big Blue. And if you need a quick up-to-speed about how it\u2019s been going for former Adelaide coach Kurz, here\u2019s resident football historian David Squires with an entirely factually accurate summary: And we\u2019ve a third fixture underway in the W-League, it\u2019s Newcastle hosting Melbourne City. 10 minutes in and it\u2019s the visitors with all the ball - no surprises there given the star-studded quality of this City squad. And it will be an emotional return to Newcastle for star Matilda Emily van Egmond, lining up against her hometown side. A miraculous comeback - heaven sent, you\u2019d could say, as the man they call God, claims his first A-League win as a head coach. On the mat, and back up in the second half. They looked gone for all measure down 2-0, and then 3-1 - not just from the scoreline, but from the mentality on display. But there\u2019s plenty of character in this squad - leaders like Tom Aldred and Roy O\u2019Donovan driving this team in orange on, and the bushfire-ravaged fans of south east Queensland have been treated with a terrific escape tonight. An emphatic result in the opening round \u201cBig Blue\u201d between last season\u2019s premiers and champions, and it\u2019s the Emily Gielnik and Christine Nairn-less Victory that were on the wrong end of this one. A late goal from Indigenous rising star Shadeene Evans adding the cherry on top in added time, as Sydney FC send an stark message to the league. You come at the Queens, you\u2019d best not miss. It\u2019s a win at home to start the W-League season in the capital, as the former powerhouses of the early competition consign a Sam Kerr-less Perth Glory to a first up loss, thanks to an early brace to US import Simone Charley. Perth huffed and puffed but couldn\u2019t mount too much of a challenge offensively. Could be a tough rebuilding season for the gals from the West. Watch this space. NBL: Sydney Kings 92-87 Illawarra Hawks And a record result trickling in from the NBL - here\u2019s the report from our colleagues at AAP: The biggest crowd in NBL history has watched Sydney survive a third-quarter explosion from LaMelo Ball to claim a 92-87 victory over Illawarra. The 17,513 at Qudos Bank Arena in the harbour city on Sunday surpassed the record of 17,143 set in 1999 at a double-header at the same venue. This time, fans flocked to watch the league-leading Kings take on a last-placed Hawks side boasting a projected NBA No 1 draft pick in Ball. The 18-year-old had a quiet first half but erupted in the third period by either scoring or assisting on 15 points of a 20-10 run that gave Illawarra the lead. Ball eventually finished with 16 points on 7-19 shooting, including 1-5 from distance to go with eight rebounds, six assists and zero turnovers. But it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent the Kings maintaining top spot on the table, and remain the only team unbeaten at home this season. A-League: Goal! Brisbane Roar 4-3 Melbourne City (O\u2019Donovan) - 83\u2019 No mistake from Roy the Boy, to the delight of the home fans. And having not scored in eons - it\u2019s the Roar with a hat-trick hero of their own, albeit with plenty of help from the spot (and VAR). Denis Genreau the man deemed to have infringed - the ball did appear to strike his out-raised hand, but it was only up because he was about to get smacked in the face. Is that self-defence? Is at an unnatural position? What is love? More questions than answers, the clear-and-obvious VAR. A-League: Brisbane Roar 3-3 Melbourne City - penalty! Hello! Well, it would be a potential 7-goal thriller without a big fat paw-print of VAR all over the game - it\u2019s the 83rd minute up at Redcliffe, and having improbably come back from 3-1 down, it could be the Roar about to take a 4-3 lead from the spot, after another contestable VAR-adjudged handball incident! Kia ora, Terevist, Aloha! G\u2019day to you and our international audience. Well, we\u2019ve clearly timed this handover well - like a baton change for the clear Olympic favourites in a 4x100m final - what could go wrong? Safe-hands Heinrich out, \u201ccomedy fingers\u201d Parkin to take it home from here. Plenty of live action going on so we\u2019ll settle in and get cracking. You\u2019ve probably missed sixteen more goals from Roar v City just since I was typing this update. Well folks, that is me for the day. More goals than a Google off-site. And this evening promises to be just as good. I can\u2019t think of anyone better to bring you the action than my esteemed colleague, Richard Parkin. Knock \u2018em dead, Parko (not literally)! A-League: Goal! Brisbane Roar 3-3 Melbourne City (O\u2019Donovan) - 64\u2019 Amadi-Holloway goes down in the box under a strong challenge, leaving the ref with no option but to award a penalty. Step up Roy O\u2019Donovan, who curves his shot from right to left and past the keeper. And to make matters even more concerning for City, Jamie Maclaren has been substituted off for Denis Genreau. Am I stating the bleeding obvious to say it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game? A-League: Goal! Brisbane Roar 2-3 Melbourne City (Amadi-Holloway) - 60\u2019 It\u2019s becoming an outright goalfest in Redcliffe and the Roar just won\u2019t lie down. This one wasn\u2019t overly pretty, with Amadi-Holloway one of two Brisbane players scrambling to get on the end of Ingham\u2019s headed cross. He manages to get something on the ball, forcing it over the line. And it is game on. A-League: Goals! Brisbane Roar 1-3 Melbourne City (O\u2019Donovan) - 50\u2019 &amp; (Maclaren) - 51\u2019 For a fleeting moment, Brisbane were back in this game thanks to Roy O\u2019Donovan\u2019s strike in the 50th minute. But nobody is safe when Jamie Maclaren is in the opposing team. For some reason, the Roar defenders seem quite happy to give Maclaren space in the box and yet again he makes them pay, this time beating the keeper with a precise header from Cabrera\u2019s cross. That\u2019s a hat-trick for Maclaren and 14 goals in his past eight games for club and country. Andf there\u2019s still over half an hour to go. The man is seeing them like beach balls. Wow. What a finish. Courtney Webb hit a boundary off the third-last delivery of the match to leave the Renegades needing seven runs to win, but the next-ball run-out of Carly Leeson looked to end their chances. Only a six (or an all-run five) off the last ball would win it for the Renegades. And what does Webb do? Hit a six. Astonishing. A little more here on the cricket story of the day, with Mitchell Starc - the man most likely to benefit from James Pattinson\u2019s latest brush with cricket\u2019s lawmakers - suggesting his fellow paceman might have to pull his head in. A bit. \u201cHe\u2019s that up-in-your-face fast bowler. It\u2019s something that he thrives upon and it makes him bowl better and I hope he doesn\u2019t have to shut up shop completely,\u201d Starc said. \u201cBut he has to be a little more careful of overstepping that line. There is a place for it, but perhaps in this day and age he\u2019ll have to tone it back a bit.\u201d In case you\u2019ve been in bed all day, under a rock or simply otherwise engaged, here\u2019s the story: W-League: HT: Sydney FC 2-0 Melbourne Victory W-League: HT: Canberra United 2-0 Perth Glory A-League: HT: Brisbane Roar 0-2 Melbourne City A-League: Goal! Brisbane Roar 0-2 Melbourne City (Maclaren) - 29\u2019 Jamie Maclaren. Again. That\u2019s now six goals across today\u2019s three 4pm games and just the three individual scorers. Maclaren times his run nicely, connecting with Brillante\u2019s cross and finishing the job with a glancing header. That\u2019s now six goals in his past three A-League games and 13 goals in his past eight games for club and country. And it\u2019s not even half-time yet. White hot. W-League: Goal! Sydney FC 2-0 Melbourne Victory (Siemsen) - 22\u2019 Another W-League brace and we\u2019re barely moments into the afternoon\u2019s action. Remy Siemsen shows she has several strings to her bow, climbing into Caitlin Foord\u2019s ball and heading past the Victory keeper. W-League: Goals! Canberra United 2-0 Perth Glory (Charley) - 6\u2019 &amp; 11\u2019 Canberra United, and more specifically Simone Charley, have started the new season in explosive fashion, the defender helping herself to two goals inside the opening 11 minutes. Brisbane Roar manager Robbie Fowler is blowing up deluxe in Redcliffe, first over a yellow card that wasn\u2019t given and then over penalty that wasn\u2019t. On the latter point, VAR said no dice. And Robbie should know better. VAR does not make mistakes. Period. A-League: Goal! Brisbane Roar 0-1 Melbourne City (Maclaren) - 6\u2019 Who else but that man Maclaren? The City marksman pounces on a searching through-ball from Cabrera and, given more space by Roar defenders than should be legal, takes a touch and makes no mistake. W-League: Goal! Sydney FC 1-0 Melbourne Victory (Siemsen) - 4\u2019 Before most fans had chance to return from the pop-up taco truck and claim their seats, Remy Siemsen chimes in with a sweet left-footed strike that finds its home in the bottom left corner. And we are away with our three shotgun 4pm (EDT) games in the A-League and W-League. W-League: Sydney FC v Melbourne Victory W-League: Canberra United v Perth Glory A-League: Brisbane Roar v Melbourne City Don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t know where to look. WBBL: Sydney Sixers 139-4 (20 overs) v Melbourne Renegades - Marizanne Kapp\u2019s breezy 52 not out off 34 balls helped the Sixers post what looks a competitive total in Sydney. Both Lea Tahuhu and Molly Strano took two wickets for the Renegades, the former removing Alyssa Healy for a rare single-figure score. Ellyse Perry (37 off 45) and Ashleigh Gardner (36 off 26) were other key contributors for the Sixers. Am I alone in thinking this whole Colin Kaepernick circus is a bit of a, um, circus? Issac Luke breaking his own news here. Goodbye, Warriors. Hello, Dragons. Brisbane Heat\u2019s WBBL title defence has shifted into overdrive as Jess Jonassen and Beth Mooney inspired them to a clinical eight-wicket defeat of Perth Scorchers at Drummoyne Oval in Sydney. Jonassen starred with bat (32 not out) and ball (4-23) while Mooney (60 not out) continued her magical run at the top of the order to steer the ladder-leading Heat past the Scorchers\u2019 modest 8-112 with 23 deliveries to spare on Sunday. Mooney, the tournament\u2019s top run-scorer (523 at 87.17), held firm as Maddy Green and Sammy-Jo Johnson both departed in the power play to plunder her sixth half-century of a golden summer. She found a valuable ally in allrounder Jonassen and the pair put on an unbroken 79 for the third wicket to make easy work of the run chase, securing Brisbane\u2019s fifth-straight victory. * * With lashings of thanks to AAP We\u2019ll never know if James Pattinson would have nosed out Mitchell Starc for a spot in Australia\u2019s XI for the first Test against Pakistan, not after he was today rubbed out for one match after a code of conduct breach in Victoria\u2019s Sheffield Shield loss to Queensland. James has become quite the offender, this being a third breach in his past six Shield games. Players at the MCG are understood to have dismissed Pattinson\u2019s slur against a Queensland player as banter between mates, but Tim Paine\u2019s words make for very interesting reading. Check it all out below. Afternoon, sports fans. There\u2019s no point attempting to dress it up any other way - today is complete, utter, total festival of football. Yes, there\u2019s some WBBL doing the rounds and a certain cricket story that will be discussed and debated ad nauseam in the lead-up to the first Test against Pakistan, but this fine Sunday is dominated by domestic football. There are three W-League games, two A-League games and all of this is highlighted by a Big Blue double-header at Kogarah, which from personal experience I can say is a ripper of a place to watch football (or any sport, for that matter). Fans in attendance at Netstrata Jubilee Stadium will also be treated to the sublime skills of my second-born son, who\u2019ll be doing his darnedest to find the back of the net in a small-sided game at half-time of the A-League game between Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory. It\u2019s a lovely day, it\u2019ll be close to a sellout and the Kogarah playing surface will be like a billiard table. But he\u2019ll likely think little of it. Youth is wasted on the young.",

He has already said he would repeal Sri Lanka\u2019s commitment to a UN human rights agenda for reconciliation and accountability for atrocities committed in the civil war, describing it as illegal.

Under Mahinda Rajapaksa, all dissent was crushed and journalists and campaigners were routinely attacked. The police and the judiciary were also under the control of the Rajapaksa family.

He came to power as part of the \u201cpink tide\u201d of leftwing leaders across Latin America in the last decade, whose coffers were bolstered by a regional commodity boom they pledged to spend on poverty reduction. Bolivia has the continent\u2019s second-largest natural gas reserves.</p> <p>While allies like Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez frittered away cash on unsustainable projects, Morales managed to turn Latin America\u2019s poorest country into its fastest growing and more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/how-a-populist-president-helped-bolivias-poor-but-built-himself-a-palace\" title=\"\">halved extreme poverty</a>.</p> <p>As the country\u2019s first indigenous president he brought both power and visibility to peoples who make up a majority of the country\u2019s population, but had always been politically and economically marginalised. But one part of indigenous tradition Morales never truly embraced is a rotation of power and it may have cost him his legacy. While he was reshaping his country he refused to groom a successor or contemplate his departure. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any interest in cultivating younger leaders, men or women who would take over that role and carry it forward. It was a key mistake,\u201d said Mark Goodale, lecturer in cultural and social anthropology at the University of Lausanne, who has researched Bolivia extensively.</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019d had a graceful transition from power, we\u2019d probably have a new leader [from his Movement for Socialism], and people would be writing about the legacy of Morales. He would be considered like a Nelson Mandela for Latin America.\u201d</p> <p>There were early hints that he might want to stay in power longer than the two terms allowed by the constitution. In 2009 he told a crowd: \u201cThis will be forever.\u201d More recently in 2017 he asked visiting dictator Teodoro Obiang, long-term president of Equatorial Guinea, how he managed to win elections with 90% of the vote.</p> <p>His political career was forged in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/15/coca-production-farming-bolivia-law\" title=\"\">coca-growing</a> unions. Their machiavellian politics prepared him well for the national stage, but may also have steeped him in a leadership tradition of \u201cbig man\u201d bosses who stayed in power for decades.</p> <p>Many of those who took to the streets against him recently were from the indigenous groups that first helped clear his path to power, and were frustrated by what they saw as an illegitimate power grab in the latest elections.</p> <p>Bolivia\u2019s constitution, drawn up under Morales, sets a two-term limit. His first election victory was discounted from the tally, because it came under the previous constitution, allowing him to run successfully for a third term. Soon after, he tried clearing the way for another run at high office, with a 2016 referendum to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-42165258\" title=\"\">abolish presidential term limits</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even some of those critical of Morales fell in behind him faced with what they saw as a rightwing power grab</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Morales was still extremely popular. He knew at first hand the poverty that he fought. He had <a href=\"https://yp.scmp.com/news/international/article/91417/all-about-evo-morales-bolivias-beloved-indigenous-president\" title=\"\">lost four of his six brothers and sisters</a> to malnutrition or disease in childhood, and was working from the age of five, turning his hand to everything from llama-herding and farming to football and trumpet playing.</p> <p>He is charismatic and respected for the careful stewardship of the economy, the greater social equality he created, and the championing of indigenous rights. But he had also lost supporters over his apparent failure to move on environmental protection and women\u2019s rights, including combating domestic violence and murders of women.</p> <p>\u201cHe passed laws but did nothing to reform the system which perpetuates impunity,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Galindo, founder of <a href=\"http://www.mujerescreando.org/\" title=\"\">Mujeres Creando</a>, a feminist movement.</p> <p>He also appeared to embrace, or at least accept, a growing cult of personality and expensive trappings of leadership \u2013 from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/03/bolivia-opens-7m-museum-honouring-president-morales\" title=\"\">museum dedicated to him</a> in his home town, to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/16/bolivian-president-evo-morales-new-residence-is-as-imposing-as-it-is-divisive-la-paz\" title=\"\">new government skyscraper</a> fitted with a helipad and luxury presidential suite.</p> <p>When voters rejected his proposal in 2016, instead of accepting defeat, Morales brought and won a court case, arguing that term limits violated a \u201chuman right\u201d enshrined in the constitution, for Bolivians to run freely for office and choose their leaders. The process cast the first shadow over his legitimacy, and fed suspicions among many Bolivians that he might try to tamper with the next presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cThere had never been a complaint about any of the electoral processes. It was an unprecedented track record of democratic legitimacy, until you get to 2016,\u201d said Goodale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/what-the-coup-against-evo-morales-means-to-indigenous-people-like-me\">What the coup against Evo Morales means to indigenous people like me | Nick Estes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Morales claimed victory before the final count last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/21/bolivia-confusion-over-election-results-sparks-fear-and-protests\" title=\"\">protests broke out</a> nationwide.</p> <p>\u201cAs Bolivians it has cost us a lot to get back democracy and we won\u2019t allow any government \u2013 be it from the left or the right \u2013 to take it away again,\u201d said Fernando Velarde, a 39-year-old university worker.</p> <p>The greatest controversy stemmed from a near 24-hour-long <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-election/bolivias-morales-agrees-to-new-elections-after-damning-oas-audit-idUSKBN1XK07T?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=newsOne\" title=\"\">halt to the vote count</a>, when electricity, internet and the phone supply to election headquarters were cut off.

As the country\u2019s first indigenous president he brought both power and visibility to peoples who make up a majority of the country\u2019s population, but had always been politically and economically marginalised. But one part of indigenous tradition Morales never truly embraced is a rotation of power and it may have cost him his legacy. While he was reshaping his country he refused to groom a successor or contemplate his departure. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any interest in cultivating younger leaders, men or women who would take over that role and carry it forward. It was a key mistake,\u201d said Mark Goodale, lecturer in cultural and social anthropology at the University of Lausanne, who has researched Bolivia extensively. \u201cIf he\u2019d had a graceful transition from power, we\u2019d probably have a new leader [from his Movement for Socialism], and people would be writing about the legacy of Morales. He would be considered like a Nelson Mandela for Latin America.\u201d There were early hints that he might want to stay in power longer than the two terms allowed by the constitution. In 2009 he told a crowd: \u201cThis will be forever.\u201d More recently in 2017 he asked visiting dictator Teodoro Obiang, long-term president of Equatorial Guinea, how he managed to win elections with 90% of the vote. His political career was forged in the coca-growing unions. Their machiavellian politics prepared him well for the national stage, but may also have steeped him in a leadership tradition of \u201cbig man\u201d bosses who stayed in power for decades. Many of those who took to the streets against him recently were from the indigenous groups that first helped clear his path to power, and were frustrated by what they saw as an illegitimate power grab in the latest elections. Bolivia\u2019s constitution, drawn up under Morales, sets a two-term limit. His first election victory was discounted from the tally, because it came under the previous constitution, allowing him to run successfully for a third term. Soon after, he tried clearing the way for another run at high office, with a 2016 referendum to abolish presidential term limits. Morales was still extremely popular. He knew at first hand the poverty that he fought. He had lost four of his six brothers and sisters to malnutrition or disease in childhood, and was working from the age of five, turning his hand to everything from llama-herding and farming to football and trumpet playing. He is charismatic and respected for the careful stewardship of the economy, the greater social equality he created, and the championing of indigenous rights. But he had also lost supporters over his apparent failure to move on environmental protection and women\u2019s rights, including combating domestic violence and murders of women. \u201cHe passed laws but did nothing to reform the system which perpetuates impunity,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Galindo, founder of Mujeres Creando, a feminist movement. He also appeared to embrace, or at least accept, a growing cult of personality and expensive trappings of leadership \u2013 from a museum dedicated to him in his home town, to a new government skyscraper fitted with a helipad and luxury presidential suite. When voters rejected his proposal in 2016, instead of accepting defeat, Morales brought and won a court case, arguing that term limits violated a \u201chuman right\u201d enshrined in the constitution, for Bolivians to run freely for office and choose their leaders. The process cast the first shadow over his legitimacy, and fed suspicions among many Bolivians that he might try to tamper with the next presidential election. \u201cThere had never been a complaint about any of the electoral processes. It was an unprecedented track record of democratic legitimacy, until you get to 2016,\u201d said Goodale. When Morales claimed victory before the final count last month, protests broke out nationwide. \u201cAs Bolivians it has cost us a lot to get back democracy and we won\u2019t allow any government \u2013 be it from the left or the right \u2013 to take it away again,\u201d said Fernando Velarde, a 39-year-old university worker. The greatest controversy stemmed from a near 24-hour-long halt to the vote count, when electricity, internet and the phone supply to election headquarters were cut off. When the count resumed there had been a \u201cdrastic and hard-to-explain change in the trend\u201d, handing victory to the incumbent, according to the head of the Organisation of American States election observation team. The electoral fraud threw Morales\u2019s claim of a first-round win into doubt, and as protests mounted he eventually agreed to call fresh elections. But it was too little too late. Within days he had fled the country, and what began as a popular rebellion to protect democracy was being denounced as a coup in Bolivia and abroad. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard decried a \u201cmilitary coup\u201d; Uruguay joined Mexico in refusing to recognise the interim government. In La Paz and its high-plateau sister city El Alto, hundreds of Morales supporters waved the Wiphala, shouting: \u201cCoup! Come back Evo.\u201d Even some of those critical of Morales and his attempt to stay in power fell in behind him, faced with what they saw as a rightwing power grab. But the people who have replaced him remain defiant. \u201cThe one who said there\u2019s a coup [against him] is in fact the only one who plotted a coup,\u201d said politician Gonzalo Barrientos at the swearing in of the new cabinet. And that showdown leaves Bolivia and its people vulnerable. \u201cThis is a dangerous moment,\u201d said Shultz. \u201cThe country is divided almost in half \u2026 and it\u2019s unclear who will mediate, unclear how this gets down to a place of dialogue where we can move forward.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to omit a mistaken historical reference to Morales as the first indigenous head of state in Latin America. Benito Ju\u00e1rez, of Zapotec origins, was President of Mexico 1858-1872.",

      "body": "<p>Speaking at an event devoted to \u201chealing the nation\u201d at the beginning of this election campaign, Robbie Gibb, recently knighted for his role as Theresa May\u2019s communications chief, briefly lost it with a fellow panellist. The head of Sky News, Christina Nicolotti Squires, was explaining the corrosive effect of anonymous briefings on political stories. Gibb agreed up to a point, but responded bluntly that such concerns were a sideshow in the changing relationship between politicians and the media. A far bigger problem, he claimed, lay in the effect of social platforms, particularly Twitter, on the strategy of political interviewers on radio and TV.</p> <p>\u201cBack in the day, the role of reporter and presenter was to act as an agent for viewers at home, wanting to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Gibb argued. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is that the incentives are \u2018retweets\u2019 and \u2018likes\u2019, which totally distorts the type of interview which is done.\u201d</p> <p>The result, he said, was the manufactured \u201ccar-crash interview \u2026 the \u2018I really showed it to them\u2019 line\u201d. The rewards for journalists from this approach, he maintained, came not from enlightening viewers and listeners, but in the vanity of \u201clikes and hat-tips from other reporters\u201d. Everything had become about extracting a \u201cgotcha\u201d clip in which the hapless MP floundered or was skewered, footage that could go triumphantly viral. Informed investigation or examination of the issues was secondary to such exchanges. Political interviewers, Gibb said, needed to \u201cget back in their box\u201d.</p> <p>Gibb was in charge of BBC political output \u2013 responsible for everything from <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em> to the 2017 election coverage \u2013 before taking on the calamitous role of trying to get May\u2019s tin-eared message over to parliament and the public. Leaving aside the fact that it requires some monumental chutzpah for him of all people to take issue with the culture of broadcast journalism, you can\u2019t honestly watch the progress of the current campaign without seeing some truth in his analysis.</p> <p>The most memorable moments of the grim political fortnight so far have almost all been triggered by short viral clips from broadcast interviews: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense\" title=\"\">Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s shameful arrogance about the residents of Grenfell Tower</a> in a conversation with LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari; 5 Live\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/labour-candidate-kate-ramsden-steps-down-israel-comparison\" title=\"\">Emma Barnett letting Labour\u2019s Jane Aitchison</a> dangle in silence for 12.5 seconds (count them) while she deliberated whether it was reasonable for a fellow candidate to imagine \u201ccelebrating\u201d the deaths of Tony Blair and Benjamin Netanyahu; Sophy Ridge on Sky asking Jo Swinson to explain the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/16/lib-dems-criticised-for-selective-use-of-polling-data-on-leaflets\" title=\"\">misleading graphs on Lib Dem election leaflets</a>; and pretty much every exchange with the prime minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4bf45bb17f4337667421cd65af094082108e5cde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bf45bb17f4337667421cd65af094082108e5cde/0_936_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sophy Ridge of Sky confronted Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson with claims her party was using misleading campaign literature.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophy Ridge of Sky confronted Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson with claims her party was using misleading campaign literature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Previous campaigns have turned on disastrous media moments \u2013 Gordon Brown and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/29/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-bigot\" title=\"\">that bigoted woman</a>\u201d, Ed Miliband and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/06/sun-ed-miliband-labour-mail-telegraph-election\" title=\"\">his bacon sandwich</a> \u2013 but they have generally appeared as accidental exclamation marks in the narrative of electioneering. This, by contrast, is coming to seem a campaign made up of nothing but meme-worthy gaffes and clangers, a live stream that is all heckle and no debate.</p> <p>TV viewers and radio listeners have, apparently, long bought into the idea that it is in the aggressive interview that political presenters earn their sometimes eye-watering salaries. Twitter foregrounds that long-held vicarious desire for them to \u201cgo in hard\u201d on our elected representatives, to catch them out, rather than to tease out genuine dilemmas or complications. Ever since Robin Day first mauled Harold Macmillan on TV in 1958, a ritualistic pattern has been established in which politicians attempt to convey only narrow pre-planned messages, and presenters dramatise the frustration of trying to trip them up. In this arena, as Tony Blair\u2019s spin doctor Tim Allan once observed, \u201cany communication by the politician on his or her terms is regarded [by the journalist and the viewer] as a failure.\u201d Or as the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis had it: \u201cOne of the purposes of what we do is to be seen to be pouring a bucket of custard over powerful people.\u201d</p> <p>Those custard moments have been amplified by dramatic changes in the way that we tend to receive political news. Previously, there was the sense that they might be the cathartic conclusion of a longer strategic conversation. Given the way that interview clips are now shared, however, the bucket and the custard stand alone. One of the most telling demographic changes of the last decade or so is the way in which younger people have switched off TV news. According to the most recent <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/157914/uk-news-consumption-2019-report.pdf\" title=\"\">Ofcom report</a>, the average British pensioner watches 33 minutes of real-time TV news a day, but this figure falls to just two minutes among people aged 16-24. These ratios of attention are broadly reversed when it comes to viral messaging.</p> <p>For political campaigners, clipping interviews is easier than knocking doors. Labour\u2019s highly organised Momentum group has what the organisation\u2019s co-founder Emma Rees describes as a \u201cdistributed clipping team\u201d, in which all media channels are monitored day and night by volunteers around the country. They wait to pounce on that precise moment when \u201ca Labour MP has said something good, or a Tory MP has said something terrible\u201d and get it trending. The Conservative party \u2013 bruised early on by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/tories-unrepentant-about-doctored-video-of-keir-starmer-tv-appearance\" title=\"\">unethical edit of Keir Starmer being interviewed by Piers Morgan</a> \u2013 is more likely to rely on foghorn sites such as Guido Fawkes and Breitbart to do its clip-attack work.</p> <p>If the mechanics of this process are increasingly transparent, the effect is more difficult to measure. The viral interview clips that have made headlines in this campaign have mostly gained traction because they seem to illustrate a broader truth: Rees-Mogg\u2019s patrician self-regard, in imagining himself escaping the inferno is which others perished, amplified a perception that the Tories were criminally out of touch; Aitchison\u2019s 12.5 seconds of \u201cdead air\u201d served to dramatise Labour\u2019s wider difficulty over allegations of antisemitism; Swinson\u2019s dodgy graphs appeared to illuminate a degree of exaggerated ambition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45d091f2723824ee317781bcde00da5e708b427c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d091f2723824ee317781bcde00da5e708b427c/0_226_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Marr, here interviewing Sajid Javid, admits he looks at the impact his shows have online.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Marr, here interviewing Sajid Javid, admits he looks at the impact his shows have online.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does this potential for great internet excitement change the way that interviewers approach their subjects, as Gibb argued? Andrew Marr recently suggested that he measured success in two ways when faced with a guarded politician. \u201cI judge myself by the newspaper stories and the online stories that follow any particular programme,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut secondly, at the same time, for the couple of million people watching the show, I really want them to be able to understand the person on the other side of conversation better.\u201d</p> <p>And does it change the way that politicians approach the media? Channel 4\u2019s Cathy Newman took to Twitter last week to express dismay that the leading lights of the government and opposition no longer felt duty bound to submit themselves to questioning. The old Mephistophelean exchange on which political interviews are based \u2013 trading publicity for scrutiny \u2013 has also been disrupted by social media. The prime minister can trot out no end of homemade videos in which he brews cups of tea and answers questions no harder than the name of his favourite pop group, and trust that at least part of the electorate won\u2019t notice the difference. The easiest way to minimise potential damage is to minimise the number of interviews which could produce damaging clips. And, when that fails, to keep any such interviews short.</p> <p>Perhaps the most famous moment in the history of TV political interviewing came when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/02/david-frost-interview-frost-nixon\" title=\"\">David Frost extracted his mea culpa from Richard Nixon</a>. That ultimate clippable moment was not the result of five-minute jugular-directed questioning, however, but long hours of attritional listening and insidious charm. Frost\u2019s forensic researcher James Reston Jr reflected of that moment: \u201cThe first and greatest sin of the deception of television is that it simplifies; it diminishes great, complex ideas, stretches of time; whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.\u201d</p> <p>If news stations understand the force of that fact, then so do politicians and their strategists. The interview clips that have gone viral in the current campaign are not always the ones that illustrate the most urgent news item. On Thursday morning, it appeared for once that damaging facts might upend the government\u2019s election argument, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/14/ae-waiting-times-in-england-hit-worst-ever-level\" title=\"\">the desperate figures</a> for waiting times in NHS A&amp;E departments were released. In response, Twitter found health secretary Matt Hancock making selfies in a West Country field where a health centre was apparently planned. Interview clips of Priti Patel, meanwhile, started trending, revealing her refusal to answer a question about whether the Conservatives would increase or decrease immigration numbers. The clip appeared to show the Home Secretary cornered by the journalist, prevaricating. But it also served, online, to switch the focus away from those headline NHS figures \u2013 and perhaps imply that most cynical of all current political equations, that waiting times in A&amp;E were getting longer not because of cuts to services, but because of unchecked immigration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4322a14b7dbf70a8e5dc41165233de6bdcfc9416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4322a14b7dbf70a8e5dc41165233de6bdcfc9416/0_170_3400_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MIchael Gove has been giving the impression that he isn\u2019t taking media encounters entirely seriously.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIchael Gove has been giving the impression that he isn\u2019t taking media encounters entirely seriously.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael Gove appears to be using this election campaign to test just that kind of \u201cevolved\u201d theory of news management. Consider that weird exchange with Andrew Neil on the subject of a second referendum just before campaigning began. In answer to Neil\u2019s typically forthright questions, Gove adopted an unhinged patois, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1184796948617781248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1184800897018355712&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thepoke.co.uk%2F2019%2F10%2F18%2Fmichael-gove-second-ref-aint-gonna-happen%2F\" title=\"\">\u201cdere ain\u2019t gonna be no second referendum\u201d</a> that prompted several online observers to gleefully suggest he was stoned. The strange delivery not only guaranteed that the clip racked up views, but also carried the subtext from Gove that the interview format itself was bogus, comic, all a silly game. When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1194554888006623232\" title=\"\">Nick Robinson confronted Gove</a> with a backtrack on a commitment to an inquiry into Islamophobia, also on Thursday, Gove maintained his innocence in a comparable jocular tone. If the interviewee can make the whole process appear contrived or trivial, then it loses its power to hurt.</p> <p>The prime minister, of course, has built his entire career on this principle. He appears to have calculated in this campaign that the more clips there are of him describing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax\" title=\"\">building buses out of wine crates</a> or stepping on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/15/boris-johnson-says-brexit-will-realise-potential-of-country\" title=\"\">shards of shattered cafeti\u00e8res</a>, the less likely he is to be on the wrong end of the kind of brutal dismantling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/mar/24/boris-johnson-accused-nasty-video\" title=\"\">Eddie Mair\u2019s persistent questioning</a> once delivered. On Friday, on the BBC <em>Breakfast</em> sofa, Johnson was apparently undone by a short, open question from Naga Munchetty about what made him \u201crelatable\u201d to the public. He waffled and mumbled in the same manner that he has been waffling and mumbling in response to brush-offs and fuck-offs from the flooded public in Yorkshire and the north Midlands, before attempting to dismiss the word \u201crelatable\u201d as absurd. Jeremy Vine leapt on to Twitter to congratulate his fellow BBC interrogator for her tactics. But was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/15/boris-johnson-struggles-to-say-what-makes-him-relatable-to-voters-in-bbc-interview-video\" title=\"\">disseminated clip of Johnson muttering</a> about semantics the most damaging possible outcome of their exchange?</p> <p>It would be encouraging to believe that such journalistic moments, magnified by social media, serve to change hearts and minds. The evidence, among polarised news feeds, is not compelling. Paradoxically, the politicians who have lately found themselves unwelcome in party and parliament are not those exposed by interview pratfall and subsequent Twitter outrage, but those who have attempted to trade in the nuttiness of logic and nuance. However forensic the interviewer, when the medium is geared to promote 30 seconds of theatrical slapstick the political winners are not likely to be those wrestling with the difficult truths, but those who are simply least embarrassable.</p> <h2>Sophy Ridge, Sky News </h2> <p><em>Morning anchor started the campaign by exposing Jo Swinson\u2019s double-standards in some of the Lib Dems campaign claims. \u201cThe people that I look up to in the way they interview, are those who just listen very carefully to the answers and then home in on something that they know is a story,\u201d she says.</em></p> <h2>Emily Maitlis, BBC</h2> <p><em>Earlier in the year, an eye-roll from Newsnight\u2019s lead interrogator, as she listened to Barry Gardiner set out Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, was acknowledged to \u201csum up the national mood\u201d. She describes TV interviewing as \u201cMessy. It gets things wrong. It is imperfect \u2013 sometimes laughably so \u2013 [but] sometimes you just nail it.\u201d</em></p> <h2>Emma Barnett, BBC</h2> <p><em>Barnett described the 12.5 seconds in which she waited for an answer from Labour candidate for Pudsey Jane Aitchison about whether it would be appropriate to celebrate the death of Tony Blair as the longest pause of her career. Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman identifies her as the interviewer he most admires.</em></p> <h2>Andrew Marr, BBC</h2> <p><em>The BBC had to apologise to home secretary Priti Patel after Marr accused her of laughing at him while he outlined business leaders\u2019 concerns about Brexit. \u201cI watch body language, sweat, eye movements. I\u2019ll try smiley-gentle, nasty, repetitive ... almost anything to get a fresh or surprising answer,\u201d he says.</em></p> <h2>Nick Ferrari, LBC</h2> <p><em>The Breakfast host is a cheerful scourge of woolly liberalism. His matey interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg, however, produced perhaps the most damaging quote of the campaign to date, when the minister suggested Grenfell Tower victims would have survived had they used \u201ccommon sense\u201d and ignored firefighters\u2019 instructions.</em></p> <h2>Naga Munchetty, BBC</h2> <p><em>On Friday, the Breakfast presenter sat coolly alongside a squirming prime minister while asking him if he had ever used a mop before and why voters found it hard to relate to him. Fellow BBC broadcaster Jeremy Vine tweeted in admiration: \u201cGreat lesson for interviewers, this \u2013 the question so open, and so lethal.\u201d</em></p> <p><em> </em></p>",

A far bigger problem, he claimed, lay in the effect of social platforms, particularly Twitter, on the strategy of political interviewers on radio and TV. \u201cBack in the day, the role of reporter and presenter was to act as an agent for viewers at home, wanting to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Gibb argued. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is that the incentives are \u2018retweets\u2019 and \u2018likes\u2019, which totally distorts the type of interview which is done.\u201d The result, he said, was the manufactured \u201ccar-crash interview \u2026 the \u2018I really showed it to them\u2019 line\u201d. The rewards for journalists from this approach, he maintained, came not from enlightening viewers and listeners, but in the vanity of \u201clikes and hat-tips from other reporters\u201d. Everything had become about extracting a \u201cgotcha\u201d clip in which the hapless MP floundered or was skewered, footage that could go triumphantly viral. Informed investigation or examination of the issues was secondary to such exchanges. Political interviewers, Gibb said, needed to \u201cget back in their box\u201d. Gibb was in charge of BBC political output \u2013 responsible for everything from The Andrew Marr Show to the 2017 election coverage \u2013 before taking on the calamitous role of trying to get May\u2019s tin-eared message over to parliament and the public. Leaving aside the fact that it requires some monumental chutzpah for him of all people to take issue with the culture of broadcast journalism, you can\u2019t honestly watch the progress of the current campaign without seeing some truth in his analysis. The most memorable moments of the grim political fortnight so far have almost all been triggered by short viral clips from broadcast interviews: Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s shameful arrogance about the residents of Grenfell Tower in a conversation with LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari; 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett letting Labour\u2019s Jane Aitchison dangle in silence for 12.5 seconds (count them) while she deliberated whether it was reasonable for a fellow candidate to imagine \u201ccelebrating\u201d the deaths of Tony Blair and Benjamin Netanyahu; Sophy Ridge on Sky asking Jo Swinson to explain the misleading graphs on Lib Dem election leaflets; and pretty much every exchange with the prime minister. Previous campaigns have turned on disastrous media moments \u2013 Gordon Brown and \u201cthat bigoted woman\u201d, Ed Miliband and his bacon sandwich \u2013 but they have generally appeared as accidental exclamation marks in the narrative of electioneering. This, by contrast, is coming to seem a campaign made up of nothing but meme-worthy gaffes and clangers, a live stream that is all heckle and no debate. TV viewers and radio listeners have, apparently, long bought into the idea that it is in the aggressive interview that political presenters earn their sometimes eye-watering salaries. Twitter foregrounds that long-held vicarious desire for them to \u201cgo in hard\u201d on our elected representatives, to catch them out, rather than to tease out genuine dilemmas or complications. Ever since Robin Day first mauled Harold Macmillan on TV in 1958, a ritualistic pattern has been established in which politicians attempt to convey only narrow pre-planned messages, and presenters dramatise the frustration of trying to trip them up. In this arena, as Tony Blair\u2019s spin doctor Tim Allan once observed, \u201cany communication by the politician on his or her terms is regarded [by the journalist and the viewer] as a failure.\u201d Or as the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis had it: \u201cOne of the purposes of what we do is to be seen to be pouring a bucket of custard over powerful people.\u201d Those custard moments have been amplified by dramatic changes in the way that we tend to receive political news. Previously, there was the sense that they might be the cathartic conclusion of a longer strategic conversation. Given the way that interview clips are now shared, however, the bucket and the custard stand alone. One of the most telling demographic changes of the last decade or so is the way in which younger people have switched off TV news. According to the most recent Ofcom report, the average British pensioner watches 33 minutes of real-time TV news a day, but this figure falls to just two minutes among people aged 16-24. These ratios of attention are broadly reversed when it comes to viral messaging. For political campaigners, clipping interviews is easier than knocking doors. Labour\u2019s highly organised Momentum group has what the organisation\u2019s co-founder Emma Rees describes as a \u201cdistributed clipping team\u201d, in which all media channels are monitored day and night by volunteers around the country. They wait to pounce on that precise moment when \u201ca Labour MP has said something good, or a Tory MP has said something terrible\u201d and get it trending. The Conservative party \u2013 bruised early on by its unethical edit of Keir Starmer being interviewed by Piers Morgan \u2013 is more likely to rely on foghorn sites such as Guido Fawkes and Breitbart to do its clip-attack work. If the mechanics of this process are increasingly transparent, the effect is more difficult to measure. The viral interview clips that have made headlines in this campaign have mostly gained traction because they seem to illustrate a broader truth: Rees-Mogg\u2019s patrician self-regard, in imagining himself escaping the inferno is which others perished, amplified a perception that the Tories were criminally out of touch; Aitchison\u2019s 12.5 seconds of \u201cdead air\u201d served to dramatise Labour\u2019s wider difficulty over allegations of antisemitism; Swinson\u2019s dodgy graphs appeared to illuminate a degree of exaggerated ambition. Does this potential for great internet excitement change the way that interviewers approach their subjects, as Gibb argued? Andrew Marr recently suggested that he measured success in two ways when faced with a guarded politician. \u201cI judge myself by the newspaper stories and the online stories that follow any particular programme,\u201d he said. \u201cBut secondly, at the same time, for the couple of million people watching the show, I really want them to be able to understand the person on the other side of conversation better.\u201d And does it change the way that politicians approach the media? Channel 4\u2019s Cathy Newman took to Twitter last week to express dismay that the leading lights of the government and opposition no longer felt duty bound to submit themselves to questioning. The old Mephistophelean exchange on which political interviews are based \u2013 trading publicity for scrutiny \u2013 has also been disrupted by social media. The prime minister can trot out no end of homemade videos in which he brews cups of tea and answers questions no harder than the name of his favourite pop group, and trust that at least part of the electorate won\u2019t notice the difference. The easiest way to minimise potential damage is to minimise the number of interviews which could produce damaging clips. And, when that fails, to keep any such interviews short. Perhaps the most famous moment in the history of TV political interviewing came when David Frost extracted his mea culpa from Richard Nixon. That ultimate clippable moment was not the result of five-minute jugular-directed questioning, however, but long hours of attritional listening and insidious charm. Frost\u2019s forensic researcher James Reston Jr reflected of that moment: \u201cThe first and greatest sin of the deception of television is that it simplifies; it diminishes great, complex ideas, stretches of time; whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.\u201d If news stations understand the force of that fact, then so do politicians and their strategists. The interview clips that have gone viral in the current campaign are not always the ones that illustrate the most urgent news item. On Thursday morning, it appeared for once that damaging facts might upend the government\u2019s election argument, when the desperate figures for waiting times in NHS A&amp;E departments were released. In response, Twitter found health secretary Matt Hancock making selfies in a West Country field where a health centre was apparently planned. Interview clips of Priti Patel, meanwhile, started trending, revealing her refusal to answer a question about whether the Conservatives would increase or decrease immigration numbers. The clip appeared to show the Home Secretary cornered by the journalist, prevaricating. But it also served, online, to switch the focus away from those headline NHS figures \u2013 and perhaps imply that most cynical of all current political equations, that waiting times in A&amp;E were getting longer not because of cuts to services, but because of unchecked immigration. Michael Gove appears to be using this election campaign to test just that kind of \u201cevolved\u201d theory of news management. Consider that weird exchange with Andrew Neil on the subject of a second referendum just before campaigning began. In answer to Neil\u2019s typically forthright questions, Gove adopted an unhinged patois, \u201cdere ain\u2019t gonna be no second referendum\u201d that prompted several online observers to gleefully suggest he was stoned. The strange delivery not only guaranteed that the clip racked up views, but also carried the subtext from Gove that the interview format itself was bogus, comic, all a silly game. When Nick Robinson confronted Gove with a backtrack on a commitment to an inquiry into Islamophobia, also on Thursday, Gove maintained his innocence in a comparable jocular tone. If the interviewee can make the whole process appear contrived or trivial, then it loses its power to hurt. The prime minister, of course, has built his entire career on this principle. He appears to have calculated in this campaign that the more clips there are of him describing building buses out of wine crates or stepping on shards of shattered cafeti\u00e8res, the less likely he is to be on the wrong end of the kind of brutal dismantling that Eddie Mair\u2019s persistent questioning once delivered. On Friday, on the BBC Breakfast sofa, Johnson was apparently undone by a short, open question from Naga Munchetty about what made him \u201crelatable\u201d to the public. He waffled and mumbled in the same manner that he has been waffling and mumbling in response to brush-offs and fuck-offs from the flooded public in Yorkshire and the north Midlands, before attempting to dismiss the word \u201crelatable\u201d as absurd. Jeremy Vine leapt on to Twitter to congratulate his fellow BBC interrogator for her tactics. But was that disseminated clip of Johnson muttering about semantics the most damaging possible outcome of their exchange? It would be encouraging to believe that such journalistic moments, magnified by social media, serve to change hearts and minds. The evidence, among polarised news feeds, is not compelling. Paradoxically, the politicians who have lately found themselves unwelcome in party and parliament are not those exposed by interview pratfall and subsequent Twitter outrage, but those who have attempted to trade in the nuttiness of logic and nuance. However forensic the interviewer, when the medium is geared to promote 30 seconds of theatrical slapstick the political winners are not likely to be those wrestling with the difficult truths, but those who are simply least embarrassable. Sophy Ridge, Sky News Morning anchor started the campaign by exposing Jo Swinson\u2019s double-standards in some of the Lib Dems campaign claims. \u201cThe people that I look up to in the way they interview, are those who just listen very carefully to the answers and then home in on something that they know is a story,\u201d she says. Emily Maitlis, BBC Earlier in the year, an eye-roll from Newsnight\u2019s lead interrogator, as she listened to Barry Gardiner set out Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, was acknowledged to \u201csum up the national mood\u201d. She describes TV interviewing as \u201cMessy. It gets things wrong. It is imperfect \u2013 sometimes laughably so \u2013 [but] sometimes you just nail it.\u201d Emma Barnett, BBC Barnett described the 12.5 seconds in which she waited for an answer from Labour candidate for Pudsey Jane Aitchison about whether it would be appropriate to celebrate the death of Tony Blair as the longest pause of her career. Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman identifies her as the interviewer he most admires. Andrew Marr, BBC The BBC had to apologise to home secretary Priti Patel after Marr accused her of laughing at him while he outlined business leaders\u2019 concerns about Brexit. \u201cI watch body language, sweat, eye movements. I\u2019ll try smiley-gentle, nasty, repetitive ... almost anything to get a fresh or surprising answer,\u201d he says. Nick Ferrari, LBC The Breakfast host is a cheerful scourge of woolly liberalism. His matey interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg, however, produced perhaps the most damaging quote of the campaign to date, when the minister suggested Grenfell Tower victims would have survived had they used \u201ccommon sense\u201d and ignored firefighters\u2019 instructions. Naga Munchetty, BBC On Friday, the Breakfast presenter sat coolly alongside a squirming prime minister while asking him if he had ever used a mop before and why voters found it hard to relate to him. Fellow BBC broadcaster Jeremy Vine tweeted in admiration: \u201cGreat lesson for interviewers, this \u2013 the question so open, and so lethal.\u201d",

The premise is a fertile one for the author, an expert chronicler of adolescence and its many indignities, as well as its erratic, overwhelming passions. Ferrante retains an extraordinary ability to conjure the concerns and changing priorities of different ages. She carefully depicts the way strong feelings can fade and mutate, with razor-sharp insights into the hypocrisies and muddled reasons that make people act the way they do. Parents\u2019 foibles and unappealing habits are transmitted, Larkin-like, to their children.</p> <p>What immediately distinguishes this book from its predecessors is its focus on the upper echelons of Neapolitan society in the early 1990s. Giovanna grows up in a wealthy leftwing household in which lively discussions about Marxism and the end of history are habitual; she and her friends are given educational booklets about sex and taught that they \u201cneed to feel proud to have been born female\u201d. But, as Giovanna\u2019s search for her mysterious aunt Vittoria leads her to discover a different Naples \u2013 much closer to the working class <em>rione</em> of the previous books \u2013 she does her best to cast off her privileged upbringing in favour of ill-considered liaisons with older men and a poorly pronounced, tentative Neapolitan dialect (one of the few things her liberal parents banned), often to humorous effect. Sculpture at Saint Martin\u2019s College surely beckons.</p> <p>As her apparently idyllic family unit starts to tear itself apart, Giovanna further exhibits rebellion against her humanist, progressive parents by flirting with a belief in the supernatural and, thanks to a fateful church visit with Vittoria, religion. This is where tall, studious, curly-haired Roberto \u2013 reminiscent of the quartet\u2019s Nino Sarratore \u2013 comes in, delivering a sermon about compunction (you wait ages for the unattainable love interest in the follow-up to a much-loved series to be a hot priest figure, and then...). Giovanna is smitten.</p> <p>If there is a sense of having been here before, it\u2019s because there are themes common to Ferrante\u2019s other work: a fascination with beauty, or the lack of it; class, and the ability to transcend poverty through study; the contrast and links between vulgarity and refinement. Families falling apart formed the basis of <em>The Days of Abandonment</em>; a complex, somewhat tedious narrative strand involving a grandmother\u2019s bracelet brings to mind the mother\u2019s clothes in <em>Troubling Love</em>. But, unlike the case in much of Ferrante\u2019s previous fiction, there isn\u2019t a character who acts as a direct foil to the protagonist.</p> <p>Instead, various female figures appear and disappear without ever matching the rich character development granted to Giovanna, who goes from insecurity and painful self-analysis to an acceptance of sorts. At the start, it is Vittoria who imbues the story with a sense of momentum, her meetings with Giovanna described in vivid, electrifying detail. But as her figure is sidelined halfway through the book, the pace increases, flitting from scene to scene in quick succession.

It will have pleased, not bothered, Labour\u2019s leadership that there are furious arguments about its costs, feasibility and effect. The telecoms boss who attacked it as \u201cbroadband communism\u201d was helping them out. If he\u2019d had more wit and a more nuanced understanding of leftwing ideologies, he would have called it \u201cbroadband bolivarianism\u201d. Boris Johnson also did them a favour when he called it \u201ca crackpot scheme\u201d. Better that everyone is talking about a Labour policy pledge that is going to be popular with at least some voters than that everyone is tugging at the loose threads of Labour\u2019s contorted and muddled positions on Brexit, another referendum on Scottish independence or immigration, to name three of the topics in which the party had got into a hot mess in the preceding 48 hours.</p> <p>That may help explain the rather curious timing of the announcement of Corbyn Infinity Broadband. You might have expected a pledge this splashy to be saved for manifesto launch week rather than sprung upon an unprepared world late on a Thursday night. This commitment was never previously agreed at a Labour conference and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, had previously said that British Telecom was \u201cnot on my list\u201d of nationalisations. This strengthens my hunch that the policy was rushed out to distract from Labour\u2019s difficulties on other fronts and as a diversion from its internal rows about the contents of its manifesto. Though many doubt that this broadband pledge will ever be fulfilled even if Labour wins this election, it is an excellent illustration of both the strengths and weaknesses of the Corbyn programme. On the positive side, the party can field some reasonable arguments in favour of the policy. It can be persuasively contended that the internet is not a discretionary consumer service, but a utility essential to the lives of everyone who has not chosen the life of the digital hermit. There is also a good case to be made that the private sector has done a poor and slow job of modernising Britain\u2019s network and the state needs to step in to ensure that there is universal provision. Mr Corbyn, a man who is not always at his most accomplished when explaining policy, made those arguments well when he unveiled the pledge.</p> <p>Early polling suggests that it has gone down positively with many voters. Because it involves another nationalisation, the creation of an additional state entity and new, if vaguely defined, taxes on tech giants, it will be called left wing. But it is not actually redistributionist. The greatest beneficiaries of free broadband would most likely be the more affluent households, which would get for nothing what they are already capable of paying for. So file this one in the same folder where we keep the pledge to scrap all student tuition fees: the folder marked Labour gifts to the middle classes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/15/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-labours-broadband-pledge-dominates\">Andrew Sparrow's election briefing: Labour's broadband pledge dominates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It differs from Labour\u2019s other proposed nationalisations in key respects.

This is obviously designed to be the most voter-attractive element of the package that Labour costs at \u00a320bn and industry experts say will come in at more like \u00a3100bn. The flaw in this pledge as a campaign device is that it will feed into the already widely held belief that Labour\u2019s prospectus is less a carefully costed plan for Britain and more an ever-lengthening wishlist with little plausible indication of how it is all going to be paid for. No Tory has been as mocking of free broadband as Chris Leslie, the former Labour MP and shadow chancellor and once an aide to Gordon Brown, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisLeslieMP/status/1195106186577793027\" title=\"\">who joked</a>: \u201cWhy not throw in free Sky TV?

First, a lot of voters tend to be instinctively suspicious that a party promising the moon will end up costing them the earth.

The shadow cabinet as a collective do not radiate reassurance that they would manage the public\u2019s money as carefully as if they had earned it themselves. John McDonnell is the best of them when he does his impression of an avuncular bank manager. Despite the shadow chancellor\u2019s efforts to project himself as a safe pair of hands, Labour is badly behind the Tories when voters are asked to rate the parties on \u201ceconomic competence\u201d and this despite the fact that the official statisticians have just confirmed that last year\u2019s growth was the feeblest in a decade. It doesn\u2019t help when the shadow chancellor falls out publicly with the shadow health secretary about how his proposed four-day working week would affect the operation of the National Health Service. If the party\u2019s leading figures can\u2019t agree how their policies would work in practice, and voters aren\u2019t confident that the economy and their livelihoods are going to be safe in Labour\u2019s hands, they aren\u2019t likely to believe that the party\u2019s promises can be delivered.</p> <p>This is compounded by the sheer scale of Labour\u2019s spending promises. It is true that all the parties are splashing around the cash at this election in the apparent belief that a promise a day keeps the voters at bay. I\u2019m minded to agree with those who argue that this is most likely to deepen public cynicism. Labour is by far and away the biggest of the big spenders. The Tories shouldn\u2019t bother concocting phoney estimates of how much a Corbyn-McDonnell government would add to state expenditure and borrowing because I think the country has already twigged that it would be a very big number.</p> <p>That is the spectre from the last election that haunts this Labour effort. In case anyone needs reminding, the party lost in 2017. Eye-catching spending pledges and promises of loads of free stuff can grab headlines and energise the campaign and then not secure power. And without that vital commodity you never have the means to give away broadband or fulfil any of your promises.

In the mid-90s, Netscape was killed by Microsoft with its Internet Explorer. Then, in the late 2000s, a resurgent Firefox faced near-fatal competition from Google\u2019s Chrome. Now, hopefully, it is on another upswing.</p> <p>\u201cFor the last \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 three or four years, I\u2019d say Mozilla has been remaking the organisation itself,\u201d Baker says. The Firefox browser, which had resisted the dominance of Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer, found itself faced with a far hardier opponent in the shape of Google Chrome.</p> <p>However, the rise of the potentially monopolistic web platform also creates a new opportunity \u2013 in fact, an urgent new mission. Mozilla is no longer fighting for market share of its browser: it is fighting for the future of the web.</p> <p>\u201cIn the early days, we thought all companies and social networks cared about us and cared for us,\u201d says Baker, speaking for web users as a whole. \u201cAnd increasingly it has become clear that, no, you need someone looking out for you.\u201d</p> <p>Chrome, the world\u2019s most popular browser, is made by the world\u2019s fourth-most valuable company, Alphabet, the parent company of Google.

Google\u2019s main priority is to funnel user data into the enormous advertising engine that accounts for most of its revenue. Apple\u2019s motivation is to ensure that customers continue to buy a new iPhone every couple of years and don\u2019t switch to Android.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle wants the web to go through Google,\u201d Aral Balkan, the activist and founder of the internet democracy campaign site <a href=\"https://ind.ie/\" title=\"\">ind.ie</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aral/status/1191283230894415872\">tweeted earlier this month</a>. \u201cIt already mostly does: with eyes on 70% to 80% of the web.\u201d</p> <p>The company has been accused of using its control of Chrome and of Google search to warp the very fabric of the internet.</p> <p>Take \u201caccelerated mobile pages\u201d, or AMP.

But it is unlikely that any browser made by an advertising company would offer such a feature.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you go on Facebook and contribute a post, a like or whatever, you're giving information to Facebook</p> <footer> <cite>Mitchell Baker, Mozilla</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not just Google that benefits. It may treat Facebook as a bitter rival, but both companies have a shared interest in limiting the ability of users to shape how the web works.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that if you go on Facebook and contribute information in some way \u2013 a post, a like or whatever \u2013 you\u2019re giving information to Facebook,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWhat\u2019s not as obvious is that there are a lot of times when you\u2019re on some other site, doing something unrelated and, behind the scenes, Facebook is still gathering information \u2013 especially if you\u2019ve signed in with Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>So Firefox now runs sites such as Facebook in \u201ccontainers\u201d, effectively hiving the social network off into its own little sandboxed world, where it can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening on other sites. Baker says: \u201cIt reduces Facebook\u2019s ability to follow you around the web and track you when you\u2019re not on Facebook and just living your life.\u201d</p> <p>Baker insists solutions such as this are important, saying: \u201cThe dystopian future is a risk for all of us. For those of us who remember <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, is that one possible future in front of us? For sure.\u201d</p> <p>The fight takes place on several fronts and Mozilla is hoping to use its framing as \u201cyour pal on the internet\u201d to branch out from being just a browser provider. (An email client, <a href=\"https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/\" title=\"\">Thunderbird</a>, has survived alongside Firefox, but is demoted to the status of community project.)</p> <p>Mozilla has launched <a href=\"https://monitor.firefox.com/\" title=\"\">Monitor</a>, a data-breach reporting service; <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/\" title=\"\">Lockwise</a>, a password manager; and <a href=\"https://send.firefox.com/?utm_source=www.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=nav&amp;utm_content=firefox\" title=\"\">Send</a>, a privacy-focused alternative to services such as WeSendit. It\u2019s also beta-testing a VPN (virtual private network) service, which it hopes to market to privacy-conscious users.</p> <p>Such a suite is an impressive sales pitch to a certain type of user \u2013 one who hopes for a better outcome than the one Baker fears. She says: \u201cOne thing that we\u2019ve learned from our past is that it\u2019s hard to imagine a different future until you can somehow see or touch the promise of it. Before Firefox, everyone \u2018knew\u2019 what the internet was going to look like. And that was Microsoft.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems funny today \u2013 there\u2019s a generation today who can\u2019t imagine that \u2013 but until 2005, it was 100% known that Microsoft was going to control the internet.\u201d</p> <p>If only it were so simple this time around. If Mozilla could be the David to Chrome\u2019s Goliath, the company would have an easy pitch. But there is a third player in the mix: Apple.</p> <p>On the surface, the two companies share goals \u2013 and features. Where Firefox has \u201cenhanced tracking protection\u201d, Apple\u2019s Safari browser has \u201cintelligent tracking prevention\u201d. Where Firefox takes a swipe at Google by swearing that by contrast it \u201cprotects your privacy in every product\u201d, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook knocks Facebook by saying: \u201cPrivacy to us is a human right, a civil liberty.\u201d</p> <p>Those similarities make Apple harder for Firefox to square off against. Yet in some ways, it is the more dangerous competitor.</p> <p>For all the leverage that Google puts into making Chrome succeed, it leaves space for Firefox. Desktop computers can always download another browser. Android phones may be shipped out with Chrome pre-installed \u2013 a fact that has put Google in hot water with EU regulators \u2013 but those phones allow users to install Firefox instead. Chrome OS, Google\u2019s operating system, which effectively wraps a thin layer around an always-open browser window, is more locked down, but ultimately just a thin slice of the market.</p> <p>Things are different in Apple\u2019s section of the world. Macs remain a fairly open system, although the increasing focus on the Mac app store, which Firefox isn\u2019t on, bodes ill for the browser\u2019s future. And Apple\u2019s iOS (mobile operating system) is an acknowledged disaster for Mozilla. Safari is the default and, while users can install other browsers, they come doubly hindered: they can never be set as the default, meaning any link clicked in other applications will open in Safari; and they must use Safari\u2019s \u201crendering engine\u201d, a technical limitation that means that even the browsers that Firefox does have on the platform are technically just fancy wrappers for Apple\u2019s own browser, rather than full versions of the service that Mozilla has built over the decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba6e367f1c5a1ad26ddee73e6a2d18bbc0717631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba6e367f1c5a1ad26ddee73e6a2d18bbc0717631/532_403_3073_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple\u2019s boss Tim Cook has made the firm\u2019s privacy features a selling point \u2013 which is tough for Mozilla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple\u2019s boss Tim Cook has made the firm\u2019s privacy features a selling point \u2013 which is tough for Mozilla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cApple\u2019s stance is \u2018you should trust us and we\u2019re different and better,\u2019\u201d says Baker. \u201cI believe that\u2019s a serious commitment right now at Apple. And that works \u2013 as long as everything that you want and need is OK coming through Apple and you can pay for it all. But the minute there\u2019s something heterogeneous, or there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t fit with Apple, or there\u2019s something new, then you\u2019re out of luck.</p> <p>\u201cEven if you do download a replacement, iOS drops you back into the default. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s acceptable. Every link you open on a phone is the choice of the phone maker, even if you, as a user, want something else.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Apple listening at all. We make a huge technical investment in this obscure layer, called the rendering engine, because it turns out that\u2019s where there\u2019s a lot of power. In some systems, you can see the powerful thing right up front. But often the real power of the system is under the hood. And that\u2019s true of how you see content on the web. So we invest a lot in it and Apple simply prohibits it. We just can\u2019t use that technology. So I don\u2019t see that changing.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, Firefox\u2019s future is as much down to the decisions of a few regulators as it is about anything Mozilla can do.

      "body": "<p>Their shining morning faces cover the walls of the Duveen galleries from floor to ceiling: beaming, laughing, awkward, exuberant. Who could not love them, all these eager young children from primary schools across London? Seventy-six thousand year 3 pupils, aged seven or eight, arranged on the diminutive wooden benches of our childhood in thousands of class photographs. This is a collective portrait of both our past and our future. Face to face with all this rising hope, which of us could not be moved?</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/steve-mcqueen-year-3\" title=\"\">Year 3</a></strong>, Steve McQueen\u2019s new project with <a href=\"https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/year-3/\" title=\"\">Artangel</a>, is unassailable in its emotional immediacy and grandeur. At first it thrives on the impact of its sheer scale. Walk into Tate Britain and you can hardly take in the spectacle of so many school photographs stretching into the distance, and all of them so regular in their lineup and format: the benches at identical range from the camera, the children symmetrically arranged around their teachers, the colours of the school clothes \u2013 red, grey, purple, royal blue \u2013 regularly repeating. They are all of them, so to speak, uniform shots; at least until the eye homes in.</p> <p>Skewed ties, missing teeth, the wild child, the double act fooling about in the back row: perhaps one looks for the familiar at first. But then there is that tall boy in a turban leaning so slightly out of line, as if he wanted to break free; the baffled girl with the amber eyes stretching out her hands; the nervous anxiety of the child squeezed into the front row at the last moment, not quite sitting on the bench.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3e6adb49f21e1cf590140352dfed5c9a97e81ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3e6adb49f21e1cf590140352dfed5c9a97e81ab/0_0_5599_3360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Year 3 at Tate Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheer scale\u2026 Year 3 at Tate Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/ Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some classes break into laughter at the shutter\u2019s click, delighted by the photographer\u2019s rival smile, or perhaps by the whole surprise of the occasion (few primary schools organise these all-together-now group portraits any more).

      "body": "<p>One crisp and sunny morning last week, the normally busy road outside the main entrance to the University of Hong Kong was eerily quiet. Overlooked by mango trees, the road was empty, save for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/mini-stonehenges-hong-kong-protesters-take-on-police-one-brick-at-a-time\" title=\"\">piles of bricks that protesters had scattered across it overnight</a> as a barricade to paralyse traffic.</p> <p>As students guarded the entrance against the potential arrival of riot police, a woman shouted \u201cWe support you!\u201d across the road. As soon as she had finished, another man shouted: \u201cI don\u2019t! You people are university students, for crying out loud!\u201d</p> <p>The anti-government movement in Hong Kong, now in its sixth month, is causing increasingly deep divisions across the community.</p> <p>The Chinese-ruled city has seen its most violent scenes yet in the past week, with protesters blocking roads and throwing petrol bombs at trains and railway tracks, a police officer shooting a young man at close range, a man set on fire after being doused with flammable liquid by a protester, and police entering university campuses for the first time to battle with students. China has issued stark warnings and the government confirmed the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/hong-kong-plunges-into-deep-recession\" title=\"\">first recession for a decade last week</a>.</p> <p>With no end in sight, the continued escalation of violence has also caused widespread concerns over the future. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/second-death-in-hong-kong-protests-as-xi-demands-end-to-violence\" title=\"\">has directly condemned the protests for the first time</a> and the city\u2019s number two official has vowed that the government will adopt \u201cdecisive measures\u201d to put an end to violence.</p> <p>While students say last week\u2019s radical action, which included protesters shooting flaming arrows and petrol bombs at police, were an effort to enforce a citywide paralysis in response to the death of a student who died after a fall during the protests, the wider population is becoming increasingly sceptical.</p> <p>Grumbles can be heard all over the city about the disruption to people\u2019s lives \u2013 from office workers\u2019 30-minute commutes turning to two-hour journeys on foot to the old and sick, and even doctors, unable to get to hospitals because roads are blocked. \u201cWhen we ask when the police will stop using violence, can we also ask when the protesters will stop their violence?\u201d said an angry caller on a radio phone-in last week.</p> <p>But the support for the wider movement remains strong even if Hongkongers are becoming intolerant of violence. A survey released in mid-October conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed 52.5 % of the 751 respondents it surveyed believed the government bore the most responsibility for the conflict, while 18.1% blamed the police and 9.6% blamed the protesters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Democracy should be about tolerance. Both police and students are now led by their anger</p> <footer> <cite>Hong Kong banker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was even considerable support for the movement among the finance and banking sector, which is normally regarded as conservative. During lunch hours over the past week, hundreds of smartly dressed professionals took to the streets in the city\u2019s financial hub condemning police violence. On some days, riot police threw teargas, beat demonstrators and made arrests near the stock exchange building.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t accept the violence, but I understand the youngsters\u2019 frustrations, because the government has not responded to their demands and keeps using police violence,\u201d said a banker in his 30s who gave his name as Ryan.</p> <p>\u201cThe movement has been hijacked [by radicals] and I question their approach,\u201d said an employee at an investment bank. \u201cI sympathise with the students, but democracy should be about tolerance and not forcing people to go along with you. Both police and students are now led by their anger.\u201d</p> <p>Even a 70-year-old market stall owner who had been exposed to teargas showed his sympathy. \u201cWhat kind of a city is this when the kids are not afraid of death? They have no opportunities under this government.\u201d</p> <p>But regardless of their political stance, Hongkongers are now deeply worried. As the conflict continues to mount, the government shows no desire to give further political concessions while China\u2019s leaders issue stern warnings. In September, the Hong Kong government belatedly scrapped a controversial extradition bill that sparked the political crisis in June, but protesters continue to demand democratic reforms and an independent body to investigate police brutality.</p> <p>On Thursday, Xi said during a presidential visit to Brazil that the Chinese government was determined to \u201csafeguard national sovereignty and security\u201d and was against \u201cexternal forces meddling in Hong Kong affairs\u201d. He pledged support for the city\u2019s police and leaders, and said \u201chalting the violence and restoring order is Hong Kong\u2019s most urgent task,\u201d according to the state news agency, Xinhua.</p> <p>After a key Communist party meeting, the Fourth Plenum, which concluded on 31 October, China signalled it would bring the semi-autonomous city under tighter control. It stressed that national sovereignty should take precedence in the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy that has allowed Hong Kong extensive autonomy since the handover from British rule, and warned that it would not tolerate \u201cany actions that split the country\u201d. It said Hong Kong should perfect its legal system to \u201csafeguard national security\u201d \u2013 hinting at the revival of a subversion law shelved in 2003 \u2013 and increase \u201cpatriotic education\u201d among its citizens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a393198cbb25cf3201aa07c208b46f878afba006\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a393198cbb25cf3201aa07c208b46f878afba006/0_0_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents form a human chain to clear debris from a concrete barricade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents form a human chain to clear debris from a concrete barricade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Kwan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Analysts in China say the official rhetoric is a clear indication that more draconian measures will be introduced to quash Hong Kong\u2019s pleas for more freedoms. The city\u2019s government has already invoked an emergency law that bypasses the legislature to impose a ban on face masks in public assemblies. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance empowers the government to impose measures including a curfew, censorship of publications and communications, arrest and detention and the freezing of assets.</p> <p>Zhang Lifan, an independent political commentator, said Beijing had set a hardline tone in the Fourth Plenum and its policy towards Hong Kong would only toughen.

      "bodyText": "One crisp and sunny morning last week, the normally busy road outside the main entrance to the University of Hong Kong was eerily quiet. Overlooked by mango trees, the road was empty, save for piles of bricks that protesters had scattered across it overnight as a barricade to paralyse traffic. As students guarded the entrance against the potential arrival of riot police, a woman shouted \u201cWe support you!\u201d across the road. As soon as she had finished, another man shouted: \u201cI don\u2019t! You people are university students, for crying out loud!\u201d The anti-government movement in Hong Kong, now in its sixth month, is causing increasingly deep divisions across the community. The Chinese-ruled city has seen its most violent scenes yet in the past week, with protesters blocking roads and throwing petrol bombs at trains and railway tracks, a police officer shooting a young man at close range, a man set on fire after being doused with flammable liquid by a protester, and police entering university campuses for the first time to battle with students. China has issued stark warnings and the government confirmed the city\u2019s first recession for a decade last week. With no end in sight, the continued escalation of violence has also caused widespread concerns over the future. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has directly condemned the protests for the first time and the city\u2019s number two official has vowed that the government will adopt \u201cdecisive measures\u201d to put an end to violence. While students say last week\u2019s radical action, which included protesters shooting flaming arrows and petrol bombs at police, were an effort to enforce a citywide paralysis in response to the death of a student who died after a fall during the protests, the wider population is becoming increasingly sceptical. Grumbles can be heard all over the city about the disruption to people\u2019s lives \u2013 from office workers\u2019 30-minute commutes turning to two-hour journeys on foot to the old and sick, and even doctors, unable to get to hospitals because roads are blocked. \u201cWhen we ask when the police will stop using violence, can we also ask when the protesters will stop their violence?\u201d said an angry caller on a radio phone-in last week. But the support for the wider movement remains strong even if Hongkongers are becoming intolerant of violence. A survey released in mid-October conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed 52.5 % of the 751 respondents it surveyed believed the government bore the most responsibility for the conflict, while 18.1% blamed the police and 9.6% blamed the protesters. There was even considerable support for the movement among the finance and banking sector, which is normally regarded as conservative. During lunch hours over the past week, hundreds of smartly dressed professionals took to the streets in the city\u2019s financial hub condemning police violence. On some days, riot police threw teargas, beat demonstrators and made arrests near the stock exchange building. \u201cI don\u2019t accept the violence, but I understand the youngsters\u2019 frustrations, because the government has not responded to their demands and keeps using police violence,\u201d said a banker in his 30s who gave his name as Ryan. \u201cThe movement has been hijacked [by radicals] and I question their approach,\u201d said an employee at an investment bank. \u201cI sympathise with the students, but democracy should be about tolerance and not forcing people to go along with you. Both police and students are now led by their anger.\u201d Even a 70-year-old market stall owner who had been exposed to teargas showed his sympathy. \u201cWhat kind of a city is this when the kids are not afraid of death? They have no opportunities under this government.\u201d But regardless of their political stance, Hongkongers are now deeply worried. As the conflict continues to mount, the government shows no desire to give further political concessions while China\u2019s leaders issue stern warnings. In September, the Hong Kong government belatedly scrapped a controversial extradition bill that sparked the political crisis in June, but protesters continue to demand democratic reforms and an independent body to investigate police brutality. On Thursday, Xi said during a presidential visit to Brazil that the Chinese government was determined to \u201csafeguard national sovereignty and security\u201d and was against \u201cexternal forces meddling in Hong Kong affairs\u201d. He pledged support for the city\u2019s police and leaders, and said \u201chalting the violence and restoring order is Hong Kong\u2019s most urgent task,\u201d according to the state news agency, Xinhua. After a key Communist party meeting, the Fourth Plenum, which concluded on 31 October, China signalled it would bring the semi-autonomous city under tighter control. It stressed that national sovereignty should take precedence in the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy that has allowed Hong Kong extensive autonomy since the handover from British rule, and warned that it would not tolerate \u201cany actions that split the country\u201d. It said Hong Kong should perfect its legal system to \u201csafeguard national security\u201d \u2013 hinting at the revival of a subversion law shelved in 2003 \u2013 and increase \u201cpatriotic education\u201d among its citizens. Analysts in China say the official rhetoric is a clear indication that more draconian measures will be introduced to quash Hong Kong\u2019s pleas for more freedoms. The city\u2019s government has already invoked an emergency law that bypasses the legislature to impose a ban on face masks in public assemblies. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance empowers the government to impose measures including a curfew, censorship of publications and communications, arrest and detention and the freezing of assets. Zhang Lifan, an independent political commentator, said Beijing had set a hardline tone in the Fourth Plenum and its policy towards Hong Kong would only toughen. It may use the current unrest as an excuse to postpone the district election scheduled for 24 November, in which the pro-Beijing candidates are expected to fare badly. It could also use the emergency law to curb more civil freedoms, such as the much-discussed curfew. Zhang said the party may resort to drastic action if it feels its authority is being threatened. \u201cIt is a double-edged sword: it will ruin the city but also ruin itself,\u201d he said, noting China\u2019s extensive business interests in Hong Kong. \u201cBut for the sake of preserving its authority, the worst choice cannot be ruled out.\u201d Wu Qiang, a former politics lecturer at Beijing\u2019s prestigious Tsinghua University, said China was extending its totalitarian governance to Hong Kong, but as it could not implement a Tiananmen-style military crackdown on the city, it would continue to use the police force to violently suppress protesters. \u201cThe party plenum has ruled out political solutions so I expect the crackdown and confrontations to further escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis may continue for one, two years or even more than a decade, until the Hong Kong problem is forgotten. It will hurt China and Hong Kong\u2019s interests, but China\u2019s politics is rigid and lacks political wisdom. To [preserve] the leadership\u2019s face, it has little choice.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A single step inside the socialist Kshama Sawant\u2019s office on the second floor of City Hall in downtown Seattle and a visitor knows exactly where the newly re-elected city council member stands politically.</p> <p>One wall is plastered with every imaginable poster on policies she\u2019s pushed for, including rent control and $15 an hour minimum wage. One bright red poster says, \u201cUnionize Amazon\u201d and \u201cTax Bezos\u201d in large white letters. It offers a glimpse into a potential upcoming battle for Sawant now that she beat her rival, the business-backed Egan Orion, despite his unprecedented financial support from Amazon.</p> <p>The collection is her \u201clabor of love\u201d and frequently updated with the day\u2019s latest struggles, says Sawant, who is sitting at a long table in her office Tuesday with a mason jar filled with apple cider (It\u2019s from PCC Community Markets, a local food cooperative whose workers, she happily reveals, are unionized).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/05/amazon-seattle-councilwoman-kshama-sawant-re-election-bid\">Is Amazon taking revenge on a Seattle socialist after she took on company?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She\u2019s been up since well before 5am, juggling a day packed with media interviews and council meetings. But you wouldn\u2019t know it by the rapid-fire analysis she provides of her recent momentous win.</p> <p>She says that she hopes other candidates like her across the world take note of this major victory.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that a socialist who has been an unapologetic fighter for ordinary people and who has doggedly used a movement-building approach and shown herself to be extremely effective and successful, that you can win three elections, that should be extremely empowering for our movements,\u201d said Sawant, who will now be starting her third term in office in January.</p> <p>Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle, contributed $1.5m into the local city council elections by way of a political action committee sponsored by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. The Civic Alliance for a Sound Economy backed her opponent, Orion, and six other candidates considered to be business-friendly. Only two of them ultimately won.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"881b8a9c45428fe3e01a49bb18005266d4724514\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881b8a9c45428fe3e01a49bb18005266d4724514/0_174_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kshama Sawant\u2019s campaign office in Seattle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kshama Sawant\u2019s campaign office in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sawant, a Mumbai-educated economist and former tech worker, said the Amazon money certainly had a negative impact on her campaign, citing the many attack mailers and online attack ads that have circulated. But it also helped to further galvanize her grassroots support. Her campaign ultimately saw hundreds of volunteers who knocked on more than 200,000 doors, and over $500,000 in donations from hundreds of individual donors across the US.</p> <p>On election night, Sawant trailed Orion by 8%, but days later, after the remaining ballots were counted, she managed to take the lead. Washington state runs a vote-by-mail system, which means it can take days to achieve a final count. It wasn\u2019t until the following Tuesday that Orion conceded.</p> <p>In 2013, Sawant unseated the 16-year incumbent Richard Conlin, a Democrat, to become the first socialist on the Seattle council in nearly a century. Since then, she has helped to raise the city\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour and provide renters with more rights.</p> <p>From the beginning she has been a fierce critic of big business and its influence on Seattle.</p> <p>Last year, she drew national headlines through her push for the controversial head tax, a per-employee tax on large corporations. Amazon has about 45,000 workers in Seattle, so it would have potentially had to pay millions each year through the tax. The funds would have been used for housing for the homeless, but was repealed one month after passing unanimously.</p> <p>Now that she has been re-elected, Sawant says one key priority will be to push again for this type of tax. She says she believes it\u2019s possible as long as she builds up an even more powerful movement.</p> <p>Sawant has long been viewed as one of the area\u2019s more controversial politicians. One key complaint has been about her ability to collaborate and work with fellow council members in order to get policy enacted. As one editorial published last month in the Seattle Times put it, \u201cThe Socialist Alternative rabble rouser \u2013 or should I say champion of the common people \u2013 has shown herself not especially interested in comity and compromise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86b358378fa7e0434ad41b6c0aeb1d8d20861b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86b358378fa7e0434ad41b6c0aeb1d8d20861b44/0_2_4439_2665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kshama Sawant speaks to her supporters, 5 November 2019, at the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center, in Seattle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kshama Sawant speaks to her supporters, 5 November 2019, at the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center, in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genna Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sawant said she believes in being cordial and building unity with other elected officials, but ultimately her job is to represent the interests of the working people.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they say that, \u2018Oh we don\u2019t have a good working relationship,\u2019 what they are actually saying is that I am not accountable to them, I\u2019m accountable to the movement,\u201d said Sawant. \u201cBut that\u2019s not something I hide, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m planning to change and I\u2019m proud of that because that is the only winning strategy.\u201d</p> <p>In her upcoming term, two of her key priorities will be on pushing for a tax on big business, and rent control, something she has been advocating for since she was first elected. In September, she introduced a proposal that would limit rent increases to the rate of inflation.</p> <p>When she kicks off her new office term, she will now be the most senior member of the city council. But if anyone thinks that\u2019s going to have any impact on how she governs, you would be sorely mistaken.</p> <p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m technically senior, that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m now suddenly going to lead the establishment wing of the council,\u201d she says. \u201cI am still going to be 100% loyal to the movement that I am a part of and continue to use my office to build that struggle even more strongly that we already have.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A single step inside the socialist Kshama Sawant\u2019s office on the second floor of City Hall in downtown Seattle and a visitor knows exactly where the newly re-elected city council member stands politically. One wall is plastered with every imaginable poster on policies she\u2019s pushed for, including rent control and $15 an hour minimum wage. One bright red poster says, \u201cUnionize Amazon\u201d and \u201cTax Bezos\u201d in large white letters. It offers a glimpse into a potential upcoming battle for Sawant now that she beat her rival, the business-backed Egan Orion, despite his unprecedented financial support from Amazon. The collection is her \u201clabor of love\u201d and frequently updated with the day\u2019s latest struggles, says Sawant, who is sitting at a long table in her office Tuesday with a mason jar filled with apple cider (It\u2019s from PCC Community Markets, a local food cooperative whose workers, she happily reveals, are unionized). She\u2019s been up since well before 5am, juggling a day packed with media interviews and council meetings. But you wouldn\u2019t know it by the rapid-fire analysis she provides of her recent momentous win. She says that she hopes other candidates like her across the world take note of this major victory. \u201cThe fact that a socialist who has been an unapologetic fighter for ordinary people and who has doggedly used a movement-building approach and shown herself to be extremely effective and successful, that you can win three elections, that should be extremely empowering for our movements,\u201d said Sawant, who will now be starting her third term in office in January. Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle, contributed $1.5m into the local city council elections by way of a political action committee sponsored by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. The Civic Alliance for a Sound Economy backed her opponent, Orion, and six other candidates considered to be business-friendly. Only two of them ultimately won. Sawant, a Mumbai-educated economist and former tech worker, said the Amazon money certainly had a negative impact on her campaign, citing the many attack mailers and online attack ads that have circulated. But it also helped to further galvanize her grassroots support. Her campaign ultimately saw hundreds of volunteers who knocked on more than 200,000 doors, and over $500,000 in donations from hundreds of individual donors across the US. On election night, Sawant trailed Orion by 8%, but days later, after the remaining ballots were counted, she managed to take the lead. Washington state runs a vote-by-mail system, which means it can take days to achieve a final count. It wasn\u2019t until the following Tuesday that Orion conceded. In 2013, Sawant unseated the 16-year incumbent Richard Conlin, a Democrat, to become the first socialist on the Seattle council in nearly a century. Since then, she has helped to raise the city\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour and provide renters with more rights. From the beginning she has been a fierce critic of big business and its influence on Seattle. Last year, she drew national headlines through her push for the controversial head tax, a per-employee tax on large corporations. Amazon has about 45,000 workers in Seattle, so it would have potentially had to pay millions each year through the tax. The funds would have been used for housing for the homeless, but was repealed one month after passing unanimously. Now that she has been re-elected, Sawant says one key priority will be to push again for this type of tax. She says she believes it\u2019s possible as long as she builds up an even more powerful movement. Sawant has long been viewed as one of the area\u2019s more controversial politicians. One key complaint has been about her ability to collaborate and work with fellow council members in order to get policy enacted. As one editorial published last month in the Seattle Times put it, \u201cThe Socialist Alternative rabble rouser \u2013 or should I say champion of the common people \u2013 has shown herself not especially interested in comity and compromise.\u201d Sawant said she believes in being cordial and building unity with other elected officials, but ultimately her job is to represent the interests of the working people. \u201cWhen they say that, \u2018Oh we don\u2019t have a good working relationship,\u2019 what they are actually saying is that I am not accountable to them, I\u2019m accountable to the movement,\u201d said Sawant. \u201cBut that\u2019s not something I hide, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m planning to change and I\u2019m proud of that because that is the only winning strategy.\u201d In her upcoming term, two of her key priorities will be on pushing for a tax on big business, and rent control, something she has been advocating for since she was first elected. In September, she introduced a proposal that would limit rent increases to the rate of inflation. When she kicks off her new office term, she will now be the most senior member of the city council. But if anyone thinks that\u2019s going to have any impact on how she governs, you would be sorely mistaken. \u201cJust because I\u2019m technically senior, that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m now suddenly going to lead the establishment wing of the council,\u201d she says. \u201cI am still going to be 100% loyal to the movement that I am a part of and continue to use my office to build that struggle even more strongly that we already have.\u201d",

Yet this weekend, exactly 30 years after the Velvet Revolution began, ushering in the overthrow of the totalitarian system, Mal\u00fd \u2013 now Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of Prague \u2013 is exhorting a new generation to fight new threats to their hard won freedom.</p> <p>At a rally at the Czech capital\u2019s Letn\u00e1 field, the same site where he moderated a huge demonstration in November 1989 hailed as a pivotal moment in overthrowing communism, Mal\u00fd warned a crowd of more than 200,000 that the revolution\u2019s achievements were endangered by politicians who wanted to divide society, limit freedom of speech, and concentrate political and media power in a few hands.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s demonstration, organised by the Million Moments for Democracy student movement, was held to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the revolution but also draw attention to what critics contend is a dangerous drift away from its ideals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/nov/16/czechoslovakias-velvet-revolution-1989-in-pictures\">Czechoslovakia\u2019s Velvet Revolution, 1989 - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is the latest in a series of protests against the governing style of Andrej Babi\u0161, the country\u2019s billionaire tycoon prime minister, who has been accused of corruption and conflicts of interest, and the role of Milo\u0161 Zeman, the populist president who has promoted close ties with Russia and China. Speaking to the <em>Observer</em> in the Prague archdiocese headquarters, adjacent to the city\u2019s magnificent castle, Mal\u00fd said the pair failed to meet the standards of Havel, who became the first post-communist president of Czechoslovakia and later of the Czech Republic when it split from Slovakia in 1993.</p> <p>\u201cThey change their positions and they are in the hands of PR advisers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey give very simple promises that are very dangerous and they speak about enemies and divide society. It is the worst act of their governing.\u201d</p> <p>It was necessary to commemorate Havel\u2019s ideals \u2013 crystallised in his famous quote \u201ctruth and love will prevail over lies and hatred\u201d \u2013 which, Mal\u00fd argued, are as relevant today as in communist times. Tributes to the events of 1989 \u2013 when Czechoslovakia shook off four decades of communist rule after similar allied regimes had fallen in Poland, Hungary and East Germany \u2013 have been ubiquitous in recent days. Slovakia\u2019s president, Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, last week laid a wreath at a shrine in Prague\u2019s N\u00e1rodn\u00ed T\u0159\u00edda, where demonstrators were attacked by riot police 30 years ago in an episode that triggered mass street protests heralding the regime\u2019s downfall. Spectacular lighting displays, concerts and other events are planned for Sunday in the Czech capital and elsewhere.</p> <p>Central to it is Havel, the softly-spoken former dissident <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/18/vaclav-havel\" title=\"\">who died in 2011 </a>but remains an icon for many liberals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2ca15c783468935ab1f296f15ca1760210ee2a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2ca15c783468935ab1f296f15ca1760210ee2a9/0_131_3261_1957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"V\u00e1clav Havel waves to a crowd of thousands of demonstrators on 10 December 1989 in Prague\u2019s Wenceslas Square, celebrating the communist capitulation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">V\u00e1clav Havel waves to a crowd of thousands of demonstrators on 10 December 1989 in Prague\u2019s Wenceslas Square, celebrating the communist capitulation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lubomir Kotek/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid the adulation, however, another former Havel ally, Jan Urban, now a professor and political analyst at New York University in Prague, gave a more critical assessment, blaming him for indecisiveness, which bequeathed the Czech Republic unprincipled politicians and an unrepentant communist party that is still in parliament to this day, where it currently props up Babi\u0161\u2019s minority government.</p> <p>\u201cV\u00e1clav was superb to the outside world. He put Czechoslovakia back on the map,\u201d said Urban, co-founder of the post-communist Civic Forum movement.</p> <p>\u201cBut domestically he was a disaster. And I say that knowing he was a dear friend. He was a dreamer. He should never have gone into presidential politics and he never learned the rules of parliamentary politics.</p> <p>\u201cHavel\u2019s time stopped any chance of the fast delegitimisation of the communist party. These civil conflict situations always demand symbolic gestures because people want to believe that the new regime will do its utmost to give society a sense of justice. This was his biggest failing.</p> <p>\u201cI aways picture a simple comparison; the idea that members of [the Nazi party] would have sat in the West German Bundestag in 1975 is unthinkable. Why is a comparable situation normal here?\u201d</p> <p>Yet as vivid memories of life under communism resurfaced, Urban, 68, another Charter 77 signatory who was fired as a schoolteacher for refusing to sign official statements denouncing it, tempered his criticism of current developments. \u201cI never expected to see the end of communism,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to inflict as much damage as possible before they got me. So I cannot be disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>The desire to inflict damage \u2013 driven by anger over the loss of an unborn child after his wife miscarried following the trauma of a police interrogation \u2013 incurred huge personal strain.</p> <p>After representing Charter 77 at a human rights conference in Moscow in December 1987, Urban returned to find himself under intense surveillance. Meetings with fellow dissidents had to be restricted to a few minutes or even seconds and convened on bridges, to foil secret police intervention.</p> <p>In spring 1988, the StB, the communist security service, sent a coffin with his name on it to Urban\u2019s flat in Prague\u2019s Mala Strana district, today a favoured tourist haunt. Anonymous death threats arrived by letter and phone. Determined not to go to jail, he took to sleeping with running shoes beside his bed and a rope by his window to escape any dreaded pre-dawn knock on the door.</p> <p>Another personal drama arrived in August 1989, when a courier arrived with a letter ordering him to report for military training early next day. Fearing a trick, Urban persuaded a friend to hide him in a hospital emergency ward, under the pretext of a feigned heart attack.</p> <p>\u201cTwo secret police guys showed up and sat in the corridor, demanding that the doctor report everything to do with Mr Urban\u2019s health,\u2019 he said. \u201cIncredibly, there was another Mr Urban slowly dying in the room next door. After five days, hospital staff helped me escape at 5am and I went into hiding for the next 10 days.\u201d</p> <p>By the eve of revolution, Urban \u2013 who was helping to run an underground news agency \u2013 was on his last warning. A judge had told him that his next misdemeanour would result in an indictment for subversion which could spell 12 years in jail.When the communist party leadership resigned, a week after protests began, it was \u201cthe most joyful few hours of my life\u201d, Urban said.</p> <p>But there was a catch: \u201cI immediately realised we can do whatever we want \u2013 but we didn\u2019t know what we wanted. We were totally unprepared.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Times have changed dramatically since Monsignor V\u00e1clav Mal\u00fd endured interrogations, beatings and the indignities of being barred from the priesthood while being forced to clean toilets as the price of campaigning against Czechoslovakia\u2019s communist regime. As a signatory and then spokesman for Charter 77, a civic initiative demanding respect for human rights that was led by, among others, the dissident playwright V\u00e1clav Havel, the clergyman was on the frontline of opponents targeted by the hated secret police. Yet this weekend, exactly 30 years after the Velvet Revolution began, ushering in the overthrow of the totalitarian system, Mal\u00fd \u2013 now Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of Prague \u2013 is exhorting a new generation to fight new threats to their hard won freedom. At a rally at the Czech capital\u2019s Letn\u00e1 field, the same site where he moderated a huge demonstration in November 1989 hailed as a pivotal moment in overthrowing communism, Mal\u00fd warned a crowd of more than 200,000 that the revolution\u2019s achievements were endangered by politicians who wanted to divide society, limit freedom of speech, and concentrate political and media power in a few hands. Saturday\u2019s demonstration, organised by the Million Moments for Democracy student movement, was held to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the revolution but also draw attention to what critics contend is a dangerous drift away from its ideals. It is the latest in a series of protests against the governing style of Andrej Babi\u0161, the country\u2019s billionaire tycoon prime minister, who has been accused of corruption and conflicts of interest, and the role of Milo\u0161 Zeman, the populist president who has promoted close ties with Russia and China. Speaking to the Observer in the Prague archdiocese headquarters, adjacent to the city\u2019s magnificent castle, Mal\u00fd said the pair failed to meet the standards of Havel, who became the first post-communist president of Czechoslovakia and later of the Czech Republic when it split from Slovakia in 1993. \u201cThey change their positions and they are in the hands of PR advisers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey give very simple promises that are very dangerous and they speak about enemies and divide society. It is the worst act of their governing.\u201d It was necessary to commemorate Havel\u2019s ideals \u2013 crystallised in his famous quote \u201ctruth and love will prevail over lies and hatred\u201d \u2013 which, Mal\u00fd argued, are as relevant today as in communist times. Tributes to the events of 1989 \u2013 when Czechoslovakia shook off four decades of communist rule after similar allied regimes had fallen in Poland, Hungary and East Germany \u2013 have been ubiquitous in recent days. Slovakia\u2019s president, Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, last week laid a wreath at a shrine in Prague\u2019s N\u00e1rodn\u00ed T\u0159\u00edda, where demonstrators were attacked by riot police 30 years ago in an episode that triggered mass street protests heralding the regime\u2019s downfall. Spectacular lighting displays, concerts and other events are planned for Sunday in the Czech capital and elsewhere. Central to it is Havel, the softly-spoken former dissident who died in 2011 but remains an icon for many liberals. Amid the adulation, however, another former Havel ally, Jan Urban, now a professor and political analyst at New York University in Prague, gave a more critical assessment, blaming him for indecisiveness, which bequeathed the Czech Republic unprincipled politicians and an unrepentant communist party that is still in parliament to this day, where it currently props up Babi\u0161\u2019s minority government. \u201cV\u00e1clav was superb to the outside world. He put Czechoslovakia back on the map,\u201d said Urban, co-founder of the post-communist Civic Forum movement. \u201cBut domestically he was a disaster. And I say that knowing he was a dear friend. He was a dreamer. He should never have gone into presidential politics and he never learned the rules of parliamentary politics. \u201cHavel\u2019s time stopped any chance of the fast delegitimisation of the communist party. These civil conflict situations always demand symbolic gestures because people want to believe that the new regime will do its utmost to give society a sense of justice. This was his biggest failing. \u201cI aways picture a simple comparison; the idea that members of [the Nazi party] would have sat in the West German Bundestag in 1975 is unthinkable. Why is a comparable situation normal here?\u201d Yet as vivid memories of life under communism resurfaced, Urban, 68, another Charter 77 signatory who was fired as a schoolteacher for refusing to sign official statements denouncing it, tempered his criticism of current developments. \u201cI never expected to see the end of communism,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to inflict as much damage as possible before they got me. So I cannot be disappointed.\u201d The desire to inflict damage \u2013 driven by anger over the loss of an unborn child after his wife miscarried following the trauma of a police interrogation \u2013 incurred huge personal strain. After representing Charter 77 at a human rights conference in Moscow in December 1987, Urban returned to find himself under intense surveillance. Meetings with fellow dissidents had to be restricted to a few minutes or even seconds and convened on bridges, to foil secret police intervention. In spring 1988, the StB, the communist security service, sent a coffin with his name on it to Urban\u2019s flat in Prague\u2019s Mala Strana district, today a favoured tourist haunt. Anonymous death threats arrived by letter and phone. Determined not to go to jail, he took to sleeping with running shoes beside his bed and a rope by his window to escape any dreaded pre-dawn knock on the door. Another personal drama arrived in August 1989, when a courier arrived with a letter ordering him to report for military training early next day. Fearing a trick, Urban persuaded a friend to hide him in a hospital emergency ward, under the pretext of a feigned heart attack. \u201cTwo secret police guys showed up and sat in the corridor, demanding that the doctor report everything to do with Mr Urban\u2019s health,\u2019 he said. \u201cIncredibly, there was another Mr Urban slowly dying in the room next door. After five days, hospital staff helped me escape at 5am and I went into hiding for the next 10 days.\u201d By the eve of revolution, Urban \u2013 who was helping to run an underground news agency \u2013 was on his last warning. A judge had told him that his next misdemeanour would result in an indictment for subversion which could spell 12 years in jail.When the communist party leadership resigned, a week after protests began, it was \u201cthe most joyful few hours of my life\u201d, Urban said. But there was a catch: \u201cI immediately realised we can do whatever we want \u2013 but we didn\u2019t know what we wanted. We were totally unprepared.\u201d",

Increasing workloads, looming deadlines, departures of senior staff and the pressures around delivering Brexit are all being blamed for the spike.</p> <p>It appears to be the highest rate recorded for any industry since the Health and Safety Executive began collecting these statistics 20 years ago. About 3,230 cases of stress, depression and anxiety per 100,000 workers were recorded for the sector and related jobs, the highest rate of any sector in the UK and around 77% higher than the all-industry average.</p> <p>Unions blamed the figures on increasing workloads, years of pay restraint and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/civil-service-stressed-and-floundering-amid-brexit-paralysis\" title=\"\">added pressures created by Brexit</a> and political gridlock. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, said: \u201cNo other industry has experienced anything like this annual jump, and it is impossible to escape the conclusion that it is because of the sheer level of pressure being heaped on civil servants as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cNo government in peace time has ever been as reliant on its civil service, keeping the country running and preparing for Brexit, while parliament remains effectively deadlocked. Pay is still lagging behind the private sector, departmental cuts continue to bite, and senior politicians never seem to miss an opportunity to attack civil servants \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder they are feeling the strain.</p> <p>\u2018The government urgently needs to address this problem or it will soon discover that even our fantastic civil service has a breaking point.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The public sector pay cap has been key. People do not feel valued. Pay is going down and they are being asked to do more.</p> <footer> <cite>Former government employee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Emma Norris, research director of the Institute for Government thinktank, said she believed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/30/brexit-civil-servants-unfair-criticism-accusations-bias-whitehall\" title=\"\">uncertainty and difficulty of Brexit</a>, as well as a high turnover of senior staff, was having an impact. \u201cSome of this is the sheer workload that the civil service has been subjected to under Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that, as a result, some departments have already moved to shift work to try to reduce the hours some people are working \u2013 particularly where tight deadlines are involved.</p> <p>\u201cThe phrase we have heard is \u2018the fog of the fortnight ahead\u2019 \u2013 a constant sense that it is hard to see beyond two weeks or so, with a constant cycle of uncertainty. That can certainly be demoralising and stressful. High turnover is always a big problem in Whitehall. Naturally that is going to have consequences for staff morale.\u201d</p> <p>She said public bodies were taking action. The Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs recently made counsellors available for its staff, while others are holding lunchtime sessions on managing intensive workloads and wellbeing.</p> <p>One employee at a government body, who worked as a mental health champion after suffering depression, said he changed jobs to help him deal with his condition. Speaking anonymously, he said that, while mental health awareness was improving, growing workloads could be to blame for the growing number of cases. \u201cThe organisation is making the right noises, but there is a heck of a lot more to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cQuite a few public sector bodies sign up to mental health pledges as a box-ticking exercise, or to give them the kudos of trying to do something. The public-sector pay cap has been key. People do not feel valued. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/10/civil-servants-pay-stagnated-decade-real-rise\" title=\"\">Their pay packets are going down in real terms</a> and they are being asked to do more for less. When someone leaves, instead of that role being filled, people are being asked to take up that work.\u201d</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe Civil Service is taking steps to reduce the stigma around mental health. Supporting the mental health of civil servants is a key priority and a part of our ambition to be the UK\u2019s most inclusive employer by 2020.\u201d<br></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to add a quote from the cabinet office.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Rates of work-related stress, depression and anxiety among civil servants has risen drastically in the past year to the highest level for decades, amid warnings that Whitehall will reach \u201cbreaking point\u201d. The proportion of civil servants who say they are experiencing stress has increased by 45%, according to official data. Increasing workloads, looming deadlines, departures of senior staff and the pressures around delivering Brexit are all being blamed for the spike. It appears to be the highest rate recorded for any industry since the Health and Safety Executive began collecting these statistics 20 years ago. About 3,230 cases of stress, depression and anxiety per 100,000 workers were recorded for the sector and related jobs, the highest rate of any sector in the UK and around 77% higher than the all-industry average. Unions blamed the figures on increasing workloads, years of pay restraint and the added pressures created by Brexit and political gridlock. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, said: \u201cNo other industry has experienced anything like this annual jump, and it is impossible to escape the conclusion that it is because of the sheer level of pressure being heaped on civil servants as a result of Brexit. \u201cNo government in peace time has ever been as reliant on its civil service, keeping the country running and preparing for Brexit, while parliament remains effectively deadlocked. Pay is still lagging behind the private sector, departmental cuts continue to bite, and senior politicians never seem to miss an opportunity to attack civil servants \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder they are feeling the strain. \u2018The government urgently needs to address this problem or it will soon discover that even our fantastic civil service has a breaking point.\u201d Emma Norris, research director of the Institute for Government thinktank, said she believed the uncertainty and difficulty of Brexit, as well as a high turnover of senior staff, was having an impact. \u201cSome of this is the sheer workload that the civil service has been subjected to under Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that, as a result, some departments have already moved to shift work to try to reduce the hours some people are working \u2013 particularly where tight deadlines are involved. \u201cThe phrase we have heard is \u2018the fog of the fortnight ahead\u2019 \u2013 a constant sense that it is hard to see beyond two weeks or so, with a constant cycle of uncertainty. That can certainly be demoralising and stressful. High turnover is always a big problem in Whitehall. Naturally that is going to have consequences for staff morale.\u201d She said public bodies were taking action. The Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs recently made counsellors available for its staff, while others are holding lunchtime sessions on managing intensive workloads and wellbeing. One employee at a government body, who worked as a mental health champion after suffering depression, said he changed jobs to help him deal with his condition. Speaking anonymously, he said that, while mental health awareness was improving, growing workloads could be to blame for the growing number of cases. \u201cThe organisation is making the right noises, but there is a heck of a lot more to do,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite a few public sector bodies sign up to mental health pledges as a box-ticking exercise, or to give them the kudos of trying to do something. The public-sector pay cap has been key. People do not feel valued. Their pay packets are going down in real terms and they are being asked to do more for less. When someone leaves, instead of that role being filled, people are being asked to take up that work.\u201d A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe Civil Service is taking steps to reduce the stigma around mental health. Supporting the mental health of civil servants is a key priority and a part of our ambition to be the UK\u2019s most inclusive employer by 2020.\u201d This article was amended on 18 November 2019 to add a quote from the cabinet office.",

      "body": "<p>To coincide with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/17/david-bowie-is-exhibition-review\" title=\"\">retrospective at the V&amp;A in 2013, David Bowie</a> drew up a personal canon of 100 books. It was made up of the \u201cmost important and influential\u201d works for the musician, rather than his favourites: biographies of artists,</p> <p>20th-century fiction, books that touched on dadaism and surrealism, two histories of soul music\u2026 There were plenty of titles that suggested a curator who had come of age in the early 60s (<em>On the Road</em>, <em>Billy Liar</em>, Colin Wilson\u2019s <em>The Outsider</em>), though with the inclusion of every issue of <em>Viz</em>, <em>Private Eye </em>and the <em>Beano </em>alongside Dante and Homer, the list was democratic, and clearly intended to give pointers on how to live a good life as much as signal an iconoclastic education.</p> <p>In <strong>Bowie\u2019s Books</strong>, John O\u2019Connell investigates the list through 100 short essays, seeing it not as autobiography but more \u201ca look at the tools he used to navigate his life\u201d. Seemingly in no particular order, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/01/david-bowie-books-kerouac-milligan\" title=\"\">the list</a> provided literary and geographical snapshots of Bowie\u2019s life and, tellingly, worlds in which he was only ever on the fringes. A prime example is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/02/100-best-nonfiction-books-14-nik-cohn-awopbopaloobop-alopbamboom\" title=\"\">Nik Cohn\u2019s 1969 masterpiece, <em>Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom</em></a>, a celebration of the 60s pop scene that the teenage Bowie had so desperately wanted to be a part of. Cohn was a columnist for <em>Queen</em> magazine and gave pocket histories and quickfire appraisals of all rock\u2019s main players (he adores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/18/features.musicmonthly4\" title=\"\">Phil Spector</a>\u2019s \u201cbeautiful noise\u201d and finds Pink Floyd \u201cboring almost beyond belief\u201d). O\u2019Connell notes that Bowie not only would have \u201cread it the second it came out, but also studied it as a manual\u201d. Likewise, though he was based in Los Angeles and Berlin for most of the 70s, the singer was obsessed with New York, home of Warhol\u2019s Factory and long-term heroes the Velvet Underground. On his list was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/20/fran-lebowitz-you-do-not-know-anyone-as-stupid-as-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Fran Lebowitz</a>\u2019s <em>Metropolitan Life</em><em> </em>(1978), a collection of pieces for <em>Mademoiselle</em> and <em>Interview</em> that captures the insularity of New York\u2019s Studio 54 era. From a distance, Bowie adhered to Lebowitz\u2019s line that \u201cyou\u2019re only as good as your last haircut\u201d.</p> <p>O\u2019Connell is gently witty, and clearly enjoys riffing on Bowie\u2019s own playfulness \u2013 discussing Wyndham Lewis, he writes that he \u201cdropped his first name, Percy, as you would\u201d.

      "bodyText": "To coincide with his retrospective at the V&amp;A in 2013, David Bowie drew up a personal canon of 100 books. It was made up of the \u201cmost important and influential\u201d works for the musician, rather than his favourites: biographies of artists, 20th-century fiction, books that touched on dadaism and surrealism, two histories of soul music\u2026 There were plenty of titles that suggested a curator who had come of age in the early 60s (On the Road, Billy Liar, Colin Wilson\u2019s The Outsider), though with the inclusion of every issue of Viz, Private Eye and the Beano alongside Dante and Homer, the list was democratic, and clearly intended to give pointers on how to live a good life as much as signal an iconoclastic education. In Bowie\u2019s Books, John O\u2019Connell investigates the list through 100 short essays, seeing it not as autobiography but more \u201ca look at the tools he used to navigate his life\u201d. Seemingly in no particular order, the list provided literary and geographical snapshots of Bowie\u2019s life and, tellingly, worlds in which he was only ever on the fringes. A prime example is Nik Cohn\u2019s 1969 masterpiece, Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom, a celebration of the 60s pop scene that the teenage Bowie had so desperately wanted to be a part of. Cohn was a columnist for Queen magazine and gave pocket histories and quickfire appraisals of all rock\u2019s main players (he adores Phil Spector\u2019s \u201cbeautiful noise\u201d and finds Pink Floyd \u201cboring almost beyond belief\u201d). O\u2019Connell notes that Bowie not only would have \u201cread it the second it came out, but also studied it as a manual\u201d. Likewise, though he was based in Los Angeles and Berlin for most of the 70s, the singer was obsessed with New York, home of Warhol\u2019s Factory and long-term heroes the Velvet Underground. On his list was Fran Lebowitz\u2019s Metropolitan Life (1978), a collection of pieces for Mademoiselle and Interview that captures the insularity of New York\u2019s Studio 54 era. From a distance, Bowie adhered to Lebowitz\u2019s line that \u201cyou\u2019re only as good as your last haircut\u201d. O\u2019Connell is gently witty, and clearly enjoys riffing on Bowie\u2019s own playfulness \u2013 discussing Wyndham Lewis, he writes that he \u201cdropped his first name, Percy, as you would\u201d. A neat idea is O\u2019Connell\u2019s suggested listening, just one track per book, like a wine tasting: a biography of David Bomberg, an artist largely ignored in his lifetime who was rehabilitated almost as soon as he died, should be accompanied by Up the Hill Backwards from 1980\u2019s Scary Monsters; John Braine\u2019s furiously dated Room at the Top goes with Bowie\u2019s very 1967 confection Love You Till Tuesday; Evelyn Waugh\u2019s Vile Bodies is matched with the decadent, strung-out title track from Aladdin Sane. Bowie may have been a selfish artist, comfortable in borrowing other people\u2019s talents before swiftly discarding them (his early bands, Mick Ronson, Carlos Alomar), but he was always generous with the threads he left for his fans to pull on. Even in his earliest work there are allusions to an unlikely mixture of the writer Keith Waterhouse, The Quatermass Experiment, Tibetan Buddhism and actor Anthony Newley. What Bowie called his \u201cquesting, Orientalist side\u201d is explored in books by David Kidd and Bruce Chatwin. His mid-70s fascination with the occult, however, is ignored, possibly because books on the subject reminded him of a miserable period in his life or, O\u2019Connell suggests, because the books he read at the time were \u201cmostly dumb\u201d. Titles such as Dion Fortune\u2019s Psychic Self-Defence and Israel Regardie\u2019s The Golden Dawn \u2013 both of which Bowie is known to have read \u2013 were dropped from his literary list. Following Bowie was always an education, and Bowie\u2019s Books is a handy, amusing and, thankfully, light-touch precis, tracking the musician\u2019s high modernist influences while remaining aware of his flightiness and fondness for self-editing. \u201cI love Stephen King,\u201d he told Q magazine in 1999. \u201cHe scares the shite out of me.\u201d But you won\u2019t find King in this list. Will Brooker is both an obsessive Bowie fan and an academic. His own epiphany was the leaden, rather clumsy Let\u2019s Dance album track Ricochet, which he heard aged 13 in 1983. Why Bowie Matters (surely we already know? In 2019, it would be far harder to write a book called Why Elvis Matters?) is based on a year in Brooker\u2019s life in which he dressed like the star, dyed his hair orange and travelled to Bowie haunts in Europe and America while reading the singer\u2019s favourite books and listening to records he loved, such as the O\u2019Jays\u2019 Back Stabbers.

These products have elbowed their way into a small pen of winter traditions, the annual equivalent of flicking an elastic band on your wrist, a calming, a groundedness. The reassurance being, \u201cTime passes, but everything stays the same.\u201d</p> <p>And when winter has announced itself, I run my bath. I live in a house of regular bathers, for whom there is no ritual surrounding its execution or enjoyment. One housemate listens to podcasts while washing his armpits, a gravelly cynic asking old actors about their childhoods, another produces short performances of <em>Frozen</em> while fighting over shampoo.</p> <p>Me, I savour these rare exquisite evenings, when autumn has succumbed to mulch and the crisp winter air is not yet annoying. When we still step outside in the morning delighted at the prospect of snow, and when my only remaining guilty pleasure \u2013 a full house of central heating \u2013 is realised. I say things like, \u201cWe should make more soup,\u201d and \u201cI love you so I\u2019ve bought you fleece slippers,\u201d and so ease myself into these dark evenings with promises of comfort. Which includes the bath.</p> <p>All must be perfect. A clean dressing gown, a well-worn towel so as not to get fluff everywhere, nothing worse, a scalding temperature and locked door. I will permit a twist, such as lavender oil, or this vintage bath bomb, and I will ease myself in as if succumbing to anaesthetic, counting down from five. The bomb fizzes angrily by my thigh, quickly transitioning into a sort of perfumed cob roll, which I prod, disheartened. And it\u2019s at this point, in my annual winter bath, that I remember why I don\u2019t bathe more often. Four minutes of relaxation, of submersion in sweet heat and foaming glory, and the bath is cold. Five minutes and you realise there\u2019s no efficient way of washing your hair. Six, and you\u2019re lying naked in a tepid soup of gravelly soap wondering when your knees got old.</p> <p>The bath bomb refuses to detonate, bouncing morosely instead across the enamel, searching for someone that appreciates its smell, which now fills the room in a steam of lipgloss and plastic. The realisation falls on me like a loaded \u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>This is what winter is, not the cosy fireside chats nor crisp walks down snowy paths, but four months of discomfort, disappointment and sentiment failing to catch up with reality. It is chasing warmth down ever-darkening passages, it is frantic online purchases to placate children stuck inside due to rain. It is factory-made smells, designed to recreate weekends once glimpsed on TV, stuffed into candles as if ducks into turkeys. It is this bath, this dimly lit bath barely concealing my goose pimples and shame.</p> <p>So tomorrow I must erase these realisations from my mind, gorging on seasonal sandwiches and a coffee made of cream. Because the lie that winter is something to be welcomed, savoured and ritualised, is the most ingrained tradition we have.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

These products have elbowed their way into a small pen of winter traditions, the annual equivalent of flicking an elastic band on your wrist, a calming, a groundedness. The reassurance being, \u201cTime passes, but everything stays the same.\u201d And when winter has announced itself, I run my bath. I live in a house of regular bathers, for whom there is no ritual surrounding its execution or enjoyment. One housemate listens to podcasts while washing his armpits, a gravelly cynic asking old actors about their childhoods, another produces short performances of Frozen while fighting over shampoo. Me, I savour these rare exquisite evenings, when autumn has succumbed to mulch and the crisp winter air is not yet annoying. When we still step outside in the morning delighted at the prospect of snow, and when my only remaining guilty pleasure \u2013 a full house of central heating \u2013 is realised. I say things like, \u201cWe should make more soup,\u201d and \u201cI love you so I\u2019ve bought you fleece slippers,\u201d and so ease myself into these dark evenings with promises of comfort. Which includes the bath. All must be perfect. A clean dressing gown, a well-worn towel so as not to get fluff everywhere, nothing worse, a scalding temperature and locked door. I will permit a twist, such as lavender oil, or this vintage bath bomb, and I will ease myself in as if succumbing to anaesthetic, counting down from five. The bomb fizzes angrily by my thigh, quickly transitioning into a sort of perfumed cob roll, which I prod, disheartened. And it\u2019s at this point, in my annual winter bath, that I remember why I don\u2019t bathe more often. Four minutes of relaxation, of submersion in sweet heat and foaming glory, and the bath is cold. Five minutes and you realise there\u2019s no efficient way of washing your hair. Six, and you\u2019re lying naked in a tepid soup of gravelly soap wondering when your knees got old. The bath bomb refuses to detonate, bouncing morosely instead across the enamel, searching for someone that appreciates its smell, which now fills the room in a steam of lipgloss and plastic. The realisation falls on me like a loaded \u201cOh.\u201d This is what winter is, not the cosy fireside chats nor crisp walks down snowy paths, but four months of discomfort, disappointment and sentiment failing to catch up with reality. It is chasing warmth down ever-darkening passages, it is frantic online purchases to placate children stuck inside due to rain. It is factory-made smells, designed to recreate weekends once glimpsed on TV, stuffed into candles as if ducks into turkeys. It is this bath, this dimly lit bath barely concealing my goose pimples and shame. So tomorrow I must erase these realisations from my mind, gorging on seasonal sandwiches and a coffee made of cream. Because the lie that winter is something to be welcomed, savoured and ritualised, is the most ingrained tradition we have. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman",

      "body": "<p>Xanthe Couture, a Canadian living in the UK with her British husband, applied in March for indefinite leave to remain. The Home Office website said she would have to wait six months for a decision, but that if she paid an \u00a3800 super-priority premium on top of its \u00a32,389 fee, she would hear back within one working day of submitting her biometric details.</p> <p>Couture needed her residency permit swiftly to travel abroad for work, so she paid up. Five months passed before she heard her application had been successful. \u201cThe delay has meant I missed a summit I was a lead in organising and another important overseas meeting,\u201d she says. \u201cThe uncertainty, the high costs and the lack of information from the Home Office have affected my mental health and my ability to do my job.\u201d</p> <p>Couture is one of a dozen readers who contacted the <em>Observer</em> after being left in limbo by Home Office delays, despite paying a small fortune for the heavily promoted super-priority service. The government outsourced its visa processing service to a French firm, Sopra Steria, last year and critics have accused the new system of letting down migrants with substandard service, despite fee increases introduced by the Home Office. Another company, VFS Global, was contracted to handle visa applications abroad and has also been criticised for alleged service failures.</p> <p>Until last year, applicants in the UK could submit their ID and biometric data via their local post office, while those abroad could apply through a British embassy or consulate. Now overseas applicants are directed to hubs operated by Dubai-based VFS and those in the UK have to travel to one of six core centres, which offer a free service, or pay a minimum fee of \u00a360 for an appointment at 51 others.</p> <p>A shortage of free appointments has meant some have had to travel long distances or pay three-figure sums to complete their applications on time. Those without internet access are forced to book an appointment on a premium-rate phone line that costs \u00a32.50 a minute, while an emailed query is charged at \u00a35.48. Strict deadlines for submitting documents and data mean visa requests risk being rejected before applicants can secure an appointment, leaving them at risk of deportation unless they shell out for the premium service.</p> <p>In June, Pakistani refugee Abdul Farooq was forced to beg contributions from friends to apply for the right to remain because there were no free appointments available within the six-week deadline. The only option was 200 miles away from his Manchester home and cost \u00a3780.</p> <p>Those who pay the price for the fast-track option may be wasting their money. The Home Office says the 24-hour turnaround can\u2019t be guaranteed if extra checks are required, but applicants have no way of predicting if those will be needed and report being left in the dark about their nature.</p> <p>Only after querying the delay in a subject access request was Couture informed, two months later, that additional unspecified information was being sought. She says the requirements are so opaque that applicants have to employ a legal adviser if they want to be certain their application is comprehensive. \u201cI have applied for several visas since 2011 and the situation is now really at breaking point, getting ever more expensive, unclear and essentially impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cThe system seems to have been developed by people who don\u2019t ever have to use government services for very serious life events that can alter the course of their lives.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014 the government announced plans to make the immigration system self-funding by 2020 through increased visa fees and a range of optional premium services. Since then the basic cost of applying for a settlement visa has increased 72% to \u00a31,523. Now 6% of applicants pay up to \u00a3800 on top of that to avoid a six-month wait. Meanwhile, 21% of applicants from outside the UK paid the extra for premium services in 2017-18, according to Home Office figures, increasing the surplus from visa applications ninefold since the system was outsourced in 2014.</p> <p>The government\u2019s chief inspector of borders, David Bolt, accused it of devolving immigration services \u201con the cheap\u201d without adequate oversight, while legal groups claim service levels have deteriorated as costs have increased. \u201cWe are concerned that these services may exploit vulnerable and less well-informed migrants, who may feel pressured to purchase an expensive service which will not provide them with any benefit, and we have been concerned about the poor level of service being provided by UK Visa and Immigration [UKVI] subcontractors for some time,\u201d says Nicole Francis, chief executive of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of transparency in the contractual arrangements between UKVI and the subcontractors were of particular concern. We have been worried the contract between UKVI and the subcontractors may have resulted in UKVI benefiting financially from the subcontractors selling additional services to customers.\u201d</p> <p>Applicants who felt pressured to pay the priority fee reported lost work, missed holidays and escalating costs as they awaited the decision on their status. Xiaoting Hou paid \u00a33,208 for her visa application, including the \u00a3800 super-priority fee. \u201cMy job requires me to do a lot of international travel so I needed it quickly,\u201d says the Chinese national who has lived in the UK for five years with her British husband. \u201cThe Home Office website states that I would be informed of any delays within a working day. In reality when you query progress with their contact centre, they require five working days to respond. After five working days, they simply say they can\u2019t process the application on priority service standards, nor can they let you know which stage your application is at.\u201d</p> <p>It took three weeks for Hou to be informed that her application was successful. \u201cIt caused us a lot of sleepless nights,\u201d she says. \u201cMy case should have been straightforward so I can only assume that the delay was because case workers are overworked and did not have capacity to carry out the super-priority service, although they won\u2019t admit that.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor Maloney, a US national married to a Briton, was unable to take up a job offer because of months-long delays to her visa application, despite paying the \u00a3800 for a next-day decision. It eventually arrived 103 days later after the <em>Observer</em> took up her case. The Home Office blamed an \u201cadministrative error\u201d.</p> <p>Shailja Anand*, an Indian national with a British husband, waited six months for her spouse visa to be extended, despite paying for the priority service plus an extra \u00a3100 for an appointment at a processing centre in Croydon to avoid a two-week wait for a free one. \u201cI needed my visa as quickly as possible for work and to sponsor my family who were coming over,\u201d she says. \u201cI received the decision granting me further leave to remain within 24 hours by email and was told my biometric residency permit should reach me within 10 working days.\u201d The permit didn\u2019t arrive and Anand eventually discovered her biometrics had not been processed correctly. She was told to make the long journey back to Croydon for another appointment and received her visa too late for her family\u2019s visit.</p> <p>MPs have called for an independent review into the privatised visa system. The Home Office denies that there is a problem and says it regularly reviews the availability of free appointments for applicants. \u201cWe are committed to providing a world-class service to people using our visa systems,\u201d it says. \u201cOur [web] page makes clear that the super-priority service can take longer if we require additional information. We work closely with our partners to provide excellent customer service and the vast majority of applications are processed in line with service standards.\u201d Hou, Anand and Maloney have since received refunds of their super-premium fee.</p> <p>Sopra Steria did not respond to specific questions about lack of free appointments and the promotion of add-on services. \u201cApplicants can select a free or paid appointment to submit their biometric data, depending on availability. A paid appointment can cost anywhere from \u00a365 at a core or enhanced service point, to a maximum of \u00a3260 for an appointment at a premium lounge,\u201d it said. \u201cThe super-priority service offers a decision within one working day of an applicant submitting their biometric data via an appointment at a centre.\u201d VFS Global also omitted to respond to specific questions about its charges, profits and performance. It said: \u201cThe super-priority visa and priority visa services are optional services offered by UK Visas and Immigration.\u201d</p> <p><em>* This name has been changed</em></p>",

In June, Pakistani refugee Abdul Farooq was forced to beg contributions from friends to apply for the right to remain because there were no free appointments available within the six-week deadline. The only option was 200 miles away from his Manchester home and cost \u00a3780. Those who pay the price for the fast-track option may be wasting their money. The Home Office says the 24-hour turnaround can\u2019t be guaranteed if extra checks are required, but applicants have no way of predicting if those will be needed and report being left in the dark about their nature. Only after querying the delay in a subject access request was Couture informed, two months later, that additional unspecified information was being sought. She says the requirements are so opaque that applicants have to employ a legal adviser if they want to be certain their application is comprehensive. \u201cI have applied for several visas since 2011 and the situation is now really at breaking point, getting ever more expensive, unclear and essentially impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cThe system seems to have been developed by people who don\u2019t ever have to use government services for very serious life events that can alter the course of their lives.\u201d In 2014 the government announced plans to make the immigration system self-funding by 2020 through increased visa fees and a range of optional premium services. Since then the basic cost of applying for a settlement visa has increased 72% to \u00a31,523. Now 6% of applicants pay up to \u00a3800 on top of that to avoid a six-month wait. Meanwhile, 21% of applicants from outside the UK paid the extra for premium services in 2017-18, according to Home Office figures, increasing the surplus from visa applications ninefold since the system was outsourced in 2014. The government\u2019s chief inspector of borders, David Bolt, accused it of devolving immigration services \u201con the cheap\u201d without adequate oversight, while legal groups claim service levels have deteriorated as costs have increased. \u201cWe are concerned that these services may exploit vulnerable and less well-informed migrants, who may feel pressured to purchase an expensive service which will not provide them with any benefit, and we have been concerned about the poor level of service being provided by UK Visa and Immigration [UKVI] subcontractors for some time,\u201d says Nicole Francis, chief executive of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association. \u201cThe lack of transparency in the contractual arrangements between UKVI and the subcontractors were of particular concern. We have been worried the contract between UKVI and the subcontractors may have resulted in UKVI benefiting financially from the subcontractors selling additional services to customers.\u201d Applicants who felt pressured to pay the priority fee reported lost work, missed holidays and escalating costs as they awaited the decision on their status. Xiaoting Hou paid \u00a33,208 for her visa application, including the \u00a3800 super-priority fee. \u201cMy job requires me to do a lot of international travel so I needed it quickly,\u201d says the Chinese national who has lived in the UK for five years with her British husband. \u201cThe Home Office website states that I would be informed of any delays within a working day. In reality when you query progress with their contact centre, they require five working days to respond. After five working days, they simply say they can\u2019t process the application on priority service standards, nor can they let you know which stage your application is at.\u201d It took three weeks for Hou to be informed that her application was successful. \u201cIt caused us a lot of sleepless nights,\u201d she says. \u201cMy case should have been straightforward so I can only assume that the delay was because case workers are overworked and did not have capacity to carry out the super-priority service, although they won\u2019t admit that.\u201d Taylor Maloney, a US national married to a Briton, was unable to take up a job offer because of months-long delays to her visa application, despite paying the \u00a3800 for a next-day decision. It eventually arrived 103 days later after the Observer took up her case. The Home Office blamed an \u201cadministrative error\u201d. Shailja Anand*, an Indian national with a British husband, waited six months for her spouse visa to be extended, despite paying for the priority service plus an extra \u00a3100 for an appointment at a processing centre in Croydon to avoid a two-week wait for a free one. \u201cI needed my visa as quickly as possible for work and to sponsor my family who were coming over,\u201d she says. \u201cI received the decision granting me further leave to remain within 24 hours by email and was told my biometric residency permit should reach me within 10 working days.\u201d The permit didn\u2019t arrive and Anand eventually discovered her biometrics had not been processed correctly. She was told to make the long journey back to Croydon for another appointment and received her visa too late for her family\u2019s visit. MPs have called for an independent review into the privatised visa system. The Home Office denies that there is a problem and says it regularly reviews the availability of free appointments for applicants. \u201cWe are committed to providing a world-class service to people using our visa systems,\u201d it says. \u201cOur [web] page makes clear that the super-priority service can take longer if we require additional information. We work closely with our partners to provide excellent customer service and the vast majority of applications are processed in line with service standards.\u201d Hou, Anand and Maloney have since received refunds of their super-premium fee. Sopra Steria did not respond to specific questions about lack of free appointments and the promotion of add-on services. \u201cApplicants can select a free or paid appointment to submit their biometric data, depending on availability. A paid appointment can cost anywhere from \u00a365 at a core or enhanced service point, to a maximum of \u00a3260 for an appointment at a premium lounge,\u201d it said. \u201cThe super-priority service offers a decision within one working day of an applicant submitting their biometric data via an appointment at a centre.\u201d VFS Global also omitted to respond to specific questions about its charges, profits and performance. It said: \u201cThe super-priority visa and priority visa services are optional services offered by UK Visas and Immigration.\u201d * This name has been changed",

      "bodyText": "There is a single, powerful moment in Manuel Oliver\u2019s stage show that captures the purpose of a work he never wanted to write. An alarm clock rings, signalling that 15 minutes have passed since the last life was lost to gun violence in America, and that another person is about to die. He hurls the clock across the set and it explodes into a mass of springs and metal, filling the theatre with a haunting silence. Oliver\u2019s anger is directed as much at the grim statistic that 100 people die every day in the US from gunshot wounds as at the death of his own teenage son, Joaquin, in the Parkland high school shooting massacre of 2018. Turning the loss of his best friend, the 17-year-old he calls Guac, into a compelling one-man stage performance, has been difficult and emotionally draining, Oliver says. But it\u2019s something he insists Joaquin would have wanted him to do. It is his way of raising awareness of gun violence issues and building on the \u201cart activism\u201d he and his wife, Patricia, have conducted through painting murals and their not-for-profit advocacy group Change the Ref, since 17 students and staff were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. \u201cThis play is not for people to feel bad for me or Patricia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about feeling sad for themselves or their kids because they could end up being who we are. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when we finish this interview we\u2019re going to be able to speak again tomorrow. So we thought, \u2018How do we get closer to people, how do we use our skills to have an intimate conversation with people instead of having to beg for their attention, or be more effective with the attention they give us?\u2019 \u201cIt brings me to the idea that everybody should listen, anybody who is part of this social gun culture atmosphere that has been happening for years. My whole life I was training for something I had no idea what it would be. I think it\u2019s this play.\u201d Oliver will perform Guac: My Son, My Hero, on Friday night at the 92nd Street Y in New York City, the first date of a Live Nation-sponsored national tour that will run through 2020, often in cities blighted by gun violence or which have suffered their own mass shootings, among them Orlando, Chicago, New Orleans and Houston. In \u201can immersive emotional experience that inspires audiences to take a stand on gun violence\u201d, Oliver uses live painting, audio and visual presentations and monologue to tell the story of Joaquin\u2019s upbringing and his family\u2019s lives in their picture-perfect south Florida community, before and after the shooting. Its most impactful scene is unquestionably the one in which Oliver, wearing a mask of Joaquin\u2019s face, re-enacts the Parkland shooting through the eyes of his son. He conveys the same chilling terror experienced by students at Saugus high school in Santa Clarita, California, as recently as last Thursday.

      "body": "<p>Disney\u2019s eagerly anticipated entry into the streaming wars last week proved that the days of Netflix\u2019s virtual global monopoly are well and truly over. Backed by a stellar library of content, from the Marvel and Pixar films to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/23/the-mandalorian-disney-unveils-trailer-for-star-wars-tv-series\" title=\"\">the $100m live-action Star Wars series <em>The Mandalorian</em></a>, Disney+ attracted 10 million customers on day one.</p> <p>A technical glitch that temporarily crashed the service failed to dissuade fans in its launch markets, the US and the Netherlands, although sign-up numbers were swollen by Disney+ being offered free to customers of Verizon mobile for a year.</p> <p>Investors have been jubilant \u2013 Disney\u2019s share price rose more than 7% on news of the launch-day take-up. The sense is that Netflix and, to a lesser extent, Amazon are facing a third superpower. The Disney service, which at $6.99 a month in the US is about half the price of Netflix\u2019s most popular package, is well on the way to its target of between 60 million and 90 million subscribers globally by 2024.</p> <p>Disney+ will arrive in Australia and New Zealand next week and in the UK on 31 March, as part of a western Europe launch. A roll-out in Asia Pacific will also begin next year, with Latin America in 2021.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would take an average viewer four to five years to watch the new TV shows in production by major streaming services</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The cracks may finally start to show at Netflix, which has once again upped its annual budget, to $15bn, as the inexorable need for ever-more-expensive content to win subscribers takes its toll. Netflix has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/01/is-this-the-end-of-netflixs-golden-age\" title=\"\">more than $30bn in debt and long-term liabilities relating to the making and licensing of programmes</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the need to increase its war chest saw Netflix push through the biggest price rises, up to 18%, in the company\u2019s history. This, in the second quarter, led to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/17/netflix-shares-fall-misses-growth-targets\" title=\"\">first-ever loss of subscribers in the US</a>. Netflix is forecasting that in 2019 it will not have added as many new subscribers as it did last year, which is the first time it has failed to report year-on-year growth since its streaming service launched in 2007.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/01/apple-appletv-hopes-its-new-streaming-service-will-make-a-splash\" title=\"\">global launch of Apple TV+ on 1 November</a>, priced at just $4.99 a month or free for 12 months to the 200 million people who buy a new Apple iPhone each year, and more new rivals on the way, costs continue to soar.</p> <p>Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s content chief, recently admitted that the cost of winning a bid for the most \u201celite\u201d of shows has risen by 30% in the past year because of competition from new entrants.</p> <p>Apple was willing to pay an eye-watering $240m for two series of <em>The Morning Show</em>, its flagship drama starring Reece Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Netflix has lost both <em>Friends</em> and the US version of <em>The Office</em> in $500m deals to HBO Max and Peacock, the streaming services from US giants WarnerMedia and NBC Universal respectively. These two are set to further crowd the global market when they launch next year. HBO Max also snapped up <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, the most popular scripted show on US television, though Netflix struck back by securing <em>Seinfeld</em>.</p> <p>Netflix remains the market leader by some distance, with 158 million global subscribers (about 11 million of them in the UK), but the era of peak streaming and consumer \u201csubscription fatigue\u201d seems to be approaching rapidly.</p> <p>In 2007, the year Netflix switched from DVD-by-post rental to embark on its streaming future, the total amount TV companies spent on content globally was $90bn. Spending this year will reach almost $170bn, according to Ampere Analysis.</p> <p>There are estimated to be almost 800 new scripted TV series in production by the main international streaming services, such as Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Apple, most of which will land over the next 12 months. It would take an average viewer four to five years to watch just these new shows, never mind older fare and unscripted content such as reality and talent shows and documentaries.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would call it a bubble but if the current growth in spending on content is sustained it will rapidly become unmanageable,\u201d says Richard Broughton, analyst at Ampere. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be enough room in the market for all the big streaming services to survive in their current forms.\u201d</p> <h2>One cheer for the EU investment bank\u2019s move out of fossil fuels</h2> <p>The long-awaited decision by the European Investment Bank (EIB) to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/15/european-investment-bank-to-phase-out-fossil-fuels-financing\" title=\"\">end fossil-fuel financing</a> \u2013 and Europe\u2019s multibillion-euro hypocrisy \u2013 within the next two years was long overdue.</p> <p>For decades the world\u2019s biggest public bank has been funnelling millions of euros every day into oil, coal and gas projects, while the EU governments that own it claimed to be taking a global lead in tackling the climate crisis.</p> <p>The landmark global climate agreement struck in Paris in 2016 did little to slow the flood of funding to fossil-fuel funds. A little over a year after the Paris agreement, the Luxembourg-based bank made Europe\u2019s biggest-ever loan \u2013 for a controversial gas pipeline. It was a cool \u20ac1.5bn deal to support the Trans-Adriatic pipeline from the Caspian Sea to western Europe, which would lock countries into decades of dependence on natural gas.</p> <p>Previous loans helped Italian oil major Eni to set up offshore gas rigs, and Polish utility PGE to build new gas-fired power plants.</p> <p>The decision to end fossil fuel financing by 2021 makes the EIB the first major lender to take a step which is as bold as the political rhetoric on carbon emissions. It will help the EU to end its contribution to global heating, and establish the world\u2019s first major \u201cclimate bank\u201d, aligned with the green agenda.</p> <p>However, it may still be too soon to claim that Europe\u2019s climate hypocrisy is over. The decision to clean up the \u20ac500bn EIB was not universally accepted across the bloc, and the debate has revealed fault lines in Europe\u2019s commitment to the Paris climate goals. Germany and the European commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive arm \u2013 were identified by campaigners as blocks in the negotiations over the EIB\u2019s new lending policy, despite being vocal supporters of the Paris accord.</p> <p>In the battle against a climate crisis, the time for talk has long passed. At least now Europe is finally beginning to put its money where climate action requires it to be.</p> <h2>Nationalising broadband will be a tricky call</h2> <p>There is a growing appetite for the natural monopolies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/29/short-history-of-privatisation\" title=\"\">privatised by Margaret Thatcher and John Major</a> to be taken into public ownership. And quite rightly so. Not because the targets for nationalisation are on the brink of insolvency as they so often were in the 1960s and 1970s. Or that they are starved of investment. They are not. On most financial measures they are ticking along just fine.</p> <p>The appetite stems from the behaviour of the owners of Britain\u2019s water and energy companies and railways. One by one, these industries have been loaded with debt as a means of furnishing shareholders and creditors with lavish payouts.</p> <p>That debt is refinanced on a regular basis to take advantage of increasingly low interest rates \u2013 again, not to prevent sewage entering our rivers or allow new electricity connections to solar farms or lower prices on the railways, but to feather investors\u2019 beds.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s plans to bring the UK\u2019s broadband network</a> into the ambit of natural monopolies poses a more difficult problem. The network needs investment in fibre-optic cables and sophisticated software at local exchanges.

Likewise, city mayors promoting their areas could be given unwarranted priority. Most importantly, it is not an area the public sector has ever managed. Why would civil servants make good decisions about broadband networks?</p> <p>If Labour can show it has thought about these issues and others \u2013 such as how its new network would build on existing ones and why it should be free to households \u2013 there could be much merit in a nationalised broadband network.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Disney\u2019s eagerly anticipated entry into the streaming wars last week proved that the days of Netflix\u2019s virtual global monopoly are well and truly over. Backed by a stellar library of content, from the Marvel and Pixar films to the $100m live-action Star Wars series The Mandalorian, Disney+ attracted 10 million customers on day one. A technical glitch that temporarily crashed the service failed to dissuade fans in its launch markets, the US and the Netherlands, although sign-up numbers were swollen by Disney+ being offered free to customers of Verizon mobile for a year. Investors have been jubilant \u2013 Disney\u2019s share price rose more than 7% on news of the launch-day take-up. The sense is that Netflix and, to a lesser extent, Amazon are facing a third superpower. The Disney service, which at $6.99 a month in the US is about half the price of Netflix\u2019s most popular package, is well on the way to its target of between 60 million and 90 million subscribers globally by 2024. Disney+ will arrive in Australia and New Zealand next week and in the UK on 31 March, as part of a western Europe launch. A roll-out in Asia Pacific will also begin next year, with Latin America in 2021. The cracks may finally start to show at Netflix, which has once again upped its annual budget, to $15bn, as the inexorable need for ever-more-expensive content to win subscribers takes its toll. Netflix has more than $30bn in debt and long-term liabilities relating to the making and licensing of programmes. Earlier this year, the need to increase its war chest saw Netflix push through the biggest price rises, up to 18%, in the company\u2019s history. This, in the second quarter, led to its first-ever loss of subscribers in the US. Netflix is forecasting that in 2019 it will not have added as many new subscribers as it did last year, which is the first time it has failed to report year-on-year growth since its streaming service launched in 2007. With the global launch of Apple TV+ on 1 November, priced at just $4.99 a month or free for 12 months to the 200 million people who buy a new Apple iPhone each year, and more new rivals on the way, costs continue to soar. Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s content chief, recently admitted that the cost of winning a bid for the most \u201celite\u201d of shows has risen by 30% in the past year because of competition from new entrants. Apple was willing to pay an eye-watering $240m for two series of The Morning Show, its flagship drama starring Reece Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Netflix has lost both Friends and the US version of The Office in $500m deals to HBO Max and Peacock, the streaming services from US giants WarnerMedia and NBC Universal respectively. These two are set to further crowd the global market when they launch next year. HBO Max also snapped up The Big Bang Theory, the most popular scripted show on US television, though Netflix struck back by securing Seinfeld. Netflix remains the market leader by some distance, with 158 million global subscribers (about 11 million of them in the UK), but the era of peak streaming and consumer \u201csubscription fatigue\u201d seems to be approaching rapidly. In 2007, the year Netflix switched from DVD-by-post rental to embark on its streaming future, the total amount TV companies spent on content globally was $90bn. Spending this year will reach almost $170bn, according to Ampere Analysis. There are estimated to be almost 800 new scripted TV series in production by the main international streaming services, such as Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Apple, most of which will land over the next 12 months. It would take an average viewer four to five years to watch just these new shows, never mind older fare and unscripted content such as reality and talent shows and documentaries. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would call it a bubble but if the current growth in spending on content is sustained it will rapidly become unmanageable,\u201d says Richard Broughton, analyst at Ampere. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be enough room in the market for all the big streaming services to survive in their current forms.\u201d One cheer for the EU investment bank\u2019s move out of fossil fuels The long-awaited decision by the European Investment Bank (EIB) to end fossil-fuel financing \u2013 and Europe\u2019s multibillion-euro hypocrisy \u2013 within the next two years was long overdue. For decades the world\u2019s biggest public bank has been funnelling millions of euros every day into oil, coal and gas projects, while the EU governments that own it claimed to be taking a global lead in tackling the climate crisis. The landmark global climate agreement struck in Paris in 2016 did little to slow the flood of funding to fossil-fuel funds. A little over a year after the Paris agreement, the Luxembourg-based bank made Europe\u2019s biggest-ever loan \u2013 for a controversial gas pipeline. It was a cool \u20ac1.5bn deal to support the Trans-Adriatic pipeline from the Caspian Sea to western Europe, which would lock countries into decades of dependence on natural gas. Previous loans helped Italian oil major Eni to set up offshore gas rigs, and Polish utility PGE to build new gas-fired power plants. The decision to end fossil fuel financing by 2021 makes the EIB the first major lender to take a step which is as bold as the political rhetoric on carbon emissions. It will help the EU to end its contribution to global heating, and establish the world\u2019s first major \u201cclimate bank\u201d, aligned with the green agenda. However, it may still be too soon to claim that Europe\u2019s climate hypocrisy is over. The decision to clean up the \u20ac500bn EIB was not universally accepted across the bloc, and the debate has revealed fault lines in Europe\u2019s commitment to the Paris climate goals. Germany and the European commission \u2013 the EU\u2019s executive arm \u2013 were identified by campaigners as blocks in the negotiations over the EIB\u2019s new lending policy, despite being vocal supporters of the Paris accord. In the battle against a climate crisis, the time for talk has long passed. At least now Europe is finally beginning to put its money where climate action requires it to be. Nationalising broadband will be a tricky call There is a growing appetite for the natural monopolies privatised by Margaret Thatcher and John Major to be taken into public ownership. And quite rightly so. Not because the targets for nationalisation are on the brink of insolvency as they so often were in the 1960s and 1970s. Or that they are starved of investment. They are not. On most financial measures they are ticking along just fine. The appetite stems from the behaviour of the owners of Britain\u2019s water and energy companies and railways. One by one, these industries have been loaded with debt as a means of furnishing shareholders and creditors with lavish payouts. That debt is refinanced on a regular basis to take advantage of increasingly low interest rates \u2013 again, not to prevent sewage entering our rivers or allow new electricity connections to solar farms or lower prices on the railways, but to feather investors\u2019 beds. Labour\u2019s plans to bring the UK\u2019s broadband network into the ambit of natural monopolies poses a more difficult problem. The network needs investment in fibre-optic cables and sophisticated software at local exchanges. By Labour\u2019s calculation, this is a \u00a320bn project. There is the potential for the broadband project to become a political football, with unions exercising their newfound muscle to extract higher pay and benefits. Likewise, city mayors promoting their areas could be given unwarranted priority. Most importantly, it is not an area the public sector has ever managed. Why would civil servants make good decisions about broadband networks? If Labour can show it has thought about these issues and others \u2013 such as how its new network would build on existing ones and why it should be free to households \u2013 there could be much merit in a nationalised broadband network.",

      "body": "<p>No matter how many times we were told, we wouldn\u2019t let it go. And so <em>Frozen </em>is back. Not that the earworm of the century was going to die anyway, with the official <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU%0Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU%0D%0D%0D\" title=\"\">YouTube video of Let It Go</a> at 1.8 billion views and counting, six years on from the original film.</p> <p>This week sees the opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwzLiQZDw2I\" title=\"\"><em>Frozen II</em></a>, a launch long awaited by seven-year-olds who want to be ice-pick-wielding princesses and long dreaded by parents who have only just about got over the psychological scars caused by the soundtrack of the first film: \u201cI mean it\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWe finish each other\u2019s sandwiches...\u201d How those words linger in what is left of my mind.</p> <p>The original 2013 movie took more than $1bn at the box office and more than that in merchandising, became Amazon\u2019s bestselling children\u2019s film DVD of all time, solely based on pre-orders, and pushed Elsa, the name of the ice princess who can\u2019t control her powers, into the <a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/parenting/news/a33943/game-of-thrones-frozen-baby-names/\" title=\"\">top 100 names for British babies</a>. At the height of <em>Frozen</em>\u2019s success, the waiting time to see Elsa at Disney World, Florida, was four hours. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/serena-williams-has-seen-frozen-3000-times-2019-1?r=US&amp;IR=T%0Dhttps://www.businessinsider.com/serena-williams-has-seen-frozen-3000-times-2019-1?r=US&amp;IR=T%0D%0D%0D\" title=\"\">Serena Williams once claimed</a> to have watched the film 3,000 times.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I can quite beat that but sometimes it felt like it. Our family was gripped by <em>Frozen</em> mania long before the term \u201cbasic\u201d fell into common usage. At the time, in 2013, our children were aged three, seven and 10, so we were essentially a <em>Frozen</em> marketing focus group. At first, <em>Frozen</em> was comforting and bonding, even slightly profound in its Oprah-esque message of self-belief and resilience. Then the soundtrack drove you slowly but surely to the boundary of sanity. Still, the children\u2019s passion for it grew. The three-year-old loved Olaf, the snowman who never wanted summer to come because then he would melt. The seven-year-old could imagine she was a princess who could shoot ice from her fingers. And the 10-year-old got to pretend his interest in it all was purely ironic. The parents, by now bludgeoned into dumb submission by the repetition of frozen fractals spiralling all around (Let It Go, bridge), simply appreciated any DVD or CD that the three tyrants would not argue over.</p> <p>For months, car trips were dominated by trolls singing about suitors tinkling in the woods and debates about whether reindeers smell better than people (seems unlikely but depends on the person \u2013 and the reindeer). I must confess to tragically earnest attempts by a peri-menopausal woman with karaoke ambitions (that would be me) to mimic the vocal gymnastics of Tony award-winner Idina Menzel as Elsa. I tried for months to hit the high E flat on \u201cLet the storm rage ooooon\u2026\u201d, a note held for so long that the driver of the car (my husband) once threatened to crash intentionally. As <a href=\"https://mollysmusic.org/blog/hard-songs-to-sing-let-it-go-from-disneys-frozen/\" title=\"\">voice coach Molly Webb</a> puts it: \u201cYou don\u2019t meet many singers who find sustaining a belt on an Eb5 a manageable request.\u201d But not many singers are Menzel. If she could do it, I could do it on the A303.

      "bodyText": "No matter how many times we were told, we wouldn\u2019t let it go. And so Frozen is back. Not that the earworm of the century was going to die anyway, with the official YouTube video of Let It Go at 1.8 billion views and counting, six years on from the original film. This week sees the opening of Frozen II, a launch long awaited by seven-year-olds who want to be ice-pick-wielding princesses and long dreaded by parents who have only just about got over the psychological scars caused by the soundtrack of the first film: \u201cI mean it\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWe finish each other\u2019s sandwiches...\u201d How those words linger in what is left of my mind. The original 2013 movie took more than $1bn at the box office and more than that in merchandising, became Amazon\u2019s bestselling children\u2019s film DVD of all time, solely based on pre-orders, and pushed Elsa, the name of the ice princess who can\u2019t control her powers, into the top 100 names for British babies. At the height of Frozen\u2019s success, the waiting time to see Elsa at Disney World, Florida, was four hours. Serena Williams once claimed to have watched the film 3,000 times. I don\u2019t think I can quite beat that but sometimes it felt like it. Our family was gripped by Frozen mania long before the term \u201cbasic\u201d fell into common usage. At the time, in 2013, our children were aged three, seven and 10, so we were essentially a Frozen marketing focus group. At first, Frozen was comforting and bonding, even slightly profound in its Oprah-esque message of self-belief and resilience. Then the soundtrack drove you slowly but surely to the boundary of sanity. Still, the children\u2019s passion for it grew. The three-year-old loved Olaf, the snowman who never wanted summer to come because then he would melt. The seven-year-old could imagine she was a princess who could shoot ice from her fingers. And the 10-year-old got to pretend his interest in it all was purely ironic. The parents, by now bludgeoned into dumb submission by the repetition of frozen fractals spiralling all around (Let It Go, bridge), simply appreciated any DVD or CD that the three tyrants would not argue over. For months, car trips were dominated by trolls singing about suitors tinkling in the woods and debates about whether reindeers smell better than people (seems unlikely but depends on the person \u2013 and the reindeer). I must confess to tragically earnest attempts by a peri-menopausal woman with karaoke ambitions (that would be me) to mimic the vocal gymnastics of Tony award-winner Idina Menzel as Elsa. I tried for months to hit the high E flat on \u201cLet the storm rage ooooon\u2026\u201d, a note held for so long that the driver of the car (my husband) once threatened to crash intentionally. As voice coach Molly Webb puts it: \u201cYou don\u2019t meet many singers who find sustaining a belt on an Eb5 a manageable request.\u201d But not many singers are Menzel. If she could do it, I could do it on the A303. The song robbed me of all reason. The excellence of the real-life performers behind the characters was certainly a factor in the film\u2019s success, with Kristen Bell also shining as Anna. The film itself won best animated feature, and Let It Go won the Oscar for best song. That song represents Frozen\u2019s success \u2013 and embodies the \u201chell hath no fury\u201d feminism of the storyline: \u201cThe cold never bothered me anyway.\u201d This brand of isolationist feminism \u2013 who needs men when you can create your own ice kingdom? \u2013 somehow hit a nerve long before #MeToo.

Despite speculation that Johnson might have relocated to a safer seat, it was confirmed on Thursday that he would stay put, ignoring an internal assessment from CCHQ that he is potentially at risk. The decision has prompted a network of groups to intensify their targeting of the constituency with the focus on galvanising the youth vote. They believe they can overturn Johnson\u2019s 5,034 majority in the 2017 election, a margin that was itself cut from almost 11,000 in the 2015 vote. Yesterday the female-led FCK Boris group, which has organised parties around the UK with the intention of getting young people to register to vote, held an event in Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency titled \u201cKick him out\u201d. At least 10 other groups, including Grime4Corbyn, UK Student Climate Network and the Feminist Anti-Fascist Assembly, were among the organisations supporting the event. The newest group to target the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency is crowd-funded collective Youth Can, which entered the fray yesterday confident it can help overturn Johnson\u2019s majority. A spokesman for Youth Can said: \u201cWe need to get rid of Johnson, but what is important to remember is that we can. That is what is so radical about democracy \u2013 a group of young people with a shared vision can organise, vote and change history. It\u2019s down to youth.\u201d He added: \u201cJohnson is the single person most responsible for taking away our hope \u2013 he has to go.\u201d The group cites calculations based on government statistics that around 3,000 new voters have turned 18 since the last election in June 2017, making a total of 13,000 residents aged under 25 in the constituency. Alongside that, the non-party- affiliated group estimates there have been around 1,500 deaths in the constituency since the 2017 election with older voters traditionally more likely to vote Conservative. A report by centre-right thinktank Onward found that a constituency is likely to be won by a party other than the Tories if its ratio of younger to older residents rises above 1.1. Analysts at Youth Can believe that the seat is significantly beyond that tipping point, with younger voters outnumbering older by an estimated 2.1 ratio. In addition to making sure younger residents are registered to vote, pivotal to any victory will be targeting the 13,000 students at the constituency\u2019s Brunel University London. With the end of term falling just two days after the general election, Youth Can is among a number of groups working together to try and ensure that Brunel\u2019s student population are eligible to vote. In the last general election Labour came second in the constituency and its candidate in 2019 is a former president of Brunel\u2019s student union, Ali Milani, a 25-year-old Iranian immigrant who moved to a north London council estate with his mother and sister when he was five. Youth Can, which will use billboards throughout the constituency among other localised messaging, joins a number of groups seeking to target Johnson in his constituency, including Operation Votey McVoteface, which believes there are enough potential voters without a permanent address, such as canal boat dwellers, to potentially influence the result. Research by the Canal &amp; River Trust reveals that Hillingdon, the west London borough in which Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge constituency lies, already tops the list of London local authorities in which boat dwellers paid the most council tax . Johnson\u2019s majority was cut from 10,695 in the 2015 general election to 5,034 in the 2017 election and is now the smallest of any prime minister since 1924. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 and 19 November 2019. An earlier version referred to an assessment by the intelligence agency GCHQ, when CCHQ, Conservative campaign headquarters, was meant. If Johnson loses his seat at the general election he will be the second PM, not the first, to do so. Conservative PM Arthur Balfour lost his seat in 1906.",

Although it\u2019s now little more than an overgrown, derelict site beside a DIY superstore, the RCA record plant in the new town of Washington, next to the A1 motorway and not far from the Angel of the North, was once a cutting-edge factory that produced pristine vinyl. Opened in 1970, it was visited by the young David Bowie soon after he signed to the RCA label, the star slicing a cake for the nonplussed staff, who lingered a while before returning to work. But by the mid-1970s orders had dwindled, and the plant seemed destined for closure. Its fate was averted in 1977 when the label\u2019s biggest star, Elvis Presley, died. Production was immediately scaled up to meet demand for reissues of the King\u2019s records, and the plant continued to operate until 1981.

The area is steeped in Fab Four lore: John Lennon and George Harrison attended Dovedale primary school around the corner, and Lennon lived for a while with his mother nearby, while McCartney sang in the choir at St Barnabas\u2019 church, which overlooks the junction. From there, one road leads to Lennon\u2019s Aunt Mimi\u2019s house, another to the McCartney family home. It\u2019s a good starting point for a journey through the Beatles\u2019 childhood landscapes, recalled in a cluster of autobiographical songs (In My Life, Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane). Crazy Daisy, Sheffield \u201cYou were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when I met you\u201d, Phil Oakey sings on the Human League\u2019s 1981 single Don\u2019t You Want Me. A year earlier, he\u2019d met Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall on the dancefloor of the Crazy Daisy nightclub in Sheffield, in a basement beneath what\u2019s now a Sainsbury\u2019s Local, and recruited them on the spot as dancers and backing singers for what would become the Human League\u2019s second iteration (founding members of the band, Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware had split in 1980 to form Heaven 17). The chance encounter represents a turning point for the group, leading to their third album Dare \u2013 a synthpop masterpiece \u2013 and a number one single in both the US and UK. \u2022 19-21 High St, Sheffield Hatton Gallery, Newcastle The huge influence of Britain\u2019s art schools on rock bands is perhaps most obvious in the case of Roxy Music. Lead singer Bryan Ferry studied fine art at Newcastle University in the mid-1960s, where he was taught by the artist Richard Hamilton, who would design the sleeve for the Beatles\u2019 White Album. Ferry\u2019s early bands, the City Blues and the Gas Board, dealt in the gritty soul and R&amp;B that would later be reshaped and distorted by Roxy Music. The Hatton Gallery in the university\u2019s art school holds regular exhibitions (a show of American pop artist Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s work runs until January 2020) and is home to Kurt Schwitters\u2019 Merz Barn Wall, relocated from the Lake District in 1965 and on permanent display. RCA record-pressing plant, Washington, Tyne and Wear The idea for my book Hit Factories originated with the discovery of a disused record plant not far from where I live. Although it\u2019s now little more than an overgrown, derelict site beside a DIY superstore, the RCA record plant in the new town of Washington, next to the A1 motorway and not far from the Angel of the North, was once a cutting-edge factory that produced pristine vinyl. Opened in 1970, it was visited by the young David Bowie soon after he signed to the RCA label, the star slicing a cake for the nonplussed staff, who lingered a while before returning to work. But by the mid-1970s orders had dwindled, and the plant seemed destined for closure. Its fate was averted in 1977 when the label\u2019s biggest star, Elvis Presley, died. Production was immediately scaled up to meet demand for reissues of the King\u2019s records, and the plant continued to operate until 1981. Local independent labels and acts had their records pressed at RCA Washington, including The Police, who visited in 1977 to pick up their first single, Fall Out. \u2022 Armstrong Industrial Estate, Washington Karl Whitney is the author of Hit Factories: A Journey Through the Industrial Cities of British Pop is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Whenever I\u2019m in Glasgow, I usually buy a day ticket for the Subway, the circular underground system that links the north and south city. Affectionately known as the Clockwork Orange, on account of its colour scheme, it\u2019s admirably simple: you can go clockwise or anti-clockwise. I have found it perfect for music tourism, which is essentially what I do in Glasgow: poking around record shops, hanging around bars and clubs and seeking out locations connected in some way to the Glasgow artists I love. Because for me Glasgow, more than anywhere else in the UK, is a music city. I recently published Hit Factories, a book about music scenes in our major industrial cities, and in a chapter about Glasgow I take the Subway to Hillhead station. In the ticket hall is a huge mural by novelist and artist Alasdair Grey. It\u2019s a bird\u2019s eye view of the West End of the city, as if the artist was hovering above Byres Road in a hot-air balloon. One of the things I thought a lot about while writing the book was the relationship between place and music, and when I got to Hillhead the perspective of the mural reminded me of a song \u2013 The Blue Nile\u2019s A Walk Across the Rooftops, from the 1984 album of the same name, which evoked the West End\u2019s sandstone tenement buildings, churches and university. The Blue Nile was a band rooted in the area: it had once been named McIntyre, after a building on the University of Glasgow\u2019s nearby campus, where its members were once students. They played an early, sparsely attended gig at Di Maggio\u2019s, an Italian restaurant down a laneway off Byres Road. \u201cWe played to two people,\u201d singer Paul Buchanan, who still lives in the West End, recalled. \u201cI remember thinking, this is astonishing, the [three-piece] band outnumber the audience.\u201d (The band\u2019s first two albums were issued by Linn Records, a label run by a high-end audio equipment manufacturer that provides guided tours of its purpose-built factory in Waterfoot, nine miles south of Glasgow. Probably for serious audiophiles only: tours are free on the second Thursday of every month at 10am, book at linn.co.uk) On Byres Road, the Oxfam Music Shop (at number 330) is always worth a look for bargains and rarities, from vinyl and CDs to instruments and hi-fi equipment; and next to Hillhead library is the original Fopp record store, recently saved from closure after an outcry from customers and local musicians. Further up the street, where Byres Road meets Great Western Road, is the \u00d2ran M\u00f3r, an arts venue in what was formerly Kelvinside parish church. The ceiling of its auditorium is decorated with an elaborate mural by \u2013 who else? \u2013 Alasdair Grey, and it hosts live music events several times a week. The key to Glasgow\u2019s thriving music scene lies in just such small- and medium-sized venues. A mile or so east along Great Western Road (or take the two-stop Subway ride from Hillhead to St Georges Cross) is the Hug and Pint, a bar and venue (named after an album by Scottish indie band Arab Strap, in turn inspired by a former Falkirk bar of the same name) whose kitchen specialises in delicious vegan dishes and whose murky basement room hosts gigs several nights a week. The Hug and Pint is a relative newcomer, established in 2015, but small venues like it were key to the growth of Glasgow\u2019s indie music scene \u2013 places where bands played their first gigs and could meet and share ideas. The 13th Note (originally on Glassford Street, now on King Street), Nice \u2018n\u2019 Sleazy on Sauchiehall Street and King Tut\u2019s Wah-Wah Hut on Vincent Street all opened their doors in the 1990s. The latter is famous for being the venue where Creation Records boss Alan McGee discovered Oasis. John Williamson, the former manager of Belle and Sebastian and Bis \u2013 and now a lecturer in music at the University of Glasgow \u2013 was a freelance journalist who ended up working with local entrepreneur and former musician Craig Tannock to open the 13th Note. \u201cSuddenly there were places that were putting live music on because they really wanted to,\u201d Williamson told me, \u201cnot just because it might bring in a few extra punters on a quiet night.\u201d Walking tours of the city\u2019s musical history are run by Glasgow Music City Tours every Saturday in summer (group tours resume on 11 April 2020 until 31 October, two-hour tours \u00a317; private tours run year round). The 13th Note became home to a weekly night, the Kazoo Club, organised by Alex Kapranos of the Yummy Fur, and later of Franz Ferdinand.

(The story of Chemikal Underground is lovingly documented in Niall McCann\u2019s 2016 film, Lost In France.) Craig Tannock moved on to open other venues that stick to a similar blueprint: Stereo, the Flying Duck, the 78 and Mono are cafe-bars serving craft beers and vegan food, with a small venue attached. The latter opened in 2002 across King Street from 13th Note, in a sandstone railway arch. Tucked away in a corner of the room, is Monorail Music, a beautifully curated record shop stocking the best independent releases \u2013 plenty of them from local acts \u2013 run by Stephen McRobbie of Glasgow lo-fi icons the Pastels. The city has a great selection of record shops: there are gems to be discovered in Missing Records beneath Central Station, a two-level store teeming with secondhand vinyl and CDs; in the West End, the excellent Mixed-Up Records on Otago Street deals in everything from indie to jazz and world music; on the other side of Kelvinbridge is LP Records, which has its own radio station broadcasting from the shop \u2013 often the DJs include local indie acts; and Love Music near Queen Street station sells new and secondhand vinyl, CDs and tapes. It quickly became clear to me that the musical infrastructure of Glasgow \u2013 its record shops, bars and cafes, the recording studios and record labels \u2013 is the result of a DIY ethos that the city\u2019s musicians had long embraced. Punk was a galvanising force in many UK cities and has had long-term effects that stretched far beyond the initial sound and fury of the music. The idea of being able to record your own songs, promote your own gigs and issue your own records without waiting around to be discovered by a major label was revelatory. Postcard Records, founded by Alan Horne in 1979, was one of many labels around the country to grasp the potential of this punk-DIY ethos. It\u2019s difficult to imagine the history of Glasgow\u2019s independent music scene without its rickety, melodic and witty guitar pop \u2013 typified by Edwyn Collins\u2019 Orange Juice. The band and Horne used to meet in the Victoria Caf\u00e9 in the Glasgow School of Art on Scott Street. The Vic, assembled from fittings salvaged from a cafe of the same name on the city\u2019s Southside, is still open despite the damage to the main art school buildings in last summer\u2019s fire. Although the band played an early, informal date here, Orange Juice\u2019s first official gig was nearby at the art school\u2019s Haldane Building, a turreted, red sandstone former Highland Light Infantry drill hall on the corner of Hill Street and Rose Street. Postcard\u2019s bands had a musical influence on subsequent Glasgow acts, notably BMX Bandits and Teenage Fanclub. I crossed the Clyde to the Southside to meet Duglas T Stewart of BMX Bandits. He recalled meeting Norman Blake \u2013 who later formed Teenage Fanclub \u2013 at primary school in the outlying industrial town of Bellshill.

Over time they recruited other young musicians from Bellshill and nearby Motherwell to join their bands, having met them while busking on Saturdays in Glasgow city centre.

      "body": "<p>Democracy relies on accurate information. If voters are subjected to a cacophony of political claims between which it is almost impossible to sift fact from fiction, how can they be said to have made a meaningful choice? This is why the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 false, fabricated or deliberately misleading information \u2013 poses such an existential threat to the legitimacy of the democratic process.</p> <p>This election campaign is highlighting the extent to which it is not just shadowy players in the background who are involved in spreading fake news. It is increasingly something that certain politicians, in particular, the Tory party under Boris Johnson, are themselves creating and propagating in an effort to discredit their rivals.</p> <p>It would be naive to imagine politics has ever been immune to spin and exaggeration. But until a few years ago, there was an assumption that most of what our leaders said would have some basis in fact and if a politician were caught telling a bare-faced lie, there would be political consequences. This helped to keep politics honest far more than any rule or law.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many more will have seen the figures than will have read why they are utterly misleading</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last week\u2019s campaigning shows how much this honour code has broken down. The Conservatives released a dossier that claimed to show a Labour government would increase spending by \u00a31.2tn over five years. That figure has been <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/news/conservative-claim-labour-1-trillion/\" title=\"\">roundly debunked</a> by independent fact-checkers. Not only has Labour not yet published its manifesto, rendering any attempt to accurately cost what its plans might be completely invalid, but the Tory analysis includes policies Labour has explicitly said will not be in its manifesto and many that are not its policy. And some figures have been exaggerated through double-counting. This has not, however, stopped the Tories <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50383018\" title=\"\">claiming </a>that a Labour government would cost each taxpayer on average \u00a32,400 a year. These figures have no basis in fact, yet Sajid Javid, the man who is asking voters for a five-year mandate to run the nation\u2019s finances, robustly defended them.</p> <p>It has been more of the same scaremongering about immigration. Priti Patel, the home secretary, claimed last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/will-net-immigration-reach-840000-per-year-under-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">net migration could treble</a> to 840,000 people a year under a Labour government. Read the small print and not only have the Conservatives failed to set out their workings, the figure is based on the assumption that Labour would extend free movement rights to the whole world. This is not Labour policy.</p> <p>Both figures have been comprehensively demolished.

      "bodyText": "Democracy relies on accurate information. If voters are subjected to a cacophony of political claims between which it is almost impossible to sift fact from fiction, how can they be said to have made a meaningful choice? This is why the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 false, fabricated or deliberately misleading information \u2013 poses such an existential threat to the legitimacy of the democratic process. This election campaign is highlighting the extent to which it is not just shadowy players in the background who are involved in spreading fake news. It is increasingly something that certain politicians, in particular, the Tory party under Boris Johnson, are themselves creating and propagating in an effort to discredit their rivals. It would be naive to imagine politics has ever been immune to spin and exaggeration. But until a few years ago, there was an assumption that most of what our leaders said would have some basis in fact and if a politician were caught telling a bare-faced lie, there would be political consequences. This helped to keep politics honest far more than any rule or law. Last week\u2019s campaigning shows how much this honour code has broken down. The Conservatives released a dossier that claimed to show a Labour government would increase spending by \u00a31.2tn over five years. That figure has been roundly debunked by independent fact-checkers. Not only has Labour not yet published its manifesto, rendering any attempt to accurately cost what its plans might be completely invalid, but the Tory analysis includes policies Labour has explicitly said will not be in its manifesto and many that are not its policy. And some figures have been exaggerated through double-counting. This has not, however, stopped the Tories claiming that a Labour government would cost each taxpayer on average \u00a32,400 a year. These figures have no basis in fact, yet Sajid Javid, the man who is asking voters for a five-year mandate to run the nation\u2019s finances, robustly defended them. It has been more of the same scaremongering about immigration. Priti Patel, the home secretary, claimed last week that net migration could treble to 840,000 people a year under a Labour government. Read the small print and not only have the Conservatives failed to set out their workings, the figure is based on the assumption that Labour would extend free movement rights to the whole world. This is not Labour policy. Both figures have been comprehensively demolished. But in a world where many voters consume the news by scrolling through headlines on social media feeds, many more will have seen the figures than will have read why they are utterly misleading. These tactics borrow heavily from the Vote Leave campaign of 2016, which was run by Johnson\u2019s chief strategist, Dominic Cummings. Vote Leave deliberately misled voters in order to win votes.

Vote Leave also claimed that leaving the EU would free up \u00a3350m a week that could be spent on the NHS, a claim that has led the UK Statistics Authority to criticise Johnson for \u201ca clear misuse of national statistics\u201d. It\u2019s not just the fake figures: Johnson has misled his way through interviews with impunity. He has repeatedly asserted that there will be no customs checks for goods from Northern Ireland making their way to the rest of the UK as a result of his EU exit deal, even as other ministers have been honest that they will indeed be necessary. He has falsely claimed to have reduced murders in London to fewer than a hundred for several years in a row and said that EU immigration represents half of total immigration into the UK (the real figure is around a quarter. And the Conservatives have egregiously circulated an edited clip of an interview of Keir Starmer that misrepresents what actually happened. There are serious consequences to politicians spreading what can only be termed \u201cfake news\u201d.

The most coveted Spanish wine bodega of all, however, is not in Rioja. That credit belongs \u2013 as it has done for around 150 years \u2013 to Vega Sicilia, a single estate in Ribera del Duero to the west of Rioja, whose trio of superb ageworthy reds, but particularly Unico and Reserva Especial, attract top-Bordeaux (three and four-figure) prices. Until recently, the fame of Vega Sicilia dwarfed that of the region itself; but over the past 30 years, Ribera has emerged as a real challenger to the Rioja hegemony, thanks to wines ofdepth and silky polish, such as Cilar de Silos\u2019 immaculate crianza.</p> <p><strong>Bodega de Bardos Romantica Crianza, Ribera del Duero, Spain 2016 (from \u00a313.50, <a href=\"http://nickollsandperks.co.uk\">nickollsandperks.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://cambridgewine.com\">cambridgewine.com</a>; <a href=\"http://henningswine.co.uk\">henningswine.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://woodwinters.com\">woodwinters.com</a>) </strong>What makes comparisons between Ribera del Duero and Rioja irresistible is that both regions are dominated by the same grape variety: tempranillo, (or tinto fino or tinta del pa\u00eds as the Ribera del Duero variant is known). The big difference is that the vineyards in the upper valley of the Duero River (which flows down to Portugal where it changes its name to Douro, and supports another great wine region near Porto) are at a much higher altitude (around 800m above sea level) than in Rioja (which tops out around 500m). What that tends to mean in practice is a short growing season where the very hot days are matched by very cool nights, leading to wines that tend to be more intense in colour, dark fruit (mulberry and blackberry) flavour and tannin, but with a balancing, focusing freshness, all qualities very much in evidence in Bardos\u2019 Romantica.</p> <p><strong>Quinta Milu Roble, Ribera del Duero, Spain 2018 (from \u00a312.99, <a href=\"http://randhfinewines.co.uk\">randhfinewines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://noblegreenwines.co.uk\">noblegreenwines.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://connollyswine.co.uk\">connollyswine.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://corksofbristol.com\">corksofbristol.com</a>)</strong> Perhaps because its emergence as a wine region \u2013 Vega Siclia aside \u2013 coincided with boom years for the Spanish and global economy, Ribera del Duero\u2019s reputation has sometimes been one of excess.

It\u2019s the meaty equivalent of eating pistachios: there is the meditative process of lifting the shell. You probe with your tongue for the good stuff and discard the empties.</p> <p>We have a large platter of prawns that have been deep-fried in their shells. You may peel them if you wish. I like the texture of those salty shells, crisped up in the hot oil. There is a little sweet chilli sauce to send them on their way and, for no obvious reason, save that fairy lights make everything better, a single bulb tied to the plate by a strand of clingfilm. It flashes blue and pink.</p> <p>The star of the show is a whole head-and-tail-on sea bass, taken off the rest of the bones. Courtesy of mind-boggling kitchen knife gymnastics, it has been transformed into a fish-porcupine hybrid. The flesh has become thick battered fingers which have risen up in the fryer to point accusingly. It\u2019s then drenched in a sweet garlic sauce. God, it\u2019s good. My cheeks become sticky and I feel the limits of appetite as a failure of character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97154d192d59fce5975cc0e83c30d8eb6536f430\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97154d192d59fce5975cc0e83c30d8eb6536f430/680_518_4363_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A thudding member of the citrus family\u2019: pomelo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A thudding member of the citrus family\u2019: pomelo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanna Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They bring huge segments of pomelo, a thudding member of the citrus family, which we pick at listlessly. I regret there are only two of us here tonight. This place demands enough of you at the table to give the menu and the contents of those tanks a proper seeing to. We have had three beers each and knocked up a bill of \u00a3125. A larger party would find it cheaper per head.</p> <p>Downstairs a man has just bought a single huge geoduck at \u00a395 a kilo, which he has paid for in \u00a320s thumbed off a fat bank roll. It has been fished out of the tank, and now its end probes the edge of the bag in which it sits. Stop frowning. At Live Seafood in Manchester, a frisky geoduck heading out the door is all part of the floor show.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Like Live Seafood in Manchester, the interior of Seveni, across the road from the Imperial War Museum in south London, is big on fairy lights. It doesn\u2019t do live seafood but it does do a whole lot else: old Beijing copper hotpot, table barbecue and raucous Sichuan dishes. As with Live Seafood, go mob handed to get the most out of it (<em><a href=\"https://seveni.co.uk/\">seveni.co.uk</a></em>).</p> <p>From 26 November until 26 April 2020, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge will stage an exhibition called Feast &amp; Fast: The Art of Food in Europe, 1500-1800. It celebrates the preparation of food across the continent, its presentation and what that said about the attitudes of those involved. Intriguingly, it points up how concerns about our relationship with what we eat are not a modern phenomenon (<em><a href=\"https://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/\">fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk</a></em>).</p> <p>Amid all the restaurant closure gloom some cheerier news: <a href=\"http://www.pittcue.co.uk/\">Pitt Cue</a>, which grew out of an American barbecue food truck before going into administration earlier this year, looks set to make a comeback. Co-founder Jamie Berger has bought back the intellectual property rights to the business. The new Pitt Cue will first make its mark through pop-ups and residences and will concentrate on \u2018barbecue, bourbon and beer\u2019.</p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>",

I roll up my sleeves and reach for a pile of napkins, because it\u2019s a hands-on job and there is no way to do this cleanly, if you do it properly. It\u2019s the meaty equivalent of eating pistachios: there is the meditative process of lifting the shell. You probe with your tongue for the good stuff and discard the empties. We have a large platter of prawns that have been deep-fried in their shells. You may peel them if you wish. I like the texture of those salty shells, crisped up in the hot oil. There is a little sweet chilli sauce to send them on their way and, for no obvious reason, save that fairy lights make everything better, a single bulb tied to the plate by a strand of clingfilm. It flashes blue and pink. The star of the show is a whole head-and-tail-on sea bass, taken off the rest of the bones. Courtesy of mind-boggling kitchen knife gymnastics, it has been transformed into a fish-porcupine hybrid. The flesh has become thick battered fingers which have risen up in the fryer to point accusingly. It\u2019s then drenched in a sweet garlic sauce. God, it\u2019s good. My cheeks become sticky and I feel the limits of appetite as a failure of character. They bring huge segments of pomelo, a thudding member of the citrus family, which we pick at listlessly. I regret there are only two of us here tonight. This place demands enough of you at the table to give the menu and the contents of those tanks a proper seeing to. We have had three beers each and knocked up a bill of \u00a3125. A larger party would find it cheaper per head. Downstairs a man has just bought a single huge geoduck at \u00a395 a kilo, which he has paid for in \u00a320s thumbed off a fat bank roll. It has been fished out of the tank, and now its end probes the edge of the bag in which it sits. Stop frowning. At Live Seafood in Manchester, a frisky geoduck heading out the door is all part of the floor show. News bites Like Live Seafood in Manchester, the interior of Seveni, across the road from the Imperial War Museum in south London, is big on fairy lights. It doesn\u2019t do live seafood but it does do a whole lot else: old Beijing copper hotpot, table barbecue and raucous Sichuan dishes. As with Live Seafood, go mob handed to get the most out of it (seveni.co.uk). From 26 November until 26 April 2020, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge will stage an exhibition called Feast &amp; Fast: The Art of Food in Europe, 1500-1800. It celebrates the preparation of food across the continent, its presentation and what that said about the attitudes of those involved. Intriguingly, it points up how concerns about our relationship with what we eat are not a modern phenomenon (fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk). Amid all the restaurant closure gloom some cheerier news: Pitt Cue, which grew out of an American barbecue food truck before going into administration earlier this year, looks set to make a comeback. Co-founder Jamie Berger has bought back the intellectual property rights to the business. The new Pitt Cue will first make its mark through pop-ups and residences and will concentrate on \u2018barbecue, bourbon and beer\u2019.

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of exploiting migrants for profit and leaving them in legal limbo after its visa application services were outsourced to private firms. The Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association (ILPA) says that those seeking to work or settle in the UK are being pressed into paying premium rates for a fast-track service that does not reliably deliver. Visa services for overseas applicants were outsourced to a Dubai-based firm, VFS, in 2014 and the process for those applying for residency permits was handed over to a French company, Spora Steria, last year. Home Office revenues from overseas visa applications have soared ninefold to \u00a31.6bn after VFS took over and much of the income is from heavily promoted add-on services such as fast-tracking and document checking. Applicants are warned that they must wait six months for a decision unless they pay an additional premium of up to \u00a3800 for a 24-hour \u201csuper priority\u201d service. \u201cWe are concerned that these services may exploit vulnerable and less well-informed migrants, who may feel pressured to purchase an expensive service which will not provide them with any benefit,\u201d said ILPA chief executive Nicole Francis. \u201cThe contract between UKVI and the subcontractors may have resulted in UK Visa and Immigration [UKVI] benefiting financially from the selling of additional services to customers.\u201d A shortage of free appointments for those already in the UK has forced some to pay the fee to renew their residency permit before their visas expire. However, the prominent promotions of priority services on the government website do not specify that the 24-hour timescale applies only to the decision about a visa application, not to how long it will take to receive a biometric residency permit (BRP). These hold a person\u2019s fingerprints and photograph on a secure chip, and can be used to confirm information on work and benefits entitlements. The delays by the Home Office and its subcontractors are leaving some applicants unable to work or leave the country for weeks after they have paid the premium. Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo, a university research fellow from Mexico, paid \u00a32,350 to extend his work visa, including \u00a3500 for the priority service to avoid the six-month wait. Over two months later he was still awaiting his residency permit after it was delivered to the wrong address by DX, the courier contracted by the UKVI. He was told that he could not contact the Home Office directly, and that since its subcontracted helpline has no access to application details his only option was to apply again. He was obliged to pay another \u00a31,135 in priority fees as no free appointments were available and DX was unable to locate his office block. \u201cRoyal Mail, Amazon, even Asda manage to deliver to my building, which happens to be a conspicuous national research facility \u2013 and they charge \u00a34.50 or so for a delivery,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Home Office cannot manage the same feat for \u00a33,485.20.\u201d His request for his priority fees to be refunded was refused. UKVI instead advised him to change his delivery address, which he is unable to do because DX can\u2019t provide a tracking number for the order. \u201cNo one should be treated and squeezed for money like this, regardless of where they are born,\u201d he says. \u201cMy experience shows how little the Home Office cares about the applications it receives for work visas, the fantastically large sums of money involved in the process and the lack of channels to appeal against flagrant negligence.\u201d His BRP eventually arrived via Royal Mail after the Observer intervened. The Home Office told the Observer that he was not due a refund of his priority fees since both applications had been processed on time and the delays were due to delivery errors. A DX spokesperson said: \u201cWe are obviously very disappointed that Mr Lozada-Hidalgo had a poor experience with our delivery service and we wish to apologise to him. We have looked into the matter and have identified steps to improve our service in the light of his experience.\u201d",

By making better meat production a priority, publicly funded research will not only improve and protect public health but also increase food security and self-sufficiency, issues especially important for the UK.

Arguably, the most surprising event in recent years has been the emergence of Emmanuel Macron as president of the republic.

There have been harder questions to answer. It\u2019s unsettling, in fact, how quickly we shed any expectations of Claire Foy, Vanessa Kirby and the rest of the band, so seamless the transition and so thorough the inhabiting. Olivia Colman\u2019s first words were \u201cold bag\u201d, but Olly\u2019s caught the full weirdnesses required to make one\u2019s mouth move in that way \u2013 \u201ceulled begg\u201d \u2013 as has Helena Bonham Carter as Margaret, the \u2013 I think we\u2019re in spoiler-free zones now \u2013 pushy, stylish, jealous one, with her thwarted dreams of being \u201con ivvry coin, ivvry banknote\u201d. Tobias Menzies as Phil the Greek now reveals the skull beneath the skin.</p> <p>How true is Peter Morgan\u2019s interpretation of real backroom royal lives? Again, there have been harder questions. Who cares? I first heard about the Queen\u2019s \u201caffair\u201d with Lord P about 30 years ago, and was so shocked I had no option but to shrug and keep breathing. More chewy by far is the politics: in this lies nothing less than the 60s/70s story of Britain, told through Morgan\u2019s prism, which is roughly faithful, skewed only to the serving of drama. Which can in the right hands do so much more than simple documentary; I\u2019m vaguely grumped yet wholly unsurprised that youngsters are learning more from Netflix than propah schooling. When Jason Watkins, a wonderful Harold Wilson, is stared down by Colman, post-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/09/aberfan-50-years-owen-sheers-the-green-hollow-film-poem\" title=\"\">Aberfan</a>, for setting the press on Her Coldness \u2013 distinct and surely deliberate pre-echoes of Blair, 1997 \u2013 you get a shivery frisson of genuine tensions in that room; and you believe it happened <em>exactly</em> so. I\u2019ll say again: it\u2019s worth the Netflix sub for this alone.</p> <p><strong>World on Fire</strong> ended with the most sit-up-and-beg plea for a second series I\u2019ve yet to see \u2013 Kasia, on a hill escaping from Nazis, trying to decide whether to go with certain tortured death or a race to the sunlit uplands, which would have guaranteed another few hours with ex-lover Harry. I\u2019d have looked at spoilt boy Harry and considered the lazy attractions of gravity.</p> <p>It has been a semi-triumph. Writer Peter Bowker bravely stranded all of Europe in his task: some strands worked. Kasia and Poland, certainly, and the Webster/Albert relationship in Paris is wielding increasing power, as did some Berlin segments. But much else has been a part waste of fine actors: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lesley-manville\" title=\"\">Lesley Manville</a>, Sean Bean, Helen Hunt, for goodness sake. It\u2019s been sometimes lovely, often harrowing, but two characters in particular have never rung even vaguely true: both Hunt\u2019s war reporter and posho Harry have channelled 21st-century sensibilities. It hugely deserves a second series, not least because of the good jazz, from which I exclude caterwauls from Lois.

Loya describes himself, now, as looking like he ate his younger self. He\u2019s big, 55, Mexican. He\u2019s very charming and articulate. He is telling us about how he used to rob banks. And if you\u2019re expecting a lengthy pre-robbery strategy session, a careful casing of the joint and assessment of security, you won\u2019t be getting that. \u201cHow much have you planned this all out in advance?

It turns out you can. Loya simply wrote down \u201cWe have a bomb, this is a bank robbery\u201d and passed the note to a bank clerk.</p> <p>No planning, then, but there was a buildup. Loya is very good at explaining his mindset. He kept walking into banks, psyching himself up to rob them\u2026 and then he\u2019d walk out and go to a fast-food joint for a coffee. He knew he had to break through his fear, he says, because on the other side of it was \u201ca big payoff\u201d.

And he ends up in jail, where he has to protect himself. \u201cJail was OK. It\u2019s like camp but with extreme violence,\u201d he says.

Does it sound interesting? It is. Adair, who worked on <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/dr-death/\" title=\"\">Dr Death</a></em>, is a great interviewer, and Loya an excellent interviewee. And this opening episode of new series <strong><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/thescore\" title=\"\">The Score: Bank Robber Diaries</a></strong> is utterly gripping, even though the robbery itself \u2013 he gets away with $4,500 \u2013 is hardly a great heist.

Barnes is a mum, with a kid who has a nut allergy (this fact is dropped in with a CLANNNNNGGGG, so one assumes it will become relevant), and she also messed up her last case.

An unreconstructed, full-corps pageant complete with tiny pageboys in satin knickerbockers, the unironic staging obscures the satire of Tchaikovsky\u2019s intricate score, which is served up with the bullishness of a Technicolor special at the MGM Grand.</p> <p>There is a notable lack of menace when bad fairy Carabosse curses Princess Aurora at her christening, simply because she wasn\u2019t invited. Carabosse will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen <em>The</em> <em>Wizard of Oz</em> or encountered an angry flamenco teacher. With her dusty Halloween dress and secondhand lace headpiece, Carabosse resembles a tipsy cosplay Catherine of Aragon crashing Anne Boleyn\u2019s christening party for Elizabeth I.</p> <p>The starring role of Princess Aurora will be taken by various dancers this season. I got <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/yasmine-naghdi\" title=\"\">Yasmine Naghdi</a> and she is spectacular. Prowling and exultant, punchy and athletic, grinning from ear to ear, she exudes physical and emotional strength. She cavorts with a bravura display of skill, stamina and charisma, her majestically controlled high kicks and nonchalant turns reminding me more of a music-hall sailor than a fragile \u201cpwintheth\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the interminable final wedding, pairs of guests perform like runners-up on Strictly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Apart from this main role, the production is underpowered and baggy, in massive need of updating. Any darkness is ignored. A cursed family, a century-long damned sleep, a wake-up call in the form of a sexual assault? Who cares when you have the Lilac Fairy holding a glittery wand resembling a cake decoration. When Princess Aurora finds the cursed spindle, it trails a length of thread like the Tampon of Doom. Her saviour, diffident little Prince Florimund (Matthew Ball), doesn\u2019t have much to do. In his first solo he is lonely and sad, his spiralling turns and dejected, headachey hops going nowhere. Later, he is happy and in love.</p> <p>Other male dancers splay and display, but really this is a ballet for women and an epic legs workout. That is where Marius Petipa\u2019s choreography really bites and attacks, demanding total ballerina focus for those unsupported holds and turns. Each fairy \u2013 and the gorgeously writhing White Cat \u2013 gets her own fiendishly precise choreographic personality, which fuses with the score, where trilling solos tease out from the lush bluster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38f806bc5493b98cb9a85e90f882c62a9afc2fef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38f806bc5493b98cb9a85e90f882c62a9afc2fef/0_0_4301_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from The Sleeping Beauty by The Royal Ballet @ Royal Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corps strength\u2026 The Sleeping Beauty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the interminable final wedding, pairs of guests perform like runners-up on <em>Strictly</em>.

It showcases the strong ballet foundations of Cunningham\u2019s genius as well as his international influences, deconstructed through writhing jumps and nervy readjustments.</p> <p>The score is intrusive and overbearing, neither a complement nor a counter-challenge, and running 10 excerpts together without any change in costume, backdrop or lighting robs the source works of their distinctiveness.

An unreconstructed, full-corps pageant complete with tiny pageboys in satin knickerbockers, the unironic staging obscures the satire of Tchaikovsky\u2019s intricate score, which is served up with the bullishness of a Technicolor special at the MGM Grand. There is a notable lack of menace when bad fairy Carabosse curses Princess Aurora at her christening, simply because she wasn\u2019t invited. Carabosse will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen The Wizard of Oz or encountered an angry flamenco teacher. With her dusty Halloween dress and secondhand lace headpiece, Carabosse resembles a tipsy cosplay Catherine of Aragon crashing Anne Boleyn\u2019s christening party for Elizabeth I. The starring role of Princess Aurora will be taken by various dancers this season. I got Yasmine Naghdi and she is spectacular. Prowling and exultant, punchy and athletic, grinning from ear to ear, she exudes physical and emotional strength. She cavorts with a bravura display of skill, stamina and charisma, her majestically controlled high kicks and nonchalant turns reminding me more of a music-hall sailor than a fragile \u201cpwintheth\u201d. Apart from this main role, the production is underpowered and baggy, in massive need of updating. Any darkness is ignored. A cursed family, a century-long damned sleep, a wake-up call in the form of a sexual assault? Who cares when you have the Lilac Fairy holding a glittery wand resembling a cake decoration. When Princess Aurora finds the cursed spindle, it trails a length of thread like the Tampon of Doom. Her saviour, diffident little Prince Florimund (Matthew Ball), doesn\u2019t have much to do. In his first solo he is lonely and sad, his spiralling turns and dejected, headachey hops going nowhere. Later, he is happy and in love. Other male dancers splay and display, but really this is a ballet for women and an epic legs workout. That is where Marius Petipa\u2019s choreography really bites and attacks, demanding total ballerina focus for those unsupported holds and turns. Each fairy \u2013 and the gorgeously writhing White Cat \u2013 gets her own fiendishly precise choreographic personality, which fuses with the score, where trilling solos tease out from the lush bluster. At the interminable final wedding, pairs of guests perform like runners-up on Strictly. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be Christmas without some stale frosted fruitcake. Keep an eye on Yasmine Naghdi and let the rest waft around you like a cheap scented candle. Rambert Event at Sadler\u2019s Wells is a mixed spritzer of excerpted Merce Cunningham works spanning 35 years, with a backdrop of Gerhard Richter paintings and a live score by Philip Selway, Adem Ilhan and Quinta. It showcases the strong ballet foundations of Cunningham\u2019s genius as well as his international influences, deconstructed through writhing jumps and nervy readjustments. The score is intrusive and overbearing, neither a complement nor a counter-challenge, and running 10 excerpts together without any change in costume, backdrop or lighting robs the source works of their distinctiveness. This bemuse-bouche does none of its contributors any favours. Star ratings (out of five) The Sleeping Beauty \u2605\u2605\u2605 Rambert Event \u2605\u2605 \u2022 The Sleeping Beauty is at the Royal Opera House, London, until 16 January 2020",

      "bodyText": "The Greens MP Adam Bandt has defended his party colleague labelling politicians from the major parties \u201carsonists\u201d while bushfires swept through swathes of New South Wales and Queensland last week. Bandt noted that the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John was among the generation of young people \u201cterrified\u201d about the impact of climate change, and said the point of the remarks was to highlight Australia\u2019s inaction on reducing fossil fuel emissions. \u201cI think he\u2019s the youngest member of parliament, he\u2019s part of a generation that is terrified and aghast with what they\u2019re seeing with the climate crisis,\u201d Bandt, the party\u2019s climate change spokesman, told ABC Insiders on Sunday. \u201cThey are terrified and unless the government gets the climate crisis under control and reins in the use of coal, then this generation is going to rise up with a fury that is matched only by the intensity of the fires. \u201cSo people may quibble about the words that are used, but I would urge people to have a listen to the point that Jordon was making.\u201d Bandt said he did not regret linking the government\u2019s climate change policy to the bushfires. \u201cScott Morrison has been put on notice, and his government has been put on notice for many years now, that if we keep digging up coal at the rate of knots that we\u2019re doing at the moment, it is going to contribute to making global warming worse, and that is going to make bushfires like this more likely and more intense when they happen.\u201d Speaking in the Senate last week, Steele-John targeted both Labor and Coalition MPs for voting in support of the Coalition\u2019s so-called big stick energy legislation, which gives the government the power to force energy companies to divest energy assets. The Greens argue the legislation will have the effect of \u201cpropping up coal\u201d by prolonging the life of coal-fired power stations and contributing to climate change. \u201cYou are no better than a bunch of arsonists \u2013 borderline arsonists \u2013 and you should be ashamed,\u201d Steele-John said. \u201cThere will come a time when the Australian community shall look back on this moment and ask what we were doing to help as they were fighting fires on the front.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Queensland Labor senator Murray Watt objected to the remarks, accusing the party of political point-scoring. \u201cTo refer to members of this chamber as arsonists on the very day that we are told by fire chiefs that we are seeing conditions that this country has never seen before is beyond offensive,\u201d Watt said. A political war of words erupted between the Greens and Coalition MPs over the link between climate change and bushfires last week, with the Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce saying some of the victims of the fire in NSW were probably Greens voters. \u201cI acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party, so I am not going to start attacking them,\u201d Joyce told Sky News on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I want to do. What I wanted to concentrate on is the policies that we can mitigate these tragedies happening again in the future.\u201d Joyce also dismissed the Greens suggestion that a government shift on coal-fired power could address the risk of bushfires. \u201cTo make these spurious links \u2013 that a policy change would have stopped the fire \u2013 is so insulting and just completely beyond the pale,\u201d he said. Earlier in the week the Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, had said it was \u201craving inner-city lunatics\u201d who were linking climate change to the fires. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, labelled Joyce\u2019s comments \u201cunhelpful\u201d and urged MPs on all sides to \u201ctake it down a few notches\u201d. \u201cThere have been a lot of provocative comments made over the last few days from all sides of the debate and I find it very unhelpful,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThe last thing that people in an urgent crisis need at the moment is hearing politicians shout at each other. \u201cThere is a time and a place to debate controversial issues and important issues. Right now it\u2019s important to focus on the needs of Australians who need our help.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Newness is overrated. The most sustainable thing to wear to a party is the thing you already own. So, shop your wardrobe. \u201cParty wear is usually not worn very often, so do you really have to buy something new?\u201d asks personal stylist Anna Berkeley (annaberkeley.com). \u201cAnd unless you\u2019re a clinical minimalist, you might have overlooked something. When I\u2019m doing wardrobe clearouts with clients they\u2019re constantly saying, \u2018Oh, I forgot about that!\u2019\u201d And if there\u2019s something you are not wearing, is it because it needs adjusting? \u201cI have a black Tibi dress that is a great fit, but it\u2019s not quite the right length on my leg, so I\u2019m going to get a tailor to add a feather trim to the bottom,\u201d says Berkeley. Steph Stevens, a fashion editor and stylist whose clients include Alexa Chung, recently launched a consultancy service specialising in archive clothing that she sells or rents, with inspiration pictures on her Instagram feed @happydays_stephstevens. One of her tips for parties is tying a coloured ribbon around a shirt collar. \u201cI like slightly unusual colours \u2013 my favourite is mint green, which looks great with white or black.\u201d She also suggests taking your silk pyjamas out for the night. \u201cThey have to be a decent pair, but you can split them up so that you get two looks for the price of one. Wear the trousers with a dressy shoe, the shirt with a blazer and jeans.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t have to be all about the clothes. \u201cA good red matt lipstick can up the tempo of an outfit.\u201d She likes Glossier\u2019s Generation G sheer matte in Zip.
