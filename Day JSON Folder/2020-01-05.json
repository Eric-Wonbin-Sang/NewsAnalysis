Whether a genuine policy pivot or a handy smokescreen for a perceived under-investment by the clubs in foreign firepower, the number of Australian teenagers seeing game-time during the 2019-20 campaign has been hugely welcome. As previously noted, during round one Australian teenagers played a combined 546 minutes; by round 12 this had grown to 922 as injuries, fixture congestion or under-performance saw young talents like Mirza Muratovic or Dylan Pierias break through for first-team starts. And yet it was the divergent fortunes of two of the competition\u2019s big-money marquees that has animated the past week\u2019s action as Robbie Kruse\u2019s virtuoso showing dismantled Newcastle and Alexander Meier\u2019s dispirited lumbering headlined a New Year\u2019s Day home capitulation for the Wanderers.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The secretary went on the claim that \u201cthere were in fact plots that [Suleimani] was working on that were aimed directly at significant harm to American interests throughout the region, not just in Iraq\u201d.</p> \n<p>But he was unable to provide specifics.</p> \n<p>When host Chuck Todd asked if retaliation against US citizens should now be expected, Pompeo admitted: \u201cIt may be that there\u2019s a little noise here in the interim.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was a remark that could come to be seen as flippant if American lives are lost.</p> \n<p>Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top military commander held responsible for thousands of deaths, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\">was killed on Friday in a drone strike at Baghdad airport</a>, a stunning attack analysts said brought the US and Iran closer to war than at any point in the past 40 years.</p> \n<p>Critics fear Trump has opened Pandora\u2019s box.

Guests including the artist Isaac Julien, the footballer H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and poet Wilson Oryema sat at round tables, and fruit punch and Jamaican patties were offered as refreshments. In the show notes provided, Wales Bonner explained that she was inspired, in part, by John Goto\u2019s photographs of second-generation British Caribbean and Asian young people at Lewisham youth centre for lovers rock parties. The soundtrack \u2013 put together by Jamie xx \u2013 was blasted out of speaker stacks, as it might have when these images were taken.</p> <p>The collection stuck close to the theme. It began with a crisp wool suit with a polo neck \u2013 a classically 70s combination, but with a minimalism that did away with any accusations of retro. Across women\u2019s and menswear, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets followed, along with shirts printed with paintings by the British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling.</p> <p>The red, gold and green of the Rastafarian flag were used on hats, vests and coats. All the clothes felt modern despite the references. This is one of Wales Bonner\u2019s strengths. While her references are so academic that she provides a bibliography for each collection, she is able to translate her area of historical interest \u2013 be it lovers rock, Howard University in the 60s, or the court dress of Haile Selassie \u2013 into clothes that people want to wear.</p> <p>After the show, Wales Bonner \u2013 a somewhat serene presence in the usually frenetic world of a fashion show \u2013 explained that the inspiration for this show had been, as she put it, \u201cinevitable\u201d because of its proximity to her own background, and her Jamaican father\u2019s experiences in London in the 70s. \u201cI was thinking a lot about people coming into community centres and creating their own parties,\u201d she said. \u201cI was looking at John Goto\u2019s Lovers Rock series and saw my family reflected in it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d5c0a3e2e5fe523eef6875d964cf17c812a73a14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5c0a3e2e5fe523eef6875d964cf17c812a73a14/416_288_2329_4307/541.jpg\" alt=\"Model in cap, T-shirt and trousers\" width=\"541\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The show featured polo necks, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BFC/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 29-year-old designer saw a difference between that era and her own. \u201cI feel like there was an optimism and irreverence [then] which meant that you could sample and mix cultural references in a nonchalant way,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Lovers Rock, the reggae genre popular in London in the 70s and 80s, had an unexpected moment in the fashion spotlight on Sunday night at the capital\u2019s menswear shows. Grace Wales Bonner, a much-hyped designer who has dressed Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, dedicated her London fashion week collection to the music, and the scene that surrounded it more than 40 years ago. Lindley Hall, a grand building in equally grand SW1, was transformed into a homage to a youth centre. Guests including the artist Isaac Julien, the footballer H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and poet Wilson Oryema sat at round tables, and fruit punch and Jamaican patties were offered as refreshments. In the show notes provided, Wales Bonner explained that she was inspired, in part, by John Goto\u2019s photographs of second-generation British Caribbean and Asian young people at Lewisham youth centre for lovers rock parties. The soundtrack \u2013 put together by Jamie xx \u2013 was blasted out of speaker stacks, as it might have when these images were taken. The collection stuck close to the theme. It began with a crisp wool suit with a polo neck \u2013 a classically 70s combination, but with a minimalism that did away with any accusations of retro. Across women\u2019s and menswear, trenchcoats, knits, tracksuit trousers and donkey jackets followed, along with shirts printed with paintings by the British-Guyanese artist Frank Bowling. The red, gold and green of the Rastafarian flag were used on hats, vests and coats. All the clothes felt modern despite the references. This is one of Wales Bonner\u2019s strengths. While her references are so academic that she provides a bibliography for each collection, she is able to translate her area of historical interest \u2013 be it lovers rock, Howard University in the 60s, or the court dress of Haile Selassie \u2013 into clothes that people want to wear. After the show, Wales Bonner \u2013 a somewhat serene presence in the usually frenetic world of a fashion show \u2013 explained that the inspiration for this show had been, as she put it, \u201cinevitable\u201d because of its proximity to her own background, and her Jamaican father\u2019s experiences in London in the 70s. \u201cI was thinking a lot about people coming into community centres and creating their own parties,\u201d she said. \u201cI was looking at John Goto\u2019s Lovers Rock series and saw my family reflected in it.\u201d The 29-year-old designer saw a difference between that era and her own. \u201cI feel like there was an optimism and irreverence [then] which meant that you could sample and mix cultural references in a nonchalant way,\u201d she said. Wales Bonner\u2019s sterling work could perhaps encourage a new generation to do the same. Last year was a big one for Wales Bonner, starting with the curation of an exhibition at London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery in January. She also won the BFC/Vogue Fashion Fund prize \u2013 an investment of \u00a3200,000 \u2013 in May. The designer\u2019s pedigree is writ large in the company she keeps. The white coat-dress worn by the Duchess of Sussex to present her son in May was Wales Bonner\u2019s, and she collaborated with Christian Dior\u2019s Maria Grazia Chuiri on items for the megabrand\u2019s cruise collection in April.

The Argentina defender was part of the Manchester City team in 2011 that ended a trophy drought that had lasted more than three decades before being sent off in the shock 2013 FA Cup final defeat by Wigan so it is fair to say the 34-year-old has seen both sides of this famous competition. After an uncomfortable evening against opponents who were 39 places below them in the league pyramid, it was Zabaleta who settled West Ham\u2019s nerves 16 minutes from time before his fellow substitute Pablo Fornals added a second in injury-time. \u201cWe played with the respect the competition deserves,\u201d said Zabaleta. \u201cWe take it very seriously, which is why I\u2019m so pleased with the team.\u201d His manager clearly concurred, even mentioning that this season marks the 40th anniversary of West Ham\u2019s last FA Cup triumph. \u201cI\u2019ve been in one final before and I would love to get to another one,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cWe know the supporters would love to have a cup run but the Premier League is always at the forefront of our minds.\u201d The seriousness with which he is treating this competition was illustrated by making only three changes from the side that beat Bournemouth 4-0 in his first match since replacing Manuel Pellegrini. Issa Diop\u2019s return meant a switch to a three-man defence as their manager returned to a formation that served him well during his first spell in charge. The Gillingham manager, Steve Evans, grew up playing for Celtic Boys Club alongside Moyes and had kept in touch with his former team-mate as the pair have racked up the years in management. The 57-year-old\u2019s appointment at the end of last season means he has managed almost 1,000 games in English football, having previously guided non-league Crawley Town to the fifth round of the competition in 2010 when they were beaten by Manchester United. With his side unbeaten in seven matches in all competitions, Evans would have fancied his chances of causing another upset against opponents who were knocked out by AFC Wimbledon last season under Pellegrini and Wigan in 2018 under Moyes. West Ham dominated possession in the first half but still found themselves under concerted pressure from their all-action hosts, with Tom O\u2019Connor warming Lukasz Fabianski\u2019s gloves in the 18th minute after a series of corners. Felipe Anderson ended his 22-game goal drought against Bournemouth but the Brazilian was largely anonymous as the visitors struggled to find their rhythm in attack. A suspected hamstring injury to Ryan Fredericks just before half-time led to Zabaleta replacing him, with Sebastian Haller correctly having a goal ruled out for a foul in the buildup. Gillingham, looking to reach the fourth round again having knocked out Cardiff at this stage last season, sensed the chance of another Premier League scalp in front of a packed stadium. Moyes clearly was not impressed with his side\u2019s first-half performance and West Ham could have made amends for their slow start immediately after the restart when a clever ball from Anderson set up Haller, only for the Frenchman to balloon his shot well over the bar. Another effort that smacked off Jack Bonham\u2019s near post with the keeper beaten gave more encouragement to the pocket of away supporters in the temporary stand behind the goal. A blatant tug on Declan Rice\u2019s shirt by O\u2019Connor following a free kick from Robert Snodgrass somehow went unpunished by Andrew Madley but in the absence of VAR, no penalty was awarded. Moyes threw on Fornals in the hope of inspiring something from his side but it was Anderson who finally provided it, even if the goalscorer\u2019s identity was rather unexpected. A quick one-two between the Brazilian and Arthur Masuaku allowed the full-back to pick out Zabaleta at the far post and his shot squeezed past Bonham. Zabaleta was perhaps lucky to escape with a yellow card after going down easily in the penalty area and then arguing with Madley. The closest Gillingham came to forcing a replay was when Stuart O\u2019Keefe let fly from long range before Fornals gave the scoreline a more generous hue.",

The reason this is on TV is because at the time the fixtures came out it had potential banana skin written all over it. Since then, Manuel Pellegrini has shuffled through the West Ham exit door to be replaced by David Moyes. The Hammers have enjoyed a 4-0 win over Bournemouth in his sole match in charge since rejoining the club so it is an assignment that doesn\u2019t look as a dangerous now as it did when the draw was made. That\u2019s not to say this will be a cakewalk for the Hammers.

With Mr Pellegrini in charge I wasn\u2019t sure how much of a priority it would be for them; how strong they\u2019d be. How much he would think they could turn up and win. I wouldn\u2019t know his mindset but I know David Moyes\u2019s. He will want to win and want to progress. He will get them into a disciplined shape, working harder and smarter. I would say 100% West Ham will stay in the Premier League.

The Gills are in decent form too. They are unbeaten in seven and have only conceded three goals in those matches. The two sides have met four times in their history, between 2003 and 2005, when they were both in the second tier. Gillingham won one of those meetings, 2-0 at home.

      "bodyText": "And here is Ed\u2019s report: That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for your emails. Ed Aarons\u2019s match report will be here shortly. David Moyes speaks: \u201cAt half-time we told the players we needed to get more of the ball and try to play better. It was a very tough game \u2013 it wasn\u2019t easy. I didn\u2019t want to take any of the forward players off. I wanted us to be a threat. It was a tough place to come. The players showed great character and commitment and stuck together. We\u2019ve lost games like this in the past.\u201d Two Pablos scored the goals for West Ham. I\u2019m guessing that might be the first time to different Pablos have scored in an FA Cup tie. While we wait for the match report to arrive, take a look at some of the best photos from this weekend\u2019s FA Cup ties in this here Dozen: Declan Rice speaks: \u201cWe were really professional . We knew what they were going to throw at us. They treat throw-ins like corners. The old West Ham last season might have come here and lost this.\u201d The scorer of West Ham\u2019s first goal, Pablo Zabaleta, speaks: \u201cIt was my first goal in a West ham shirt which is something special. It took me two years,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt was a great feeling. It was a great performance and we played with a respect that this competition deserves. We have a great squad and great players and I\u2019m so pleased for the team.\u201d West Ham are into the fourth round. Gillingham put everything into that and made the Hammers battle more than they would have liked. It wasn\u2019t a pretty win but it was a professional one \u2013 and it\u2019s the second one of David Moyes\u2019s second coming at West Ham. All hail the Moyesiah. With everyone forwards, West ham break, Haller finds Anderson, who dribbles inside and squares it for Fornals to drill home with his left foot. Game over. 90+4 min: Gillingham win a free-kick on the halfway line after Diop clatters into Hanlan. the ball is launched into the box, where it is cleared to Marshall, whose shot is deflected out for a throw. 90+2 min: There are four minutes of injury time. Gillingham wallop a free-kick into the box from a deep area but Ogbonna towers above everyone to head clear. 90 min: It\u2019s a dangerous corner aimed at the penalty spot that Ogbonna springs up to head clear. But back come Gillingham. Ogilvie fires in a cross that the Hammers clear to the edge of the box, where O\u2019Keefe scuffs a shot wide. 88 min: There\u2019s some slick interplay between O\u2019Keefe and Jones on the edge of the West Ham box. the ball arrives at Charles-Cook\u2019s feet but he loses possession as he shapes to cross. But Gillingham come back again and win a corner \u2026 86 min: Ndjoli is on for Fuller as Gillingham make their last change. A moment later Marshall whips a threatening cross in from the right that Fabianski leaps off his line to collect. That was sharp goalkeeping again. 85 min: Ogilvie sends a long throw arrowing into the box but West ham clear. 83 min: West Ham clear Lee\u2019s outswinger but O\u2019Keefe\u2019s volleys back at goal. His effort is deflected on the way through and Fabianski gathers comfortably. He\u2019s had a solid game today. He\u2019s had to deal with an aerial bombardment and he\u2019s done it well. 82 min: Hanlan wins a corner after applying pressure on the right wing. Can they make it count? 81 min: Marshall is on for O\u2019Connor and Charles-Cook is on for Jakubiak. 79 min: Fornals tries to find the top corner after rushing on to a through-ball and taking the ball wide of Bonham. He spins and tries to curl the ball into the far corner but Ehmer leaps to head clear. A moment later Zabaleta is booked for dissent after falling in the box under pressure and going ballistic when a he doesn\u2019t get a penalty. There wasn\u2019t enough contact to warrant a spot-kick. 77 min: Evans probably needed to make another substitution before that goal. Gillingham were struggling to cover the yards after putting so much into the first 70 minutes. 75 min: Gillingham come rushing back at West Ham with Hanlan crashing a shot against the underside of the crossbar before looking up to see he was flagged for offside. Well, that was coming. Masuaku finds Anderson on the left before continuing his run into the box. Anderson plays a delightful little pass in behind the Gillingham defence to find Masuaku again. He cuts a cross back that Fornals swipes at and misses before Zabaleta thrashes home with a scrappy finish from 15 yards out. Bonham got a hand to it but couldn\u2019t keep it out. 71 min: O\u2019Keefe has dropped to the floor in need of treatment. Gillingham are visibly wilting. They\u2019ve put everything into this. And Rice is getting treatment for a cut above his left eye, too. I think lee caught him with an elbow while competing for a header a few moments ago. There was nothing malicious in the challenge \u2013 just a coming together. 70 min: Fornals is on in place of Snodgrass. 67 min: West Ham continue to dominate. Masuaku waltzes all of 50 yards forwards before popping the ball off to Haller on the edge of the box \u2026 but that man Tucker is in the way again and gets a vital touch. What a game he is having. 65 min: Snodgrass whips a lovely free-kick into the box towards Rice, who can\u2019t quite strertch to get a foot onto it and divert it into the goal. Rice is screaming for a penalty and the replay shows O\u2019Connor had a handful of his shirt and was holding him back. If VAR was at this game that would have been given as a spot-kick. But it\u2019s not, so I\u2019ll shut up. 64 min: Masuaku drills a crossfield ball from one side of the pitch to the other, where Zabaleta inexplicably miscontrols. \u201cThe Premier League, you\u2019re having a laugh,\u201d taunt the home fans. 63 min: Ogilvie is bundled over by Anderson in the corner and Gillingham survive another West ham attack. Steve Evans said he wanted his side to still be in the game after 70 minutes. They have seven more to go and then they will have fulfilled their manager\u2019s wish. 61 min: Anderson beats Lee for fun with some trickery on the left wing but his low cross is cleared. West Ham are playing with a bit of pizazz now and it\u2019s making for a much better game, mercifully. 59 min: Hanlan skips past Balbuena near the touchline but as he does so he takes the ball this far out of play. It was such a promising position too. 57 min: Lanzini has a shot at goal after a lovely give and go with Haller near the edge of the box. His shot took a deflection on the way through and lost some of its oomph. A moment later Bonham has to arc his back and claw away a cross from Zabaleta that was dipping beneath his crossbar. 55 min: West Ham are beginning to build a head of steam, partly because they are going long themselves now, instead of playing keep ball in defence for long stretches every time they get the ball. 53 min: Masuaku whips a ball into the near post, where Tucker is there again. This is the best performance by a Tucker since this. 51 min: Snodgrass barges into Hanlan 35 yards from goal. It\u2019s a Gillingham free-kick in a central position. Lee clips it to the back post, it\u2019s flicked back into the box towards Hanlan, but West Ham clear. 50 min: Tucker fails to get a clean connection on a header after West Ham punt the ball forwards. Haller rushes in behind him and clatters a shot against the near post from a tight angle. Oh S\u00e9bastien! 49 min: On the subject of that Haller miss, Ian Sargeant writes: \u201cThat missed by a metre for every million we paid for him.\u201d 48 min: West Ham win a corner but Snodgrass doesn\u2019t clear the first man. 46 min: Haller is sent racing through on goal after a lovely dink into his path from Anderson. He takes one touch and shapes to shoot before wedging a hopeless effort around 10 yards over as Bonham rushed out at him. That was truly shocking. 45 min: Things can only get better. Want to know what went on in the other FA Cup games today? Have a read of our round-up then: Please come back for the second half. It has to be better than the first one. 45 min: Hoof! Thwack! Oof! Ooyah! This is about as scrappy as it gets. The highlight of the past two minutes is Lanzini making a tackle. 43 min: Haller rolls the ball into the net \u2026 but he\u2019s offside. 41 min: Zabaleta replaces Fredericks in a straight swap at right-back. Zabaleta is only 34. In my mind he should be at least pension age. 39 min: Fredericks looks to have twanged his left hamstring as he tracked back. He won\u2019t run this off. 37 min: Ogbonna tries to skip past O\u2019Keefe on the left but the Gills midfielder clips his heels and West Ham have a free-kick on the left about 40 yards from goal. Lanzini clips a low one into Anderson at the near post but it bobbles and Anderson can\u2019t get his shot away under pressure. That was a clever little set piece. It was a disguised delivery. 34 min: Gillingham\u2019s midfield is giving it absolutely everything. They\u2019re closing down every inch of space and making West Ham play long balls towards Haller that Ehmer and Tucker are gobbling up. 32 min: It\u2019s not a classic this. I tell you what is a classic, though: Tomy Super Cup football. I rediscovered my 32-year-old version of the game over Christmas and cleaned it up for my kids. They think it\u2019s ace. They\u2019re right, it is. It\u2019s much better than Subbuteo. Discuss \u2026 29 min: Masuaku wins a corner after a jet-heeled burst up the left. Snodgrass curls in a delicious ball to the penalty spot but no West ham player is anywhere near it and Gillingham clear after watching it bounce. 28 min: Tucker is doing a very good job of handling Haller. He\u2019s only 20 and does not appear to be as tall as the big French striker but is using his body brilliantly to prevent Haller getting any joy on the turn. 27 min: The Hammers defender is back in the game sporting a brand new white shirt and no apparent injury. That was odd. He\u2019s a fast healer. 26 min: There\u2019s a stoppage as Balbuena appears to be oozing a bit of blood from some unspecified part of his face. I think he\u2019ll survive, though. 25 min: Snodgrass stands over the free-kick. But his attempted effort is curled straight into the wall. That was poor. Where\u2019s Dimitri Payet these days? 23 min: The corner is whipped into the near post where Hanlan deflects it at goal only to see Fabianksi make a smart save. A moment later Gillingham concede a free-kick 20 yards from goal after Haller wis clumsily brought down after a mix-up in Gillingham defence. 22 min: Balbuena is put under intense pressure by Hanlan, who briefly nicks the ball off the defender, who manages to get a foot in to concede a corner. 20 min: Ogbonna floats a ball down the left wing towards Anderson but it runs out of play. West ham\u2019s midfield has been anonymous so far. No one is showing for the ball. 18 min: Jakubiak dinks a little volley towards Hanlan, almost getting it over Diop, who leaps up and nods it out of the Gillingham forward\u2019s path around 25 yards from goal. Steve Evans will be delighted with the start his team has made. They haven\u2019t given West Ham any time to get going. 15 min: O\u2019Connor backheels it to Lee, but the little playmaker takes far too long to get his shot away, burying it into the onrushing wall. 14 min: Lee is dragged down by Rice after wriggling his way through with a skilful burst. This free-kick is in a very decent position, right of centre and 20 yards out. Lee and O\u2019Connor are standing over it \u2026 12 min: This one is curled in to the back post where it bounces once, causing mild panic in the Hammers defence, before being hoofed clear. It\u2019s not pretty on the eye this, but it is kind of hypnotic. 11 min: Jakubiak shows a clean pair of heels Balbuena and lys the ball off for Ogilvie on the overlap but his cross is blocked. It\u2019s another corner for the Gills. 9 min: The corner doesn\u2019t clear the front post. It\u2019s scrappy stuff this. It\u2019s like watching The Big Match in 1984. Just a collection of set pieces played out to a visceral soundtrack of roaring supporters. 8 min: The free-kick is walloped in to the back post where it\u2019s cleared for a throw-in. Ogilvie hurls it in Rory Delap-style and it\u2019s nodded out for a corner. This is uncomfortable for the Hammers. 7 min: The corner is overhit and cleared on the back post. A moment later Jakubiak is left in a heap on the floor near the touchline around 45 yards from goal. This is decent chance to get a good ball in. 6 min: Gilingham lump a long ball forwards which causes Ogbonna all kinds of trouble as the wind gets hold of it, forcing the defender to head across his own goal and out of play for a corner. He smiles wryly, but that was an awkward moment and he could have been left with cartoon pie on his face had he got the direction of his header wrong. 4 min: Snodgrass gifts possession to Gillingham in midfield. Jones pops the ball through to Jakubiak, but the striker\u2019s touch is heavy and West Ham regain possession. That was a good chance for Gillingham had his touch been even remotely decent. 3 min: Diop floats a long ball forwards. The muscular Haller tries to make a nuisance of himself but Tucker does a good job of holding him off and Gillingham clear. 2 min: It\u2019s drilled in at the near post, where West Ham hook it clear. 1 min: West Ham get the game under way. Gillingham, in blue, are kicking from right to left. West Ham, in their all white away kits, are kicking the other way. Gllingham win a corner almost immediately \u2026 All matches in the FA Cup third-round are kicking off a minute later than they would ordinarily to encourage fans to \u2018Take A Minute\u2019 to think about looking after their mental health. It\u2019s part of the Heads Up campaign and Barry Glendenning has written about it here: There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere at the Priestfield Stadium, where a crowd of around 11,000 are belting their songs out into the chilly evening air in Kent. And here come the teams \u2026 David Moyes speaks: \u201cI wanted to use the momentum [from the Bournemouth game]. I want everything to get better. It\u2019s a different game tonight though \u2026 the pitch isn\u2019t the same as what we\u2019re used to in the Premier League.\u201d And here\u2019s Gillingham manager Steve Evans: \u201cWest Ham are in town. I\u2019m surprised in how strong David has gone [with his team selection] but we\u2019re ready for it. Moyesy will know what he\u2019ll get from us and we know what we\u2019ll get from him. We grew up at Celtic together. We want to be in the Cup tie for 70 minutes and if we are I think David will be the more nervous manager.\u201d \u201cIs that Diop in midfield, or has Moyesy switched to a 3-4-3?\u201d asks Graeme Arthur. \u201cWas at the game on New Year\u2019s Day (brought my two young daughters over from France for their first experience of live football and they get to see a 4-0 thrashing - something I\u2019d never seen in all my years of intermittent attendance!) and my friend Iain opined that Diop in midfield would be a smart move.\u201d I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a 3-4-3 Graeme though we won\u2019t know for sure until we see them line up. A much-changed Liverpool team has beaten Everton 1-0 at Anfield. You can look in on the reaction to that with Simon Burnton\u2019s minute-by-minute report here \u2026 but be sure to come back to me afterwards. It\u2019s the Steve Evans show! Gillingham: Bonham, Fuller, Ogilvie, Tucker, Ehmer, O\u2019Keefe, Jones, O\u2019Connor, Lee, Hanlan, Jakubiak. Subs: Walsh, Hodson, Willock, Pringle, Marshall, Charles-Cook, Ndjoli. West Ham: Fabianski, Fredericks, Balbuena, Ogbonna, Diop, Masuaku, Rice, Snodgrass, Lanzini, Felipe Anderson, Haller. Subs: Roberto, Zabaleta, Reid, Sanchez, Fornals, Holland, Ajeti. Referee: Andrew Madley It\u2019s a strong West Ham side. Moyes makes just three changes to the side which beat Bournemouth 4-0 in his first match back in charge, and two of those were injury-enforced. Mark Noble and Aaron Cresswell were carrying knocks so Issa Diop and Arthur Masuaku come in, while Manuel Lanzini replaces Pablo Fornals. Alex Jakubiak comes in for Mikael Mandron in attack for Gillingham. Mandrom has just become a father and he\u2019s had hardly any sleep the past two nights, according to his manager. Hello! Let\u2019s be honest. The reason this is on TV is because at the time the fixtures came out it had potential banana skin written all over it. Since then, Manuel Pellegrini has shuffled through the West Ham exit door to be replaced by David Moyes. The Hammers have enjoyed a 4-0 win over Bournemouth in his sole match in charge since rejoining the club so it is an assignment that doesn\u2019t look as a dangerous now as it did when the draw was made. That\u2019s not to say this will be a cakewalk for the Hammers. They will likely field a rotated starting XI and Moyes\u2019s focus will be on making sure he keeps his squad fit and well to stay clear of any relegation trouble this season. Gills boss Steve Evans has admitted that Moyes\u2019s appointment has hit his side\u2019s chances of a Cup upset. \u201cI loved the draw when it came out,\u201d he said. \u201cWest Ham, one of the iconic London clubs, at the Priestfield with the television all over it, because they\u2019ve lost to lower-league clubs in the cups. With Mr Pellegrini in charge I wasn\u2019t sure how much of a priority it would be for them; how strong they\u2019d be. How much he would think they could turn up and win. I wouldn\u2019t know his mindset but I know David Moyes\u2019s. He will want to win and want to progress. He will get them into a disciplined shape, working harder and smarter. I would say 100% West Ham will stay in the Premier League. I doubted that when I left the London Stadium last week.\u201d If Gillingham do cause an Cup upset, their fans will likely have played a part in it. The Priestfield Stadium will be rocking as the locals try to terrify their illustrious visitors into making errors. The Gills are in decent form too. They are unbeaten in seven and have only conceded three goals in those matches. The two sides have met four times in their history, between 2003 and 2005, when they were both in the second tier.

      "body": "<p>The threats emanating from Twitter feeds and podiums in Tehran and Washington might suggest the moment for diplomacy has long passed, and some form of war between the US and Iran following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\">assassination of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\">Qassem Suleimani</a> is now inevitable.</p> \n<p>The only consideration that might hold the two sides back is the possible consequences. Tehran has tasted the unpredictability of Donald Trump and however much the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/us-and-allies-on-high-alert-as-iran-threatens-retaliation\">desire for revenge</a> beats in the hearts of Iranians, European leaders are pleading with Tehran\u2019s leadership, saying it has a responsibility to use its head and recognise any direct attack on US assets in the Middle East is likely to be met with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/donald-trump-vows-to-hit-52-sites-very-hard-if-iran-retaliates-for-suleimani-killing\">further escalation by Trump</a>.</p> \n<p>A number of European diplomats privately say it is notable that among the chants of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/huge-crowds-expected-in-baghdad-for-funeral-of-iranian-general-killed-by-us\">\u201cdeath to America\u201d</a>, some Iranian military leaders have spoken more cautiously about a response, stressing it will occur at a time and on a target of Iran\u2019s choosing. For the past year, Tehran has conducted attacks on the US and its allies through plausible deniability, using proxies and militias. A full-frontal assault on Washington by the Revolutionary Guards would be suicidal. The US has about 60,000 troops in the region, including about 5,200 in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Those sums may give diplomats the narrowest window of opportunity to try to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/qassem-suleimani-killing-may-spell-end-iran-nuclear-deal-europe-fears\">de-escalate the crisis</a>. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, is heading to the US on a pre-arranged visit and will press the White House to think more strategically about its involvement in the Middle East. Many in the Pentagon will be privately urging the same.</p> \n<p>The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has also invited the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to Brussels, and it is possible Tehran will take up the offer. The EU has been rightly criticised in the past for being insufficiently active in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>There are also lines of communication open to Tehran via Oman, Japan or through the Swiss embassy \u2013 the formal conduit for communications between Tehran and Washington.</p> \n<p>Iran may also calculate that it has political as well as military avenues to pursue for long-term advantage.</p> \n<p>It is already a posthumous victory of sorts for Suleimani that the Iraqi parliament has voted to support the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/anti-isis-coalition-suspends-operations-as-iraqi-mps-vote-to-expel-us-troops\">expulsion of US troops</a>. Many of Suleimani\u2019s years of political work in Iraq were spent trying to build up pro-Iranian forces, and Iran\u2019s politicians will press the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, to quickly enforce parliament\u2019s will. It speaks volumes that he felt compelled to take part in the tributes paid to Suleimani in Baghdad against a backdrop of anti-American slogans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eccd5566-094f-4b87-9a48-80f37da36215\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-x88HVir4qA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has claimed Iraqis responded to the assassination of Suleimani by dancing in the streets, but the assassination has weakened anti-Iranian forces in Baghdad, including the nationalist protesters in Tahrir Square opposed to Iran and the US using Iraq to fight out their geopolitical battles. </p> \n<p>Restraint by Tehran now might strengthen pro-Iranian factions in Iraq as fresh efforts are made to find a new prime minister. A more pro-Iranian mood may also sweep through other capitals in the Middle East as public opinion recoils at Trump\u2019s threats.</p> \n<p>It was notable for instance that Qatari leaders rushed to Tehran to convey their support, even though tens of thousands of US troops are stationed in Qatar. Equally, both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the two Gulf states closest to the US, have issued very cautious remarks about the killing of Suleimani.

      "bodyText": "The threats emanating from Twitter feeds and podiums in Tehran and Washington might suggest the moment for diplomacy has long passed, and some form of war between the US and Iran following the assassination of Qassem Suleimani is now inevitable. The only consideration that might hold the two sides back is the possible consequences. Tehran has tasted the unpredictability of Donald Trump and however much the desire for revenge beats in the hearts of Iranians, European leaders are pleading with Tehran\u2019s leadership, saying it has a responsibility to use its head and recognise any direct attack on US assets in the Middle East is likely to be met with a further escalation by Trump. A number of European diplomats privately say it is notable that among the chants of \u201cdeath to America\u201d, some Iranian military leaders have spoken more cautiously about a response, stressing it will occur at a time and on a target of Iran\u2019s choosing. For the past year, Tehran has conducted attacks on the US and its allies through plausible deniability, using proxies and militias. A full-frontal assault on Washington by the Revolutionary Guards would be suicidal. The US has about 60,000 troops in the region, including about 5,200 in Iraq. Those sums may give diplomats the narrowest window of opportunity to try to de-escalate the crisis. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, is heading to the US on a pre-arranged visit and will press the White House to think more strategically about its involvement in the Middle East. Many in the Pentagon will be privately urging the same. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has also invited the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to Brussels, and it is possible Tehran will take up the offer. The EU has been rightly criticised in the past for being insufficiently active in the Middle East. There are also lines of communication open to Tehran via Oman, Japan or through the Swiss embassy \u2013 the formal conduit for communications between Tehran and Washington. Iran may also calculate that it has political as well as military avenues to pursue for long-term advantage. It is already a posthumous victory of sorts for Suleimani that the Iraqi parliament has voted to support the expulsion of US troops. Many of Suleimani\u2019s years of political work in Iraq were spent trying to build up pro-Iranian forces, and Iran\u2019s politicians will press the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, to quickly enforce parliament\u2019s will. It speaks volumes that he felt compelled to take part in the tributes paid to Suleimani in Baghdad against a backdrop of anti-American slogans. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has claimed Iraqis responded to the assassination of Suleimani by dancing in the streets, but the assassination has weakened anti-Iranian forces in Baghdad, including the nationalist protesters in Tahrir Square opposed to Iran and the US using Iraq to fight out their geopolitical battles. Restraint by Tehran now might strengthen pro-Iranian factions in Iraq as fresh efforts are made to find a new prime minister. A more pro-Iranian mood may also sweep through other capitals in the Middle East as public opinion recoils at Trump\u2019s threats. It was notable for instance that Qatari leaders rushed to Tehran to convey their support, even though tens of thousands of US troops are stationed in Qatar. Equally, both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, the two Gulf states closest to the US, have issued very cautious remarks about the killing of Suleimani. Saudi Arabia stressed it had not been consulted about the drone strike in Baghdad. Full-throated support for the US would not only make these countries possible targets for Iran, but also inflame domestic opinion. Lines of communication, often indirect and faltering, have been opening between Iran and Saudi Arabia for months, and while it is too early to talk of a thaw, Tehran now has cards to play with Riyadh that it did not previously possess. There has rarely been a US president less capable of cultivating public opinion in the Middle East. The threat to destroy Iranian cultural sites will leave allies in the region queasy. Iran will also work the court of legal and public opinion over the legality of the drone strike that killed Suleimani. Even Raab did not quite condone Trump\u2019s actions, saying instead that he understood them and condemning Suleimani\u2019s efforts to destabilise the region. But Iran is not well suited to the moral high ground. The political mood will demand some form of retribution and response. The fifth and final step announced by Tehran away from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers includes ceasing to recognise any operational restrictions on its civilian nuclear programme. It also means an end to restrictions on centrifuges. Some will say Tehran\u2019s announcement marks the effective end of the nuclear deal, but by allowing continued independent inspections and not pushing the levels of uranium enrichment to 20%, the continuing European signatories to the agreement can still monitor Tehran\u2019s compliance. As such, it is possible to interpret Iran\u2019s position as wanting to engage with European nations and not put them in the same category as the US. But a new gesture by France, Germany and the the UK to keep the deal alive may be required. Tehran has persistently claimed European efforts to increase trade with Iran have been limited.

I want to hope the midden is intact, but unlike the prime minister I don\u2019t believe in miracles. The fires were too ferocious.\u201d You would be excused for thinking all influencers get paid for promoting products. Some do but many are actually paying businesses for the privilege. Micro-influencers exist across all interests and industries but one of the most prominent groups is mothers. Brands love them as they provide a niche channel for advertising without the exorbitant fees charged by celebrities. Listen Today in Focus looks back at the story of Freddy McConnell, a Guardian journalist and trans man who in 2016 decided to begin the process of conceiving and giving birth to his own child. Sport Australia remain on track to finish off a perfect season of Test cricket, going to stumps on day three at the SCG on 40-0 and leading New Zealand by 243 runs. That advantage owes much to Nathan Lyon, who claimed his 17th five-wicket haul to help dismiss New Zealand for 251 in their first innings. At Newlands, Dominic Sibley neared a century to put England in control against South Africa. On a sultry Sunday England\u2019s batsmen set to work as diligently as their bowlers had on Saturday. England lead by 264, with six wickets in hand. Liverpool have beaten Everton 1-0 in their FA Cup third-round tie, thanks to a wonder goal from 18-year-old Curtis Jones. Chelsea defeated Nottingham Forest 2-0. Media roundup The Australian highlights Scott Morrison\u2019s promise of millions for the bushfire crisis, while the Sydney Morning Herald focuses on the anger of NSW Liberals at a \u201cdisconnected\u201d Morrison over his handling of the fires. The Advertiser reports that as many as 25,000 koalas may have been killed in the Kangaroo Island fires, as the army reserve prepares to deploy to the island. Coming up Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, Russell Crowe, Toni Collette and Cate Blanchett are vying for Golden Globes at today\u2019s awards. Follow our live blog from mid-morning AEDT. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 They\u2019re little. They\u2019re women. And they\u2019re terrorising grown men everywhere, apparently.

One NEC source said they were likely to stick with rules thrashed out at Labour\u2019s 2018 annual conference, that will oblige candidates to win the backing of trades unions or local parties, as well as MPs. They may be given just days to secure the necessary 21 nominations from MPs and MEPs. Leading leftwing candidate Rebecca Long Bailey, who is an NEC member, will not attend the meeting, allies said, amid fears from rival camps of a conflict of interest if she took part. Campaigning stepped up on Sunday with most contenders making media appearances \u2013 though Long Bailey has so far confined her participation in an article in the Guardian calling for \u201cprogressive patriotism and solidarity\u201d. Friends said she had taken a break to spend time with her son over Christmas and the new year, but was preparing to launch her candidacy formally this week. Long Bailey\u2019s close friend Angela Rayner, who had been seen as a potential leadership candidate, will kick off her bid to become Labour\u2019s deputy leader with a speech in Stockport on Tuesday. As well as adjusting to Britain\u2019s imminent departure from the EU, the MPs jostling to succeed Corbyn have been setting out their analysis of the party\u2019s poor performance in last month\u2019s general election. Phillips said Labour\u2019s key problem during the campaign was that voters did not trust it to deliver on its ambitious promises, including free broadband for every household. \u201cThe fundamental thing is that the country didn\u2019t trust us to govern. It didn\u2019t trust us to deliver on what we were saying,\u201d she said. Asked what she thought when she saw the free broadband pledge, which was based on a plan to renationalise elements of BT, she said: \u201cWhat I thought was actually what I think lot of people thought, which was I wasn\u2019t sure how we were going to deliver that.\u201d Phillips also questioned whether the full list of nationalisations promised by the manifesto \u2013 which included mail, water and energy, as well as rail \u2013 should have been Labour\u2019s priority. On rail, she said the case had clearly been made; but in other areas, she said the party has to look to \u201chow those services can better serve the public, and nationalisation is one of those ways \u2013 but we have to make choices that people can trust that we will deliver\u201d.

The price of a barrel of Brent crude leapt to $68.60, up from $66.25 on Friday when the US launched its rocket attack against Suleimani and his convoy near Baghdad international airport. Analysts warned any retaliation could affect supplies of crude oil through the Strait of Hormuz, which is the world\u2019s busiest passageway for tankers carrying oil and natural gas. The 39km strait, which runs between the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, is the only route to the open ocean for over a sixth of global oil production and a third of the world\u2019s liquefied natural gas. Iran was blamed last June for supporting attacks that damaged two oil tankers and was also implicated in sabotage attempts against four other vessels a month earlier. Opec, the oil producers\u2019 cartel, has sought to increase the price of oil over the last year through a series of production cuts that it may need to reverse if the supply of oil and gas is hindered by attacks on shipping or oil production facilities. Oil prices, which have climbed steadily from $58 a barrel last October to $68 early last week, had been falling for several days before the attack.

      "bodyText": "Iran has announced that it will no longer abide by any of the limits imposed by the unravelling 2015 nuclear deal, and Iraq\u2019s parliament urged its leaders to expel troops from the US-led coalition, as the aftershocks of the assassination of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani reverberated through the Middle East. In a statement broadcast on state TV late on Sunday, the Iranian government said the country would no longer observe limitations on uranium enrichment, stockpiles of enriched uranium or nuclear research and development. But the statement noted that the steps could be reversed if Washington lifted its sanctions on Tehran. The announcement came hours after hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Iran to mourn Suleimani as his remains were carried through the cities of Ahvaz and Mashhad, ahead of a burial in his hometown on Tuesday. Mourners thronged Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second city, as Suleimani\u2019s coffin was paraded on a truck through the streets to the floodlit Imam Reza shrine, chanting, \u201cIran\u2019s wearing black, revenge, revenge\u201d and holding up portraits. The scale of the procession forced the cancellation of a Sunday night ceremony in Tehran, according to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, who urged citizens instead to attend a memorial at Tehran University on Monday. The Iraqi parliament\u2019s call to expel US troops was another clear sign of blowback from the assassination \u2013 and was quickly hailed by Suleimani\u2019s supporters as a major step towards one of his main goals. Though the Iraqi debate that called for the US exit is not binding, and would require a one-year notice period, the fact that the move was led by a prime minister regarded as a US ally showed just how divisive the killing has become, and how quickly US interests in the region could unravel as a result. Adel Abdul Mahdi, who stepped down as leader last November and now serves in an acting capacity, said \u201curgent procedures\u201d were needed to start a US exit, which he described as necessary to restore \u201cour national sovereignty\u201d. Abdul Mahdi said he had been due to meet Suleimani on the morning he was killed by a US Reaper drone on a road leaving Baghdad airport. \u201cHe was to come to me with a message from Iran responding to the message we delivered from Saudi to Iran,\u201d he added.

By 2040, people aged 50 and over are expected to be this sector\u2019s key consumer base.</p> <p>But despite their spending power, the industry\u2019s institutional ageism makes this powerful demographic feel like \u201cfrumps\u201d, the research found. Women older than 75 stop spending on fashion altogether, even though they have significant savings and say they are still interested in looking stylish, according to the findings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/aug/05/this-is-what-70-looks-like-the-new-generation-of-beauty-influencers\">\u2018This is what 70 looks like\u2019: the new generation of beauty influencers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Diane Kenwood, a ILC trustee, said: \u201cFor too long the fashion and beauty industries have been bewilderingly resistant to recognising just how fashionable and stylish the generation of older consumers are and want to remain.</p> <p>\u201cThe potential of these consumers is huge and it has been shamefully sidelined. I do, though, sense a shift in attitudes starting to stir, and I\u2019m hopeful that change will gather momentum.\u201d</p> <p>Older models have been increasingly used in advertising during the past decade, but it has never become the norm. In 2015, Phoebe Philo, creative director at Celine, chose then 82-year-old author Joan Didion to star in a campaign. Since then, Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren have modelled for L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Charlotte Rampling became the face of Nars lipstick, Joni Mitchell joined St Laurent, Lauren Hutton was brought onboard for Calvin Klein lingerie, and Julia Roberts became the face of Lanc\u00f4me.</p> <p>But although a lot of the big brands \u2013 including Gucci \u2013 appear to be increasingly age-inclusive in their advertising, the issue is still sensitive. Photographer and author Ari Seth Cohen is the creator of Advanced Style, a project devoted to \u201ccapturing the sartorial savvy of the senior set\u201d. He said the fashion industry was hampered by its fear of mortality.</p> <p>Cohen said: \u201cFashion and beauty brands have been ignoring their older customers for ages. Rather than trying to reach this savvy demographic, they prey on their insecurities and use fear and ageist propaganda to sell beauty products that promise the ridiculous and harmful ideology of \u2018anti-ageing\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cI have noticed a growing trend towards inclusion for older models and senior social media stars for more than a decade.

      "bodyText": "The fashion and beauty industry\u2019s \u201cshameful sidelining\u201d of older consumers could cost it \u00a311bn over the next 20 years, according to research by the International Longevity Centre (ILC-UK). Older people increased their spending on clothes and shoes by 21% \u2013 or \u00a32.9bn \u2013 between 2011 and 2018, according to the analysis. By 2040, people aged 50 and over are expected to be this sector\u2019s key consumer base. But despite their spending power, the industry\u2019s institutional ageism makes this powerful demographic feel like \u201cfrumps\u201d, the research found. Women older than 75 stop spending on fashion altogether, even though they have significant savings and say they are still interested in looking stylish, according to the findings. Diane Kenwood, a ILC trustee, said: \u201cFor too long the fashion and beauty industries have been bewilderingly resistant to recognising just how fashionable and stylish the generation of older consumers are and want to remain. \u201cThe potential of these consumers is huge and it has been shamefully sidelined. I do, though, sense a shift in attitudes starting to stir, and I\u2019m hopeful that change will gather momentum.\u201d Older models have been increasingly used in advertising during the past decade, but it has never become the norm. In 2015, Phoebe Philo, creative director at Celine, chose then 82-year-old author Joan Didion to star in a campaign. Since then, Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren have modelled for L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Charlotte Rampling became the face of Nars lipstick, Joni Mitchell joined St Laurent, Lauren Hutton was brought onboard for Calvin Klein lingerie, and Julia Roberts became the face of Lanc\u00f4me. But although a lot of the big brands \u2013 including Gucci \u2013 appear to be increasingly age-inclusive in their advertising, the issue is still sensitive. Photographer and author Ari Seth Cohen is the creator of Advanced Style, a project devoted to \u201ccapturing the sartorial savvy of the senior set\u201d. He said the fashion industry was hampered by its fear of mortality. Cohen said: \u201cFashion and beauty brands have been ignoring their older customers for ages. Rather than trying to reach this savvy demographic, they prey on their insecurities and use fear and ageist propaganda to sell beauty products that promise the ridiculous and harmful ideology of \u2018anti-ageing\u2019. \u201cI have noticed a growing trend towards inclusion for older models and senior social media stars for more than a decade. There have been numerous beauty and fashion campaigns featuring silver-haired models, but I don\u2019t think brands have quite figured out what their older customers want and how to reach them. \u201cOne huge shift that seems to be making a difference is the power of older women on social media and Instagram. Rather than needing to create content specifically geared towards older consumers, brands are beginning to approach a growing population of senior content creators to make more organic and believable sponsored posts and ads focused on their own micro-communities.\u201d In 2017, a group of models aged 47 and older protested at the opening of London fashion week against their lack of representation on the catwalk \u2013 although it was at her show there that Simone Roche cast three septuagenarians and a 50-year-old. Jilly Johnson, 65, who was one of the protest\u2019s organisers, said at the time: \u201cPeople seem to think that once you reach 40, you\u2019re not interested in clothes and you don\u2019t buy anything \u2013 but that\u2019s simply not true. A huge percentage of clothes are bought by older women \u2013 so fashion is making a huge mistake by ignoring that grey pound.\u201d",

Anderson was ruled out of last summer\u2019s Ashes as he recovered from a calf injury but his return of five for 40, including the final two South African wickets at the start of this third day, was his 28th five-wicket haul in Tests and takes him past Ian Botham\u2019s England record. It also helped dismiss the hosts for 223, giving Joe Root\u2019s team a 46-run first-innings lead that was extended to 264 by the end of a day the tourists closed on 218 for four in their second innings. Now 37, there were fears about the seamer\u2019s future when he struggled to return promptly from the injury to his right calf he sustained on the first day of last summer\u2019s opening Ashes Test against Australia at Edgbaston. The Lancashire bowler also missed the first tour of the winter to New Zealand before Christmas as England took a safety-first approach to his comeback. However, Anderson has proved here that he is back to his best and is loving playing for his country again. \u201cI sat down at the end of day two and that feeling is what I\u2019d missed: that proper hard day of Test cricket,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a real battle.

It makes all that hard work I\u2019ve put in and the frustration of missing three or four months worthwhile.\u201d There were also words of praise for Dominic Sibley, the opener who hit his maiden half-century in his fourth Test and who could go on to reach three figures on day four after he reached the close unbeaten on 85. \u201cWe\u2019ve not only seen that he has the ability to score runs in Test cricket but he\u2019s got the mentality to open the batting, and score big runs and stay at the crease for a long time,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been missing for a couple of years. Hopefully he\u2019s going to cement his place and will get confidence from this knock and go on tomorrow. More importantly, hopefully he can go on in his career in the next few years.\u201d On a good day for England there was some bad news when it emerged that Rory Burns, Sibley\u2019s opening partner who was ruled out of the rest of this series with an ankle injury sustained playing football on the eve of this Test, is also likely to miss the two-Test series in Sri Lanka in March. Burns will see a specialist this week to determine whether he needs surgery to repair ligament damage to his left ankle but England are expecting him to miss the last tour of the winter.",

      "bodyText": "Well that\u2019ll be all from me. Liverpool fans may want to know that the fourth round draw will take place tomorrow evening from 7.11pm GMT, live on, of all things, the competition\u2019s Twitter channel. The second half here was, in its way, as uplifting as any in the last couple of extraordinary seasons at Anfield. Here\u2019s another link to David Hytner\u2019s match report, and here follows a roundup of all things FA Cuply. Bye! \u201cI\u2019m reminded of an old Bill Shankly quote: \u2018There are two teams on Merseyside; Liverpool and Liverpool reserves.\u2019\u201d says Andrew Park. \u201cWhen Bill Shankly said the best two sides on Merseyside were Liverpool and Liverpool Reserves, I always assumed he was joking,\u201d writes Paul Griffin. God only knows the levels of gloating that will be witnessed on Merseyside over the next 24 hours. David Hytner\u2019s match report has landed: Curtis Jones knew exactly what he wanted to do and so did the whole of Anfield. It is one thing to think it and quite another to execute but that is precisely what the 18-year-old Liverpool midfielder did. Accepting the ball from Divock Origi on the edge of the Everton penalty area, to the left of centre, Jones shaped to bend a right-footed shot into the far top corner of the net. It arched in exquisitely, kissing the underside of the crossbar on its way down and in past Jordan Pickford for an added show-stopping touch, and the Liverpudlian had a first senior goal to savour. It deserved to be the winner and it was, as Jurgen Klopp\u2019s selection gamble paid off handsomely. Much more here: Everton didn\u2019t have a shot on target in the second half. Not one. The matchwinner, Curtis Jones, has a chat: I\u2019ve had a frustrating time, being on the bench and then getting a bit of a taste and then on the bench again, and there\u2019s times in my head I\u2019m begging to come on. Then I just try to go with it and show what I\u2019m capable of doing, and hopefully I\u2019ve topped it off with a good performance and a good goal. Adam Lallana says this is something the club\u2019s young players are just going to have to take on the chin: \u201cAt times it\u2019s frustrating because they\u2019re playing for the best team in the world, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d Everton should have taken control of this game in the first half, but Liverpool were exceptional in the second half. They didn\u2019t create a great deal, but when you can stick the ball in from there, and like that, it doesn\u2019t much matter. 90+4 mins: It\u2019s all over, and Liverpool\u2019s kids have put the club in round four! 90+3 mins: The ball is with Pickford. Thirty seconds to play. He lashes it forwards. Chirivella lashes it into the air. Suddenly neither team knows what to do with it. 90+1 mins: A shot! Sidibe crosses from the right, and Kean\u2019s waist-high volley flies high. 90+1 mins: There will be at least three minutes of stoppage time. Everton have the ball, but what they don\u2019t have is much of an idea what to do with it. 89 mins: As another Everton attempt to make any semblance of headway ends in disappointment and an offside Richarlison, here\u2019s a clip of the goal: 86 mins: Everton keep the ball for a bit but miles away from the Liverpool goal. Eventually Mina lumps it forward, and straight to Adrian. 85 mins: The period since the goal has been a tale of pure humiliation for Everton, who can\u2019t lay a glove on Liverpool\u2019s juniors and reserves. 82 mins: A billion Liverpool passes and then Oxlade-Chamberlain curls a 25-yard shot too close to Pickford. 81 mins: The only thing stopping Everton from coming back into this game is the fact they can\u2019t get a kick of the ball. 79 mins: Substitutions for both teams: Everton bring Bernard on for Walcott, and Liverpool bring 19-year-old Rhian Brewster on for 16-year-old Harvey Elliott. 78 mins: Everton win a corner, which Adrian unconvincingly flaps away to the edge of the area, from where Schneiderlin blasts another rubbish shot into the stands. 77 mins: The BBC treat us to a few more replays of that goal. It just gets better and better. The slower the replay, the more you get to see every revolution of the spinning ball, the closer to perfection it seems. 74 mins: Jones, pushed forward towards the left wing since Minamino\u2019s substitution, does more good work before offloading to Oxlade-Chamberlain, who cuts into the box and shoots towards the near post, where Pickford saves. 73 mins: That\u2019s just phenomenal. From the edge of the area Curtis Jones sends an absolute cracker of a shot curling and dipping over Pickford and in at the far post! 71 mins: Pickford claims a corner and sends an instant clearance upfield in a manner that suggests imminent counter-attack, but it\u2019s too strong, and Adrian collects. 70 mins: Minamino comes off, and Oxlade-Chamberlain on. The new player\u2019s movement has been good, but he has had little joy at centre-forward. 69 mins: A long spell of Liverpool pressure ends with Origi taking a shot from way out which bounces awkwardly in front of Pickford, who has to push it away. 67 mins: Walcott runs through on the right, with Kean and Richarlison to his left, but his pass to your-guess-is-as-good-as-mine is awful. Throw-in. 63 mins: Everton make a double substitution. Sigurdsson is replaced by Fabian Delph, and Moise Kean comes on for Seamus Coleman. 62 mins: Liverpool are dominating possession in this half, but still can\u2019t carve out a decent chance. 59 mins: Another corner, and Chirivella sends an excellent delivery into the heart of the penalty area, but it\u2019s cleared. Everton try to break, but Walscott goes down over Larouci\u2019s tackle. The referee waves play on, but with their player clutching his leg Everton boot it into touch. 57 mins: Digne pulls Elliott back by the shoulder, and is booked. 55 mins: Everton win a corner now, which Sigurdsson curls towards the near post. Mina meets it, and I think it was a decent chance if he\u2019d only hit it with his head. Instead he misses it completely and it bounces off his back and away. 54 mins: Chirivella seems to be on set-piece duty for Liverpool this half (Harvey Elliott was in charge in the opening period). A good free-kick leads to a less-good corner, which is cleared. 52 mins: Williams, probably Liverpool\u2019s outstanding player so far along with Lallana, drives a 30-yard shot goalwards, but it\u2019s a straightforward save for Pickford. 50 mins: If Everton don\u2019t win this they should just give up on away derbies altogether. They\u2019d be better off playing 37 games a season, their players feeling just that little bit fresher and their fans just that little bit less savage disappointment. Liverpool get down the right, but the cross is rubbish and Pickford picks it up. 47 mins: Everton have the first shot of the second half, Sidibe chesting down to Schneiderlin, who curls his shot over the bar from just outside the area. 46 mins: Richarlison has kicked off, and Everton have tonked a long ball straight into touch. The players are back out, and Richarlison ready to kick off. Deep breath everyone. 45+3 mins: And that\u2019s all for now! It\u2019s been a fine game, equal in most respects except goalscoring opportunities. Everton have certainly had three of those, and should be well ahead. However, evidently, they\u2019re not. 45+2 mins: One last first-half chance for Everton! Walcott bursts down the right, with only Williams inside and an easyish pass to Richarlison available, but his ball is too high and by the time the Brazilian controls it there are plenty of defenders back. Then a few moments later a cross from the right grazes Richarlison\u2019s forehead! 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time we go, and there\u2019ll be about two minutes of it. 43 mins: It looks like Minamino is spending a bit more time on the right and Origi a bit more in the middle, and this is all good for Liverpool\u2019s chances. 41 mins: Another save, this time from Pickford! Origi, on the right side of the area, jigs this way and that before sliding a shot towards the far post which was on its way in before Pickford fingertipped it just wide! Replays suggest Origi was offside, but VAR doesn\u2019t check corners and anyway this one is cleared. 38 mins: Now Calvert-Lewin sends a low shot from the edge of the D skimming just wide. Sidibe, free to his right, is nonplussed. 38 mins: Adrian comes for the second corner, gets nowhere near it, and Mina flicks it across goal and wide of the back stick. 37 mins: An Everton cross is headed behind for a corner, which is headed behind for another. \u201cNever mind why J\u00fcrgen is playing the kids,\u201d writes Peter McCann, \u201cI am wondering why Liverpool are playing in half red and half white socks. They did this at Leicester but were back to all red against Wolves. Is there a worldwide shortage of Liverpool red strapping?\u201d This is a fair and important question. 34 mins: Liverpool make inroads into the Everton penalty area! It\u2019s an Origi cross, right-footed from the left, and it looks to be dipping towards Minamino\u2019s head only for Minamino to fail to head it! 33 mins: Jones collects a throw-in on the left, spins, heads infield and lashes a low shot wide of the near post. Liverpool are making no inroads into the Everton penalty area, but are having the occasional shooting chance from outside it. 31 mins: Walcott crosses from the right, and Calvert-Lewin dives for the header but can\u2019t get enough on it, the ball brushing the top of his head on its way past! 28 mins: Richarlison steals the ball from Minamino with an excellent tackle. He may have just missed a very good chance, but otherwise he\u2019s been doing a fine defensive job, playing deep on the left. 27 mins: Another Adrian save! Walcott pulls back a low cross from the right, and Richarlison sprints from far post to near to reach it first and turn it goalwards, but again Adrian saves with his legs! That\u2019s three excellent chances for Everton, and the Liverpool goalkeeper has been in the right place every time. 26 mins: From a half-cleared corner, Wiliams\u2019 shot is deflected wide. The referee doesn\u2019t spot the deflection, though, so it\u2019s a goal kick. 24 mins: An excellent spell from Liverpool, featuring another fine Neco Williams cross and ending when Holgate comes across to cut out the ball as Lallana bursts into the box. 20 mins: Lallana\u2019s 20-yarder curls well wide. Meanwhile Richarlison, collateral damage in a perfectly-timed Nathaniel Phillips challenge a couple of minutes back, seems to be limping a bit. 17 mins: Holgate lifts a pass through to Walcott, but it\u2019s overhit. The visitors do look the side most likely at the moment, but there\u2019s not a lot in it. 14 mins: Neco Williams curls in a fabulous cross from the right. It\u2019s cleared just before Origi reaches it, but still, top crossing. 12 mins: Another Adrian save! Everton win a free-kick on the right, and as Sigurdsson curls it into the area somehow there are five blue shirts and only two in red tracking them. Holgate is the one who reaches it first, and it\u2019s a fabulous chance that he heads straight at the keeper! 9 mins: Milner was the defender who got back to pester Walcott and stop him from having an easy chance, but it seems he pulled a muscle in doing so. Yasser Larouci, the 19-year-old Algerian, replaces him. 7 mins: Now Milner is down and shaking his head, and has already passed on the captain\u2019s armband. Clearly he feels his game is over. 6 mins: Save! The ball is played through to Walcott, and though it bounces unkindly and he\u2019s unable to bring it under control it is deflected back to Calvert-Lewin, whose low, hard shot from 15 yards hits Adrian\u2019s legs! 4 mins: Now Liverpool win the ball with a bit of intense pressing, but when it\u2019s crossed from the right it bounces under Origi\u2019s boot and out of play on the other flank. 3 mins: Digne volleys a cross from the left that is a bit too ferocious for Sidibe to control as he bursts unmarked into the box. 2 mins: There was much talk pre-match of Everton playing a back three, with Coleman as the right-sided centre-back. However, they\u2019ve started with a four. 1 min: Peeeeeeep! They\u2019re off! Minamino\u2019s first touch for Liverpool sends the ball rolling back to Joe Gomez. Liverpool are attacking the Kop in the first half. The players are on their way out. The ground looks packed and sounds raucous. Could Everton finally end their Anfield hoodoo this afternoon? We\u2019re about to find out! Carlo Ancelotti has also submitted to a BBC interrogation: It\u2019s exciting. For me it\u2019s a first derby, so I\u2019m excited. The competition is really important also. I know how the supporters love this competition. We are trying to move on, to play a good game, to give happiness to our supporters, so we have a lot of motivation for this game. I think we have to be focused to play a good game, to play to win. They have made a lot of changes, they have their reasons and we have to be focused on our game. I\u2019ve tried just to put some new ideas on the pitch, some new ideas on training, but nothing special. In football there are no secrets. Sometimes, some managers want to complicate it but honestly it\u2019s an easy life, and it should be an easy life also for the players. Jurgen Klopp has a chat with the BBC: We don\u2019t really think about how the other derbies have been, all completely different, different manager on the other side especially which makes a big difference. You never get a guarantee, but we see there\u2019s a bit opportunity and it\u2019s what we want to show. I saw the line-ups of Chelsea for example and they made nine changes but I was like, \u2018That\u2019s a nice line-up!\u2019\u201d Ours is obviously not that experienced, that\u2019s clear, but we trust the boys 100%. What I want from today is a team who is 100% excited about the opportunity. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any team in world football who wants to play this game more than this team today. And Lallana and James Milner want to play football at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning or at midnight, whatever, they always want to play football, and all the other guys, for them it\u2019s a big, big opportunity and I really like that. If one or two things don\u2019t work out it\u2019s my responsibility, simple as that, so I hope they feel that freedom and go for it. Hello everyone, Simon here, stepping in for the remainder of this one. With Liverpool obviously focusing in different directions, this is a fabulous opportunity for Everton to bank their first Anfield win since the mesolithic era, but there\u2019s enough talent in the home ranks to make it more than interesting. Everton, meanwhile, will likely not have forgotten being dumped out by their rivals at the same stage, in the same stadium, two years ago. That was Virgil van Dyke\u2019s debut, and as such the beginning of a new era at Anfield. They will be glad not to have to face the Dutchman today, but less pleased about the presence of Divock Origi, who has five goals in four outings in this fixture. That said, they\u2019ll surely fancy themselves to bloody their neighbours\u2019 noses here, especially under a manager who has one more FA Cup on his CV than Jurgen Klopp. Ancelotti\u2019s refusal to grant Moise Kean a rare start ahead of the in-form duo Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison is a declaration of intent: Everton are here to win. Of course, Liverpool\u2019s young lads have already been given a taste of top-level football with that absurd, seesawing penalty shootout win against Arsenal earlier in the season. That was magnificent entertainment all round, but not the sort of performance you\u2019d want to be replicating too often. This fixture comes with the added pressure of being a notoriously spicy derby fixture under the lights, so cool heads will be required. Well then. A bit of a pick-and-mix selection from Jurgen Klopp, who has entrusted senior players like James Milner and Adam Lallana to help coach the likes of Neco Williams and Curtis Jones (both 18) through the game. The pick of Liverpool\u2019s youngsters, though, is winger Harvey Elliott \u2013 yet all eyes will be on debutant Takumi Minamino, who\u2019ll be looking to replicate his lively recent Champions League performances against, er, Liverpool. As for Everton, Carlo Ancelotti has picked a much stronger lineup, and that striking partnership of Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin \u2013 who have scored a goal a game between them over December \u2013 will be hoping to get some joy against a Liverpool backline continuing two youngsters. Gylfi Sigursson, too, will surely be looking to sneak into space behind a Liverpool midfield that features no holding player of any real pedigree. Liverpool: Adrian; Milner, Gomez, Phillips, Williams; Lallana, Chirivella, Jones, Elliott; Minamino, Origi. Subs: Kelleher, Mane, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Brewster, Hoever, Larouci. Everton: Pickford; Mina, Holgate, Coleman, Digne; Sigurdsson, Schneiderlin, Sidibe, Walcott; Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Stekelenberg, Baines, Keane, Delph, Bernard, Davies, Kean.",

      "body": "<p>Anti-abortion campaigners are increasingly targeting students at UK universities, where there has been a rise in the number of anti-abortion societies on campus and demonstrations by outside groups displaying graphic imagery.</p> <p>The campaign has gathered momentum on the back of a continuing debate about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/27/safe-spaces-used-to-inhibit-free-speech-on-campuses-inquiry-finds\">freedom of speech</a> in universities. Some student unions have been threatened with legal action if they attempt to prevent anti-abortion groups opening on campus.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/abortion-pro-life-choice-student-societies-universities-free-speech-a9160671.html\">There have been reports</a> that there are now at least 14 anti-abortion societies in university students\u2019 unions around the UK, many of which have faced fierce opposition from students who are overwhelmingly pro-choice.</p> <p>Most recently there have been a series of demonstrations by anti-abortion campaigners outside Cardiff University, which have prompted counter-protests by some students. The rise in tensions followed a vote by the students\u2019 union to adopt an official pro-choice stance, in common with other universities.</p> <p>Isadora Sinha, a postgraduate student of bioinformatics at Cardiff, proposed the motion which gained overwhelming support when put to a vote in November. Since then there have been at least three anti-abortion protests outside the university, organised by the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK (CBR UK), which recently targeted the pro-choice Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/23/stella-creasy-anti-abortion-groups-launch-fresh-attack-on-pregnant-labour-mp\">Stella Creasy</a>.</p> <p>There have been anti-abortion societies at Cardiff students\u2019 union before, but in October a <a href=\"https://thetab.com/uk/cardiff/2019/10/30/there-is-a-new-pro-life-society-at-cardiff-uni-this-year-44081\">new </a><a href=\"https://thetab.com/uk/cardiff/2019/10/30/there-is-a-new-pro-life-society-at-cardiff-uni-this-year-44081\">anti-abortion society</a> opened called Cardiff Students for Life. Its website encourages members to get involved with the wider anti-abortion movement through events such as the annual March for Life and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/08/anti-abortion-activists-harassing-women-at-uk-clinics-during-lent\">\u201c40 days of life\u201d vigils outside clinics</a>.</p> <p>Sinha said she and other pro-choice activists had received online threats from external parties following the vote and had been in virtual hiding for two weeks. \u201cThe motion was written in a way to ensure free speech and expression for those who are pro-life and the pro-life society can function as before.

      "bodyText": "Anti-abortion campaigners are increasingly targeting students at UK universities, where there has been a rise in the number of anti-abortion societies on campus and demonstrations by outside groups displaying graphic imagery. The campaign has gathered momentum on the back of a continuing debate about freedom of speech in universities. Some student unions have been threatened with legal action if they attempt to prevent anti-abortion groups opening on campus. There have been reports that there are now at least 14 anti-abortion societies in university students\u2019 unions around the UK, many of which have faced fierce opposition from students who are overwhelmingly pro-choice. Most recently there have been a series of demonstrations by anti-abortion campaigners outside Cardiff University, which have prompted counter-protests by some students. The rise in tensions followed a vote by the students\u2019 union to adopt an official pro-choice stance, in common with other universities. Isadora Sinha, a postgraduate student of bioinformatics at Cardiff, proposed the motion which gained overwhelming support when put to a vote in November. Since then there have been at least three anti-abortion protests outside the university, organised by the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK (CBR UK), which recently targeted the pro-choice Labour MP Stella Creasy. There have been anti-abortion societies at Cardiff students\u2019 union before, but in October a new anti-abortion society opened called Cardiff Students for Life. Its website encourages members to get involved with the wider anti-abortion movement through events such as the annual March for Life and \u201c40 days of life\u201d vigils outside clinics. Sinha said she and other pro-choice activists had received online threats from external parties following the vote and had been in virtual hiding for two weeks. \u201cThe motion was written in a way to ensure free speech and expression for those who are pro-life and the pro-life society can function as before. Unfortunately, there has been backlash against this motion passing despite it having passed by a democratic vote by hundreds of students.\u201d Students\u2019 unions at universities including Birmingham, Nottingham, Aberdeen and Strathclyde have been forced to lift bans against anti-abortion groups when faced with possible legal challenges over free speech. An organisation called the Alliance of Pro-Life Students (APS) supports students to set up their own anti-abortion societies. It encourages them to affiliate with their students\u2019 unions in order to gain access to facilities, resources, students\u2019 union funding and training opportunities.

      "bodyText": "I read Martin Kettle\u2019s article (The questions Labour must face if it is ever to win again, Journal, 2 January) with interest and agree that Labour has to reconfigure as a matter of urgency, probably at the pivotal time when Johnson\u2019s over-optimistic government starts losing its electoral kudos in the dreary, gloomy days of winter. I must admit that my failing spirits revived at the news that Keir Starmer has found early favour with Labour members. I too find him a credible putative leader who can maybe unite the party and forge a sustainable way forward. But Kettle is correct that there were many factors in this electoral defeat \u2013 one was obviously the navel-gazing over Brexit which managed to alienate leavers and remainers in equal measure. He is right, too, that the old Labour base has now gone, but paradoxically its relevance is needed more than ever. It must stop going round in self-indulgent circles and address the problems this country will face in spades this decade, a time that has already been much-vaunted by the nation\u2019s favourite showman, Boris Johnson.

      "bodyText": "Elizabeth Warren has suggested Donald Trump ordered the drone assassination of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani to distract the American public from his own impeachment, taking the country \u201cto the edge of war\u201d for his own political purposes. \u201cWe know Donald Trump is very upset about this upcoming impeachment trial,\u201d the Massachusetts senator and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cBut look what he\u2019s doing now. He is taking us to the edge of war.\u201d Observers were quick to say Warren was accusing Trump of \u201cwag the dog\u201d tactics, meaning an attempt to distract public attention by launching a military strike. A 1997 film satire starring Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman used the phrase as its title and similar charges were levelled against Bill Clinton in 1998, when he ordered strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan while embroiled in the scandal which led to his own impeachment. Trump ordered the strike against Suleimani, which happened in Baghdad on Friday. It followed a rocket strike in Iraq that killed an American contractor and wounded US troops, US airstrikes in response and a siege of the US embassy in Baghdad by Iranian-backed militias. On Sunday Iran called Trump a \u201cterrorist in a suit\u201d and told US media outlets retaliation would hit US military targets. Warren told CNN\u2019s State of the Union it was \u201creasonable\u201d to ask if the strike was meant to be a distraction, \u201cparticularly when the administration, immediately after having taken this decision, offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what\u2019s going on. \u201cThere was a reason that he chose this moment, not a month ago, not a month from now, not a less aggressive, less dangerous response.\u201d Echoing the terms of the articles of impeachment, Warren accused him of using foreign policy or \u201cwhatever he can to advance the interests of Donald Trump\u201d. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer told ABC\u2019s This Week the evidence for an \u201cimminent\u201d Iranian attack provided by the administration after the Suleimani strike was \u201cvery unsatisfying\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the reasons that it had to be done now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem very clear. The documents they sent us last night\u201d \u2013 notification of the strike as required by the War Powers Act of 1973 \u2013 \u201cis very unsatisfying as to that, even though I can\u2019t talk about it because the whole thing is classified.\u201d In Washington, House speaker Nancy Pelosi is withholding articles of impeachment from the Senate, in the hope of forcing concessions over the rules of Trump\u2019s trial. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell has said Trump will not be convicted and removed and said he is co-ordinating closely with the White House. Moderate Republicans who Democrats hope will pressure McConnell to call witnesses potentially damaging to the president show little sign of shifting but Pelosi has placed Trump in constitutional limbo, the third president to be impeached but not yet the third to be acquitted. The articles of impeachment concern abuse of power, in the withholding of military aid from Ukraine amid pressure for investigations of Trump\u2019s political foes, and obstruction of Congress. Warren told NBC: \u201cThe administration can\u2019t keep its story straight and in the case of Ukraine, it was all about protecting Donald Trump\u2019s skin. We know that Donald Trump was very upset about this upcoming impeachment trial, but look what he\u2019s doing now. He is taking us to the edge of war. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at war for 20 years in the Middle East and now, he\u2019s talking about expanding that war. This has been something that has cost thousands of American lives. It has cost us enormously in many ways both at home and around the world and at the same time, look what it\u2019s done to the Middle East \u2013 millions of people who\u2019ve been killed, who\u2019ve been injured, who\u2019ve been displaced. \u201cThe job of the president is to keep us safer. The job of the president is not to move us to the edge of war.\u201d Senior Democrats backed Pelosi, whose tactics could push Trump\u2019s trial into February, when the presidential primary will be in full swing. The speaker, Schumer said, \u201chas said that she will send the articles of impeachment when she believes she can \u2013 she will maximize sending them to get the fairest trial possible. If she had sent them right away, McConnell could have well just voted for dismissal the day before or after Christmas. \u201cNow, in the last two weeks, where we haven\u2019t had the articles, lots of new evidence that bolsters our case for witnesses \u2013 for witnesses and documents \u2013 has come out. So the bottom line is very simple. We need the truth, not a coverup, not a sham, not to have some nationally televised mock trial where there\u2019s no evidence.\u201d Asked how long Democrats might be willing to hold the line, House intelligence chair Adam Schiff told CNN: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be indefinite, no \u2026 The desire is to get a commitment from the Senate that they\u2019re going to have a fair trial, fair to the president, yes, but fair to the American people.\u201d Schiff said holding back the articles had the effect of \u201cflushing out senators\u201d. \u201cWithholding the articles has thus far flushed out where Mitch McConnell is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s required senators to go on record..\u201d The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, poured cold water on Democratic hopes. Speaking on Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, Graham called Pelosi\u2019s move as a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d and threatened to \u201cchange the rules of the Senate so that we can start the trial without her if necessary\u201d. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the articles this week,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we need to take matters into our own hands\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The otherwise excellent article about the current popularity of singing in choirs (All together now, G2, 3 January) fails to mention a crucial choral tradition that is very much alive and well. There are many choirs around the UK whose repertoire comprises radical and protest songs, both old and new, drawing attention to prevailing political and social ills and celebrating past triumphs and neglected champions. My own choir, Red Leicester, can frequently be heard in Leicester and beyond singing at events where power is questioned and held accountable. It is also a proud member of the Campaign Choirs Network, a UK-wide affiliation of like-minded choirs who join together at national protests and gatherings to provide a choral backdrop to the events themselves. In these politically uncertain times, their vocal contribution is more valuable than ever. Martin Pennington Leicester \u2022 The benefits of group singing are fully appreciated in Norfolk. Since 2004 a therapeutic activity for staff and patients at a local mental health hospital has grown into the charity Sing Your Heart Out (SYHO), which runs free, drop-in singing workshops across the county. More than 150 people weekly come to professionally led daytime sessions promoting mental wellbeing through group singing in harmony. Inclusive and non-judgmental, SYHO provides a lifeline for many vulnerable people: they connect with others through singing, and contribute to something that is powerful and uplifting. Arts-based activities, including singing, offer multiple physical and mental benefits yet are so often expected to fund and sustain themselves, relying on grants, donations and dedicated volunteers. If only those in power would properly recognise and value of this work in practical, meaningful ways.

Arquette, who is best known for appearing alongside Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan, added: \u201cThe justice system works in a way ... people can get out of criminal behaviour, and we\u2019re praying that that doesn\u2019t happen and that justice is served.\u201d Rose McGowan, another of Weinstein\u2019s most well known accusers, has decided not to attend the trial fearing it will be too traumatic. She said: \u201cI also have to focus on what\u2019s healthy mentally for me and seeing him is extremely difficult.\u201d McGowan has accused Weinstein of raping her over 20 years ago and destroying her career; charges he also denies. Weinstein has denied all wrongdoing and all accusations. McGowan said: \u201cI had body flashbacks for years when I would see and receive photos of him or if I saw him in person, I would lean over and throw up in a trash can and my body remembered, you know, things that my brain wanted to silence.\u201d McGowan said seeing Weinstein face criminal charges \u201cwill speak volumes to people in the world that have been hurt. And I hope it gets justice for the women involved. Personally, I have justice. My justice might just look different than that.\u201d She added that if Weinstein is found guilty of even one charge, \u201cit\u2019s a victory, but it\u2019s also a victory to still be standing after all this damn time. It\u2019s also a victory to spread the news to other survivors, that is not our shame. It\u2019s also a victory to basically have him as the face of rape for all time.\u201d On Monday, the judge will outline the schedule for proceedings for a trial that is expected to last up to two months. Jury selection is due to begin later on Monday or Tuesday. The Los Angeles district attorney\u2019s office is considering whether to bring charges in eight separate cases against Weinstein while Scotland Yard continues to investigate allegations of misconduct.",

Dr Jonathan Boyle, the UK\u2019s top vascular surgeon, had warned West Suffolk NHS trust, the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s local hospital, that patients at risk of dying from burst aneurysms were not being safely monitored. An IT glitch meant that patients were not followed up to see how soon they would need potentially life-saving surgery. A doctor at the trust, however, says it initially repeatedly refused to take any action, raising further questions about its management. The trust initially suggested the problem was the result of senior doctors not keeping up with emails, but later accepted its IT systems were at fault. The hospital was forced to recognise that patients were potentially put at risk and took action only after a whistleblower alerted the NHS regulator. The Bury St Edmunds hospital is already at the centre of claims of bullying and intimidation after it demanded medical staff take fingerprint tests in an effort to identify a whistleblower who raised the alarm about potentially botched surgery with the family of a patient who died under its care. It has offered a partial apology to staff and agreed to reflect on its tactics after the Guardian revealed its extraordinary response to an anonymous letter a member of staff sent to the patient\u2019s widow. Responding to the new claims, the hospital acknowledged problems had occurred with its vascular surgery services and confirmed that an investigation was under way, but insisted that no patients had been harmed. The issue involves the monitoring of scans of patients with aneurysms. Scans are conducted to detect signs of growth in case surgery is required to prevent a life-threatening rupture.

      "bodyText": "The California congresswoman Maxine Waters has become the latest US politician to be fooled by Vladimir \u201cVovan\u201d Kuznetsov and Alexey \u201cLexus\u201d Stolyarov, Russian pranksters alleged to have ties to security forces. In a 10-minute phone call carried out late last year and posted to the prankster\u2019s YouTube page this week, the senior Democrat thinks she is speaking to the 17-year-old Swedish climate crisis protester Greta Thunberg as part of a series called Stars Save the Earth. Posing as Thunberg\u2019s father Svante, Stolyarov tells Waters the pair are in North Carolina to discuss a threatened island called \u201cChongo-Chango\u201d. Waters praises Thunberg for making \u201cquite a big, big, big, big thunder on this issue\u201d. Stolyarov also promises to tell Waters something \u201cconfidential\u201d about the famous moment when Thunberg crossed paths with Donald Trump at the United Nations climate summit in New York in September. A Thunberg impersonator says: \u201cIt is terrible what Trump is doing. I can\u2019t eat or sleep when I see him on TV. It was terrible to meet him at the UN building. I have nightmares about it.\u201d She then details a supposed exchange with Trump, though in fact the encounter only involved Thunberg staring at Trump as he passed by. According to the pranksters\u2019 version of the event, Trump told Thunberg: \u201cYou\u2019ll never achieve your goals, like those congressional fools who accuse me. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth: I really wanted to push the Ukraine president to put my competitor on trial. And he will go to trial with you, with [a bunch of] Democrats. \u2026 I would have a separate cage for all of you.\u201d Waters takes the bait, responding: \u201cOh my God, he mentioned the Ukrainian president?\u201d Offered an audio recording of Trump\u2019s remarks, Waters says Democrats are working towards an impeachment case, a signal that the call took place before hearings into Trump\u2019s approaches to Ukraine were held in Washington in November. \u201cIf the public knew he talked to Greta like that,\u201d Waters says, \u201c\u2026 that will go against him, too.\u201d In a statement to the Washington Post, Waters, who in fact has the dubious distinction of twice being taken for a ride by the Russian pranksters, dismissed the latest episode. \u201cThis was just another stupid prank,\u201d she said, \u201cby the same Russian operatives who have targeted many US elected officials, including Adam Schiff, Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell and John McCain, and international heads of state such as Emmanuel Macron. The end.\u201d It seems unlikely, however, that she will be the last such victim. Kuznetsov and Stolyarov have been at work since 2014, trolling figures including Elton John and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. US politicians have been regular targets, strengthening claims the Russian pair are connected to political interference programs backed by the Kremlin. The pranksters\u2019 calls sometimes come with the offer of false but potentially compromising information. According to the Atlantic, a 2017 call to Schiff \u2013 the Democrat who last year led the impeachment inquiry as chair of the House intelligence committee \u2013 was supposedly from Andriy Parubiy, speaker of Ukraine\u2019s parliament, and came with an offer to provide nude photos of Trump. \u201cWe will try to work with the FBI to figure out, along with your staff, how we can obtain copies,\u201d Schiff reportedly responded. A spokesperson for the Californian congressman told the Atlantic they immediately suspected the call was not genuine and informed law enforcement. Still, on the opening day of the impeachment hearings, Trump ally Devin Nunes used the Schiff call to accuse Democrats of seeking compromising material on the president. \u201cIt might be time to ask yourself if you\u2019ve gone out too far on a limb,\u201d Nunes said. Kuznetsov and Stolyarov deny ties to Russian security. \u201cWe work for ourselves, for nobody else,\u201d Stolyarov told the Guardian in 2016.",

And it raises the question: what other outrageously sexist decisions are being made by out-of-touch judges behind closed doors?</p> <p>The woman in the above case was so horrified at the judge\u2019s finding that she challenged it via appeal. Unlike in a normal family court hearing, appeals are heard in public, and findings can be openly reported.</p> <p>It is only because of this tiny chink in the family justice system\u2019s protective shield that we are able to glimpse inside Judge Tolson\u2019s courtroom, and see such attitudes for what they are.

      "bodyText": "When is rape, you know, real, proper rape? Shockingly, in our family courts, it seems it\u2019s only when you put up a fight and have the injuries to show for it. Never mind that you might clearly not consent to sex but in the end submit, terrified of what might happen if you were to actively resist. In one recently reported case in the family courts a woman had complained to the court that she was a victim of domestic violence and had been raped. Judge Robin Tolson ruled that because the woman had taken \u201cno physical steps\u201d to stop the man from raping her, \u201cthis did not constitute rape\u201d, and consequently ruled against her. Legally speaking, this means that when it comes to that same judge deciding whether or not, say, it is safe for a father to have contact with his child, claims of sexual violence will not be taken into account. Because, in the eyes of the court, that rape simply didn\u2019t happen. The fact that the family law system in this country is hidden behind a veil of secrecy means that these offensively vintage attitudes to rape and domestic violence can persist in courts that tens of thousands of separating couples must pass through every year. And it raises the question: what other outrageously sexist decisions are being made by out-of-touch judges behind closed doors? The woman in the above case was so horrified at the judge\u2019s finding that she challenged it via appeal. Unlike in a normal family court hearing, appeals are heard in public, and findings can be openly reported. It is only because of this tiny chink in the family justice system\u2019s protective shield that we are able to glimpse inside Judge Tolson\u2019s courtroom, and see such attitudes for what they are. The usual level of secrecy in the family courts stifles investigation and reporting of what goes on. I am typically contacted several times a week by women who say family judges have not taken their evidence of domestic abuse seriously. These women, often mothers fearful of the man they say abused and sometimes raped them, are without question retraumatised by a system presided over by some judges who have simply not accepted a modern understanding of what is and is not domestic abuse or sexual assault. Women point particularly to difficulties in proving coercive control, a dangerous pattern of abusive behaviour that can indicate a risk of homicide. Coercive control is now a criminal offence; but in family courts, I am repeatedly told, judges are reluctant to name it, even if they find that emotional and psychological abuse has occurred. Not only that. Women say that judges can even agree domestic abuse has occurred but not consider it serious enough to protect the victim and child from what we now know to be its damaging continuing effects: an abusive ex can easily continue their controlling behaviour throughout many years of court-ordered contact with a child. If it were \u201cjust\u201d scores of women telling me that this is happening, then these allegations would be exactly that: allegations. However, I recently sat through days of evidence in a family court case involving claims of domestic abuse and a dispute around child contact arrangements. The judge in that case made it clear he is unlikely to publish a judgment, and it is therefore unlikely at this stage that he will agree to allow the media to publish any part of what went on in court. But I can say that I emerged from that courtroom astonished, dismayed and alarmed for very similar reasons to those that prompted the woman described above to appeal against a different judge\u2019s findings about what constitutes rape. In the year ending March 2019, more than 58,000 allegations of rape were made to police in England and Wales. It is an uncomfortable fact that many women are forced to have sex without their consent within relationships. It may be inconvenient for a family law system that operates on the principle that children are better off having contact with both their parents to acknowledge this truth. But surely any judge who grasps the mechanisms and psychological effects of coercive control should understand that you don\u2019t need to be physically forced, there don\u2019t need to be bruises, and you don\u2019t need to scream, in order for it to be rape. This is 2020, not 1920. Society has moved on. So have the criminal courts, which are open to scrutiny and would be instantly challenged should any barrister or judge articulate such archaic attitudes. Unless you have the courage and the cash to go to appeal, however, the family courts are essentially unaccountable to the public they serve. Thanks to one of the most senior judges in the land coming firmly down on the side of the woman in the Judge Tolson case, she won her appeal. But it may well feel like a hollow victory. She will now have to relive every aspect of her evidence of domestic abuse and sexual assault at a new fact-finding hearing. This will be in front of a different judge.

Applications are made by leaving a comment on the ad. Some mothers apply because they want discounted products, others want a modelling career for their children and to be noticed by large brands that actually pay for posts. Nutt has seen the intensity and competition that exists, in a trend she likens to a \u201cmodern-day beauty pageant\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Crystal Abidin, a digital anthropologist and senior research fellow at Curtin University, says the research indicates many people \u201cwho take this pathway of being brand reps have aspirations to become \u2018mummy bloggers\u2019 or [paid] influencers\u201d.

Through brand repping Nutt has \u201cmet some incredible women and formed great friendships with them\u201d.</p> <p>While most of the work of brand repping takes place on Instagram, the community connects through Facebook. Friends are made when reps interact in busy and vibrant Facebook groups, where they exchange advice and help each other improve their profiles.

      "bodyText": "Between high-profile lawsuits and calls for more regulation, the world of \u201cinfluencer marketing\u201d has garnered plenty of attention. Some influencers hold a celebrity-like status with hundreds of thousands, even millions, of followers. Brands pay to have their products featured in influencers\u2019 posts because anyone with a large enough audience has the power to charge for advertising. But there are \u201cmicro-influencers\u201d too: everyday people who still rave about products publicly but only have a few thousand followers. Micro-influencers exist across all interests and industries, but one of the most prominent groups is mothers. The Australian \u201cbrand rep\u201d community consists of thousands of mothers who connect with each other through social media. They take photos of their children in clothing or with toys, post them to their Instagram profiles and let brands use the images in advertising. Most of these micro-influencing mothers don\u2019t receive payment. Brands love them as they provide a niche channel for advertising without the exorbitant fees charged by celebrities. In fact, many brand reps are actually paying businesses for the privilege. Kim Nutt, a mother whose one-year-old son models for brands, says \u201cthere\u2019s a very big misconception that a lot of brand reps get heaps of free product and paid for their posts. Ninety per cent of the time you\u2019re actually required to make monthly purchases.\u201d \u201cWhen we first started I naively took on way too much; I bought so much stuff I didn\u2019t need, I repped for brands I didn\u2019t really love.\u201d Brands advertise rep positions to this community through social media. Applications are made by leaving a comment on the ad. Some mothers apply because they want discounted products, others want a modelling career for their children and to be noticed by large brands that actually pay for posts. Nutt has seen the intensity and competition that exists, in a trend she likens to a \u201cmodern-day beauty pageant\u201d. Dr Crystal Abidin, a digital anthropologist and senior research fellow at Curtin University, says the research indicates many people \u201cwho take this pathway of being brand reps have aspirations to become \u2018mummy bloggers\u2019 or [paid] influencers\u201d. They may want to \u201cgroom some sort of public persona or small business. It could be their desire to form communities ... them being the leaders\u201d. Mothers in the Australian brand rep community also speak of another emotional pull that keeps them involved long-term: new friends. Through brand repping Nutt has \u201cmet some incredible women and formed great friendships with them\u201d. While most of the work of brand repping takes place on Instagram, the community connects through Facebook. Friends are made when reps interact in busy and vibrant Facebook groups, where they exchange advice and help each other improve their profiles. Brand reps increase their Instagram followers by following each other, using hashtags such as #brandrepsearchau and #ausbrandrepsearches. This leads to ongoing conversations too. Amye Byars is a mother and Facebook group manager. She speaks to her \u201crepping girlfriends\u201d more than her own family most days.

His call-up for the tour of New Zealand earlier this winter followed a summer when he was the leading run-scorer in Division One of the County Championship, scoring five centuries along the way, including two doubles. Tellingly, it was not just the volume of runs Sibley amassed but the way he got them \u2013 facing 1,009 more balls than any other batsmen in the top tier of the Championship. A strike-rate of 41.6 in first-class cricket \u2013 by comparison, Alastair Cook\u2019s is 50.7 \u2013 has raised concerns about whether Sibley has the game to truly prosper at Test level. Yet his second innings in this match has shown he certainly has the mental fortitude. Speaking before his Test debut against New Zealand at Mount Maunganui in November, Sibley spoke about his approach, saying: \u201cOpening the batting is tough at the start so you\u2019ve got to face balls for it to get easier. It\u2019s something that I sort of try to build my game round \u2013 to play to my strengths, get through the new ball and cash in when it gets easier for that.\u201d That\u2019s something Sibley did here as he upped his scoring rate in the final session, with one shot \u2013 punching Kagiso Rabada through the covers for four to move on to 48 \u2013 particularly eye-catching. Such shots would not have been possible for Sibley during the end of his time at Surrey, when his form fell off a cliff. But work with the freelance batting coach Gary Palmer, who has also helped Cook and Ian Bell, led him to remodel his technique and the runs have since flowed. A more open stance, to prevent him from falling towards the off-side, and hitting straighter has helped unlock the potential that was evident in 2013 when Sibley, aged 18 and 21 days, become the second-youngest English player, behind only WG Grace, to hit a first-class double hundred. That high point against Yorkshire was followed by a trough, as so often happens with young players. Yet Sibley\u2019s time at Surrey was hugely beneficial given that as a teenager he shared a dressing room with Ricky Ponting and Graeme Smith, now South Africa\u2019s acting director of cricket. Both were generous with their time and knowledge to the young Sibley and allied to that reworking of his technique in recent years, he is reaping the benefits on the biggest stage of all.",

On a sultry Sunday in a country where, bizarrely, cloud cover can seem to deaden the playing surface, England\u2019s batsmen set to work as diligently as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/04/england-south-africa-second-test-day-two-match-report\" title=\"\">their bowlers had</a> on Saturday.

Dominic Sibley, at 24, may have many younger peers in this particular team, but this is only his fourth Test match and it is the first time that he has delivered an innings of significance. Joe Root, at the other end for two and a half hours, was looking on admiringly as Sibley batted like a pragmatic old pro, which is exactly what he has been hired to do. Given that Rory Burns is unlikely to be fit to tour Sri Lanka, Sibley may even be considered the senior opener now. He was unbeaten on 85 at the close.</p> <p>Root was the impish presence in a partnership of 116 in the final session, which is also a source of some relief. Every team functions better when their captain is scoring runs and Root is forever under scrutiny. On this tour he has batted fluently every time he has come to the crease and he is the classiest batsman in both teams but this is the first time he has passed the half-century mark in this series. It took him only 81 balls. However, he will probably regard the fact that he departed 10 minutes before the close for 61 as a failure. This also triggered a king pair for Dom Bess, the nightwatchman, who tends not to do things by halves. He was caught down the leg side from the last ball of the day.</p> <p>Despite the loss of those two late wickets this was England\u2019s day. It began pretty well as Jimmy Anderson had Kagiso Rabada caught behind the wicket from the first ball. So a hat-trick beckoned with a No 11 batsman on strike but Anrich Nortje calmly shouldered arms to a ball wide of off-stump.</p> <p>Nortje would not be such an obstacle this time. South Africa added only eight more runs before he edged to Ben Stokes at second slip off Anderson.</p> <p>This was Anderson\u2019s 28th five-wicket haul in Test cricket, which is one more than Ian Botham achieved and therefore the most by any Englishman. At the same moment Stokes by taking the chance became the first English fielder \u2013 as opposed to wicketkeeper \u2013 to take five catches in a Test innings.</p> <p>Perhaps even more important than this little stash of records, England had a first innings lead of 46, South Africa having lost their last seven wickets for 66.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c0c0eba5abb5827473ac36b22d9da9f85457a68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c0c0eba5abb5827473ac36b22d9da9f85457a68/0_153_3499_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Anderson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Anderson celebrates dismissing Kagiso Rabada with the first ball of the day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Halden Krog/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now England\u2019s openers set about improving their career-best scores. Zak Crawley made 25 from 35 balls and hit five fours, all off the meat of the bat; so here was just a glimpse of what he can offer; he has a forthright approach, the capacity to time the ball sweetly and an awful lot to learn.</p> <p>The ease with which he dispatched some over-pitched deliveries was striking but then he was tempted once more by Rabada and edged to the keeper.</p> <p>His departure prompted a deceleration in England\u2019s progress. Some might argue that the afternoon session was quite a good advert for four-day Test matches since one wicket \u2013 the first to fall in the middle session during the match \u2013 was taken for 57 runs in 28 overs. In a five-day contest a slow session does little to harm the chances of victory. The rate was inevitably stalled when Keshav Maharaj, the left-arm spinner, opted to bowl over the wicket and into the rough outside the right-handers\u2019 leg stump. Most of the time Sibley, understandably, presented a broad left pad to counter this form of \u201cattack\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Spin\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact Sibley progressed slightly more quickly than Joe Denly, who would deliver yet another thirty. There was a time when an England upper-order batsman being regularly dismissed in the thirties was regarded as a heinous sin. Nowadays any misgivings are tinged with a certain relief that someone in the top three has got that far. For the moment Denly prompts more gratitude than exasperation for hanging in there against the new ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/05/test-cricket-four-day\">Lopping a day off Test matches \u2013 just how insecure does cricket now feel? | Emma John</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this instance Denly was dismissed when Nortje began to explore the middle of the pitch. He hooked and the top edge was well held by Dwaine Pretorius at long leg. By then England were 155 runs ahead and Joe Root was in no mood to spend the rest of the afternoon kicking away deliveries from Maharaj. In fact England\u2019s captain reverse swept a boundary from the first ball he received from the left-arm spinner, a bold statement of intent, which hinted that he has not yet been worn down by the rigours of captaincy. He did not pause to consider the flak he might receive if an ugly top edge had ensued. Instead he was going to seize the initiative.</p> <p>Root\u2019s urgency seemed to help Sibley, who clipped two consecutive deliveries from Pretorius for four; there were boundaries on the offside as well as the leg and all the while his defence was secure. He looked comfortable and at home out there, a rare combination in English opening batsmen of recent vintage. It does not matter a bit that he is unlikely to excite the aesthetes. This felt like a watershed innings, though perhaps one should remember that in recent times this conclusion has been reached about a string of openers who are no longer required beyond county level.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dominate two days in a row and a Test match victory is on the horizon. On a sultry Sunday in a country where, bizarrely, cloud cover can seem to deaden the playing surface, England\u2019s batsmen set to work as diligently as their bowlers had on Saturday. The upshot is that England are in a commanding position at Newlands; they lead by 264 with six wickets in hand. Even better, an architect of England\u2019s second innings is one of the new boys. Dominic Sibley, at 24, may have many younger peers in this particular team, but this is only his fourth Test match and it is the first time that he has delivered an innings of significance. Joe Root, at the other end for two and a half hours, was looking on admiringly as Sibley batted like a pragmatic old pro, which is exactly what he has been hired to do. Given that Rory Burns is unlikely to be fit to tour Sri Lanka, Sibley may even be considered the senior opener now. He was unbeaten on 85 at the close. Root was the impish presence in a partnership of 116 in the final session, which is also a source of some relief. Every team functions better when their captain is scoring runs and Root is forever under scrutiny. On this tour he has batted fluently every time he has come to the crease and he is the classiest batsman in both teams but this is the first time he has passed the half-century mark in this series. It took him only 81 balls. However, he will probably regard the fact that he departed 10 minutes before the close for 61 as a failure. This also triggered a king pair for Dom Bess, the nightwatchman, who tends not to do things by halves. He was caught down the leg side from the last ball of the day. Despite the loss of those two late wickets this was England\u2019s day. It began pretty well as Jimmy Anderson had Kagiso Rabada caught behind the wicket from the first ball. So a hat-trick beckoned with a No 11 batsman on strike but Anrich Nortje calmly shouldered arms to a ball wide of off-stump. Nortje would not be such an obstacle this time. South Africa added only eight more runs before he edged to Ben Stokes at second slip off Anderson. This was Anderson\u2019s 28th five-wicket haul in Test cricket, which is one more than Ian Botham achieved and therefore the most by any Englishman. At the same moment Stokes by taking the chance became the first English fielder \u2013 as opposed to wicketkeeper \u2013 to take five catches in a Test innings. Perhaps even more important than this little stash of records, England had a first innings lead of 46, South Africa having lost their last seven wickets for 66. Now England\u2019s openers set about improving their career-best scores. Zak Crawley made 25 from 35 balls and hit five fours, all off the meat of the bat; so here was just a glimpse of what he can offer; he has a forthright approach, the capacity to time the ball sweetly and an awful lot to learn. The ease with which he dispatched some over-pitched deliveries was striking but then he was tempted once more by Rabada and edged to the keeper. His departure prompted a deceleration in England\u2019s progress. Some might argue that the afternoon session was quite a good advert for four-day Test matches since one wicket \u2013 the first to fall in the middle session during the match \u2013 was taken for 57 runs in 28 overs. In a five-day contest a slow session does little to harm the chances of victory. The rate was inevitably stalled when Keshav Maharaj, the left-arm spinner, opted to bowl over the wicket and into the rough outside the right-handers\u2019 leg stump. Most of the time Sibley, understandably, presented a broad left pad to counter this form of \u201cattack\u201d. In fact Sibley progressed slightly more quickly than Joe Denly, who would deliver yet another thirty. There was a time when an England upper-order batsman being regularly dismissed in the thirties was regarded as a heinous sin. Nowadays any misgivings are tinged with a certain relief that someone in the top three has got that far. For the moment Denly prompts more gratitude than exasperation for hanging in there against the new ball. In this instance Denly was dismissed when Nortje began to explore the middle of the pitch. He hooked and the top edge was well held by Dwaine Pretorius at long leg. By then England were 155 runs ahead and Joe Root was in no mood to spend the rest of the afternoon kicking away deliveries from Maharaj. In fact England\u2019s captain reverse swept a boundary from the first ball he received from the left-arm spinner, a bold statement of intent, which hinted that he has not yet been worn down by the rigours of captaincy. He did not pause to consider the flak he might receive if an ugly top edge had ensued. Instead he was going to seize the initiative. Root\u2019s urgency seemed to help Sibley, who clipped two consecutive deliveries from Pretorius for four; there were boundaries on the offside as well as the leg and all the while his defence was secure. He looked comfortable and at home out there, a rare combination in English opening batsmen of recent vintage. It does not matter a bit that he is unlikely to excite the aesthetes. This felt like a watershed innings, though perhaps one should remember that in recent times this conclusion has been reached about a string of openers who are no longer required beyond county level.",

They will take a lead of 264 into the fourth morning with Sibley still there on 85. He has been immense, combining first with Denly for 73 then Root for 116 through the afternoon and evening sessions. The skipper went on the counterattack from the moment he arrived, keeping the board ticking over to transfer the pressure straight back onto the Proteas after Nortje won a top edge from Denly when hooking not long before tea. The young opener has 15 runs to collect to post his first ton with the lower-middle order by his side, the visitors very well placed to set South Africa a hefty fourth-innings target. For the hosts, though, they will go to bed knowing that England collapse better than any team in world cricket. They shouldn\u2019t, and won\u2019t, give up.</p> <p>Right, that\u2019s it for me.

He gets through the first ball with a nice straight bat, to the cheers of the Barmy Army. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/01/dom-bess-second-chance-test-cricket-england-south-africa\">As far as Somerset are concerned, he is a legitimate all-rounder. </a><strong> </strong>Oooi, Pretorious finds that crack for a second time in the over going over the head of de Kock, via his outstretched glove, for a bye. He keeps the strike, which is a good outcome when you send a nightwatchman out there. They should get two more overs in. <br></p> <p>As Nasser notes on Sky and techology confirms, had the wicket-taking delivery not hit the crack it would have tracked straight into the middle of Root\u2019s bat.

This is wrong on two main counts. One, because it will have the opposite effect: South Africa would start shutting up shop about now and go ultra defensive in a 4 day game. But, secondly, it misunderstands its audience. Many people look to test cricket as an antidote to the pace of modern life (see also the success of yoga). I actually conducted the original research for the ECB back in 2001 which led to 20:20\u2019s introduction. The supposition was that people were getting bored of cricket: the research showed they weren\u2019t. They just wanted to watch a game which didn\u2019t take all day when they should be with their family and they could get to after work. 20:20 was in many ways a necessary compromise for them.\u201d</p> <p>Great point about yoga and slowing down life in a world resembling a perpetual motion machine. There\u2019s probably a column in that. Mind if I pinch it, mate?</p> <p>\u201cI hear tell that Sophie Winkleman has been married into the royal family,\u201d reports Petra Dangle.

When the spinner misses his length, he\u2019s straight onto the pull shot, to the man at deep backward square. du Plessis takes <em>an age</em> to set his field for the one delivery remaining at Sibley as Maharaj goes back over the wicket and the crowd are giving him some grief about it.

Guess who the batsman in Test history is who was the most consistent, as measured by the group of scores compared to his final batting average? Greg Matthews! The caveat was that the player had to have an average of 30, or something, so to rule out tailenders. I told him this a couple of years back and it is fair to say he was thrilled with this fact. <br></p> <p>I see you were talking about University Challenge before I arrived.

South Africa and England are perfect dance partners. In the last 28 years, since South Africa\u2019s readmission to Test cricket, they have been as evenly matched as any teams in the world: 15 wins to England, 16 to South Africa and four series victories apiece. </p> <p>Usually, contrasting styles make for the best fights. With these two, it\u2019s the similarities - quality seam bowling, lively pitches, an unusual mixture of toughness and insecurity - that have made the matches so compelling. One team rarely gets away from the other, particularly in the first innings, and that has led to many lowish-scoring minor classics: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/12/the-spin-england-south-africa-1994\">The Oval 1994</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/04/england-south-africa-1998-the-spin\">Headingley 1998</a>, <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/12465/scorecard/534227/england-vs-south-africa-3rd-test-south-africa-tour-of-england-2012\">Lord\u2019s 2012</a>.</p> <p>And, perhaps, Cape Town 2020. South Africa will resume on 215 for eight, a deficit of 54, after a terrific bowling performance from England - and an even better catching display from Ben Stokes - on the second day. Not for the last time, the bowlers rescued the batsmen from the stocks.</p> <p>On a dry wicket, a first-innings lead would make England strongish favourites to level the series. But we should assume the square root of bugger all until those last two wickets are taken. The Ghost of Cape Town past, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/image/372131.html?object=43919;dir=next\">in this case an apparition of a frog in a blender</a>, is a reminder that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/09/englandvsouthafrica2008.englandcricketteam3\">an exemplary bowling performance can quickly be undone.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T08:18:09.957Z\">at 8.18am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here is the report from today. Sibley has shown what he can do. A good day for Jimmy. England\u2019s day. By any measure. They will take a lead of 264 into the fourth morning with Sibley still there on 85. He has been immense, combining first with Denly for 73 then Root for 116 through the afternoon and evening sessions. The skipper went on the counterattack from the moment he arrived, keeping the board ticking over to transfer the pressure straight back onto the Proteas after Nortje won a top edge from Denly when hooking not long before tea. The young opener has 15 runs to collect to post his first ton with the lower-middle order by his side, the visitors very well placed to set South Africa a hefty fourth-innings target. For the hosts, though, they will go to bed knowing that England collapse better than any team in world cricket. They shouldn\u2019t, and won\u2019t, give up. Right, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks for your company throughout this absorbing afternoon. I\u2019ll be back with you at 11pm tonight for the fourth day at the SCG and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning, as always, from Newlands. Until then, bye! Yep, he\u2019s gloved it alright! Nortje ensures that South Africa end their day on a high with wickets in the final two overs. Bess has bagged a pair but it could be argued that he has done his job as nightwatchman in a quirky kind of way. Stumps! 79th over: England 218-4 (Sibley 85) HAS BESS BEEN CAUGHT DOWN THE LEGSIDE OFF THE GLOVE? The decision on field is not out but Faf has signalled for DRS. Stand by! 78th over: England 218-3 (Sibley 85, Bess 0) Bess walks out as the nightwatchman with eight minutes on the clock, Stokes taking his pads off in the dressing room. He picked up a half century in this role against Pakistan in his most recent Test Match but he is walking out this time on a King Pair here, of course. He gets through the first ball with a nice straight bat, to the cheers of the Barmy Army. As far as Somerset are concerned, he is a legitimate all-rounder. Oooi, Pretorious finds that crack for a second time in the over going over the head of de Kock, via his outstretched glove, for a bye. He keeps the strike, which is a good outcome when you send a nightwatchman out there. They should get two more overs in. As Nasser notes on Sky and techology confirms, had the wicket-taking delivery not hit the crack it would have tracked straight into the middle of Root\u2019s bat. Keep that in mind when reflecting on the skipper\u2019s dismissal. He batted exceptionally well. Caught at slip! Completely against the flow of play, Pretorious locates the crack just outside the off-stump and also finds the edge of the England skipper, taken by his counterpart at first slip. The end of an excellent partnership. 77th over: England 217-2 (Sibley 85, Root 61) Oh, so they were just swinging Maharaj around to replace Nortje. It makes no difference though - both batsmen feel as though they have the spinner\u2019s measure as we near stumps. Root doesn\u2019t let him settle, immediately taking two through a reverse sweep. He finishes the over with that same unorthodox stroke, but he plays it so well. 12 minutes to go. \u201cFollowing the OBO in snowy Sweden, keep the sunshine coming.\u201d Thanks for being part of it, Julian Menz. \u201cFirst of all, I imagine I speak for all us Poms when I say that we send our best wishes to those in your country affected by the fires. The closest I have been to Australia is working in a pub in Earl\u2019s Court, but, despite certain sporting differences, there is a \u2018love that dare not speak its name\u2019 between our countries.\u201d There is - well said. And thank you. \u201cBack on topic, I once faced Corrie Van Zyl (spelling?) as a schoolboy when my father had a contract in SA. Terrifying, just glad it wasn\u2019t Alan Donald.\u201d If I had a cricket time machine, one of the places I would visit is Edgbaston in the late 1980s to watch Donald in the era before he was playing international cricket. 76th over: England 212-2 (Sibley 85, Root 57) Pretorious not Philander gets the job following Maharaj, who has been given a breather. But he only works if he can dot up an end at 120-125kph, and he hasn\u2019t achieved that in this over with Root cutting two and Sibley steering a couple more behind point. 111 is now the partnership, for those into the old English cricket superstition. \u201cEverybody spent the first two days of this match saying how the wicket was breaking up and would be well nigh unplayable in the later stages,\u201d writes Chris Young. Good point! There were plenty yesterday. \u201cAnd now look! How many will England need to be sure of not losing? Will 300 be enough?\u201d There is no way they will give South Africa any fewer than 400 to chase, if indeed they get into that situation. A long way to go. But, 140 more will take them until roughly the middle of tomorrow. That\u2019d leave a day and a half for ten wickets? Make that five sessions if Buttler and Curran get busy when it is their turn. 75th over: England 207-2 (Sibley 83, Root 54) Nortje continues to charge in hard and attack from round the wicket but the singles are leaking now, which isn\u2019t sustainable. All are through the legside, all without risk. Without wanting to repeat myself, Philander again? He\u2019s only bowled three overs since I took over. \u201cGood afternoon Adam.\u201d And to you, Ed Smyth. \u201cI know all the trendy chat is about Bairstow, Stokes, Buttler and all, but (were his back not made of cocktail sticks and perished rubber bands) would you include Morgan in this set up? He\u2019s basically Buttler/Bairstow without the keeping or Stokes without the bowling and clearly knows how to captain them with hurting the sensitive egos. Would he work as a captain replacing one of the above and allowing Root to go back to untroubled batter?\u201d There was a window where this might have been entertained after the World Cup but Morgan made it clear he isn\u2019t interested in returning to the England creams. 74th over: England 204-2 (Sibley 82, Root 52) Superb from Root, lapping Maharaj one way for two then sweeping the other side of the square leg out to the boundary to bring up his half-century! It also raises the 100 partnership between this pair and the team tally beyond 200. Beautiful numbers for England. 73rd over: England 197-2 (Sibley 82, Root 45) Sibley passes another test and moves into the 80s. Nortje sprung a pacy and potent bouncer on him from around the wicket, the first of those we have seen in a while, just clearing the batsmen then going over de Kock for four byes. Going for the ribs with his next offering, the opener kept his shape to tuck a lovely shot away behind square for four more. Nine off the over all told, advancing the lead to 245. The partnership is 98. 72nd over: England 188-2 (Sibley 78, Root 44) Sibley leans on a drive out to cover for a couple off Majaraj. No risks, no exposures. He\u2019s had a great day. \u201cI see Joe Root just passed David Boon in the all time list,\u201d notes Michael Meagher in Spain. \u201cMy money\u2019s on Boon in a beer drinking contest, mind. Some more numbers from @AndrewDMilligan on twitter, answering the earlier question about Vern. \u201cHe averages 20 in first tests, 22 in 2nd and 28 in 3rd. Only ever played one 4th Test.\u201d 71st over: England 186-2 (Sibley 76, Root 44) Nortje to Root, who once again gets a single from the second ball. He\u2019s in cruise control right now. The short ball comes at Sibley but there isn\u2019t a lot of potency. When full again, he pushes one to cover himself. The opener has now faced more than 200 deliveries in this innings. \u201cI discover that Rachael Heyhoe Flint\u2019s mother was named Roma Crocker,\u201d reports Kim Thonger. \u201cSuch a wonderful monicker I felt compelled to share. Cricketing families everywhere should name their next daughter Roma in tribute.\u201d You\u2019re saying we should put Roma on our shortlist? I tried to sneak Dermott onto there for a boy, after Hawthorn great Dermott Brereton, but, despite my partner being English, she worked it out pretty quickly and exercised her veto. 70th over: England 184-2 (Sibley 75, Root 43) Much better from Maharaj around the wicket to Sibley, bringing him forward in defence throughout. Maiden. \u201cGreetings from Joburg where the implementation of the so-called \u2018load shedding\u2019, i.e. scheduled electricity cuts to prevent the creaking system from collapsing, prevents us from watching the final couple of hours on TV.\u201d Eva Maaten, that sounds incredibly frustrating. Thanks for joining us on the OBO. \u201cBut I digress: I just wanted to say that I read you sentence in over 66 \u201cwith this side\u2019s enduring ability to collapse in an hour\u201d at first as \u2018endearing ability\u2019 and found that going a bit far. Though, in a way, it is endearing as well as exasperating - and certainly enduring.\u201d Well, it\u2019s certainly endearing to every other group of fans! 69th over: England 184-2 (Sibley 75, Root 43) Just the three overs from Philander, which is surprising. The pace of Nortje again now, Root taking a single early in the over as he has consistently through his innings. A short ball at Sibley gets him in a tangle, inside edge onto pad and not too far from the stumps, but he\u2019s through it safely. He keeps the strike with an easy push to cover. He\u2019s three-quarters of the way to what would be a mighty maiden Test ton. Enough time for it today, too. 68th over: England 182-2 (Sibley 74, Root 42) Maharaj returns from the other end to where he\u2019s bowled so far today and gives Sibley an old-fashioned long-hop to begin the new spell, hammered away through the gap at cover for the easiest four runs he\u2019s made today. \u201cThey\u2019re what you want when working towards a first Test century,\u201d says Mark Nicholas. Too right. He defends the rest meditatively. 67th over: England 178-2 (Sibley 70, Root 42) Philander to Root, forcing him to play straight from his perfect line and length. He goes just a fraction shorter in search of some indecision to finish but the skipper is up to the task, playing his best shot - the push through point - along the ground for a couple. The lead is 224. 66th over: England 176-2 (Sibley 70, Root 40) du Plessis continues to trust Pretorious to tie up an end but for the second time in two overs he\u2019s gone for a boundary, flicked around the corner by Root from leg stump to the fine leg rope. That\u2019s not without risk - he wouldn\u2019t want to miss one of those - but the England skipper has been playing beautifully today. He\u2019s into the 40s. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Great to have you back with us, Simon McMahon. \u201cImpossible for England to lose this now, right? Though we\u2019ve said that before and been proved wrong. No guarantees. Such is life, I suppose.\u201d More Such is Life! (Scroll down if you\u2019re just logging on for today). Also Ned Kelly\u2019s final words. To your actual point, if these two can make it to stumps, I\u2019ll sign up to that. But not yet, with this side\u2019s enduring ability to collapse in an hour. Mac Millings while they have a drink. \u201cOne of my best and oldest friends, Andy McDonald, is following the OBO today on his birthday. Could we possibly celebrate it with my all-time Birthday XI? Prezzie Haynes Tom \u201cCogratu\u201d Latham Inzamam-ul-Haqqy birthday Derek Candle Party Patel Many Happy Chris Cairns For Reece Topley a Jolly Good Fellow Norman Giftford Mike Selveybration Chris Older Cake Ball Party-time Patel! A favourite of mine. Happy birthday to you, Andy. \u201cEnjoying your OBO here in unsunny Holland.\u201d Thank you, Thomas Paternoster. \u201cIf you want to hear KP really giggling, you will probably be delighted by the Talksport podcast tonight. I was listening to them earlier and delightfully KP Darren Gough and a few others were giggling at the word \u201cbotty\u201d like a bunch of 4 year olds. It wasn\u2019t quite Aggers and Johnners with Botham\u2019s failed legover, but it was lovely nonetheless.I don\u2019t know if they will include it, but they really should.\u201d Consider this a public service announcement. I\u2019ve been enjoying both the TS call and the BBC\u2019s Cricket Social (disclaimer: I\u2019m on that sometimes). More from Pete Salmon on Larwood - sorta! \u201cIn answer to Gary Naylor, no idea about Larwood/Lawrence, but I do know that Andre the Giant grew up in the same village as Samuel Beckett, who used to drive him and his siblings to school sometimes.\u201d The stuff we learn on the OBO... \u201cAm I right that Phillander tends to start a series looking unplayable then tails off as a series progresses?\u201d asks Mike Waters. \u201cThere are clues in his wikipedia page which makes several references to 5 fors early in a series. My recall may be hazy and I cant find stats online to back this up, I wonder if anyone else can.\u201d Not sure, but I was there calling his 6/11 to finish Australia off in the Fourth Test at Jo\u2019Burg in 2018 and I was at Lord\u2019s when he cleaned England up in 2012, in what I\u2019m pretty sure was the final Test too. But it might be that they are outliers? 65th over: England 171-2 (Sibley 70, Root 35) Ooi! Philander stump-to-stump gets one to keep low at Root, the England numero uno quick enough to get his bat down in town. There\u2019s no respite when this bloke is bowling. Excellent. DRINKS! \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hello, Tom Marlow. \u201cDo you think Nasser Hussain will (should) one day be running English cricket? A four day test would be like trying to put a quart into a pint pot. Wouldn\u2019t making teams get a wiggle on to force a result further diminish those virtues of batting time and crease occupation that add to great battle between bat and ball which are part of the awesomeness of Test cricket? We\u2019d then be staring down the barrel of the best game in the world becoming extinct as players with real Test credentials become a rare species. Happy New Year and congratulations by the way.\u201d Thanks, Tom. Well, I\u2019d have Nasser running the country - I couldn\u2019t be a bigger fan of his measured approach to, well, everything. I don\u2019t see why he would leave his current life as a TV commentator though. It\u2019s a pretty good gig! 64th over: England 170-2 (Sibley 70, Root 34) We now have two seamers in operation, both with the \u2018keeper up to the stumps. You don\u2019t see that often these days. Indeed, you\u2019d never see it from Australia. If Philander was from my country it\u2019s unlikely he would have played Test cricket. Pretorious gives Root a bit more length to deal with here and the captain uses it well, steering a square drive through the gap at point - his fifth boundary. He\u2019s right back on it to Sibley to finish, extracting a lot more bounce from short of a length. That\u2019s his spot. We have 20 overs remaining today, or 75 minutes. Probably the latter. John Starbuck has more on Larwood/Lawrence. \u201cHarold Larwood was born in November 1904 in Nuncargate, not Eastwood itself, for anyone researching the Lawrence connection. Duncan Hamilton\u2019s biography doesn\u2019t specify the street and nor did Harold himself when I met him in 1977. He wasn\u2019t too bothered about that sort of thing in those days.\u201d 63rd over: England 165-2 (Sibley 70, Root 29) Yes, Philander on for Maharaj. He begins with figures of 9-6-7-0. Ohhhh, and he\u2019s so close to castling Sibley! The opener feels safe enough to leave but the delivery hoops back a long way, clearing his off stump by no more than an inch. That\u2019s the different challenge he presents. 62nd over: England 163-2 (Sibley 69, Root 28) Pretorious through an accurate maiden to Root. He\u2019s playing his role, going for two runs in his last three overs. 61st over: England 163-2 (Sibley 69, Root 28) Maharaj goes for another boundary, Root able to help him a poor delivery on its way to the fine leg rope. He\u2019s done that a couple of times now, in addition to those eight byes. I know the spinner should be set-and-forget in the second innings but he needs a breather. Get Vern on! 60th over: England 158-2 (Sibley 69, Root 23) One from the Pretorious over, via Root. There\u2019s nothing wrong at all with this spell but you get the sense that both batsmen are happy just to play it out, knowing there isn\u2019t a lot of risk. It\u2019s a different story when Philaner is on. Between overs, the Supersport director elects to show Bairstow with the binoculars followed by a series of close-up shots of young women in the crowd. Hmm. Yeah. I dunno about that. Very 1990s. 59th over: England 157-2 (Sibley 69, Root 22) A big over to take the lead beyond 200. Maharaj overpitched ever so slightly to Root at the start, the captain obliging with a beautiful clip through midwicket to move into the 20s himself. To finish, Sibley rocked back deep in the crease to cut him through the gap for four more. The partnership between these two is now 56 from 91 balls. Perfect batting. \u201cI\u2019ve half a memory (you\u2019ll know what I mean when the kid arrives) that DH Lawrence grew up on the same street as Harold Larwood,\u201d tweets Gary Naylor. \u201cCan OBOers confirm or deny?\u201d Oooh, that\u2019s tasty. Anyone? I only know about the lovely story of where Larwood continued - then finished - his life, in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford. 58th over: England 148-2 (Sibley 65, Root 17) Just one from the Pretorious over, Root taking a single off his pads first ball. Sibley shows as much discipline as the bowler, both playing their role as this contest continues to mature. \u201cRight on Ian Forth,\u201d declares Finbar Anslow. \u201cThis heresy of 4 day tests is symptomatic of the \u201cI want it all, I want it now\u201d malaise which sees us fast forwarding through the opening credits of a film, skipping the introductory chapters of a Jame Austen novel and taking the little train to the top of Mount Snowdon. Life is already hurtling along at derailment velocity, please don\u2019t tinker with a rare oasis of serenity.\u201d Well put. Lovely stuff. So much serenity. 57th over: England 147-2 (Sibley 65, Root 16) Nearly a chance! Maharaj gets what he wants - Sibley to have a crack at something outside the leg stump. He also wins the leading edge but it doesn\u2019t quite make it to the man at backward point, Hamza. That would have opened the door. Instead, six are added by the end of the over with another lot of four byes off the spinner, once again down the legside. Can anyone else hear KP\u2019s distinctive giggle at the end of every over on telly? He\u2019s been in the public eye for the better part of two decades but still remains one of the hardest people in cricket to get a definitive read on, for mine. 56th over: England 141-2 (Sibley 63, Root 16) Pretorious has de Kock up to the stumps to keep Sibley still. He\u2019s not doing a lot wrong in terms of his stump-to-stump line but I do wonder why they aren\u2019t giving Philander a go before Root is completely set with the lead in excess of 200. Sibley pushes one to mid-on. \u201cSibley to 50 was runs but also overs,\u201d notes Gary Naylor on twitter of the opener\u2019s milestone. \u201cI am very, very happy with that.\u201d You\u2019re old school and I love it. 55th over: England 140-2 (Sibley 62, Root 16) Byes, four of them! It\u2019s a bad call too. Sibley let the Maharaj delivery go well outside the leg stump and it beat de Kock\u2019s gloves. But the problem is that it flicked the front pad on the way through, which means it should have been a dead ball (not leg byes, not anything). Faf can see that on the big screen and makes representations to the umpire but it\u2019s too late. Three further singles are taken with the blade, all in front of square. The lead is now 186 and almost getting out of hand. Time for Philander? Has to be, right? \u201cThanks for that!\u201d replies Peter Salmon. \u201cReally interesting stuff! I\u2019m tootling along with a piece for the Sydney Review of Books atm on D H Lawrence, and am re-reading SIL (to nail one sentence, as you do). It really is an extraordinary book, and reading it with the fire madness going on makes it even more of a thing. Aussie mythmaking etc. It\u2019s the Ulysss of Australia I reckon. Needs to take its place as such.\u201d Time for me to read it again too. Perhaps aloud when the baby arrives! 54th over: England 133-2 (Sibley 60, Root 15) Better from Pretorious. Root is tested by his extra bounce early in the over, content playing the rest watchfully. Maiden. \u201cSouth Africa doesn\u2019t lose often at Newlands,\u201d says Shaun Pollock on telly. \u201cDid Furphy morph into five-fer?\u201d That\u2019d be neat! But no, I don\u2019t believe there is much cricket on that side of my family until the last couple of generations. \u201cPatient, persistent and proficient,\u201d begins Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cSibley is playing an innings highly similar to that of Elgar\u2019s at the top of the order. If he managed to get out in his eighties too...\u201d Yep, I can see that comparison. He\u2019s a keeper. 53rd over: England 133-2 (Sibley 60, Root 15) Root plays Maharaj with the straight bat this time, to long-off for an ODI-style single. Sibley\u2019s turn, moving into the 60s with a clip. Back to the skipper, who sweeps to keep the strike. Like clockwork. 52nd over: England 130-2 (Sibley 59, Root 13) Sibley is motoring along now, taking the change bowler Pretorious for consecutive boundaries. The first is played off the outside portion of the bat, albeit with soft hands, past gully. No concerns with that. The next is a wonderful stroke, clipping off middle stump away with the rope with outstanding Mark Waugh timing. The Barmy Army are giving it BIG. \u201cCongrats on the impending arrival, Adam.\u201d Cheers, Ian Forth. We can\u2019t wait. My partner is currently painting a room upstairs and buying a car seat. We are nesting, make no mistake. \u201cFrom my experience the house is overrun by mothers, mother-in-laws and grandmothers in the first six weeks. Your time comes after they\u2019ve gone. So why not take the opportunity to take paternity leave and write a thriller.\u201d In theory! I plan to be ready to OBO the Women\u2019s World Cup by the time we get to the end of February with the little boy/girl riding shotgun. Train them young. 51st over: England 122-2 (Sibley 51, Root 13) Root on the reverse again to Maharaj, adding another single to move into the teens. Sibley collects another, more conventionally with a push to cover. The skipper tries to reverse once more later but doesn\u2019t make contact. These two have already put on 21. The lead is 168. 50th over: England 120-2 (Sibley 50, Root 12) There he goes! It has taken four Tests and a handful of promising starts, but Dom Sibley now gets to raise his bat for England with a half-century. Earlier in the Rabada over he moved to 48 with a delightful, Root-esque punch through cover point from the balls of his feet. That\u2019s a much harder shot to play than it looks, especially along the ground. Later in the set he moves to 50 with a couple steered the other side of point. Very well done. 49th over: England 114-2 (Sibley 44, Root 12) Maharaj is not going to settle when bowling at Root, who is sweeping and shuffling and all the rest. And he makes contact on a poor delivery down the legside, helping it down to the fine leg rope. With those valuable runs in the bank, he kicks the last couple away. Fine work. \u201cYou are the great-great (great?) nephew of Joseph Furphy!!!\u201d says Peter Salmon. \u201cGood lord. Such is Life is one of the greatest novels of all time. Unemployed at last! I spend far too much of my time forcing people to read it, especially in the UK where he\u2019s not so known. I have a shelf next to my desk with all my favourite books and there it is. And your surname is his pseudonym - what is going on there? Surely when Sibley is batting is a perfect time for telling the story?\u201d Whoa! This is quite flattering. And yes - my dad, when changing his name (from Amezdroz - don\u2019t ask), elected to go with Collins, with it Joseph\u2019s pseudonym. Clever, ay? The reason the author used that was because his brother had the water tank business, which, decades later, led to the expression telling a furphy. 48th over: England 110-2 (Sibley 44, Root 8) Rabada to Root, that\u2019s Box Office. He\u2019s off strike from the first ball of the session, pulling for the third time in his short innings, getting one for it. Sibley is sturdy in defence as he was throughout that middle session, creeping up on a maiden Test half-century. \u201cI\u2019m sure others have mentioned this, but if not, imagine if this were a 4 day test.\u201d David Lewis, good afternoon to you. \u201cIt\u2019d probably be petering out to a draw. Eng don\u2019t have enough time to build a sufficient lead to make it safe to declare and try to bowl SA out. SA have got to take effectively 8 wickets in a session and a half to then have sufficient time to chase down a target of 250 or so. Again unlikely. But with a fifth day, all kinds of positive situations are available. But just think of all the extra time for ODIs 4 day tests give us.\u201d Yes, and the rhythm of it all. Right now, England would need to scamper for quick runs to justify a potential declaration. Instead, we are enjoying this absorbing battle, safe in the knowledge that there is time for it to play out organically. Oh, the players are back on the field. That went quickly. Root is on strike and Rabada is back into the attack. PLAY! \u201cOn the burning issue of both openers improving their best in each innings,\u201d adds Tom Bowtell to his earlier query. \u201cWarnapura and Wettimuny did it in Sri Lanka\u2019s first Test in 1982, so it\u2019s not unique!\u201d Ah well! But good work digging it out. \u201cFive catches by a non-wicketkeeper does deserve an honours board mention,\u201d says John Staruck. \u201cBut all five-for dismissals should count too, so run-outs are part of the picture.\u201d Unpopular opinion: honours board chat is a bit overdone? Was this a thing before 1993 at Lord\u2019s with Mark Waugh and the sticky tape? I\u2019m not so sure? Robert Lewis laments that it wasn\u2019t Wilkie Collins who I was named after. I\u2019ll take what I can get in tangential links to esteemed authors given I have just one book to my name and it was a ghost-written political memoir, so it really wasn\u2019t to my name at all. I best get on that in 2020. But with a new baby soon? Probably not. \u201cHaving comprehensively mockered Denly,\u201d begins Brian Withington (sorry about that), \u201cis it possible that he is trying to become the next standard deviation king by stealing the crown if Greg Matthews (over 40)? If so, could I suggest he pitches his mean about ten-twenty runs higher?\u201d I\u2019ll crunch the numbers and report back to Joe when he\u2019s back. Dare to dream. \u201cHaving followed you last night before bed and caught you again as I wake here in NE Brazil, I find myself wondering if you ever sleep or are you in training for the upcoming baby?\u201d Cressida Evans, this is a very good point. I managed to fit in a trip across London to watch Dulwich Hamlet pile on six goals between stints yesterday too. Happy days. \u201cEither way, thanks for the OBO and the Final Word. And massive thoughts to all your compatriots in these terrifying fires, am really conflicted about whether cricket should be played under these circs.\u201d Thanks for the kind words - that\u2019s lovely. You\u2019ll see I\u2019ve popped in a cheeky link to TFW above, Geoff Lemon and my podcast. Give us a go, yeah? And yes - the fires at home, well, it\u2019s all been said. But I\u2019m glad this Test at the SCG has been utilised to raise so much money over the last few days. Guardian sport readers might be interested in the bat auction our old colleague Russell Jackson is running to raise further cash for bushfire relief. A bargin if you ask me - get on board! Some clarification on Nortje. \u201cPronunciation of Nortje is like \u2018Gnaw\u2019 with the slightest southerly breeze of an r sound at the end - ever so slight - and then \u2018kea\u2019 as in IKEA.\u201d Thanks to @BlackmansReview on twitter for clearing that up. Ian Forth has some further thoughts on our four-day Test topic from yesterday. \u201cFour day matches may free up days the schedule but deep down I believe administrators think they are more in tune with an era demanding increased gratification. This is wrong on two main counts. One, because it will have the opposite effect: South Africa would start shutting up shop about now and go ultra defensive in a 4 day game. But, secondly, it misunderstands its audience. Many people look to test cricket as an antidote to the pace of modern life (see also the success of yoga). I actually conducted the original research for the ECB back in 2001 which led to 20:20\u2019s introduction. The supposition was that people were getting bored of cricket: the research showed they weren\u2019t. They just wanted to watch a game which didn\u2019t take all day when they should be with their family and they could get to after work. 20:20 was in many ways a necessary compromise for them.\u201d Great point about yoga and slowing down life in a world resembling a perpetual motion machine. There\u2019s probably a column in that. Mind if I pinch it, mate? \u201cI hear tell that Sophie Winkleman has been married into the royal family,\u201d reports Petra Dangle. Yes, I\u2019ve seen that. Well played, her. \u201cSo quite what Prince Michael of Kent makes of the ribald Peep Show is perhaps anyone\u2019s guess!\u201d Same applies, I guess, to the Queen when she watches The Crown and realises that Soph is playing her. I\u2019m sure Her Maj is a member of the Dobby Club. 47th over: England 109-2 (Sibley 44, Root 7) Root stays busy in the final over before the tea break, immediately leaning into a reverse sweep at Maharaj and nailing it to third man for his first boundary. That\u2019s the Joe Root we enjoy so much - brave, bold and classy. He picks off another single to finish his session, Sibley defending the rest. The lead is 155 as they walk off the field. Excellent cricket. \u201cGreetings from Hanoi where it has been drizzling on and off all day, though it is not cold.\u201d Good to have you with us, Phil Keegan. The OBO community pretty much drafted the itinerary for my Hanoi visit last year. Loved it. \u201cMy Vietnamese girlfriend is poorly, my dog is sulking because he has only had one walk today and neither of them are showing the slightest interest in cricket. Such is life.\u201d My great-great (great?) uncle wrote Such is Life and he is the reason why my surname is Collins. A story for a quieter time, perhaps. 46th over: England 104-2 (Sibley 44, Root 2) Nortje bowls half an over to Sibley over the wicket before du Plessis gives him the all clear to go around the wicket with two catchers in close on the legside. Not quite Jardine clapping his hands, but the brief is clear. Sibley uses his bat in defence the does well to direct a tuck off his thigh pad beyond the leg gully and down to fine leg. Root was off the mark with a pull to start the over and has one more to see off here, du Plessis sending a second man out for the hook. It\u2019s short, of course, and the skipper pulls again, taking another to midwicket. \u201cThis is a terrific contest,\u201d concludes Athers. It sure is. \u201cSurely 5 catches in an innings should go up on the honours board?\u201d suggests Jamie Woodward. \u201cThe contribution from Stokes was just as important as that from Anderson in the dismissal of SA.\u201d Quite fair. It\u2019d be a small board, though! 45th over: England 101-2 (Sibley 43, Root 0) The game changes for Sibley now, having to take responsibility as the set man in this new partnership as tea approaches. He\u2019s getting well forward to Maharaj, who is coming over the wicket. The spinner gets one to really go out of the footmarks, easily beating the edge. 44th over: England 101-2 (Sibley 43, Root 0) Earlier in the over, Rabada misfielded at mid-on, letting Denly pick up a couple and prompting a massive round of applause from the healthy away support as the board hit 100. As KP said on telly, the body language of the fielders showed how this was drifting. But a well-directed and quick bumper wasn\u2019t resisted, a top edge bringing Denly\u2019s downfall. Speaking of short stuff, Root has one ball to see and it is a rapid bouncer, the captain just getting his helmet out of the way. He shoots a smile Nortje\u2019s way. \u201cWhat percentage of the Newlands crowd are English supporters?\u201d asks Rob Nixon. \u201cIs that a factor in raising England\u2019s batting to these dizzying heights?\u201d Judging by the roar when the England 100 was raised in this over, I\u2019m tipping about half? A wonderful tour to go on, especially the Cape Town and Port Elizabeth legs, with the magnificent Garden Route drive ahead of them this week. Oh dear, just as England were increasing the pressure with the score moving beyond 100 and the lead nearing 150, Denly has holed out to long leg. 43rd over: England 99-1 (Sibley 43, Denly 29) Maharaj is sticking with his plan to Denly, over the wicket into the rough outside leg stump. But the Kent veteran is a model of concentration, defending and kicking. When the spinner misses his length, he\u2019s straight onto the pull shot, to the man at deep backward square. du Plessis takes an age to set his field for the one delivery remaining at Sibley as Maharaj goes back over the wicket and the crowd are giving him some grief about it. This is why we can\u2019t have 90 overs in a day, by he way. It\u2019s defended. \u201cJust diverting briefly from England\u2019s serene progress, did you catch any of the Nasser and Atherton interview segments with Joe Root recently?\u201d I did see some of yesterday\u2019s, Brian Withington. \u201cSomewhat surprisingly candid stuff - and much more honest than the one Nasser did with Kevin \u2018they were my mates\u2019 Pietersen. Just saying.\u201d Yep, was interesting telly; it\u2019s impossible to dislike Joe. Whether that means he should remain captain is another question, but we\u2019ll avoid that today. 42nd over: England 98-1 (Sibley 43, Denly 28) Norkje again - maybe that pronunciation is Nork-yeah? That\u2019s what KP just said, which differs from what I was told last week by a South African colleague. Alas, he\u2019s banging in at Sibley from round the wicket now, the opener getting on top of the bounce and working a single behind square first up. What a wonderful opportunity he has created for himself here. Denly wants nothing to do with the bouncer that follows, prompting a change of diretion back to over the wicket and wide of the crease. The No3 defends and defends. He\u2019s now clocked up 100 balls in the middle. To finish, a careful cut shot behind point to the sweeper out there, keeping the strike. \u201cMorning from a rather pleasant Bogot\u00e1 Adam.\u201d Lovely, David Baillie. \u201cSterling stuff this, proper batting and pressing home an advantage - not quite sure I recognise this England side but I\u2019m rather enjoying it. Ps, anyone pin Bogot\u00e1 where I can catch the Chelsea 6-0 Forest later? Asking as a Forest fan.\u201d Not my area of expertise but I\u2019m sure someone reading this can give you a steer. 41st over: England 96-1 (Sibley 42, Denly 27) Shot, Dom. Maharaj drops short, but not that short, and Sibley quickly gets into position to cut him away to the rope form the balls of his feet. No risk there. He backs it up easing one down the ground, Denly happy enough defending the rest of the over. Excellent batting. 40th over: England 90-1 (Sibley 37, Denly 27) Nortje (pronounced Nork-yay, if you were wondering) at Denly again and he\u2019s very comfortable on the back foot when the shorter ball comes, once again pulling it to the sweeper. He has an impressive swivvel on him. Sibley does the rest. I haven\u2019t got it to hand, but Denly\u2019s record in Test cricket getting roughly to where he is in this innings is very useful. It reminds me of a brilliant stat about standard deviation. Guess who the batsman in Test history is who was the most consistent, as measured by the group of scores compared to his final batting average? Greg Matthews! The caveat was that the player had to have an average of 30, or something, so to rule out tailenders. I told him this a couple of years back and it is fair to say he was thrilled with this fact. I see you were talking about University Challenge before I arrived. I trust we all saw Sophie Winkleman (Peep Show\u2019s Big Suze) on the show last week? When doing the overnight OBOs for Australia v New Zealand, as I am this week, I treat myself to an episode during the lunch break each day. This is my life. 39th over: England 89-1 (Sibley 37, Denly 26) Denly continues to build in confidence against Majarah, flicking against the spin to begin, Sibley then following suit. The former makes contact with his sweep this time around too, adding another. Dare I say, it\u2019s drifting for the Proteas. England\u2019s lead is 135. \u201cGood early afternoon.\u201d And to you, Tom Bowtell. \u201cI note that Crawley and Sibley have both beaten their top score in the first and second innings of this match. This feels like an uncommon occurrence for openers and I\u2019m currently seeking the last instance. Any help from OBO statters much appreciated.\u201d Stattos, start your engines. 38th over: England 86-1 (Sibley 36, Denly 24) Nortje replaces Rabada, presenting a slightly quicker challenge for the two set England batsmen. What a production line of talented fast bowlers the Proteas have had over the last decade, even with Abbott and Olivier now doing their thing in the county championship as Kolpaks. But it\u2019s another productive over for the visitors, Sibley pushing to point and Denly pulling along the carpet for a couple. This is such an important hour. \u201cGood question just posed by Mark Nicholas,\u201d says Ian Sargeant. \u201cIs this a hard watch or a fascinating watch. My answer: it\u2019s more the latter now you\u2019ve stopped talking Mark.\u201d Now, now! But yes, this feels on the proverbial knife edge. 37th over: England 82-1 (Denly 22, Sibley 35) Maharaj is working hard outside Denly\u2019s leg stump from over the wicket, with ample rough to aim at. He has a pop at a sweep when the spinner slightly overpitches but fails to make contact. A proper contest between these two. Nasser makes a great point on telly: imagine this was a four-day Test. It would totally mess with the rhythm of this match. Amit Ghosh is certain I\u2019ve put the mockers on England with my opening post. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to hide behind the sofa as the inevitable carnage ensues.\u201d You\u2019re right. I\u2019ve made a meal of Mitch Marsh\u2019s career with my positive commentary on him. 36th over: England 82-1 (Denly 22, Sibley 35) Rabada continues and Denly nearly gives him a chance in his follow through. It didn\u2019t quite carry to the big quick\u2019s right hand - and would have taken something very special to complete it even if it did - but something to ooh and aah about for the hosts all the same. The No3 is straight back on the job, pulling with authority to the sweeper at midwicket. Another well-struck drive to finish, stopped by a diving Philander at mid-on Thanks, Rob. What is this calm at the crease? This careful accumulation? England have added 32 runs in the hour since lunch, advancing their lead to 127. They aren\u2019t going to rock up with a decimated squad and win this, are they? I\u2019m looking forward to your company through the rest of the afternoon. Do drop me a line. Drinks That\u2019s it from me \u2013 Adam Collins will take you through the rest of the day you. You can email him at Adam.Collins.Casual@theguardian.com or tweet @collinsadam. I\u2019ll leave you with another Mac Millings XI \u2013 bye! \u201cIn these increasingly grim times, it\u2019s important to remember the things that can get us through them - booze, cricket, booze, and friends,\u201d he says. \u201cTo celebrate two out of the four, I present my all-time Friendship XI, and, if I may, I\u2019d like to dedicate it to one of my oldest and best friends, Carl Jones, who is in the crowd at the Test as we speak, with his lovely wife, Steph. It\u2019s possible they\u2019ve been drinking: Inzamam-ul-Haquaintance Doug Insoulmate Percy Friender Alter Trego Gavin Ewingman Hansie Crony Moeen Ally Bishan Buddy Palan Mullally Pat Chummins Ryan Sidekickbottom 34th over: England 81-1 (Sibley 35, Denly 21) Maharaj moves back over the wicket to Sibley, who waves him through the covers for a single. This is now the highest score of his burgeoning Test career, and his longest innings as well. If England aren\u2019t careful, they could end up with a decent top three. \u201cGood afternoon from Leiden,\u201d says Jaas Maags. \u201cI do not know why Sibley is sometimes critiqued due to the slow scoring. He does not give it away.\u201d Agreed. He\u2019s exactly what England need. 33rd over: England 79-1 (Sibley 34, Denly 20) Sibley times a Rabada half-volley through extra cover - no, that\u2019s not a misprint - for four to bring up an assured fifty partnership with Denly. Sibley is into the thirties for the second time into the match. Denly then agrees to a slightly dodgy run on a misfield, but he\u2019s home before the throw from mid-off whistles past the stumps. England are going good guns and lead by 125. 33rd over: England 74-1 (Sibley 29, Denly 20) Another over-the-wicket maiden from Maharaj to Denly. England would rather be positive against him, but ultimately they are in control of the match and it\u2019s South Africa who are on the defensive. 32nd over: England 74-1 (Sibley 29, Denly 20) Sibley, withdrawing his bat at the last second, is half beaten by Rabada. Six more dot balls to Sibley, also known in some cultures as a maiden. \u201cGood day, young Rob,\u201d says Petra Dangle. \u201cThere are some wonderful candidates to address the gender disparity on the fictional England cricket University team, but one cannot plump for a finer participant than dear Katherine Helen Brunt, a great ambassador for those of us who brandish the willow!\u201d I\u2019d like to see her against Paxman as well. 31st over: England 74-1 (Sibley 29, Denly 20) Maharaj bowls over the wicket to Denly, who misses an attempted sweep outside leg stump. Everything else is kicked away, so it\u2019s anotehr maiden. South Africa\u2019s plan is to bore somebody out and then go for Joe Root\u2019s head. England lead by 120. \u201cAt the risk of earning the wrath of the Finedon Massif, it has to be pointed out that the honourable former keyboardist Rev. Richard Coles and his University of Leeds team won the Christmas University Challenge,\u201d says Tim Maitland. \u201cIt\u2019\u2019s the Freight Rover Trophy of University Challenges. PS I used to waste 1/4\u201d tape interviewing Gower back in his Leicestershire days and he could be interesting on more topics than any other sports personality I\u2019ve met (other than Brian Clough, but Cloughie didn\u2019t need to know anything about the subject to have an opinion on it). Gower should clearly be captain.\u201d 30th over: England 74-1 (Sibley 29, Denly 20) Kagiso Rabada replaces Vernon Philander, who bowled a spell of 5-4-1-0, at the Wynberg End. A loose, uppish drive from Denly goes between cover and mid-off for a couple, and another single takes him into the tremulous twirties. He\u2019s been dismissed seven times between 20 and 39 in his short Test career. 29th over: England 71-1 (Sibley 29, Denly 17) Maharaj moves over the wicket to Sibley, bowling into the rough outside leg stump. Sibley kicks everything away, and it\u2019s a maiden. That was fun. 28th over: England 71-1 (Sibley 29, Denly 17) Denly has now reached double figures in 20 of his 23 innings, which is extremely good, but only three of those have exceeded 53. He is the cricketer I dreamed of being. I\u2019m serious. Whenever I used to dream about batting for England, usually against Brett Lee for some reason, I always made resourceful 20s and 30s rather than glorious hundreds. You don\u2019t need to be Freud, do you. \u201cHow about Zafar Ansari for University Challenge?\u201d says Matt Emerson. \u201cEveryone mentioned is over the age of 40 so they\u2019ll need a youngster to answer the Taylor Swift questions...\u201d 27th over: England 71-1 (Sibley 29, Denly 17) Maharaj is too straight to Sibley, who flicks him behind square for four. A couple of singles make it another good over for England, who have been noticeably more positive against Maharaj today. \u201cI\u2019m going to stick my hand up for KP this instance (amongst a very enjoyable cadre on TalkSport),\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cI see a lot of parallels with Warnie too, in that there\u2019s a great cricket brain in there, fighting to get some airtime from its own ego. When it does, it\u2019s fantastic stuff, even if the hyperbole can\u2019t always tone itself down enough. I think the excellent, and surprisingly far less banter-y TalkSport team keeps him in check, too. I certainly have his book on my list, but I\u2019m currently engrossed in the contradictory character of a childhood hero, The Judge.\u201d Ah, cheers. He\u2019s a good egg. 26th over: England 65-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 16) Denly likes to bat out of his crease against Philander, so de Kock has come up to the stumps. Intriguing stuff. Philander bowls his third consecutive maiden, which gives him figures of 8-5-7-0. 25th over: England 65-1 (Sibley 24, Denly 16) Denly makes room to chip Maharaj over extra cover for three, another elegant and positive stroke. Sibley, who looks uncomfortable against left-arm spin, gets away with a couple of edges later in the over. The first fell short of du Plessis at slip, the second went wide of him for four. 24th over: England 58-1 (Sibley 20, Denly 13) Sibley gives extremely good dot ball, and there are six more in that Philander over. England desperately need an opener who can bat time, and Sibley is looking a little better with every Test. This is only his fourth, which shows how pathetic it was to suggest he should be dropped for the series. \u201cGood morning, Rob,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cPerennial question: how much do you think is enough?\u201d I\u2019d say 250 should be enough, 300 would almost certainly be enough, and 400 would be time to dance like nobody\u2019s watching. 23rd over: England 58-1 (Sibley 20, Denly 13) There goes Denly, dancing down the track to drive Maharaj down the ground for four. There\u2019s a man at wide long off, but it was a safe shot provided Denly connected properly. He did. 22nd over: England 53-1 (Sibley 19, Denly 9) \u201cOn the University Challenge question, I\u2019ve no specific suggestions,\u201d says Geoff Wignall, \u201cbut some surprise that all those mentioned come from the men\u2019s team. Very 1961.\u201d I don\u2019t really know who are the most erudite women\u2019s cricketers, but I\u2019d argue that\u2019s due to limited exposure rather than me being a big old sexist. Then again, I suppose I would say that. 21st over: England 53-1 (Sibley 19, Denly 9) Maharaj starts at the Less Helpful End with a maiden to Sibley. England will want to get after him, even if it\u2019s just with three or four singles an over, but that\u2019s often easier said than done. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Robert Blanchard. \u201cSince the Cricketers\u2019 University Challenge event is entirely fictional, shouldn\u2019t players from any era qualify? I would like to nominate Lord Peter Wimsey.\u201d If we\u2019re going down that road, let\u2019s enliven proceedings with the inclusion of Harry Paget Flashman. I\u2019d like to hear his exchanges with Paxman. 20th over: England 53-1 (Sibley 19, Denly 9) Vernon Philander starts after tea, and Sibley shovels him off the pads for a single. South Africa need quick wickets plural - and they almost get the first one when Denly flicks on the bounce to Elgar at short midwicket. \u201cI wonder if the stat about increasing slip catches is an anomaly,\u201d says Michael Anderson. \u201cPerhaps 13 cases is too small a sample size to be significant. If we look at catches in a match instead of in an innings, of the 40 who have taken more than six catches, 10 have been in the last decade. That\u2019s only 25% of overall total, instead of 54% for five catches in an innings. This study shows percentage of catches as form of dismissal has remained pretty much constant from 1877-2012. Would be interesting if anyone can find similar stats from 2012 onwards...\u201d Lunchtime reading Emma John joins Virat Kohli at the top of the class. Lunch That was a near-perfect session for England. Jimmy Anderson took the last two South African wickets with the minimum of fuss before England extended their lead to a very useful 98. They lost Zak Crawley for a breezy 25, but that was the only downside. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session. 19th over: England 52-1 (Sibley 18, Denly 9) Maharaj bowls the final over of the session to Denly, who was bowled by an arm ball in the first innings. His defence is much tighter in that over, and it\u2019s a maiden. That\u2019s lunch! 18th over: England 52-1 (Sibley 18, Denly 9) Sibley is beaten by a beauty from Nortje, which straightened sharply after being delivered from wider on the crease. But - baby steps department - he has now faced at least 50 balls in the last three Test innings. He has certainly got the temperament of a Test batsman. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Gavin Ball. \u201cRe: increasing slip catches, how about DRS inclining more (defensive) shots being played to balls on off stump?\u201d Yes, that makes sense, certainly against the spinners. 17th over: England 52-1 (Sibley 18, Denly 9) An attempted yorker from Pretorius is clipped through midwicket for four by Pretorius. As Nasser notes on Sky, South Africa have lost their discipline in the last half hour, so the lunch break will come at a good time. It\u2019s two overs away. 16th over: England 48-1 (Sibley 18, Denly 5) Nortje strays onto the hip of Sibley, who flicks him for four more. He is playing nicely, making South Africa bowl to him. Rabada aside, they have been a bit subdued in the field. England lead by 94. \u201cRe: the question about University Challenge in the 10th over,\u201d begins Pete Salmon, \u201ccan I put in a late vote for C B Fry. His wiki page is a peach, very intelligent, and also \u2018He reputedly turned down the throne of Albania. In later life, he suffered mental health problems, but even well into his seventies he claimed he was still able to perform his party trick: leaping from a stationary position backwards onto a mantelpiece\u2019 and \u2018He failed to persuade von Ribbentrop that Nazi Germany should take up cricket to Test level.\u2019 Definitely the man for the task.\u201d I thought we were only talking about live, living cricketers. CB Fry would have been perfect had he not died in 1956. From memory, University Challenge didn\u2019t start until 21 September 1962, so he missed it. 15th over: England 43-1 (Sibley 14, Denly 4) Pretorius replaces Rabada (7-2-25-1) and has an LBW shout against Sibley turned down. That was extremely optimistic, especially as the ball hit Sibley on the elbow. Sibley gets his second boundary later in the over, muscling a full ball from Pretorius through midwicket. 14th over: England 39-1 (Sibley 10, Denly 4) \u201cOn the list of those with five outfield caches in an innings, seven of the 13 have occurred in the last 10 years. What was so bad about slip fielding before that?\u201d That\u2019s an excellent spot. I\u2019m quite surprised because slip catching feels like the area of fielding that has improved the least in modern times. Off the top of my head, I can offer only one half-arsed theory: there are fewer slips these days, so you might have a second slip taking a diving catch that would previously have gone to third. 13th over: England 38-1 (Sibley 9, Denly 4) This is the seventh over of Rabada\u2019s spell. I\u2019m sure he would have come off had he not taken that Crawley wicket. His first ball is too straight, allowing Sibley to flick to fine leg for his first boundary, and then Denly gets off the mark with a flowing off-drive for four. England lead by 84. \u201cI dipped into the radio commentary just before your words about Pietersen and caught the other extreme of his commentating talents,\u201d says Peter Gibbs. \u201cSome of it would not be out of place in the workshop improv stage of a Christopher Guest movie, only to be dismissed by Fred Willard as too surreal even for him. FWIW...it\u2019s probably just me. He might be a batting geek but I could only listen for a moment before my teeth started to grind.\u201d The evidence of my inbox suggests it\u2019s definitely not just you. I suspect he\u2019ll always be excruciatingly gauche at times, but I do love hearing him talk about the mechanics of batting. 12th over: England 29-1 (Sibley 4, Denly 0) A superb short ball from Nortje raps Sibley on the glove, with the ball looping to safety on the leg side. Sibley, since you asked, has a strike rate of 30.61 in his short Test career, which is 0.01 ahead of Chris Tavare\u2019s. I don\u2019t care, I love it. 11th over: England 28-1 (Sibley 3, Denly 0) \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cI\u2019ve just had a fossick on Statsguru. It appears Sir Richard Hadlee is the oldest post-war quick to take a Test five-for. He was 39 years and 2 days of age. If anyone could surpass him, you\u2019d think it would be Anderson.\u201d Indeed. I certainly think Anderson, like Hadlee, will play Test cricket in his forties. I think Cricinfo\u2019s Andrew Miller was the first to compare them a few years back \u2013 talented tearaway becomes ageless interrogator - and the observation looks more profound with ever passing year. Crawley\u2019s jaunty cameo is over. He was tempted into the drive by a full delivery from Rabada and snicked it to the right of de Kock, who dived in front of first slip to take a good catch. South Africa needed that. 10th over: England 27-0 (Crawley 25, Sibley 2) Anrich Nortje replaces Philander. Crawley, driving loosely outside off stump, edges his first ball wide of the slips for four. The short ball is coming, everybody knows it, and when it does Crawley pulls crisply through midwicket for a couple. He\u2019s beaten by the next delivery, wafting outside off stump again. There are rough edges, as with all 21-year-old batsman, but there\u2019s a lot to like about Crawley. \u201cGood morning Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cAs a resident of Finedon can I just say how proud we all are of our very wonderful Rev Richard Coles for bringing the University Challenge trophy home for us, especially as he\u2019s done so with great dignity during his period of mourning for Rev David Coles who shall be greatly missed. Now, who should represent an England cricket University Challenge team? Brearley should clearly be captain, perhaps with Victor Marks by his side? Nominations for two more team members (and a reserve please in case of a nasty virus going round).\u201d Good question. How about two from David Gower, Mark Butcher, Ed Smith, Mike Selvey and Mike Atherton? 9th over: England 21-0 (Crawley 19, Sibley 2) Rabada rips a lifter past Sibley\u2019s outside edge. It\u2019s another maiden, though that won\u2019t bother Sibley. He has 2 from 26 balls. 8th over: England 21-0 (Crawley 19, Sibley 2) Crawley faces Philander for the first in this innings. After a few confident defensive strokes and leaves, he crashes a full ball through midwicket for four. That\u2019s another excellent shot. \u201cThe catch with the idea in the 4th over is that there is a grey area when it comes to dismissals,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWhat will happen if someone is bowled off a no-ball, or caught, or leg before? Surely you can\u2019t give that out. But the delivery will still be a legitimate one in this proposal, so how does that work? Also, who is stopping a pacer running down to the middle of the pitch during his run-up? In the death overs, a single penalty run would be worth it to deliver such a ball.\u201d Any no-ball that takes a wicket would be delivered again. But your second point, about bowlers doing unpleasant things to the spirit of the law, is a good one. I\u2019d like to think about it a bit more, which is not possible the noo. 7th over: England 17-0 (Crawley 15, Sibley 2) With Crawley expecting more short stuff, Rabada tries to nail him with a sucker yorker. It turns into a low full toss, however, and Crawley flicks it fine for four. Crawley, like Sibley, seems to have an impressively equable temperament. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says David Horn. \u201cThe catch to Matt Emerson\u2019s idea is that it\u2019s straightforward, free to implement, and makes zero more dollars for The Man. It doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d 6th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 2) After a sluggish start, South Africa are starting to threaten. Sibley, offering no stroke, survives an LBW appeal from Philander. It was far too high. Maharaj then save four with a fine diving stop at mid-off. \u201cI had a dream last night (and I just know you want to hear all about it) that I was playing football with Glenn McGrath and I told him to watch his step for balls,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better I\u2019d say my subconscious was trying to tell me I\u2019ve been watching too much sport. But that can\u2019t be right, can it?\u201d The pedant in me, who is caged by frail and fragile bars, reckons you haven\u2019t been watching enough: McGrath was playing touch-rugby, wasn\u2019t he? 5th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 2) Crawley misses an attempted pull at Rabada, with ball deflecting off his arm and into the grille. There\u2019s a break in play while the physio gives him the once-over, but he\u2019s fine. Rabada is starting to work him over, however, and later in the over he thumps Crawley on the front arm with another short ball. Terrific bowling from Rabada, who walks down the track to offer a few observations on Crawley\u2019s technique. \u201cThis could be a problem,\u201d says KP of Crawley\u2019s sudden vulnerability to the short ball, \u201cand it\u2019s not the problem you want in international cricket.\u201d 4th over: England 12-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 2) Sibley is in the interrogation room, with Philander leading the AC-12 investigation into his off-side technique. He shovels Philander behind square for a couple to get off the mark. These two young England openers have started nicely. \u201cMorning Rob, morning everyone,\u201d says Matt Emerson. \u201cAn easier solution to no balls would be for the fourth umpire (who does very little during play) to monitor and then relay the number of no balls to the umpire at the end of each over. He then signals how many runs are to be added. No extra balls, which saves time, but it still penalises the bowler and changes their behaviour. Now let\u2019s never talk of this again.\u201d I quite like that idea. What\u2019s the catch? There\u2019s always a catch. 3rd over: England 10-0 (Crawley 10, Sibley 0) \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful, that\u2019s really good,\u201d says Kevin Pietersen on commentary as Zak Crawley defends assertively against Kagiso Rabada. \u201cYou can still intimidate a bowler and own that space by playing the most amazing defensive shot, where the ball goes straight off the middle of your bat to mid-off.\u201d For all his foibles, KP is an extremely good analyst. You could never accuse him of just relying on his genius. As he showed in this brilliant book, he\u2019s an unashamed batting geek. 2nd over: England 8-0 (Crawley 8, Sibley 0) Here\u2019s Vern, for the last time on his home ground. His first over is immaculate in its accuracy, but there\u2019s no real movement and Sibley defends comfortably. A maiden. \u201cA lead, a palpable lead!\u201d weeps Brian Withington. \u201cGiddy stuff from England - what can possibly go wrong from here? In other rhetorical questions, what are the chances of West Ham ignominiously folding at Gillingham this evening?\u201d Sorry, Ashley Giles has banned all football chat on the OBO. 1st over: England 8-0 (Crawley 8, Sibley 0) Kagiso Rabada takes the first over, presumably so that Vernon Philander can bowl from the favourable Wynberg End. Crawley gets his first boundary in Test cricket with a confident, wristy clip through midwicket, and his second with a lovely drive through mid-off. Two lovely strokes, those, but he gets carried away and tries to drive another off the last delivery. He dragged the ball onto the pad and just wide of the stumps. Stokes\u2019s five-for equals the Test record for an outfielder. They were all difficult catches, too. He is, in the parlance of our time, gloriously backasswards. \u201cGood morning,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cAs has been hinted before, cricket should investigate the tennis Hawkeye system and consider installing a gizmo which records the front foot landing and beeps if it\u2019s over the line. There are, admittedly, problems, in that (a) the field of play is so much larger that opportunities for accidents are increased (e.g. damage by the heavy roller) (b) the beep has to be very loud, especially if the crowd are in singing mood (c) it\u2019s all managed remotely by the fifth umpire. Alternatively, we could ditch the present system and revert to a back-foot rule.\u201d Oh lord, not a return to Rorke\u2019s Drag. But I agree about technology. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll find a way in the next few centur- sorry, years. England lead by 46 runs That was an exceptional bowling performance, led by the inevitable Jimmy Anderson: he ends with figures 19-6-40-5. That\u2019s his 28th five-for in Test cricket. He turns 38 this year. Five wickets for Anderson - and five catches for Ben Stokes. Nortje, pushed back by a couple of bouncers, edged a big drive and was beautifully taken, goalkeeper-style, by Stokes at second slip. 88th over: South Africa 222-9 (Philander 16, Nortje 4) A quiet over, one from it. Nortje looks very comfortable. 87th over: South Africa 221-9 (Philander 15, Nortje 4) Pope at gully misses a run-out chance, with Nortje well short of his ground. Nortje survives the remainder of Anderson\u2019s over without much difficulty, flicking a boundary over square leg to get off the mark. South Africa usually bat deep - Adelaide 1998 might be the strongest lower order in Test history - and Nortje is a terrific No11. 86th over: South Africa 216-9 (Philander 14, Nortje 0) Philander decides it\u2019s time to slog, which is slightly surprising given the excellence of Nortje\u2019s batting in the first Test. He misses with swipes at Broad\u2019s first two deliveries before taking a single off the fifth. \u201cMike Waters is close,\u201d says Adam Hillmann, \u201cbut the real reason umpires have been instructed to ignore no-balls is that the ICC can\u2019t think of any other way to increase the over rate.\u201d Ha. It\u2019s okay, they\u2019ve cracked that problem \u2013 they\u2019re going to increase it to 98. 85th over: South Africa 215-9 (Philander 13, Nortje 0) Jimmy Anderson took an ODI hat-trick 17 years ago, but he hasn\u2019t managed one in Tests. And he still hasn\u2019t: Nortje leaves the hat-trick ball outside off stump. But he does have figures of 17-6-34-4. He probably wouldn\u2019t have played had Jofra Archer been fit. Jimmy Anderson is on a two-day hat-trick! Kagiso Rabada goes first ball, thin-edging an immaculate delivery through to Buttler. No looseners here. Jimmy Anderson will open the bowling. He has two balls of his 17th over remaining, having taken the wicket of Keshav Maharaj last night. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Mike Waters. \u201cCould there be any credibility in the theory that the ICC have instructed their umpires to call as few no balls as possible as a way to deter the spot betting market, and by extension the illicit payments to players to bowl them on demand?\u201d That\u2019s a cracking conspiracy theory, but I suspect there\u2019s approximately 0.00000000000001 per cent chance of it being true. \u201cFour-day Tests? Look, I\u2019m not a fan.\u201d Dear Virat, thank you. A bit of pre-play reading Morning. South Africa and England are perfect dance partners. In the last 28 years, since South Africa\u2019s readmission to Test cricket, they have been as evenly matched as any teams in the world: 15 wins to England, 16 to South Africa and four series victories apiece. Usually, contrasting styles make for the best fights. With these two, it\u2019s the similarities - quality seam bowling, lively pitches, an unusual mixture of toughness and insecurity - that have made the matches so compelling. One team rarely gets away from the other, particularly in the first innings, and that has led to many lowish-scoring minor classics: The Oval 1994, Headingley 1998, Lord\u2019s 2012. And, perhaps, Cape Town 2020. South Africa will resume on 215 for eight, a deficit of 54, after a terrific bowling performance from England - and an even better catching display from Ben Stokes - on the second day. Not for the last time, the bowlers rescued the batsmen from the stocks. On a dry wicket, a first-innings lead would make England strongish favourites to level the series. But we should assume the square root of bugger all until those last two wickets are taken. The Ghost of Cape Town past, in this case an apparition of a frog in a blender, is a reminder that an exemplary bowling performance can quickly be undone.",

We were the team who had the chances and we missed an easy last ball and we should win it. But we survived and we have to play again at home. In a game where for 90 minutes they had one dangerous situation the game is under control but that\u2019s what it was. The great thing was the way everyone reacted and the boys on the pitch reacted. Then we took risks and we created so many chances in the past 10 minutes but we could only draw.\u201d </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1209268f08c397226452d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T16:08:06.857Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jonathan Woodgate speaks: </strong>\u201c[Spurs] are a top, top team. In a Champions League final last season. We had to hang in at times. We know they play a high line so we thought we would have chances to get in [behind]. We\u2019ve stayed with our principles of the game. I was playing with two number eights at centre-back but I thought they stuck at it and we were really good defensively. Mejias [the goalkeeper sel;ected instead of Pears] has been exceptional in cup games and that\u2019s why I went with him today.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e12088a8f085eda5c1128e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T16:04:47.492Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>If I was a Spurs fan, I would be a bit worried about the lack of pace in their general play. </strong>For all that Middlesbrough were very hard to break down, the passing in midfield was mostly ponderous, which led very quickly to a full-back\u2019s crosses becoming their main outlet.

Our shape today was good and we nullified them at times. We were a threat off set pieces all game. I think their keeper made two good save in the first half. It\u2019s really enjoyable [here]. We didn\u2019t start the season as we would have liked but we\u2019ve picked up and hopefully we can sustain that. We\u2019re only six or seven points off the play-offs.\u201d</p> <p><strong>And here\u2019s what Boro goalscorer Ashley Fletcher had to say: </strong>\u201cIt was a great ball through from Sav and I had penty of time to think but I just slid it past Gazzaniga. I thought we deserved to get a replay. We had to sustain a lot of pressure but thankfuly we stood strong..\u201d </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T16:00:46.856Z\">at 4.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e12062c8f085eda5c1128c1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T15:54:41.828Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Middlesbrough 1-1 Tottenham</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Middlesbrough win another free-kick.

I have lost players. The squad is not at its maximum potential. A cup is a cup and the FA Cup is more special than any other cup. Middlesbrough are in a good moment.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s match report: Thanks for your emails. Bye. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho speaks: \u201cIt was a frustrating afternoon but we were losing against a team who defends with a lot of soul and a lot of bodies and us without a target man who we could organise behind. We were the team who had the chances and we missed an easy last ball and we should win it. But we survived and we have to play again at home. In a game where for 90 minutes they had one dangerous situation the game is under control but that\u2019s what it was. The great thing was the way everyone reacted and the boys on the pitch reacted. Then we took risks and we created so many chances in the past 10 minutes but we could only draw.\u201d Jonathan Woodgate speaks: \u201c[Spurs] are a top, top team. In a Champions League final last season. We had to hang in at times. We know they play a high line so we thought we would have chances to get in [behind]. We\u2019ve stayed with our principles of the game. I was playing with two number eights at centre-back but I thought they stuck at it and we were really good defensively. Mejias [the goalkeeper sel;ected instead of Pears] has been exceptional in cup games and that\u2019s why I went with him today.\u201d If I was a Spurs fan, I would be a bit worried about the lack of pace in their general play. For all that Middlesbrough were very hard to break down, the passing in midfield was mostly ponderous, which led very quickly to a full-back\u2019s crosses becoming their main outlet. Reminiscent of United anyone? Middlesbrough\u2019s Paddy McNair, who was excellent, speaks: \u201cWe knew before the game it was going to be tough and they would have a lot of the ball. Our shape today was good and we nullified them at times. We were a threat off set pieces all game. I think their keeper made two good save in the first half. It\u2019s really enjoyable [here]. We didn\u2019t start the season as we would have liked but we\u2019ve picked up and hopefully we can sustain that. We\u2019re only six or seven points off the play-offs.\u201d And here\u2019s what Boro goalscorer Ashley Fletcher had to say: \u201cIt was a great ball through from Sav and I had penty of time to think but I just slid it past Gazzaniga. I thought we deserved to get a replay. We had to sustain a lot of pressure but thankfuly we stood strong..\u201d Middlesbrough win another free-kick. Spurs clear and then Alli overhits a pass and that is that. Boro fans can look forward to visiting the splendour of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in an FA Cup replay. Mourinho will not be happy but Boro were well organised and good value for their draw. 90+3 min: McNair\u2019s cross into the box is too deep and gathered comfortably by Gazzaniga. 90+2 min: Spurs pass the ball around the Boro defence but they can\u2019t find a way through. Boro break and Nmecha is clipped by Eriksen in the Spurs half. A huge cheer goes up as Boro can waste a few precious moments now and may even have a chance of a winner themselves. 90 min: Lamela skips past Clayton and fires a low cross at the near post that Mejias gobbles up. There\u2019ll be four minutes of added time. 88 min: Oh-Aurier! McNair misses his attempted tackle on Lamela, who breaks past him and towards the edge of the box. He could shoot but chooses to feed Aurier outside him. The full-back takes a touch and can win it from eight yards, but wallops a hopeless shot over instead. Oh dear! 87 min: Spence loses possession in the corner and Spurs can build another attack. 86 min: Eriksen\u2019s free-kick from 40 yards runs out of play for a goal-kick. I imagine both these teams could do without a replay. Boro have a rare foray forwards and win a throw-in deep inside the Spurs half. 84 min: Saville is booked after hooking Lo Celso\u2019s legs from underneath him with a cynical foul that probably felt very necessary. Lamela gives referee Stuart Attwell a piece of his mind and is booked for his boisterous views. 83 min: Mejias is at it again. Racing out of his box to clear into the stands after Eriksen popped a clever pass into teh path of Lo Celso. Mejias has justified his starting place ahead of Pears today. He\u2019s been solid. 82 min: Lamela pops the ball into Aurier, who races past him into the box. His low cross is cleared and a moment later Moura cuts inside and curls a wonderful shot towards the top corner that Mejias turns around the post with a strong hand. That\u2019s a brilliant save. 80 min: Spurs are bossing possession but the pace has gone out of their play. When they get anywhere near the Boro boss the red shirts swarm all over them like angry bees. 78 min: Moura slips his dancing shoes on and tries to wriggle his way through the massed Boro ranks but slips after working himself a yard of space. He wins a corner, mind. Eriksen whips it into the near post but Boro clear. 77 min: The Boro goalscorer Fletcher is replaced by Nmecha, who makes his debut after signing on loan from Manchester City with Patrick Roberts on Thursday. 76 min: Eriksen\u2019s first corner is cleared. His second is walloped out of play after the Spurs playmaker was looking for Alli on the far touchline side. File that under \u201cExperimental Jazz\u201d. 74 min: Lamela whips a dipping shot at goal from 25 yards that bounces in front of Mejias, who gets a fingertip too to send round the post. That was a classy hit and a fine save. 73 min: Eriksen whips a stinging cross into the penalty spot towards Moura that Howson does ever so well to read before heading clear. Spurs are slowly building up the pressure again now. 70 min: Gestede is on for Roberts and he has an immediate sight of goal. Vertonghen takes a heavy touch after Aurier\u2019s crossfield pass. Spence pounces on it and feeds the newly-arrived striker inside him, who takes a touch and curls a weak shot straight at Gazzaniga from 20 yards. He should have done much better then. Perhaps he\u2019s not got the Teesside chill out of his system yet. 69 min: It\u2019s all gone a bit scrappy. Clayton pops a ball into the corner that the wind grabs hold of and takes away for a throw-in. 66 min: Johnson is on for Coulson as Woodgate shuffles his pack. Coulson\u2019s run his little red socks off. 65 min: Aurier slams a cross into Coulson and the ball deflects out to Eriksen on the edge of the box. He shapes to shoot but as he pulls the trigger Boro\u2019s defenders crowd him out. 63 min: It was Spence who lost sight of Moura as Aurier\u2019s cross came in. Woodgate will be disappointed with that as his side have been so well drilled before that moment of slackness. Having said that, Spurs have increased the tempo since going behind. Spurs are level! Aurier finds space on the right. He drills a lovely ball to the back post, where Moura steps off his marker and heads across Mejias and into the far corner. Aurier has been Tottenham\u2019s best player. Lovely header too. 59 min: Moura twists and turns in the box before swivelling and finding Son, but the Spurs forward is hounded by McNair and Howson, who calmly levers Son off the ball before clearing. 57 min: Aurier has been Spurs\u2019 best outlet today. He floats a cross into the back post that Boro clear. Vertonghen, who looks to have moved over to left-back, picks up possession and whips a cross into the box that Mejias jumps to collect under no pressure. 56 min: Mourinho has seen enough. Lo Celso is on for Sessegnon and Lamela is on for Winks. 54 min: Roberts pings a pass into Coulson, who only half controls as he tries to get in front of Aurier, but Gazzaniga is alert to the danger and rushes out to collect before the Boro winger can get to it first. 52 min: I would be interested to know what Mourinho said at half-time. You would have expected his side to come out with greater intensity but they just shuffled around for five minutes before that Boro goal. A goal! At last! Saville clips a brilliantly-weighted pass through a gap in Spurs\u2019 defence for Fletcher to run on to. Dier plays him just onside. He takes one, two, three touches as he races into the box and slides it to the side of Gazzaniga \u2013 who gets a hand to it but not enough to stop it going into the net. The Riverside erupts! 48 min: Son drives through midfield and finds Sessegnon outside himjbut the youngster wastes a good chance to cross and dribbles a harmless ball behind everyone instead. 46 min: Boro are the liveliest side at the start of the second half. Coulson has a run at Aurier, who matches him for pace, and blocks the Boro winger\u2019s cross. Then Roberts has a pop from 25 yards but Dier blocks that. This is better, though. From small acorns and all that. 45 min: Stuart Attwell blows really hard on his whistle and it\u2019s the second 45. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s better than the first. An email! \u201cNo big fan of how VAR is used for judging offsides but if we are to assess its use we need to somehow count all the times players opt not to simulate because they know they will be caught out,\u201d writes H\u00e5kan Burden. \u201cNot an easy feature to measure but I do believe there is less drama today.\u201d I\u2019m not sure technology would have helped bring much drama to that first half, Hakan. It would have taken a lion invading the pitch to liven up at that first 45. Some half-time reading from your man Barry Glendenning: And that was a half of football. There\u2019ll be another one coming up in 15 minutes. 45 min: Winks goes over after rolling his ankle. He looks in pain but he\u2019ll soldier on till half-time and get treatment then. Mourinho could do without another injury. 44 min: Alli is booked for Dele Alli-ing himself into the air after McNair\u2019s attempted challenge on him over by the touchline. There was no contact but Alli was outnumbered three to one and threw himself in the air. 42 min: Aurier curls a devilishly deep cross to the back post, where Sessegnon is lurking \u2026 but Spence leaps and gets the slightest of touches to it to discombobulate the Spurs full-back, who slashes his volley wide. 40 min: There have been 13 goals in the other FA Cup ties taking place at the same time as this one. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can count them all here on our live scores page. 38 min: It\u2019s going to take some twinkle-toed skill or a very clever pass from Eriksen, Moura or Winks to unlock this Boro back three. They\u2019re ever so well drilled. Woodgate-esque in their composure too. And that\u2019s without Ayala marshalling them. 36 min: Fletcher runs down a blind alley after a rare Boro attack. We need some magic of the Cup. Perhaps this will help. 34 min: Son controls a long ball under great pressure and does well to find the onrushing Moura. He drives forwards to the edge of the box and rolls the ball wide for Aurier. His cross is whipped in to the front post where Alli flicks and misses the chance to score with an extravagant backheel. To be fair, it was a difficult chance and it was probably the only way he could score as the cross was slightly behind him. 32 min: Spence drives forwards on the right after a neat one-two makes a spectator of Sessegnon. He has ta great chance to play in Roberts for a shot but his final ball is stabbed far too hard and rolls out for a goal-kick. That attack came after some patient possession at the back dragged Spurs out of position and gave Spence the chance to stretch his legs. That was much better play. 30 min: \u201cOh my gosh, there\u2019s no VAR? What are we going to do?\u201d squeals JR in Illinois. \u201cIf there\u2019s no VAR then how are we supposed to verify that the referee\u2019s calls are correct? (In case it\u2019s not apparent I\u2019m totally fooling around though if there was VAR at The Valley right now then West Brom should have had a penalty kick (and with VAR there\u2019s about a 50% chance they would have got one) because a while back Naby Sarr blatantly stuck his hand up and knocked away a ball that was destined to land on Charlie Austin\u2019s toe.)\u201c 28 min: Spurs are firmly back in control and win their seventh corner. Eriksen whips a delicious ball in to the back post where Fry clears. 26 min: Spurs race up the other end and win a corner. Coulson fails to hook the ball away on the edge of the box and Sessegnon\u2019s eyes light up as he picks up possession. But his shot is wasteful and sails off over the bar and towards the River Tees. 23 min: Winks concedes a free-kick. McNair hooks it into the far post, where Fry leaps highest and heads powerfully at goal. Gazzaniga is alert though, and throws himself down to make a fabulous save. The ball arrives at Saville\u2019s feet and he slams a shot at goal that Gazzaniga saves again! A third shot from Saville is cleared off the line by Dier. Spurs survive! 21 min: Aurier whips a cross into the near post and McNair sparks momentary panic among the home fans as he sidefoots wide of said post by no more than an inch. the Spurs clrner is headed out for another flag-kick, which is curled in to the penalty spot where Moura handballs. 20 min: Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass. Spurs are winning the possession cup. 18 min: Aurier dinks a cross to the back post, where Sessegnon is waiting \u2026 but he\u2019s offside. 16 min: Spurs are getting a lot of joy down the flanks which is odd considering that Boro are playing with wing-backs. All the pretty Spurs passing is going around the three Boro centre-backs, though, who are resolutely keeping their shape and not exposing any gaps. 14 min: Tottenham have completely robbed Boro of their early mojo by not letting them have the ball for what feels like the past 10 minutes. It\u2019s flattened the atmosphere too. 12 min: Spurs win a corner. Eriksen swings it in but Fletcher leaps highest and clears. 10 min: Spurs are starting to find their groove now. Moura slaloms through midfield and slips a lovely ball in behind the Boro defence that Son is this close to getting to ahead of Mejias. The Boro keeper launches himself at the ball, though, and gets a strong hand on it to send the ball squirting to the edge of the box. Moura picks up the loose ball and slams a shot into a Boro defender \u2013 and this time the ball sails away to safety. This is lively. 8 min: Eriksen gets a sight of goal from just outside the box and clatters a shot straight at Mejias. It must move in the air slightly because the Boro keeper struggles to gather it in and is relieved to see it bounce back out of his midriff and past Son, who was lurking in the Kane position, nearby. 6 min: Some good news. There will be no VAR at the Riverside today! 4 min: Boro play the ball out from the back calmly. Spurs squeeze them back and then Howson pops a simple ball down the channel for Roberts. The ball is worked across the front line to Coulson, who wins a corner after clattering the ball into Aurier\u2019s arm. There\u2019s an appeal for a penalty but it was outside the box and Aurier could not move his arm out of the way. The corner leads to a corner on the other side. Not that either cause Spurs too many problems. 2 min: Boro win a corner after Spence slams a cross into Sessegnon. Moura heads clear and Coulson volleys well over from the edge of the box. It\u2019s a fast start from Boro though. They\u2019re well up for this. 1 min: Boro get the game under way. Patrick Roberts makes his debut for them today. He signed on loan from Manchester City on Thursday. He has an eye for goal all right. He\u2019s one to keep an eye on. The teams are out and the fans at the Riverside are making a fair racket despite there not being a full house. Boro are resplendent in red. Spurs are glowing bright in white. We\u2019ll be under way very shortly. All matches in the FA Cup third-round are kicking off a minute later than they would ordinarily to encourage fans to \u2018Take A Minute\u2019 to think about looking after their mental health, as part of the Heads Up campaign. It\u2019s an important initiative. For more information, click here. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho speaks: I love [the FA Cup]. Tottenham love [the FA Cup] \u2026 the history. Tottenham supporters too. But this is just the third round, the first match for us. If we want to think about Wembley, the semi-finals, it\u2019s a long way off. It\u2019s a difficult job and I wouldn\u2019t forgive myself [if I picked a weakened team] and I would be to blame if I faced this game in a light way. We are in a difficult moment. I have lost players. The squad is not at its maximum potential. A cup is a cup and the FA Cup is more special than any other cup. Middlesbrough are in a good moment. If we come here with the wrong mentality it\u2019s not going to be easy. Robbie Keane and Jonathan Woodgate were speaking to BT Sport earlier. \u201cThe two of us know exactly what we need from each other,\u201d says Keane. Woodgate is of the opinion that just because they\u2019re young it doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t already learnt a lot. \u201cWhen people say they have no experience we\u2019ve both been in the game for 20 years. We have no fear but let\u2019s not forget that Tottenham are a world class team. We have a chairman who has put untold money into this football club and we want to have a [Cup] run for him.\u201d Of course, Boro\u2019s assistant manager is former Spurs striker Robbie Keane. Here\u2019s his son meeting Jos\u00e9 earlier. By the looks of it, Mourinho may have mistaken him for a pesky opposition ballboy. It\u2019s not the warmest welcome you\u2019ll ever see. So both managers have made changes after hectic Christmas fixture pile-up but not as many as you might think. A quick glance at both sides in their last games shows that Boro have made four changes and Spurs, I think, have made three. Son starts for Spurs after his suspension. The last time he faced Boro at the Riverside he did this while scoring both goals in Spurs\u2019 2-1 win: Middlesbrough: Middlesbrough: Mejias, Howson, Fry, McNair, Spence, Clayton, Saville, Coulson, Roberts, Tavernier, Fletcher. Subs: Nmecha, Gestede, Johnson, Wood-Gordon, Wing, Liddle, Brynn. Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen,Sessegnon, Winks, Dier, Lucas Moura, Alli, Eriksen, Son. Subs: Sanchez, Lamela, Vorm, Lo Celso, Skipp, Tanganga, Parrott. Referee: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire) Afternoon! The last time Spurs won a trophy was 2008, when Jonathan Woodgate\u2019s towering 94th-minute header sealed a dramatic 2-1 win over Chelsea in the League Cup final. He\u2019s Middlesbrough\u2019s manager these days and still knows the value of winning a cup. \u201cCups are what dreams are made of,\u201d he said in the buildup to today\u2019s third-round FA Cup tie.

In each of his first full seasons at Porto, Chelsea (in his first spell), Inter and Manchester United, he has won a trophy. He knows how much the FA Cup means to Tottenham. They\u2019ve won it eight times and are third favourites with the bookies to add number nine to that impressive haul. With Pep Guardiola putting Manchester City\u2019s focus on the Champions League and J\u00fcrgen Klopp placing Liverpool\u2019s attention on the Premier League, the Cup offers Spurs a very good chance to end their 12-year trophy drought. Mind you, Boro are in cracking form. After a dismal start to the season in which Boro goals were a rare as hen\u2019s teeth, Woodgate has finally got the balance right between defence and attack. They have won four in a row since 20 December and conceded only one goal. Tottenham\u2019s form has been far more patchy. A draw at Norwich and a defeat at Southampton in which Harry Kane injured a hamstring has made for a gloomy start to 2020. Mourinho will hope a Cup tonic can lift Spurs fans\u2019 spirits.",

Suleimani\u2019s assassination has plunged the Middle East into a crisis that seems likely to lead to further escalation between Washington and Tehran.</p> <p>Suleimani\u2019s importance depended on his role as commander of the elite Quds (Jerusalem) force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which is the strongest organ of state security in the Islamic Republic. In recent years it has spearheaded Tehran\u2019s growing influence across the region, alarming the US, Israel and conservative Arab states led by Saudi Arabia, and widening the sectarian divide between Shia and Sunni Muslims.</p> <p>The Quds force undertakes non-conventional warfare and covert military activities abroad, maintaining networks with religious and political groups to further Iran\u2019s strategic interests. Allies and proxies include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah\" title=\"\">Hezbollah</a> in Lebanon, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/who-are-the-houthis-fighting-the-saudi-led-coalition-in-yemen\" title=\"\">Houthis</a> in Yemen and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. It specialises in intelligence, special operations, arms smuggling and political action \u2013 anything that protects the revolution or weakens its enemies. In 1992 it was reportedly behind terrorist attacks on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and in 1994 on a Jewish community centre in the city.</p> <p>Suleimani had been closely involved in neighbouring Iraq since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/19/iraq-war-saddam-bush-starts-2003\" title=\"\">US-led invasion of 2003</a>. It was rising tensions there that led the US to kill him at Baghdad airport, along with a commander of the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/abu-mahdi-al-muhandis-iraq-iran-militias-suleimani\" title=\"\">Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis</a>. Suleimani was known variously as the \u201cviceroy of Iraq\u201d or the \u201csupreme puppeteer\u201d \u2013 and regularly described as \u201cshadowy\u201d. In the Middle East he was known respectfully as Hajj Qassem.</p> <p>The IRGC and the Quds force have also been significant players in the Syrian conflict that erupted at the height of the Arab spring in 2011.

      "bodyText": "Qassem Suleimani, who has been killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad aged 62, was widely considered to be the most powerful man in Iran after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2013 and its leading military figure. Suleimani\u2019s assassination has plunged the Middle East into a crisis that seems likely to lead to further escalation between Washington and Tehran. Suleimani\u2019s importance depended on his role as commander of the elite Quds (Jerusalem) force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which is the strongest organ of state security in the Islamic Republic. In recent years it has spearheaded Tehran\u2019s growing influence across the region, alarming the US, Israel and conservative Arab states led by Saudi Arabia, and widening the sectarian divide between Shia and Sunni Muslims. The Quds force undertakes non-conventional warfare and covert military activities abroad, maintaining networks with religious and political groups to further Iran\u2019s strategic interests. Allies and proxies include Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. It specialises in intelligence, special operations, arms smuggling and political action \u2013 anything that protects the revolution or weakens its enemies. In 1992 it was reportedly behind terrorist attacks on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and in 1994 on a Jewish community centre in the city. Suleimani had been closely involved in neighbouring Iraq since the US-led invasion of 2003. It was rising tensions there that led the US to kill him at Baghdad airport, along with a commander of the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces, Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis. Suleimani was known variously as the \u201cviceroy of Iraq\u201d or the \u201csupreme puppeteer\u201d \u2013 and regularly described as \u201cshadowy\u201d. In the Middle East he was known respectfully as Hajj Qassem. The IRGC and the Quds force have also been significant players in the Syrian conflict that erupted at the height of the Arab spring in 2011. Iranian support for the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad was key to helping him survive, along with direct Russian intervention, which according to some sources was orchestrated by Suleimani. Tehran\u2019s version is that it has defended Syria against Saudi-backed takfiri extremists, with no mention of an uprising against an authoritarian ruler who leads Iran\u2019s most important Arab ally and is a fellow member of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d.

Suleimani was seen as the mastermind of Iran\u2019s search for regional hegemony, from the project to upgrade Hezbollah\u2019s missile arsenal for use against Israel to backing the Houthis against the Saudi-led coalition. \u201cSuleimani is arguably the most powerful and unconstrained actor in the Middle East today,\u201d wrote the US general Stanley McChrystal last year. Suleimani embodied the view of his generation that the US is the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d that encouraged Saddam Hussein to attack Iran in 1980. Unrelenting hostility to \u201cthe Zionist regime\u201d is reflected in the name of the unit he led for more than two decades.

      "bodyText": "The international coalition fighting Islamic State has suspended operations against the terrorist group so its forces can concentrate on protecting US, UK and other troops at bases in Iraq following the killing of Qassem Suleimani. The announcement came minutes before the Iraqi parliament passed a motion calling for the expulsion of US troops, in the aftermath of the assassination by the US of the Iranian general and the leader of Iraq\u2019s Hezbollah militia outside Baghdad airport on Friday. A statement on Sunday from Operation Inherent Resolve said the US-led coalition was \u201cfully committed\u201d to protecting its bases in the light of \u201crepeated rocket attacks\u201d from pro-Iranian militias over the past two months. \u201cThis has limited our capacity to conduct training with partners and to support their operations against Daesh [Isis], and we have therefore paused these activities, subject to continuous review,\u201d the coalition said. There have been many warnings that the assassination of Suleimani would compromise the final stages of the fight against Isis, which has been forced to yield all its territory by local ground forces in Iraq and Syria with the help of coalition air power, training and other military support. There are an estimated 6,000 US troops based in Iraq, whose primary function had been helping train the Iraqi military in anti-Isis operations, but their presence has become controversial. There is considerable unhappiness in Iraq that Donald Trump authorised the unannounced drone strike on Suleimani and others on Iraqi soil. But few believe the US will be forced to remove its forces. The Iraqi parliament resolution specifically calls for ending an agreement under which the US sent troops to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against Isis. It was backed by most Shia members, who hold a majority of seats, but many Sunni and Kurdish legislators who oppose abolishing the deal did not attend the vote. The UK government said that the parliamentary vote was only indicative and that only a decision by the government to order foreign troops out of the country would be legally binding. A spokesman added that the UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab had spoken to Iraq\u2019s president and prime minister to reiterate that British forces were present to counter the threat from Isis, at the request of the Iraqi government. Another 400 British troops are also stationed in Iraq, often located with US and other coalition forces, and are affected by the decision to halt training and support activities, UK sources confirmed. Hostility to US troops in Iraq has increased in recent weeks, as tensions between Washington and Tehran have ratcheted up. Late last year, a US civilian contractor was killed and several service personnel injured in a rocket attack on a base in Kirkuk. The assault prompted the US to launch airstrikes that killed an estimated 25 members of an Iran-backed militia, which in turn led to attacks by protesters on the US embassy in Baghdad. Since the killing of Suleimani, the US has said it will deploy an additional 3,500 troops in the Middle East to deter Iran from an aggressive response. They are expected to be based in Kuwait. Operation Inherent Resolve said it hoped it could eventually resume counter-Isis activities. \u201cWe remain ready to return our full attention and efforts back to our shared goal of ensuring the lasting defeat of Daesh,\u201d the coalition\u2019s statement concluded.",

But her linkup play with Beth England for Chelsea\u2019s equaliser will have given Emma Hayes no end of encouragement. But despite Kerr\u2019s wonderful flick the moment of the match undoubtedly belonged to Guro Reiten for the spectacular lob that put the hosts in front. There aren\u2019t many afternoons when the immaculately controlled volley from Fara Williams that gave Reading the lead would be merely the match\u2019s third best goal, but there you go. But in truth, the writing was on the wall for Reading once they went down to 10: it was all Chelsea from that moment on, and even before they equalised the result was only going one way.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T15:00:37.275Z\">at 3.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e11f38f8f08c397226451e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T14:34:38.289Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Beth England speaks</strong>: \u201cWe know we needed to start the game strong and Reading would be tough.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for reading, and your your emails and tweets. Here is Suzy Wrack\u2019s match report from Kingsmeadow. Bye! Post-match thoughts: A strange debut for Sam Kerr, who pretty much did everything right \u2026 except when presented with two fine chances. But her linkup play with Beth England for Chelsea\u2019s equaliser will have given Emma Hayes no end of encouragement. But despite Kerr\u2019s wonderful flick the moment of the match undoubtedly belonged to Guro Reiten for the spectacular lob that put the hosts in front. There aren\u2019t many afternoons when the immaculately controlled volley from Fara Williams that gave Reading the lead would be merely the match\u2019s third best goal, but there you go. But in truth, the writing was on the wall for Reading once they went down to 10: it was all Chelsea from that moment on, and even before they equalised the result was only going one way. Beth England speaks: \u201cWe know we needed to start the game strong and Reading would be tough. The sending off put the advantage in our hands but they gave us a good game. [Kerr] is a lovely girl, fitted in really well and we\u2019ve had a good few link-ups in training and I think that showed today. It\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t get a goal today but I\u2019m excited by what she will bring to this club.\u201d There we have it. A great first half gave way to a slightly tamer second once Chelsea had got themselves in front, but Reading can be proud of that performance and Sam Kerr, who missed two glorious chances, can console herself with a performance where she was central to all her side\u2019s best attacks \u2013 and both their goals. 93 mins: England draws yet another good save from Laws \u2013 who\u2019s been great since coming on \u2013 with a left-foot drive. The corner comes to nothing. 90 mins: Ji dances to the edge of the box and looks for England, but her lofted cross sails out for a goal-kick. 88 mins: England, still lively, drives down the left and puts in a low cross that is diverted for a corner. Napier comes on for her debut. 86 mins: Cuthbert looks hungry for a goal and has a crack from distance but doesn\u2019t quite catch the ball cleanly, and it rolls wide. 84 mins: Reading see a rare opening when Eriksson\u2019s loose pass is jumped on by Farrow, and from midway inside her own half she goes it alone, steaming past Bright and a couple of other defenders before, one-on-one with Berger, firing into the keeper\u2019s legs. That was a terrific run \u2013 but she should have scored. 80 mins: Farrow comes on for James for Reading, who look somewhat dead on their feet. It\u2019s been a long old game for them. 77 mins: And that\u2019s that\u2019s as far as Kerr\u2019s debut is concerned. She\u2019s replaced by Blundell. Andersson is unleashed down the left and volleys a cross on to the head of England, who draws a great save from LAws. But the ball spills out in front of and open goal, where the onrushing Cuthbert helps herself. Game over. 73 mins: A nicely worked short corner from Anderson sees her played into the box by Cuthbert but her low cross can\u2019t find a blue shirt. Both teams look like they\u2019d settle for this game ending now. 70 mins: A great chance for England, who\u2019s picked out by a delicious chipped cross from Kerr but can\u2019t get enough power on the header. Saved and held by Laws. 69 mins: Change for Reading: returning captain Natasha Harding comes on for a knackered Williams. 67 mins: You\u2019d be surprised if Reading were able to come back into this now. Kerr surely won\u2019t be happy with another golden chance spurned \u2013 but she has been central to her side\u2019s two goals today. A sensational goal! First Kerr is slid through for a chance resembling her early one, which Laws stands up well to and saves \u2013 but the ball balloons out to the edge of the box where Reiten connects with a glorious side-foot volley that sails over the stranded keeper and into the net. Wonderful. 64 mins: Poor Fara Williams is feeding of scraps \u2013 or whatever\u2019s less than scraps \u2013 up front for Reading, chasing hopeful punt after hopeful punt. 61 mins: Laws is on her feet, albeit shaken, and will carry on. The hosts make a change, with Cuthbert replacing Ingle. 57 mins: The resulting corner lead to a ludicrous goalmouth scramble, which ends \u2013 somehow \u2013 with no Chelsea goal and Laws down in a crumpled heap having clawed a goalbound header heroically to safety. She\u2019ll have to play on, you\u2019d think, as she\u2019s the sub keeper. 56 mins: Ji picks out Reiten, who has made a smart run and her chipped lay-off finds Spence on the edge of the box, but again a Reading body is thrown in the way of the shot. 55 mins: Reiten wriggles away from two defenders and into the box to pull back for Anderson, but her shot is tame and easily blocked. 52 mins: Normal service resumes, with Reading camped largely inside their own half and Chelsea given the task of breaking them down. 49 mins: And Allen, clearly still with some anger to let off, quickly floors Ingle with a cynical foul. Time for the Reading midfielder to calm it. 48 mins: Some argy-bargy between Allen and Spence after the Chelsea player follows through with a heavy tackle and is duly rewarded with a mouthful of invective from her wounded opponent. 45 mins: Reading get us going again, with their dismissed keeper Grace Moloney watching on from the dugout, sipping a warm cup of coffee. The good life. So all in all a pretty great 45 minutes of football, kicked off in gloriously unlikely fashion with Kerr blazing over with the goal at her mercy. But she\u2019s looked dangerous since and has at least partly redeemed herself with a splendid assist. She\u2019ll be wanting a goal, though, and with Chelsea\u2019s dominance since the red card having been comprehensive, this game is a good a chance as any. I\u2019m going to stick my neck out here: Chelsea will win this. And that\u2019s that for the time being. A most enjoyable half, with goals, sendings-off and fluffed sitters. What more do you want? 48 mins: Reading win a (soft) free-kick midway inside Chelsea\u2019s half and Williams delivers a teasing cross which is met on the volley by a stretching Eikeland, but the ball flashes just wide. Chance. 43 mins: Reading can\u2019t really get out of their own half, and all Chelsea\u2019s best attacks are coming down their lively left flank. Reiten wins the latest corner, half-cleared to England who scuffs wide. Another terrific goal, and it\u2019s wonderful link-up play from Chelsea\u2019s front two, Kerr coming short to latch on to a long ball and backheeling devilishly to the onrushing England, who rounds the keeper and slots home. 38 mins: A rare foray into opposition territory for Reading, who look to release Eikeland on the left wing but the pass from James is too heavy and forces her teammate unthreateningly wide. 35 mins: Reading continue to cling on. Reiten lofts a cross into the box and Kerr, loitering at the back post, meets it with a low angled volley which is again well saved. 32 mins: It\u2019s Laws to the rescue as Kerr drives to the edge of the box and with the defence opening up in front of her she cannily declines to shoot. Instead she lays the ball right to England, who strikes low and hard toward the far corner, but the keeper gets down well to parry away. 31 mins: It feels like a goal\u2019s coming here \u2013 Ji rifles narrowly wide from around the penalty spot. Chelsea are turning the screw with intent. 28 mins: Howard blocks from England again \u2013 this time a header \u2013 after another intricate attack up Chelsea\u2019s left. Andersson with the delivery. 25 mins: More smart play from Chelsea, this time down the left, culminates with England walloping a low shot goalwards, but Howard gets across to block. Corner. 22 mins: A mammoth tasks looms, then, for 10-woman Reading, who have a narrow lead to cling on to against perhaps the world\u2019s best striker. Strap in. It\u2019s worth taking a minute to praise Williams\u2019 goal again, too, which really was a beautifully controlled finish and exactly the sort of chance it\u2019s easy to thrash wildly at. 20 mins: Ji fires the free-kick over the crossbar of Laws, who came on for Chaplen. And immediately the visitors have their keeper sent off! Again it\u2019s Kerr at the heart of the danger: the striker saw some dilly-dallying by centre-back Potter \u2013 who was waiting for her keeper to claim a loose pass. But she came too late, Kerr leapt on it, and Moloney could only react in time to completely wipe out the striker \u2013 handling outside the box too for her troubles. A double-red card, really. 15 mins: Chelsea\u2019s insistence on playing it out from the back gets them in trouble, as Reading pounce on a wayward pass and after a bit of penalty-box pinball, Chaplen chests down a superb lay-off that Williams guides expertly into the corner from the edge of the box. Lovely strike. 13 mins: Chelsea threaten to counter dangerously after clearing a Reading corner but the attack loses momentum when England takes a heavy touch having been picked out by Kerr. 11 mins: Kerr gets on her bike again, haring in behind the Reading defence and picked out \u2013 almost \u2013 by Ingle\u2019s raking long pass. But Howard and Moloney are both alert to the danger and snaffle the ball in tandem. Good defending. 9 mins: Chaplen fires away a speculative early sighter, well struck but easily gathered by Berger. 6 mins: As ever, Ji is central to everything Chelsea do well. She orchestrates some nice keep-ball with her centre-backs before Reading\u2019s hard-chasing forward decides she\u2019s had enough and floors the Korean. 4 mins: Eikeland makes some inroad into the Chelsea half but can\u2019t find a cross. Kerr will be rueing that miss \u2013 but it was a great run that sprung the offside trap expertly. Her getting such a clearcut chance so early bodes well, right\u2026? 2 mins: Kerr misses a sitter! A golden opportunity for the star striker to make the perfect start as she\u2019s played clean through with the goal gaping. She takes her time, steadies herself, opens up her body \u2026 and blazes her strike miles over. A shocker. Chelsea get the ball rolling and possession changes hands a few times before the hosts keep the ball with a steadier hand. There\u2019s a decent crowd at Kingsmeadow, where the teams emerge from the tunnel. All eyes are on Sam Kerr, who is de-snooded after her warm-up. Handshakes are exchanged and kick-off is imminent. And lastly, our very own Suzanne Wrack on how Chelsea\u2019s star signing could signal a global power-shift in women\u2019s football: \u2026 and here\u2019s Eni Aluko on how the WSL could be set for its own Messi-Ronaldo era: Some pre-match reading to get you in the mood. First, our news report ahead of Kerr\u2019s debut: Kerr starts. Chelsea: Berger, Bright, Ingle, England, Ji, Reiten, Eriksson, Mjelde, Kerr, Spence, Andersson. Subs: Orman, Blundell, Carter, Cooper, Cuthbert, Napier, Murphy Reading: Moloney, Pacheco, Williams, James, Allen, Eikeland, Moore, Chaplen, Potter, Rowe, Howard. Subs: Laws, Bartrip, Harding, Farrow, Utland, Bennink, Skeels The most anticipated debut in WSL history? Quite possibly. Aussie superstar Sam Kerr has landed in England following her headline-grabbing move to Chelsea and is set to make her Blues bow at Kingsmeadow today. Kerr is the record scorer in both American NSWL and the Australian W-League \u2013 not half bad for a 26-year-old \u2013 and her move to England has been spoken of as a landmark moment not just for Chelsea (who have made her the best-paid female player in English football history) but for the WSL in general. But can she do it on a cold Sunday in Kingston? We\u2019ll soon find out. Her teammates, meanwhile, have gone almost a month without a win \u2013 during which time they were held 1-1 at home by today\u2019s visitors \u2013 and have slipped to third in the league. Reading are undefeated since October and a win today would give real encouragement that they could break the glass ceiling separating the top three from everyone else. Kick-off 12:30 GMT",

      "bodyText": "Sam Kerr\u2019s all-action Chelsea debut yielded everything but a goal as Emma Hayes\u2019s side came from behind at home to Reading. \u201cIt was pretty high-paced,\u201d said the forward of her introduction to the Women\u2019s Super League just over a week after landing in London. \u201cI\u2019ve been a bit rusty coming back from a break but I always want to start.\u201d The Australian provided her first assist in a Chelsea shirt, for Beth England, and was responsible for Reading\u2019s reduction in their numbers after Grace Moloney was shown red for taking out the NWSL and W-League record goalscorer. Second-half goals from Guro Reiten and the substitute Erin Cuthbert ensured the Blues keep pace in the title race after Fara Williams had given Reading an early lead. After the game Kerr highlighted the devastating bushfires ravaging her home country. \u201cIt has been really tough. You feel quite helpless over here. Hopefully it can gain the media coverage it deserves like other natural disasters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is really sad and tough but hopefully everyone at home has had some rain overnight and it gets better.\u201d Hayes was keen to praise the attitude of her recruit. \u201cShe\u2019s a doll,\u201d she said in her best faux-Aussie voice. \u201cShe\u2019s humble, hardworking, honest, thoughtful. An unbelievable team player, she cares about what the team think of her and she will work and do her job for the team at any point. You have top players but to have a top player who is a top person? Happy days.\u201d It took only two minutes for Kerr to find herself clean through and yet, having taken a touch to set herself up, the prolific striker skied her shot over the bar. New club nerves perhaps? \u201cI was nervous,\u201d said Kerr, grinning, who has an ability to peel off the shoulder of defenders like no other. \u201cIt was my first one on one in a few months. I haven\u2019t been playing much so I was nervous. But it will come, get the jitters out and it\u2019s only my first game. I can go from here.\u201d Talk before her arrival about whether the in-form England would lose out was quickly fast answered when the pair were handed starting berths alongside each other in a 4-1-3-2 designed to get the best out of both. \u201cTwo years ago,\u201d joked Hayes when asked when she had decided to start Kerr. And it was the new strike partnership that would find the equaliser after Williams\u2019 opener. \u201cOh what a backheel,\u201d purred Hayes, of the pass to England, who then rounded the stand-in goalkeeper Rachael Laws to score. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see the pair of them together and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re happy to get the first one out the way.\u201d The celebrations from the forward looked full of the relief of a player who has had to field and dodge questions about the threat of Kerr to her own position since the latter\u2019s signing was announced in November. \u201cIt\u2019s nice playing with Beth,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve just connected really quickly. She\u2019s a quality player and hopefully she can keep scoring because we need her.\u201d What one of the hottest forward lines in the league could not hide though is a defensive fragility. One minute after Williams had swept low past Ann-Katrin Berger, Kerr sprung to life up the other end. Catching some hesitation between Jo Potter and her goalkeeper, Moloney, the forward swept across the edge of the box, nicking the ball ahead of the keeper, who clattered into her and handled the ball outside the box at the same time, earning a red card. In the second half an excellent Laws was helpless as, after blocking a Kerr effort with her legs, the ball looped to the feet of Reiten on the edge of the box and her side-footed volley flew over her into an otherwise unguarded net. Chelsea extended their lead with 15 minutes to play, Jonna Andersson flying down the left and volleying a cross on to the head of England. Laws did well to keep the shot out but Cuthbert was first to the loose ball to kill the game.",

      "bodyText": "On the Up Alice O\u2019Keeffe Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a316.99, pp336 Sylvia lives with her partner and two children in a run-down block of flats in east London. Beset by noisy neighbours and antisocial behaviour, she daydreams about the leafy surroundings of her childhood. But when the estate comes under threat from developers, Sylvia discovers she cares about her community more than she had realised and decides to take a stand. A warm-hearted and entertaining debut, On the Up continues the trend for \u201cup lit\u201d novels about the benefits of close-knit neighbourhoods. How to Be an Activist Vanessa Holburn Little, Brown, \u00a313.99, pp224 Campaigner and journalist Holburn advises on all aspects of political and social activism, from finding your tribe to creating meaningful change. With chapters on sharpening and spreading your message, PR, direct action, and tips on the law and fundraising, the book is essential reading for anyone looking to start a grassroots campaign \u2013 and useful bedtime reading for some of our political parties too. The Silent Patient Alex Michaelides Orion, \u00a312.99, pp352 Acclaimed artist Alicia Berenson has killed her husband, shooting him five times at their family home. But since that night, she has not uttered a word \u2013 neither about the killing nor anything else \u2013 and there appears to be no obvious reason for the attack. Sent to a high-security criminal facility, she languishes for six years until the arrival of psychotherapist Theo Faber, who is convinced he can get Alicia to speak and uncover the motive for the murder. In tight, uncluttered prose, Michaelides peels back the layers of Alicia\u2019s past, skilfully building tension until the novel\u2019s shocking denouement. \u2022 To order On the Up, How to Be an Activist or The Silent Patient go to guardianbookshop.com.

Going any type of blonde if you\u2019re a natural brunette is high maintenance. If you go to the salon say every three to six months, then do something that will have an easy grow out, such as highlights or lighter ends. If you have 40% or less grey then try a semi-permanent dye. It fades away and then you can retouch as you wish.</p> <p>Don\u2019t highlight your whole head. When you study, you don\u2019t highlight the whole book. If you have curly hair, have a slightly thicker highlight, so it is powerful enough to see but not chunky. Most people look better with warm tones such as honey, caramel and toffee, which are more neutral. Usually ash tones are dull so don\u2019t really work with many skin tones.</p> <p>Going darker is easier: use a semi-permanent dye as a trial run. The best way to go lighter is to do it slowly. Add some highlights, then some more. That way you can see when a certain shade is light enough. If you colour your hair at home, be realistic and go for something simple. If you think it\u2019s going to look as if you just stepped out of the salon, it\u2019s not going to happen. Never bleach your hair out at home. You need someone who is skilled because bleach is a very strong chemical.

      "bodyText": "The first thing to consider when you\u2019re colouring your hair is your lifestyle: are you high or low maintenance? Consider your makeup routine and clothing. Going any type of blonde if you\u2019re a natural brunette is high maintenance. If you go to the salon say every three to six months, then do something that will have an easy grow out, such as highlights or lighter ends. If you have 40% or less grey then try a semi-permanent dye. It fades away and then you can retouch as you wish. Don\u2019t highlight your whole head. When you study, you don\u2019t highlight the whole book. If you have curly hair, have a slightly thicker highlight, so it is powerful enough to see but not chunky. Most people look better with warm tones such as honey, caramel and toffee, which are more neutral. Usually ash tones are dull so don\u2019t really work with many skin tones. Going darker is easier: use a semi-permanent dye as a trial run. The best way to go lighter is to do it slowly. Add some highlights, then some more. That way you can see when a certain shade is light enough. If you colour your hair at home, be realistic and go for something simple. If you think it\u2019s going to look as if you just stepped out of the salon, it\u2019s not going to happen. Never bleach your hair out at home. You need someone who is skilled because bleach is a very strong chemical. You want to be afraid of that.

The Mayflower lands and the pilgrims are depicted as founders, not takers,\u201d she said. For Peters\u2019 ancestors, it was very different: a brutal tale of disease, enslavement and massacre.</p> <p>But it is not just about looking back, Peters said. \u201cThe commemoration also gives us the opportunity to remind the world who we are and that we are still here. We are a viable and very active nation of indigenous people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cae12ebb2fa349459b185d9fc5f83fc9648eaeb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cae12ebb2fa349459b185d9fc5f83fc9648eaeb7/0_17_640_384/500.png\" alt=\"A member of the Wampanoag nation working on the new wampum belt.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the Wampanoag nation working on the new wampum belt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the most eye-catching commemoration projects is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp66atmxC2k&amp;t=44s\">the exhibition of an ornate wampum (shell bead) belt</a>, which is being created by more than 100 Wampanoag people. Patterns on the belt made out of thousands of quahog (clam) shells tell the story of the Wampanoag through symbols such as whale, deer, fish and a creation tree.</p> <p>The belt has been worked on at powwows and other gatherings in Massachusetts since July and will be complete by February. It will be a star attraction in a show that will tour UK cities connected to the Mayflower from April, led by the city\u2019s new cultural centre <a href=\"https://plymhearts.org/thebox/\">The Box</a>.</p> <p>Peters hopes the making of the belt may prompt the return of an old one, that of the Wampanoag chief Metacom. It has not been seen since it was taken to England in 1677 following the bloody King Philip\u2019s War between Native Americans and colonists.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to look for this belt,\u201d said Peters. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a treasure, it\u2019s our story. It could be in England still, perhaps in a private collection. It may be pie in the sky but we hope the tour of our new belt may jog someone\u2019s memory. That\u2019s a tangible thing that could come out of all this.\u201d</p> <p>Julia Marden, the weaving manager for the new belt, and a specialist in eastern woodland art, said she was honoured to be part of the project. \u201cWe\u2019re getting as many tribal members as possible involved,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Marden, who is also a member of the Wampanoag, said she supported the idea not of recovering the Metacom belt, but seeing others held in places such as the British Museum handed back. \u201cAs an indigenous person I would say we want it all back, but we\u2019re realistic. We know we\u2019re not going to get it all back.\u201d</p> <p>Marden also said she hoped the commemoration would remind the world that the Wampanoag people and other Native Americans were still around. \u201cWe\u2019re hidden in plain sight,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not living in a teepee or riding a horse on the plains we\u2019re not recognisable but we\u2019re your neighbours, your co-workers, we go to school with you.\u201d</p> <p>Among the other commemorative events in Devon involving Native Americans is a community theatre piece called <a href=\"https://www.mayflower400uk.org/events/2020/june-2020/this-land/\">This Land</a>, which wrestles with the history of the Mayflower and the impact of its arrival. It is to be performed and created with hundreds of residents of Plymouth in the UK and members of the Wampanoag people and will feature songs written and performed by the Devon folk artist Seth Lakeman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6c2db5d5f6366d51bf46e2cffe60799d04f20f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6c2db5d5f6366d51bf46e2cffe60799d04f20f8/0_237_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tree of Memory by Spanish artist Xavi Bove, an illumination at Royal William Yard on the launch of Mayflower 400, 27 November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tree of Memory by Spanish artist Xavi Bove, an illumination at Royal William Yard on the launch of Mayflower 400 on 27 November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another intriguing project is <a href=\"http://www.cannupahanska.com/settlement\">Settlement</a>, billed as a collaboration between a Plymouth collective and the Native American artist <a href=\"http://www.cannupahanska.com/\">Cannupa Hanska Luger</a>.

      "bodyText": "Native Americans whose ancestors suffered at the hands of 17th-century European settlers and adventurers are hoping commemorative events marking the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower\u2019s journey will reveal their story to the whole world \u2013 and even lead to the recovery of one their long-lost treasures. A year-long series of exhibitions, performances and community events will be centred on the Devon port of Plymouth, four centuries after the ship set sail for North America, and thousands of people from both sides of the Atlantic are expected to take part. Organisers say that the close involvement of members of the Wampanoag nation, whose ancestors were all but wiped out following the arrival of the colonists in 1620, is crucial to the success of the project. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to be standing up as equals on an international platform to tell our story,\u201d said Paula Peters, who is a member of the Wampanoag and sits on an advisory committee helping shape the British commemoration. \u201cSo often the story of the Mayflower is just about the boat. The Mayflower lands and the pilgrims are depicted as founders, not takers,\u201d she said. For Peters\u2019 ancestors, it was very different: a brutal tale of disease, enslavement and massacre. But it is not just about looking back, Peters said. \u201cThe commemoration also gives us the opportunity to remind the world who we are and that we are still here. We are a viable and very active nation of indigenous people.\u201d One of the most eye-catching commemoration projects is the exhibition of an ornate wampum (shell bead) belt, which is being created by more than 100 Wampanoag people. Patterns on the belt made out of thousands of quahog (clam) shells tell the story of the Wampanoag through symbols such as whale, deer, fish and a creation tree. The belt has been worked on at powwows and other gatherings in Massachusetts since July and will be complete by February. It will be a star attraction in a show that will tour UK cities connected to the Mayflower from April, led by the city\u2019s new cultural centre The Box. Peters hopes the making of the belt may prompt the return of an old one, that of the Wampanoag chief Metacom. It has not been seen since it was taken to England in 1677 following the bloody King Philip\u2019s War between Native Americans and colonists. \u201cWe continue to look for this belt,\u201d said Peters. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a treasure, it\u2019s our story. It could be in England still, perhaps in a private collection. It may be pie in the sky but we hope the tour of our new belt may jog someone\u2019s memory. That\u2019s a tangible thing that could come out of all this.\u201d Julia Marden, the weaving manager for the new belt, and a specialist in eastern woodland art, said she was honoured to be part of the project. \u201cWe\u2019re getting as many tribal members as possible involved,\u201d she said. Marden, who is also a member of the Wampanoag, said she supported the idea not of recovering the Metacom belt, but seeing others held in places such as the British Museum handed back. \u201cAs an indigenous person I would say we want it all back, but we\u2019re realistic. We know we\u2019re not going to get it all back.\u201d Marden also said she hoped the commemoration would remind the world that the Wampanoag people and other Native Americans were still around. \u201cWe\u2019re hidden in plain sight,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not living in a teepee or riding a horse on the plains we\u2019re not recognisable but we\u2019re your neighbours, your co-workers, we go to school with you.\u201d Among the other commemorative events in Devon involving Native Americans is a community theatre piece called This Land, which wrestles with the history of the Mayflower and the impact of its arrival. It is to be performed and created with hundreds of residents of Plymouth in the UK and members of the Wampanoag people and will feature songs written and performed by the Devon folk artist Seth Lakeman. Another intriguing project is Settlement, billed as a collaboration between a Plymouth collective and the Native American artist Cannupa Hanska Luger. It will involve Native American artists \u201coccupying\u201d Plymouth\u2019s Central Park to explore colonialism. Charles Hackett, the chief executive of Mayflower 400, said Native Americans had been missing from previous UK commemorations. \u201cThis is not a story about a boat leaving one place and arriving in another place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a story that has a huge sweep of history.\u201d Hackett said the arrival of the Mayflower was a seismic moment in the creation of what is now the west, but was cataclysmic for the Wampanoag people. \u201cIt\u2019s important we include all the voices that are significant. We won\u2019t get it entirely right. How can you? But we\u2019re committed to doing it better than it was before.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>If you share your bed with a furry friend well into adulthood, don\u2019t be ashamed \u2013 sleeping with soft toys is more normal than you might think. \u201cIt\u2019s very common,\u201d says Prof Bruce Hood of the University of Bristol, who has researched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/12/still-have-childhood-teddy-psychological-power-toys-we-keep\">our attachment to childhood toys</a>. He tells me that about one in three of the people he has questioned still sleep with teddies, and that it is probably more common for women, as it is more socially acceptable for them to do so.</p> <p>Why are we hanging on to our cuddly toys? \u201cMy hunch is that it\u2019s to do with sleeping practices,\u201d Hood says. In western cultures, we tend to separate children from their parents after the first year \u2013 after which they sleep on their own, and self-soothe using blankets and soft toys. \u201cThese become part of the sleep ritual.\u201d</p> <p>It is not unusual for your attachment to soft toys as a sleep aid to persist into adulthood. A <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/20/1-3-british-adults-still-sleeps-soft-toy-9607056/\" title=\"\">survey carried out </a><a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/20/1-3-british-adults-still-sleeps-soft-toy-9607056/\" title=\"\">last year</a> found that 44% of adults have held on to their childhood teddies and dolls, and as many as 34% of adults still sleep with a soft toy every night. Meanwhile, researchers at <a href=\"https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/touch-may-alleviate-existential-fears-for-people-with-low-self-esteem.html\" title=\"\">VU University Amsterdam</a> found that cuddling a soft toy can have a beneficial effect for people with low self-esteem, helping to alleviate their anxieties around death.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about having a sentimental attachment to things,\u201d Hood says. \u201cIt\u2019s completely normal for adults to continue to have these childish attachments.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t see any harm in sleeping with a teddy, provided you\u2019re not obsessive about it. \u201cThey provide emotional comfort.\u201d Plus, it is more hygienic than sleeping with a pet.

I used to cart Brumas everywhere with me \u2013 until one day his head fell off. That sounds very traumatic, but it wasn\u2019t that bad.</p> <p>When I grew up, I started collecting teddy bears. I have about 60 Steiff and Charlie Bears. I pass out thinking about how much money I\u2019ve spent on them \u2013 probably \u00a320,000 over my lifetime.</p> <p>My favourite bear is a 6ft-tall Charlie bear that I call Big Fella. He\u2019s one of only 100 made worldwide. He cost me about \u00a33,000. Everyone who comes to my house gets a photo with Big Fella. He stands in my corridor. When I was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer in 2014, Big Fella came into his own. Having cancer is like living in a parallel universe. Everyone is going about their business and you have this thing hanging over you. You never get a break from cancer.</p> <p>I\u2019m often in a lot of pain. No matter how bad the pain is, I always say good morning to Big Fella when I wake up. My bears are my lifeline. I can say anything to them. I wake up and say: \u201cChrist, I\u2019m in agony this morning.\u201d No one else needs to know that. I say it to Big Fella, and then I get myself ready and go to work and sit on reception smiling at everyone. They\u2019re none the wiser.</p> <p>I worry a lot about who will inherit Big Fella if I pop my clogs. I keep threatening people with it, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve left you Big Fella in my will.\u201d A look of horror appears on their faces. Seriously, though, I would love for Big Fella to go a children\u2019s hospice.

He\u2019s a brown teddy bear, about 12 inches tall. I have other soft toys that sit on top of my wardrobe. But Ted is the one who hangs out in my bed and comes with me when I go on holiday.</p> <p>Ted and I have been to Glastonbury together six times. He normally stays in my sleeping bag. It\u2019s nice to be able to get back to the tent late at night and have a cuddle, especially when it\u2019s quite cold. Last year, going into Glastonbury, Ted got properly searched \u2013 I think security thought he was a drug mule! They gave him a good squeeze. Luckily, he didn\u2019t get picked apart or anything like that.</p> <p>A big part of my love for Ted is that I find it very comforting to cuddle him when I\u2019m going to sleep. He\u2019s been a big part of my bedtime routine for the past nine years. I just like having something to cuddle. I need to have something soft to hold by my body.

      "bodyText": "If you share your bed with a furry friend well into adulthood, don\u2019t be ashamed \u2013 sleeping with soft toys is more normal than you might think. \u201cIt\u2019s very common,\u201d says Prof Bruce Hood of the University of Bristol, who has researched our attachment to childhood toys. He tells me that about one in three of the people he has questioned still sleep with teddies, and that it is probably more common for women, as it is more socially acceptable for them to do so. Why are we hanging on to our cuddly toys? \u201cMy hunch is that it\u2019s to do with sleeping practices,\u201d Hood says. In western cultures, we tend to separate children from their parents after the first year \u2013 after which they sleep on their own, and self-soothe using blankets and soft toys. \u201cThese become part of the sleep ritual.\u201d It is not unusual for your attachment to soft toys as a sleep aid to persist into adulthood. A survey carried out last year found that 44% of adults have held on to their childhood teddies and dolls, and as many as 34% of adults still sleep with a soft toy every night. Meanwhile, researchers at VU University Amsterdam found that cuddling a soft toy can have a beneficial effect for people with low self-esteem, helping to alleviate their anxieties around death. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a sentimental attachment to things,\u201d Hood says. \u201cIt\u2019s completely normal for adults to continue to have these childish attachments.\u201d He doesn\u2019t see any harm in sleeping with a teddy, provided you\u2019re not obsessive about it. \u201cThey provide emotional comfort.\u201d Plus, it is more hygienic than sleeping with a pet. Just don\u2019t forget to bung your teddy in the wash from time to time. We spoke to three Guardian readers about their furry friends. Jeff Annells, 68 Receptionist from Banbury It all started when my uncle won me a big old bear called Brumas, when I was about five. He was named after the famous polar bear who was born into captivity at London zoo. I used to cart Brumas everywhere with me \u2013 until one day his head fell off. That sounds very traumatic, but it wasn\u2019t that bad. When I grew up, I started collecting teddy bears. I have about 60 Steiff and Charlie Bears. I pass out thinking about how much money I\u2019ve spent on them \u2013 probably \u00a320,000 over my lifetime. My favourite bear is a 6ft-tall Charlie bear that I call Big Fella. He\u2019s one of only 100 made worldwide. He cost me about \u00a33,000. Everyone who comes to my house gets a photo with Big Fella. He stands in my corridor. When I was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer in 2014, Big Fella came into his own. Having cancer is like living in a parallel universe. Everyone is going about their business and you have this thing hanging over you. You never get a break from cancer. I\u2019m often in a lot of pain. No matter how bad the pain is, I always say good morning to Big Fella when I wake up. My bears are my lifeline. I can say anything to them. I wake up and say: \u201cChrist, I\u2019m in agony this morning.\u201d No one else needs to know that. I say it to Big Fella, and then I get myself ready and go to work and sit on reception smiling at everyone. They\u2019re none the wiser. I worry a lot about who will inherit Big Fella if I pop my clogs. I keep threatening people with it, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve left you Big Fella in my will.\u201d A look of horror appears on their faces. Seriously, though, I would love for Big Fella to go a children\u2019s hospice. I like the idea of the children being able to confide in him, like I have. Emily Dove, 26 Personal assistant from Leeds I got Ted as a present for my 18th birthday from my auntie. He\u2019s a brown teddy bear, about 12 inches tall. I have other soft toys that sit on top of my wardrobe. But Ted is the one who hangs out in my bed and comes with me when I go on holiday. Ted and I have been to Glastonbury together six times. He normally stays in my sleeping bag. It\u2019s nice to be able to get back to the tent late at night and have a cuddle, especially when it\u2019s quite cold. Last year, going into Glastonbury, Ted got properly searched \u2013 I think security thought he was a drug mule! They gave him a good squeeze. Luckily, he didn\u2019t get picked apart or anything like that. A big part of my love for Ted is that I find it very comforting to cuddle him when I\u2019m going to sleep. He\u2019s been a big part of my bedtime routine for the past nine years. I just like having something to cuddle. I need to have something soft to hold by my body. Recently, I went to London for a few days, and I forgot Ted, so I had to cuddle a pillow instead. It wasn\u2019t the same. I haven\u2019t had any bad feedback from partners. If they did say anything, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s Ted\u2019s bed as well! I think everyone should have a soft toy of their own. It\u2019s a constant, comforting presence in your life. And if you have a relationship and it ends, at least you still have a teddy to cuddle. Chris Kirton, 33 Call-centre worker from Sunderland My girlfriend, Becky, got me into soft toys. She\u2019s a huge soft toy fan \u2013 I\u2019m always buying her birthday or Christmas presents from Build-a-Bear Workshop. I spend a fortune in there! When she moves in with me next year I think my spare bedroom will become a bear sanctuary. There is so much pressure on us all to be adults, and it\u2019s not always the nicest world to live in. It\u2019s nice to forget about your worries for a little while and be a child again. I bought Squishy for myself from Morrisons last year. He is your classic teddy bear.

Working-age populations are expected to shrink, including in the UK, where the number of over 85-year-olds is projected to almost double in the next 25 years \u2013 raising questions for growth and the funding of public services. There are hopes that technological advances could address both the demographic shift and the climate emergency. But like a common thread running through these issues facing Britain in the 2020s, greater government coordination and funding will be required to realise the ambition. Central banks head into the 2020s with interest rates close to, at, or below zero, meaning that the effectiveness of tweaking interest rates to stimulate demand is effectively neutered. Andrew Bailey will have an important role to play to continue the work of Mark Carney at the Bank of England, becoming governor for eight years of the 2020s starting in March, but low inflation and lack of room for manoeuvre mean the government must take the primary role. Voters are increasingly fed up with kick-the-can policymaking. At the outset of the 2020s, Britain and the world are entering a disruption decade. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

      "body": "<p>The Naples-born director and screenwriter Paolo Sorrentino had his first screenplay made when he was in his 20s, and has since written and directed nine films, winning an Oscar and a Bafta for 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/08/the-great-beauty-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Great Beauty</em></a>. In 2016, he created and directed his first TV series, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/16/the-young-pope-review-stunning-thoughtful-and-visually-arresting\" title=\"\"><em>The Young Pope</em></a>, which starred Jude Law. For the follow-up, <em>The New Pope</em>, John Malkovich joins the cast.</p> <p><strong>Was it always your plan to make a sequel to <em>The Young Pope</em>?</strong><br>No, initially I intended to end the story with <em>The Young Pope</em>. It was while editing the first season that I had the idea that opened up the game again.</p> <p><strong>We left the first series with Pope Pius XIII</strong><strong> (Jude Law</strong><strong>) in a coma. Now the Catholic church is seeking a replacement, right?</strong><br>Exactly. They appoint John Paul III (John Malkovich), who is quite the opposite of his predecessor. Pius was ambitious and had always wanted to become pope. John Paul III is a reluctant pope who does it despite himself. He\u2019s moderate with a natural inclination towards compromise, whereas Pius was much more hardline and conservative.</p> <p><strong>So the new pope is more like a politician?</strong><br>Yes, like a smart politician. Which are increasingly rare creatures. It\u2019s interesting. The church still believes in training its people and preparing them for power. Politics used to be like that too, but nowadays we have more and more improvised politicians with no experience.</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to make John Paul III a Brit? There\u2019s only ever been one British pope </strong><strong>and that was nearly 900 years ago.</strong><br>I made him English because he\u2019s a key figure in converting as many Anglicans as possible to the Catholic church. That\u2019s why he\u2019s selected to be pope.</p> <p><strong>But then Pius wakes up, which is considered a miracle, and a power struggle ensues. What were your inspirations for that rivalry?</strong><br>I don\u2019t tend to get inspiration from outside sources, but from inside myself. In all the stories I tell, the struggles of my characters are the struggles I have within me.</p> <p><strong>Sharon Stone and Marilyn Manson</strong><strong> guest star in this series. Tell us about that?</strong><br>They play themselves. Our new pope has that kind of mundane secular side and, ever since he was a kid, he\u2019s had an inclination to meet celebrities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"561ea8d5e7216fd24301b50ddcf4bdbe9c0bfdc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/561ea8d5e7216fd24301b50ddcf4bdbe9c0bfdc1/0_142_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Paolo Sorrentino's The New Pope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s The New Pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gianni Fiorito</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Michelangelo\u2019s <em>Piet\u00e0</em> gets damaged by a terrorist bomb in the new series. Did that feel like sacrilege?</strong><br>Not really. I saw it as quite a likely scenario. We\u2019re living under the clear and present threat of terrorism. In Italy, there has been talk of possible targets for terror attacks and the Vatican is one of them, so why not fantasise about what could happen?</p> <p><strong>Has TV caught up with film now, in terms of its scale and ambition?</strong><br>I don\u2019t think television and cinema are in competition. But in recent years, TV at its best has become like an extension of cinema. In the 60s and 70s, the so-called <em>cin\u00e9ma d\u2019auteur </em>movement enabled directors to make long, impressionistic films. Now that\u2019s impossible in film-making, but TV allows you the opportunity to tell those long-form stories.</p> <p><strong>Your work is visually very beautiful. Did you ever want to be an artist?</strong><br>Unfortunately, I am unable even to draw a small house [laughs]. I wish I could paint, but I belong to the old-school theory that an artist must also possess technique. I don\u2019t have that. The only technical ability I have is in film-making.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve made films about a pair of Italian prime ministers: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/il-divo\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Il Divo</em></strong></a><strong>, about Giulio Andreotti</strong><strong>, and </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/20/lori-film-review-paolo-sorrentino-silvio-berlusconi-biopic\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Loro</em></strong></a><strong>, about Silvio Berlusconi</strong><strong>. Any more planned?</strong><br>Two is enough! I don\u2019t feel the need to make any more. They\u2019re quite delicate. I have a big imagination and I like to use it, but when you\u2019re dealing with well-known real people, you have to be very careful and respectful. That\u2019s a game I\u2019m no longer interested in playing.</p> <p><strong>You can\u2019t write without listening to music. What sort of music is best?</strong></p> <p>Yes, I always have music in the background as I write, but the volume is usually very low. Sometimes I forget there\u2019s music in the room. I have eclectic taste. I just got that end-of-year report from Spotify about what I\u2019ve listened to and it\u2019s all kinds of genres.</p> <p><strong>You once said that Diego Maradona saved your life. How?</strong><br>It was literally fate. When I was 16, I was supposed to go on holiday with my parents but decided to stay home because I really wanted to go and watch my football team Napoli play. My parents had an accident on holiday and died. So yes, my passion for soccer \u2013 and for Maradona in particular \u2013 saved my life.</p> <p><strong>Do you still have that passion? </strong><br>Very much so, but not just for Napoli, for all soccer. I often find myself stopping to watch matches in parks or schoolyards. I used to play, but I turn 50 this year and it\u2019s important in life to know when to stop doing things! I wish I could have been a football coach, but I never studied to be one and it\u2019s too late now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/the-new-pope-review-john-malkovich-paolo-sorrentino-jude-law\">The New Pope review \u2013 enter a seductively camp John Malkovich</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How do you feel about turning 50?</strong><br>It was more fun when I turned 20!

      "bodyText": "The Naples-born director and screenwriter Paolo Sorrentino had his first screenplay made when he was in his 20s, and has since written and directed nine films, winning an Oscar and a Bafta for 2013\u2019s The Great Beauty. In 2016, he created and directed his first TV series, The Young Pope, which starred Jude Law. For the follow-up, The New Pope, John Malkovich joins the cast. Was it always your plan to make a sequel to The Young Pope? No, initially I intended to end the story with The Young Pope. It was while editing the first season that I had the idea that opened up the game again. We left the first series with Pope Pius XIII (Jude Law) in a coma. Now the Catholic church is seeking a replacement, right? Exactly. They appoint John Paul III (John Malkovich), who is quite the opposite of his predecessor. Pius was ambitious and had always wanted to become pope. John Paul III is a reluctant pope who does it despite himself. He\u2019s moderate with a natural inclination towards compromise, whereas Pius was much more hardline and conservative. So the new pope is more like a politician? Yes, like a smart politician. Which are increasingly rare creatures. It\u2019s interesting. The church still believes in training its people and preparing them for power. Politics used to be like that too, but nowadays we have more and more improvised politicians with no experience. Why did you decide to make John Paul III a Brit? There\u2019s only ever been one British pope and that was nearly 900 years ago. I made him English because he\u2019s a key figure in converting as many Anglicans as possible to the Catholic church. That\u2019s why he\u2019s selected to be pope. But then Pius wakes up, which is considered a miracle, and a power struggle ensues. What were your inspirations for that rivalry? I don\u2019t tend to get inspiration from outside sources, but from inside myself. In all the stories I tell, the struggles of my characters are the struggles I have within me. Sharon Stone and Marilyn Manson guest star in this series. Tell us about that? They play themselves. Our new pope has that kind of mundane secular side and, ever since he was a kid, he\u2019s had an inclination to meet celebrities. Michelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0 gets damaged by a terrorist bomb in the new series. Did that feel like sacrilege? Not really. I saw it as quite a likely scenario. We\u2019re living under the clear and present threat of terrorism. In Italy, there has been talk of possible targets for terror attacks and the Vatican is one of them, so why not fantasise about what could happen? Has TV caught up with film now, in terms of its scale and ambition? I don\u2019t think television and cinema are in competition. But in recent years, TV at its best has become like an extension of cinema. In the 60s and 70s, the so-called cin\u00e9ma d\u2019auteur movement enabled directors to make long, impressionistic films. Now that\u2019s impossible in film-making, but TV allows you the opportunity to tell those long-form stories. Your work is visually very beautiful. Did you ever want to be an artist? Unfortunately, I am unable even to draw a small house [laughs]. I wish I could paint, but I belong to the old-school theory that an artist must also possess technique. I don\u2019t have that. The only technical ability I have is in film-making. You\u2019ve made films about a pair of Italian prime ministers: Il Divo, about Giulio Andreotti, and Loro, about Silvio Berlusconi. Any more planned? Two is enough! I don\u2019t feel the need to make any more. They\u2019re quite delicate. I have a big imagination and I like to use it, but when you\u2019re dealing with well-known real people, you have to be very careful and respectful. That\u2019s a game I\u2019m no longer interested in playing. You can\u2019t write without listening to music. What sort of music is best? Yes, I always have music in the background as I write, but the volume is usually very low. Sometimes I forget there\u2019s music in the room. I have eclectic taste. I just got that end-of-year report from Spotify about what I\u2019ve listened to and it\u2019s all kinds of genres. You once said that Diego Maradona saved your life. How? It was literally fate. When I was 16, I was supposed to go on holiday with my parents but decided to stay home because I really wanted to go and watch my football team Napoli play. My parents had an accident on holiday and died. So yes, my passion for soccer \u2013 and for Maradona in particular \u2013 saved my life. Do you still have that passion? Very much so, but not just for Napoli, for all soccer. I often find myself stopping to watch matches in parks or schoolyards. I used to play, but I turn 50 this year and it\u2019s important in life to know when to stop doing things! I wish I could have been a football coach, but I never studied to be one and it\u2019s too late now. How do you feel about turning 50? It was more fun when I turned 20! I might have a party, but I always say I will, then get the fear and cancel it two weeks beforehand. What was the best film and TV show you saw last year? Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman was wonderful. On TV, Modern Love, which is based on the New York Times column. Where do you keep your Oscar? In a cabinet in my study. Let\u2019s pretend that it\u2019s just one award, sitting among my many others! Do you have any new year resolutions? I should give up smoking, but won\u2019t. Recently, I switched to cigars. I probably would have given up long ago if I didn\u2019t have half the world telling me to stop. Everyone around me says I must, which only makes me more determined to continue.

Leeds, though, have suffered far more and for far longer. The Premier League has missed them as a northern powerhouse, and they have sorely missed being in the top division. Where Manchester City fans might recall days in the lower divisions as life-affirming proof of authenticity, the last 16 years have been harrowing for Leeds, a grind of disappointments amid back-office turmoil.

The art deco City Baths were mothballed by Newcastle city council in 2013 in a \u201cslash and burn\u201d round of cost-cutting that also saw the closure of Sure Start centres, libraries and museums. Now, after a tireless campaign by locals, the Grade II-listed site will reopen for sweating and pampering once more after a \u00a37.5m restoration, taking its place as one of 11 historic Turkish baths in operation across the UK. The revamp has been carried out by Fusion, a leisure charity that made its name with is renovation of Brockwell Lido in south London in 2007 and then Brighton\u2019s Saltdean Lido 10 years later. As well as restoring the baths, they have revamped one of the swimming pools and installed new fitness studios. They are determined to keep prices within the grasp of ordinary workers, reasoning that this \u201cwater palace of the people\u201d should not be the preserve of the rich. \u201cWe want to make it affordable to all,\u201d said Anthony Cawley, Fusion\u2019s director of operations. The baths have been enjoyed by generations of Geordies since they opened in 1928, as well as celebrities performing at the neighbouring City Hall. Comedian Victoria Wood was one visitor; regulars suspected that her Turkish bath sketch (\u201cIf her bum were a bungalow, she\u2019d never get a mortgage on it\u201d) was based on her experiences among half-naked Tynesiders. A day of mourning marked what many feared would be the baths\u2019 swansong in 2013. It featured a poolside recital by the Wet Poets Society and one last sweat for sauna devotees, including a group of army veterans from the Northumberland village of Cramlington, who had enjoyed a monthly session since being demobbed. \u201cIt was so sad.

Ipswich Funding is in place for the restoration of Broomhill outdoor pool, a Grade II-listed, 50-metre lido in East Anglia, which closed in 2002.

      "bodyText": "Shelley Caban just wants it to be over. \u201cSometimes I think, \u2018Fuck it, just burn it all, the house and everything,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the waiting and the limbo, you just feel like anything has to be better.\u201d When Guardian Australia spoke to Caban on Sunday, the 33-year-old was sheltered inside the safety of an unregistered bus-turned-refuge on the wharf in the coastal New South Wales town of Eden with her husband, Oliver Tratham-Webb, her three daughters Pearl, Aster and Aria, three dogs, a cat and several ducklings. They have not seen home \u2013 a historic 150-year-old timber house in the picturesque Nethercote Valley just south of Eden in the state\u2019s far-south \u2013 since New Year\u2019s Eve, when they woke to chokingly thick smoke outside their home, packed the bus and left. \u201cI just knew we had to get out of there,\u201d she said. Now they find themselves among the thousands of Australians displaced indefinitely by the bushfire emergency gripping this country, a rolling crisis that has torn through great swaths of the east coast since November. In its wake, the fires have left whole towns decimated and forced new pressure on the Australian government to act more aggressively to address the impact of climate change. \u201cIt has to change something, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Caban said on Sunday. \u201cI really, really hope it does. The spiral can\u2019t keep going like this.\u201d After communities across the state\u2019s south coast were struck by fierce blazes on New Year\u2019s Eve, authorities had warned that blistering temperatures and strong gusting winds on Saturday could make for even worse conditions. They were right. At least 60 homes have been confirmed destroyed by fires that ripped through NSW on Saturday, though that total is expected to rise once Rural Fire Service crews are able to properly inspect the fire grounds. It brings the total number of properties destroyed in this state since bushfires gripped more than a month ago to 1,400. The worst-affected areas on Saturday included Batlow, a small village in the foothills of the state\u2019s Snowy Mountains, where homes were destroyed and a man died of a heart attack while attempting to protect a friend\u2019s property. In the southern highlands, south-west of Sydney, homes were destroyed in Kangaroo Valley and Wingello after embers from the Currowan fire crossed the Shoalhaven River and sparked fires in the dense bushland on the river\u2019s northern banks. In Victoria, where dozens of blazes continue to burn, 18 communities remain cut off, including Mallacoota, where residents had previously had to be evacuated by the navy after a previous round of fires tore through. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has promised an aid package for areas ravaged by the crisis and said on Sunday he would consider a royal commission into the deadly blazes, which have burned vast areas on the east coast. Morrison, who has been heavily criticised for taking a holiday in Hawaii during the crisis and was heckled by locals in Cobargo after forcing a handshake on an unwilling woman, also again defended his leadership during the emergency. In the small fishing and logging town of Eden, near the NSW and Victoria border, hundreds of people huddled at the wharf on Saturday night as a large and uncontained fire driven by gusting southerly winds raced towards the town. By Sunday morning, conditions remained dire, and police began pleading with people to flee north to the town of Merimbula or west to Bega. In Merimbula, about 27km north, an evacuation centre has reached capacity and shanty towns have emerged along the water. Among them was Rodney Sargent with his girlfriend, Jaymi Herman. The couple had driven almost 2,500km south from Townsville in Queensland with their dog, Rex, to meet Sargent\u2019s father, Alan, who had come 4,000km across the country from Western Australia to meet for a holiday in Eden. Now they\u2019re stuck. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the holiday we were expecting,\u201d Sargent told the Guardian. \u201cWe can\u2019t get any phone service and we\u2019re pretty much out of fuel. We\u2019re just waiting here. You feel pretty lost. I just want to get out of this entire state as quickly as possible.\u201d Despite the urging of police to leave Eden, many decided they were safer in the town near water. On Saturday night, as the fire approached, Matt Proctor, a fisherman, took his partner and two children on to his dinghy and took shelter in a harbour near the town. In pitch black and surrounded by acrid smoke, they tried to wait it out as relentless gusting winds buffeted them and ash rained from the sky. \u201cIt was apocalyptic,\u201d Proctor told the Guardian. \u201cLike end of the world stuff.\u201d Eventually they took shelter in one of two tugboats at the town\u2019s wharf along with dozens of other people who had fled to the water. \u201cIt was tense, it was eerie, you know it\u2019s the safest place to be but we didn\u2019t sleep much. It\u2019s been chaos here not just today but for days and days. We thought New Year\u2019s Eve was the worst we\u2019d ever see. Little did we know. It plays with your mind a bit. Eden is such a beautiful place to live and now we\u2019ve lost so much.\u201d Easing conditions later on Sunday enabled RFS crews to bring the fire under control, and the town itself remains intact. But authorities say places to the south including the Nethercote Valley where Caban and her family live remain under threat. Not long before she spoke to the Guardian on Sunday, she received a call from neighbours who told her the house was under threat from embers. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was our dream to own a beautiful home like this. I know I will cry a lot if we lose it.\u201d",

Indeed, even whilst the government\u2019s ongoing \u201creview\u201d of Prevent <a href=\"https://www.justiceinitiative.org/newsroom/the-uk-s-prevent-strategy-review-is-fundamentally-flawed\">lacks credibility</a>, we can anticipate the policy\u2019s expansion because the government has already begun extending surveillance into Muslim people\u2019s civic lives more broadly, through programmes like the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-a-stronger-britain-together\">Building a Stronger Britain Together</a><strong> </strong>fund to counter extremism.

Paradoxically, the Conservative government\u2019s desire to harden the border against those seeking asylum comes without a call to change British foreign policy that directly contributes to the death and destruction abroad that creates refugees.

Giving Johnson and his ilk power creates a context where Islamophobia will only intensify. While many of us feel helpless in the face of this, there are things we can do. We can disrupt and refuse to take part in counter-terror rhetoric that criminalises Muslims: don\u2019t take part in the Prevent review, seek for its repeal, don\u2019t report to Prevent and don\u2019t use counter-terrorism or counter-extremism funding.</p> <p>We must also not let the results of this election mean that the broader left reacts by becoming more Islamophobic and racist. In the last few weeks I\u2019ve heard many repeat the notion that Labour lost because the party did not understand the depth of the appeal of Brexit, with this being extrapolated into the mistaken suggestion that it was not racist enough. We must also resist the so-called Blue Labour moderation, which some see as the only legitimate stance for the party. This position of social conservatism advocates leftwing economics with implicit Islamophobia and racism. We must therefore agitate to ensure this Conservative win is a prompt to stop the normalisation of lethal conditions for Muslims at home and abroad, rather than the mandate to intensify them.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2020 to: remove an implication that it is within the remit of the Commission for Countering Extremism to conduct surveillance; and to distinguish between the government\u2019s definition of extremism and the commission\u2019s definition.</p> <p>\u2022 Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan is an author, writer, spoken-word poet, speaker and educator</p>",

The government has an incredibly ambiguous definition of \u201cextremism\u201d, and the Commission for Countering Extremism\u2019s definition isn\u2019t much better as it begins conflating other equally ambiguous concepts such as \u201chate\u201d with \u201cextremism\u201d. This means the scope of what is deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d can easily be expanded. We can also expect Islamophobia to be visible at Britain\u2019s borders. The \u201cbreaking point\u201d poster of the 2016 Brexit referendum foretold calls for the harsher border controls that this government has promised. Johnson speaks of the success of a \u201cAustralian-style points-based immigration system\u201d, failing to acknowledge that Australia\u2019s own border policy is deliberately Islamophobic and largely detains Muslims. Paradoxically, the Conservative government\u2019s desire to harden the border against those seeking asylum comes without a call to change British foreign policy that directly contributes to the death and destruction abroad that creates refugees. There is no mention of ceasing arms sales to the Saudis in their genocidal bombing campaign on Yemen, for example. Muslims are unsafe under this government. Giving Johnson and his ilk power creates a context where Islamophobia will only intensify. While many of us feel helpless in the face of this, there are things we can do. We can disrupt and refuse to take part in counter-terror rhetoric that criminalises Muslims: don\u2019t take part in the Prevent review, seek for its repeal, don\u2019t report to Prevent and don\u2019t use counter-terrorism or counter-extremism funding. We must also not let the results of this election mean that the broader left reacts by becoming more Islamophobic and racist. In the last few weeks I\u2019ve heard many repeat the notion that Labour lost because the party did not understand the depth of the appeal of Brexit, with this being extrapolated into the mistaken suggestion that it was not racist enough. We must also resist the so-called Blue Labour moderation, which some see as the only legitimate stance for the party. This position of social conservatism advocates leftwing economics with implicit Islamophobia and racism. We must therefore agitate to ensure this Conservative win is a prompt to stop the normalisation of lethal conditions for Muslims at home and abroad, rather than the mandate to intensify them. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2020 to: remove an implication that it is within the remit of the Commission for Countering Extremism to conduct surveillance; and to distinguish between the government\u2019s definition of extremism and the commission\u2019s definition. \u2022 Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan is an author, writer, spoken-word poet, speaker and educator",

      "body": "<p>Followers of Elon Musk are used to big claims on Twitter. The social media habits of the Tesla and SpaceX billionaire have landed him in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/06/elon-musk-vernon-unsworth-trial-verdict\">legal hot water</a> on several occasions. But for the battery industry one boast stands out: a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1006968985760366592\">tweeted pledge</a> to remove an obscure mineral mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo from the next generation of Tesla\u2019s electric cars.</p> <p>Batteries are the key component in the electric car revolution that Tesla kickstarted, and each one contains cobalt. Yet concerns about human rights abuses and child labour have prompted a dual effort to cut the amount of cobalt used in batteries and to clean up complex global supply chains.</p> <p>The battery industry accounts for the majority of global cobalt demand, and that demand is set to soar with more than $60bn (\u00a346bn) of investments in new battery factories during 2019, according to the data firm Benchmark Minerals. Musk tweeted his pledge in 2018 but demand for cobalt has since accelerated. Benchmark\u2019s forecasts suggest that global demand for cobalt in 2029 will be 300,000 tonnes compared with an estimated 70,000 tonnes used in 2019.</p> <p>Almost three-quarters of the world\u2019s cobalt supply is sourced from the DRC, a country whose rule of law is among the weakest in the world and which consequently has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2019/dec/16/i-saw-the-unbearable-grief-inflicted-on-families-by-cobalt-mining-i-pray-for-change\">terrible record on working conditions and child labour</a>. The majority is then shipped to China, the world\u2019s largest battery manufacturer, to be processed.</p> <p>The car industry is by no means the only one implicated: the electronics manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths\">Apple, Google, Dell and Microsoft, as well as Tesla</a>, were named in a US lawsuit last month by families who say their children were killed while mining cobalt used in their products. However, the surge in electric car sales \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/17/european-parliament-carbon-dioxide-emission-truck-2035\">as regulations limit </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/17/european-parliament-carbon-dioxide-emission-truck-2035\">exhaust pipe carbon dioxide emissions</a> \u2013 and the kilograms needed in each car mean that cobalt supply concerns will only become more acute.</p> <p>There are as many as 150,000 artisanal miners in Kolwezi, the regional capital in southern DRC that has become a major mining centre, according to Mark Dummett, a researcher on business and human rights at Amnesty International. Children working at the mines are easy to find within a five-minute drive of the city centre, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d0c448d3c148a51e4fc3b380f91a16ed5d8dcf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d0c448d3c148a51e4fc3b380f91a16ed5d8dcf7/0_238_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raw cobalt in a factory after a first transformation at a factory in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of Congo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raw cobalt in a factory in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of Congo, before being exported to be refined.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Tounsi/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been some progress. The Congolese government has promised to pilot regulated areas for artisanal miners. Increasing consumer awareness has also led to supply chain auditing projects such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/conflict-minerals-legislation-human-rights-groups\">Responsible Sourcing Network</a>, run by the nonprofit organisation As You Sow, as well as two industry-led bodies, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance and Responsible Mining Initiative, to ensure that suppliers are up to standards set by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.</p> <p>Cobalt\u2019s human and financial costs, as well as the technological imperative to increase energy density, have prompted research efforts by battery makers to reduce their reliance on the metal.</p> <p>Most electric vehicle batteries use lithium ions, with nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) in various proportions in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/14/on-the-charge-why-batteries-are-the-future-of-clean-energy\">cathode, a key part of any battery</a>. Early batteries contained the three metals in equal proportions, but companies such as South Korea\u2019s SK Innovation and LG Chem are close to producing cathodes with 80% nickel and only 10% cobalt, known as NMC 811. However, chemists have struggled to remove all cobalt, which is prized for stabilising the battery during recharging.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 chemicals company Johnson Matthey has been working on reducing the amount of cobalt in its enhanced lithium nickel oxide (eLNO) batteries at one of its research labs in Sonning Common, near Reading. Its batteries, thought to contain higher levels of manganese, could cut cobalt costs in half, according to analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.</p> <p>Johnson Matthey chose Poland for a factory to mass-manufacture the products, opening in 2022, which will eventually produce 10,000 tonnes of battery material a year. BASF and Umicore, rivals from Germany and Belgium, are also working on lower-cobalt chemistries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7de810f715289e26e7ddddeda437c1dde2be6f48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7de810f715289e26e7ddddeda437c1dde2be6f48/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel, aged 11, at work in a cobalt mine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel, aged 11, at work in a cobalt mine</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Meyer/Corbis via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The demand for batteries has pulled in investors from unlikely places. The US miner Platinum Group Metals is funding research by Florida International University into using palladium and platinum in battery cathodes and electrolytes, potentially delivering improvements to recharge speeds and stability.</p> <p>The company\u2019s chief executive, R Michael Jones, hopes that these technologies \u2013 which are still years away from prototype stage \u2013 will sustain demand for palladium and platinum, which are used for catalytic converters in internal combustion engine cars.</p> <p>Smaller British companies are also in the race, hoping to emulate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/09/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-awarded-for-work-on-lithium-ion-batteries\">Nobel prize-winning Oxford University researchers</a> who pioneered the lithium ion battery in the 1970s. Oxis Energy, based in the same research centre, is trying to develop lithium sulphur batteries with a claimed five times the energy density of current technology.</p> <p>Yet Caspar Rawles, a senior analyst at Benchmark Minerals, cautions that it will be years before battery manufacturers manage to eliminate cobalt completely. Recent price volatility has limited investment in new capacity, and the two-year shutdown of Glencore\u2019s Mutanda mine near Kolwezi could mean that artisanal miners become a key source of the metal as demand increases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"sign up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tesla\u2019s first Model S, launched in 2012, was built with an average of 11kg of cobalt per vehicle, but according to Benchmark Minerals that was down to about 4.5kg in its successor car, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/26/tesla-model-3-on-sale-in-uk-may-electric-car\">the Model 3</a>, which launched in 2018.

      "bodyText": "Followers of Elon Musk are used to big claims on Twitter. The social media habits of the Tesla and SpaceX billionaire have landed him in legal hot water on several occasions. But for the battery industry one boast stands out: a tweeted pledge to remove an obscure mineral mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo from the next generation of Tesla\u2019s electric cars. Batteries are the key component in the electric car revolution that Tesla kickstarted, and each one contains cobalt. Yet concerns about human rights abuses and child labour have prompted a dual effort to cut the amount of cobalt used in batteries and to clean up complex global supply chains. The battery industry accounts for the majority of global cobalt demand, and that demand is set to soar with more than $60bn (\u00a346bn) of investments in new battery factories during 2019, according to the data firm Benchmark Minerals. Musk tweeted his pledge in 2018 but demand for cobalt has since accelerated. Benchmark\u2019s forecasts suggest that global demand for cobalt in 2029 will be 300,000 tonnes compared with an estimated 70,000 tonnes used in 2019. Almost three-quarters of the world\u2019s cobalt supply is sourced from the DRC, a country whose rule of law is among the weakest in the world and which consequently has a terrible record on working conditions and child labour. The majority is then shipped to China, the world\u2019s largest battery manufacturer, to be processed. The car industry is by no means the only one implicated: the electronics manufacturers Apple, Google, Dell and Microsoft, as well as Tesla, were named in a US lawsuit last month by families who say their children were killed while mining cobalt used in their products. However, the surge in electric car sales \u2013 as regulations limit exhaust pipe carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 and the kilograms needed in each car mean that cobalt supply concerns will only become more acute. There are as many as 150,000 artisanal miners in Kolwezi, the regional capital in southern DRC that has become a major mining centre, according to Mark Dummett, a researcher on business and human rights at Amnesty International. Children working at the mines are easy to find within a five-minute drive of the city centre, he said. There has been some progress. The Congolese government has promised to pilot regulated areas for artisanal miners. Increasing consumer awareness has also led to supply chain auditing projects such as the Responsible Sourcing Network, run by the nonprofit organisation As You Sow, as well as two industry-led bodies, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance and Responsible Mining Initiative, to ensure that suppliers are up to standards set by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. Cobalt\u2019s human and financial costs, as well as the technological imperative to increase energy density, have prompted research efforts by battery makers to reduce their reliance on the metal. Most electric vehicle batteries use lithium ions, with nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) in various proportions in the cathode, a key part of any battery. Early batteries contained the three metals in equal proportions, but companies such as South Korea\u2019s SK Innovation and LG Chem are close to producing cathodes with 80% nickel and only 10% cobalt, known as NMC 811. However, chemists have struggled to remove all cobalt, which is prized for stabilising the battery during recharging. The FTSE 100 chemicals company Johnson Matthey has been working on reducing the amount of cobalt in its enhanced lithium nickel oxide (eLNO) batteries at one of its research labs in Sonning Common, near Reading. Its batteries, thought to contain higher levels of manganese, could cut cobalt costs in half, according to analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Johnson Matthey chose Poland for a factory to mass-manufacture the products, opening in 2022, which will eventually produce 10,000 tonnes of battery material a year. BASF and Umicore, rivals from Germany and Belgium, are also working on lower-cobalt chemistries. The demand for batteries has pulled in investors from unlikely places. The US miner Platinum Group Metals is funding research by Florida International University into using palladium and platinum in battery cathodes and electrolytes, potentially delivering improvements to recharge speeds and stability. The company\u2019s chief executive, R Michael Jones, hopes that these technologies \u2013 which are still years away from prototype stage \u2013 will sustain demand for palladium and platinum, which are used for catalytic converters in internal combustion engine cars. Smaller British companies are also in the race, hoping to emulate the Nobel prize-winning Oxford University researchers who pioneered the lithium ion battery in the 1970s. Oxis Energy, based in the same research centre, is trying to develop lithium sulphur batteries with a claimed five times the energy density of current technology. Yet Caspar Rawles, a senior analyst at Benchmark Minerals, cautions that it will be years before battery manufacturers manage to eliminate cobalt completely. Recent price volatility has limited investment in new capacity, and the two-year shutdown of Glencore\u2019s Mutanda mine near Kolwezi could mean that artisanal miners become a key source of the metal as demand increases. Tesla\u2019s first Model S, launched in 2012, was built with an average of 11kg of cobalt per vehicle, but according to Benchmark Minerals that was down to about 4.5kg in its successor car, the Model 3, which launched in 2018. That has been achieved using a nickel-cobalt-aluminium chemistry. However, further reductions in line with Musk\u2019s ambitions could be significantly harder. Tesla declined to share more details of its cobalt-reduction plans with the Guardian. Either way, battery makers have a responsibility to the people of DRC, many thousands of whom rely on cobalt mining for a living, said Amnesty\u2019s Dummett. \u201cIt\u2019s still a relatively new sector, and now is the opportunity to adopt responsible sourcing,\u201d he said.",

Authorities in both states have warned <strong>the danger is far from over</strong>. These fires will continue to burn for weeks, and any deterioration in conditions will again place lives and property in peril. In NSW, temperatures are <strong>forecast to reach the 40s again on Friday</strong>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Three emergency warnings remain active in Victoria</strong>, particularly in the <strong>Gippsland region</strong>, and <strong>four people</strong> remain missing in the state. It has been hard for authorities there to survey the damage, due to heavy smoke cover, and the lack of access to isolated communities. The evacuation from Mallacoota is continuing, since it was isolated on New Year\u2019s Eve. </li> \n   <li>No <strong>emergency warnings are active in NSW</strong>, but seven fires remain at the watch and act level. Crews have begun to <strong>assess the damage across the state</strong>, and believe <strong>at least 60 homes have been lost</strong>. That number is expected to increase significantly, as crews conduct further assessments. The <strong>worst-hit regions have been in the southern highlands</strong>, particularly <strong>Kangaroo Valley and Wingello</strong>, and the Snowy Mountains foothills, particularly in Batlow, where a man died trying to protect his friend\u2019s home. On the <strong>far south coast</strong>, Eden has not yet been reached by bushfire and concerns eased slightly on Sunday afternoon, when the fire was downgraded to watch and act status. Most of the town\u2019s residents have already been evacuated. Smaller towns south of Eden were hit hard, and experienced property loss. </li> \n   <li>A fire that flared up <strong>south-west of Sydney, at Voyager Point</strong>, is not threatening homes and firefighters were bringing it under control on Sunday evening. </li> \n   <li>A clearer picture has emerged from the fires that tore through <strong>Kangaroo Island in South Australia. The fires caused significant damage to the island\u2019s tourism industry, destroying businesses like the</strong> luxury Southern Ocean Lodge, and devastating the broader Flinders Chase wilderness area. The fire has also destroyed at least $20m worth of bluegum and pine trees on plantations run by Kanagaroo Island Plantation Timber.</li> \n   <li><strong>Air quality continued to be extremely poor in Canberra</strong>, where bushfire smoke caused the closure of multiple businesses, the cancellation of flights, the continued suspension of the postal service, and the movement of sporting teams and events. The government has promised stocks of P2 masks will be replenished today and tomorrow, following a shortage. </li> \n   <li>The prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, again came under scrutiny today for failing to tell the <strong>NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons,</strong> before he announced he was calling up 3,000 army reservists to help with the recovery effort. Fitzsimmons was furious. Morrison blamed a communications breakdown. Morrison also came under further pressure for the political ad he released about the federal government\u2019s efforts at the height of the crisis.</li> \n   <li>Morrison announced a new <strong>federal agency to coordinate bushfire recovery</strong> and support. He said he is considering whether a royal commission is needed. </li> \n   <li>An <strong>extraordinary outpouring of support</strong> has continued to <strong>fuel donations to firefighters and the Red Cross</strong>. The fundraising effort started by the comedian Celeste Barber has now attracted more than $20m in donations. The Victorian government has announced its own community relief fund and has urged residents not to donate goods, but instead make financial contributions. Large contributions have been made by Nicole Kidman, Ash Barty and Pink. <br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thanks again for sticking with us.

I think he would perhaps not describe himself as that, but he doesn\u2019t speak for many Australians.

What we found \u2013 this is an unprecedented natural disaster in terms of scope and defence engagement. <br></p> \n  <p>So what we have said to the states and territories and what the prime minister clearly said yesterday is we are ramping up more assets and making it known through our liaison officer network of what the states right down to the local community level can ask for. </p> \n  <p><strong>Speers: </strong>That work, as you said, has been there for a while. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds</strong>: You\u2019re talking over me again. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Speers:</strong> I\u2019m trying to establish what changed. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds:</strong> So what that means is that it is still finally the responsibility of the states and territories to ask and coordinate but we are forward positioning and we are making equipment and also activated reservists in these states to make sure the states are very clear on what we can do and we have the people and the resources in location so that they can respond very quickly. <br></p> \n  <p>So we\u2019ve now got, for example, with the army, we\u2019ve got specialist medical teams available, engineering teams, transport teams, aerial reconnaissance and also of course evacuation assets. <br></p> \n  <p>So it is ultimately still the states\u2019 and territories\u2019 call, but what the prime minister said yesterday is we are being as forward leaning as possible to make sure that we have the maximum amount of resources available when the states ask for it.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T23:13:33.783Z\">at 11.13pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e1113178f08c39722644de0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-04T22:36:54.127Z\">10.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That exchange continues:</p> \n  <p><strong>Speers: </strong>I\u2019m not talking about communication. My question, minister, sorry, was about consulting. Wouldn\u2019t you want to consult with the operational chief to make sure this is a necessary step rather than just simply making a decision and communicating it? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds:</strong> Well, David, you are conflating two issues there. The first one is in terms of the decision that the national security committee took yesterday, which was not only the call-out of the reserves, but also the other measures that we announced yesterday. That was done in absolute consultation with the states in terms of what more resources are required. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Speers:</strong> So <strong>Shane Fitzsimmons</strong> was consulted about this? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds:</strong> I said that the state authorities were consulted. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Speers:</strong> Shane Fitzsimmons, the fire commissioner, was consulted? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds:</strong> David, with respect, we have liasion officers at all of the impacted state headquarters. We\u2019ve got liasion officers and incident controllers right across New South Wales. We consulted very widely in terms of the resources ... </p> \n  <p><strong>Speers:</strong> This is an important point, minister. </p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds:</strong> The commissioner said this morning ... You\u2019re talking over me. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Speers:</strong> The commissioner said this morning that even the liasion officers you\u2019re referring to weren\u2019t aware of the details. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds:</strong> David, that\u2019s the reason we have the liasion officers out there. <br></p> \n  <p>I do acknowledge yesterday that we could have, defence could have worked quicker to push the information out. We acknowledged that yesterday. <br></p> \n  <p>We put measures in place to make sure that our defence change chain of command have that information available as soon as possible. <br></p> \n  <p>I would say in relation to the commissioner of New South Wales, that that information was passed to the premier.

Straight after that meeting, the prime minister personally contacted each of the impacted premiers to advise them of the measures that we had agreed to take. That was done before we went and made the public announcement. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Speers:</strong> Would you not want to consult the guy who\u2019s actually in charge operationally about whether this was a good idea? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds: </strong>Well, the prime minister has been in constant contact with the premiers, daily, in fact, in some cases. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Speers:</strong> I\u2019m talking about Shane Fitzsimmons, the fire commissioner. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Reynolds</strong>: David, you asked me a question, please allow me to answer it.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick wrap up of what we\u2019ve learned today. Conditions have eased in both Victoria and NSW, as temperatures drop and winds settle. Authorities in both states have warned the danger is far from over. These fires will continue to burn for weeks, and any deterioration in conditions will again place lives and property in peril. In NSW, temperatures are forecast to reach the 40s again on Friday. Three emergency warnings remain active in Victoria, particularly in the Gippsland region, and four people remain missing in the state. It has been hard for authorities there to survey the damage, due to heavy smoke cover, and the lack of access to isolated communities. The evacuation from Mallacoota is continuing, since it was isolated on New Year\u2019s Eve. No emergency warnings are active in NSW, but seven fires remain at the watch and act level. Crews have begun to assess the damage across the state, and believe at least 60 homes have been lost. That number is expected to increase significantly, as crews conduct further assessments. The worst-hit regions have been in the southern highlands, particularly Kangaroo Valley and Wingello, and the Snowy Mountains foothills, particularly in Batlow, where a man died trying to protect his friend\u2019s home. On the far south coast, Eden has not yet been reached by bushfire and concerns eased slightly on Sunday afternoon, when the fire was downgraded to watch and act status. Most of the town\u2019s residents have already been evacuated. Smaller towns south of Eden were hit hard, and experienced property loss. A fire that flared up south-west of Sydney, at Voyager Point, is not threatening homes and firefighters were bringing it under control on Sunday evening. A clearer picture has emerged from the fires that tore through Kangaroo Island in South Australia. The fires caused significant damage to the island\u2019s tourism industry, destroying businesses like the luxury Southern Ocean Lodge, and devastating the broader Flinders Chase wilderness area. The fire has also destroyed at least $20m worth of bluegum and pine trees on plantations run by Kanagaroo Island Plantation Timber. Air quality continued to be extremely poor in Canberra, where bushfire smoke caused the closure of multiple businesses, the cancellation of flights, the continued suspension of the postal service, and the movement of sporting teams and events. The government has promised stocks of P2 masks will be replenished today and tomorrow, following a shortage. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, again came under scrutiny today for failing to tell the NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, before he announced he was calling up 3,000 army reservists to help with the recovery effort. Fitzsimmons was furious. Morrison blamed a communications breakdown. Morrison also came under further pressure for the political ad he released about the federal government\u2019s efforts at the height of the crisis. Morrison announced a new federal agency to coordinate bushfire recovery and support. He said he is considering whether a royal commission is needed. An extraordinary outpouring of support has continued to fuel donations to firefighters and the Red Cross. The fundraising effort started by the comedian Celeste Barber has now attracted more than $20m in donations. The Victorian government has announced its own community relief fund and has urged residents not to donate goods, but instead make financial contributions. Large contributions have been made by Nicole Kidman, Ash Barty and Pink. Thanks again for sticking with us. It\u2019s been another challenging day and we\u2019re far from out of the woods yet. The forest scientist Tom Fairman has just published a really interesting thread on the impact of recurring fire events on the snow gums in Victoria\u2019s alpine region. Faces from the southern highlands, by the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Hromas. The region endured a torrid night last night, when fires raced north from the Shoalhaven River. The scale of the damage is slowly being revealed today, and we now know multiple homes were lost in Kangaroo Valley and Wingello. Svitzer, a tug boat company, has performed exceptionally throughout the fire crisis on the NSW far south coast. The company has just posted this on Instagram: More than 60 local residents, aged between six months and 90 years old, took shelter on Cooma and Wistari, which remained moored to the Eden wharf overnight. The team made it safely through the night with two emergency callouts performed by Svitzer pilot boat Mersey over the course of the evening The Australian tennis champion Ash Barty has promised to donate any prize money she earns from next week\u2019s Brisbane International to the Red Cross. That could be up to $382,000 if she wins the tournament. She follows Nick Kyrgios, who pledged to donate $200 per ace served over the summer. Meanwhile, the actress Nicole Kidman has pledged to donate $500,000. The American pop star Pink donated $500,000 yesterday. The fundraising campaign started by the comedian Celeste Barber has now received more than $20m. Some good news in Bundanoon in the NSW southern highlands, where we\u2019ve had a little rain. We also witnessed some rain earlier today in Batemans Bay on the south coast, which has been ravaged by fire. Rob Rogers say the RFS is comfortable for people to stay in Eden currently. He says the fire has not reached the town. Crews are there. We are watching the fire and if the situation changes, we will advise that community but at the moment, we need to let the community just recover a little bit. They have had a rough day and a rough night last night and obviously we will stay closely monitoring that. He says the fire burning at Voyager Point, in Sydney\u2019s south-west, has not been contained. But he says he is comfortable that the fire will be brought under control this evening. In the southern highlands, he says firefighters are using the easing conditions to build containment lines. Their focus on the active fires continues to be to prevent property loss. Rogers says the bushfire threat is not going anywhere, anytime soon. There is an enormous amount of fire in that part of the world and these aren\u2019t going to go out for some time and we have been dealing with these fires non-stop now for more than five months and I can\u2019t see that changing, certainly over the next month, so it does make you think of, you know, six months of constantly dealing with fires and just where that will end. The RFS deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, has confirmed at least 60 homes have been lost across the state. We haven\u2019t been able to get a lot of aircraft off the ground today but I can confirm there is confirmed 60 homes lost but we know there is more. And we know there is a significant damage to infrastructure in the Snowy area and we also know that there are communities like Batlow that have been extremely hard-hit and we really have to get in there and have a good look at everything that has been damaged and we are also aware of significant impact to livestock in the area. Images are continuing to emerge from the southern highlands, where some towns were was overcome by fire on Saturday evening. Embers from the Currowan fire jumped the Shoalhaven River and started a new blaze that moved northward towards the town of Wingello, where multiple homes have been destroyed. These images are from Guardian photographer Jessica Hromas, who was on the scene today. New Zealand\u2019s defence force is pitching in to help Australia. The defence minister Ron Mark announced NZ would send three NH90 helicopters and crew, two NZ Army combat engineer sections, and a command element to support the ADF. \u201cThis latest NZDF support is being provided in addition to the latest rotation of five NZDF firefighters deployed to bolster numbers of emergency responders on the ground,\u201d Mark said in a statement. Just back on those air quality issues in the ACT for a moment. Residents have been frustrated by shortages in P2 masks. To make matters worse, Australia Post has suspended services in the territory because of the heavy bushfire smoke, so ordering online is no help. Chief minister Andrew Barr now says new stocks of masks are due in Canberra, through chemists and hardware stores, either today or tomorrow. The Voyager Point fire burning to Sydney\u2019s south-west is causing nearby residents considerable concern. But the RFS has advised that crews are working to contain the fire and that there is no threat to homes. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews mentioned a little earlier that relief centres were struggling to process donated goods like clothing and food. Victoria\u2019s emergency services have echoed that message. They want people to channel their noble intentions into donating cash instead. The terrible air quality in the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 rated the worst in the world on three separate days in recent weeks \u2013 is continuing to pose problems. This time, one of the ACT\u2019s universities, the University of Canberra, has announced it has been forced to close its main campus for 48 hours. Eerie footage of the drive between Tumut and Batlow in the foothills of NSW\u2019s Snowy Mountains. Posted by Tom Lowrey, a reporter with the ABC. The Kangaroo Island fire has also destroyed at least $20m worth of blue gum and pine trees on plantations run by Kanagaroo Island Plantation Timber. On Friday KIPT said it was still assessing the damage, but at least 13% of its forests had been burned. The company said it would try to salvage wood from the areas that have already burned by bringing forward harvesting. \u201cIt was unfightable\u201d, Bates said of the fire. \u201cIs this our new normal? That\u2019s the fear.\u201d She said the fires were \u201cgreatly subdued, but we\u2019re in for some warmer weather midweek\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Fire crews from Adelaide have relieved tired local volunteers, but Bates said locals would be keen to handle the mop up. She said tourists were evacuated to Penneshaw before boarding Sealink ferries to the mainland. \u201cThis is our very busiest peak time, this is when the influx comes\u201d, she said. \u201cThere were 10 or 11,000 people here, in total \u2013 that\u2019s a bit of a guess.\u201d Visitors have been asked not to come to the island unless it is essential. \u201cMost tourists want to visit our beautiful iconic sites \u2013 and of course there\u2019s no access to that end of the island,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIt\u2019s best to give us all a bit of breathing space and then come back later.\u201d Farmers on Kangaroo Island were shooting fire-injured sheep on Sunday as the small community prepared for more dangerous days ahead when hot weather returns in the middle of the week. Ferries to the mainland have been running almost around the clock to evacuate thousands of tourists back to the South Australian mainland, former mayor Jayne Bates said. Bates lives in Penneshaw, which is on the east of the island closest to the mainland and hosts its ferry terminal. Firefighters on the island have been battling fires since before Christmas that blazed out of control after extreme weather on Friday. The fires, which are still burning, started at the western end of the 160km-long island, and have burned about a third of it, devastating the island\u2019s two main industries, tourism and farming. Most of the tourist attractions are at the western end of the island. They include the luxury Southern Ocean Lodge, which has been destroyed by fire, and the broader Flinders Chase wilderness area. Bates said a large number of farm buildings had also been destroyed. \u201cA lot of our blokes have gone out today to destroy injured sheep \u2013 you\u2019re talking thousands,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re digging pits.\u201d The fires were \u201cthe worst we\u2019ve ever had\u201d, she said. \u201cWe had a big one in 2007 but not to this extent.\u201d \u201cAnd the loss of the two lives \u2013 well.\u201d Former pilot Dick Lang and his son Clayton Lang were killed when fire over-ran their car on Friday. Back in NSW, the latest figures suggest 146 fires are still burning across the state. About 65 have not been contained. A huge firefighting effort is continuing with 2,700 personnel in the field. The RFS says no total fire ban has been issued for Monday. Andrews is also quizzed on whether Victoria is doing enough hazard reduction work in the lead-up to the bushfire season. He said it\u2019s getting harder and harder to find safe times to do hazard reduction burns. Andrews also praised the logistical and funding support offered by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to Victoria. I was pleased to hear the prime minister really clear about the fact that we\u2019ll get everything we need and indeed more than that. We are also very pleased that he\u2019s not hung up on a 50/50 funding arrangement and some of these things will be beyond the capacity of Victoria, New South Wales, any state really, to be able to get it done on our own or even perhaps on equal terms. I\u2019m also very pleased this is not just about, as important as it is, roads, bridges, public housing and schools and the other infrastructure, the full damage to which won\u2019t be known until we can get into the communities and complete the disaster impact assessments we have been making. I\u2019m also pleased that the prime minister\u2019s also indicated that as far as driving economic growth, stimulus in getting the tourism industry going again, helping small business, supporting local councils, all of this is very positive news. Andrews announces the government will match the $2m donated to a Bendigo Bank community fund to support the bushfire recovery. He urges the community to donate cash instead of food and clothing. Andrews says they cannot take any more food and clothing donations. I don\u2019t want to appear harsh in any way, but we don\u2019t need any more clothes, food, trucks on our roads, we don\u2019t have the warehouse capacity, the people or the time to sort through. I know it all comes from a place of kindness and I thank everybody who\u2019s made those donations but we are getting to a point where we don\u2019t have the space or the people or the need. Importantly, he also announced the number of missing persons in Victoria has been reduced from seven to four. So we have found another three people from around between midday and now. We hope those numbers continue to fall but again we do have fears for the safety of those four people who we cannot account for and of course, there\u2019s still many communities that we have not been able to get into, particularly those that came under significant fire attack yesterday and throughout the evening, particularly in the north-east of our state. Daniel Andrews is speaking from a police operations centre in Victoria. He says conditions there have eased today, but the heavy smoke is creating new challenges. Today is a little easier, but there\u2019s a whole lot of additional challenges. The smoke, the visibility, we had hoped to fly into the incident control centre at Tallangatta, we were unable to be do that given how thick the smoke was. We hoped to be able to look at the fire damage on the way back to Melbourne, we couldn\u2019t do that because it wouldn\u2019t have been safe to do so. Despite the fact that it\u2019s a little easier, there is those extra challenges, smoke particularly in the north-east has been a really significant issue, but it\u2019s pleasing to note that with smoke clearing in Gippsland, we have been able do a number of airlifts to get people out of Mallacoota and again, the brigadier might want to update you on that or he can provide further information fur interested. Hi everyone, and thanks to Amy Remeikis for keeping us up to date this morning. The Victorian premier is just giving an update on the bushfires in that state now. I\u2019ll bring you that in a moment. For now, some distressing images are coming out of south-west Sydney, near Voyager Point. That fire is currently listed as only at the \u201cadvice\u201d level, but it is out-of-control. This is the current RFS advice for that fire: Current Situation The fire is burning to the north of Voyager Point, near Orlando Crescent. Conditions are easing. Firefighters are working to slow the spread of the fire. Advice Voyager Point or Hammondville and surrounding areas: Monitor the conditions. Activate your bush fire survival plan. Know what you will do if the fire threatens. Be alert for embers that may be blown ahead of the fire. This may create spot fires that threaten property before the main fire front arrives. I am going to hand you over to Chris Knaus for the evening. For those wanting a quick catch up: There are no emergency warnings in NSW at the moment, although the Eden fire is causing a bit of trouble. There is one emergency warning in Victoria. This emergency warning is being issued for Barwidgee, Bobinawarrah, Bowmans Forest, Buffalo Creek, Buffalo River, Carboor, Carboor East, Carboor Upper, Dandongadale, Edi Upper, Everton, Gapsted, Kneebones Gap, Markwood, Meadow Creek, Merriang, Merriang South, Milawa, Mount Buffalo, Myrtleford, Nug Nug, Rose River, Whorouly, Whorouly East, Whorouly South. Cooler conditions are giving a slight reprieve \u2013 firefighters are using it for shift changes and to attempt to get some more containment lines strengthened. There is some rain in some areas of the south coast, but not enough to make a difference. The ADF is continuing to evacuate people in Mallacoota \u2013 everyone who wants out should be able to leave today. Scott Morrison has defended his leadership again, including releasing an ad detailing the government\u2019s ADF response. Again \u2013 thank you. Please, take care of you. There are not a lot of flights coming in or out of Canberra at the moment. Here is one of the reasons why: Scott Morrison is asked what his message is, to the world at large, which is watching, and told that the social media hashtag is \u201cAustralia is on fire\u201d. His response is brief. Thank you for your support. He is again asked about his leadership during this crisis: The response you are seeing rolled out here in Australia at a state and commonwealth level is unprecedented. This is the largest single call out ever of defence force reservists, working together with our fall time defence forces to provide support which this country has never seen before. On top of that, the financial support that will be provided, I made more announcements about that yesterday, but already some 25 million working in close partnership with the states and territories. What matters is the resources are made available on the ground, the delivery of services necessary in the building and recovery effort that we will see in the future, the focus on the work that needs to be done, by the commissioner, the premier and the major general. Scott Morrison is asked if he has apologised to Shane Fitzsimmons for not telling him in advance about the ADF deployment \u2013 he says he has already done that. The defence force chief Angus Campbell is also there. Shane Fitzsimmons though, seizes the chance to provide another update: I can confirm that we have still got 150 fires across New South Wales, we are certainly seeing an easing of condition right across the state, has even been a bit of drizzle down on the south coast, and it certainly is a welcome reprieve, it is psychological relief if nothing else, all the communities being affected by these fires, but unfortunately it is not putting out the fires, it is not helping us with the furthering of the work of backburning and consolidation, so we will have to wait and see this moisture dissipated so we can get on with the important work of containment lines and backburning and consolidation right across the enormity of these playgrounds are. Hundreds of thousands of hectares, as a matter of fact, millions of hectares currently in New South Wales, and we will do that right to the coming week before we see a return to these warm and windy conditions at the end of the week. All our fires are off the emergency warning level, we have nine at the watch and act alert level which is indicative of ongoing fire behaviour and potential, and fire still burning in and around lots of communities. A lot of damage and destruction, so roads are being assessed and repaired and being made good, so people, please sustain your vigilance, maintain the focus, yes, we can take a bit of a reprieve in the weather conditions but what we have to do is remain focused, complacency kills, and we still have a long part of this summer to go. Gladys Berejiklian is very quick: It is good to be here and to continue to work together, the defence forces have already been embedded in our operations intimately in New South Wales, a significant number of months, and we are grateful for the report we have seen today, with this ongoing close working relationship. The prime minister doesn\u2019t want a press conference \u2013 he mentions both he and the premier had \u201cfairly lengthy\u201d ones already today, and they need to move on. There is a cabinet meeting tomorrow, as well as a meeting of the national security committee of cabinet. The prime minister, who said he would join Gladys Berejiklian and Shane Fitzsimmons today, is in Nowra. I want to thank you premier for the close work and the relationship we have had over many months as we work through all of these fires. ...And also thank you, commissioner Fitzsimmons, for your leadership going back to August for you, and I note that puts a very heavy load on you, and despite that, you turn up fresh every single day, and it\u2019s always a great encouragement to see that. Has been a good opportunity for you and of course the commissioner in the premier and I to talk about the announcement that was made yesterday, and to address any range of issues to make sure we have close communication in place and looking forward to it being a very strong relationship going forward, as it indeed has been, due to the nature of the ADF and New South Wales operations for very long time. NSW emergency services minister David Elliot has visited Wingello with deputy RFS commissioner, Rob Rogers. The small village of about 300 people in the southern highlands was hit hard last night. At least six properties are confirmed destroyed \u2013 many of the along the main street. In the backstreets there are black paddocks and molten cars. Elliot greets a number of firefighters there. They have had a big couple of days and tonight\u2019s prospects are concerning. He asks a few of them what they need. \u201cWe\u2019re good, thanks David, we\u2019ve got everything\u201d, one says. Speaking to the ABC, Elliot says there are going to be huge concerns for mental health and trauma among the firefighters and affected residents. He notes the mental health funding and services announced by the NSW government. \u201cMy advice is if you need it, use it\u201d, he says. \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed\u2026we all need help.\u201d He\u2019s also asked about going on holidays. Elliot says that the holiday was planned with his family a long time ago, and that plan always included coming straight back if he was needed. He says that\u2019s exactly what he did. The ACT is expecting 100,000 P2 masks from the commonwealth tomorrow morning. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr: I know this is extraordinary bad air quality. This is an extraordinary situation and no-one wants to be in this situation but please, stay indoors and stay safe. Andrew Barr is addressing the media. Canberra has the worst air quality in the world at the moment. Barr says masks are coming (you should be able to get them at your local chemists, with some hardware stores also providing them) but he advises residents to avoid leaving their homes. Again, the very best advice from ACT Health is the best way to limit your exposure to this smoke is to stay indoors. I want to repeat that, the best way, far and away, to avoid that smoke exposure is to stay indoors. Please do so. It may seem a bit better today but we are just in the eye of the storm, Victorian authorities say. When you\u2019ve had a rush of hot weather and you had people\u2019s adrenaline up, and people can actually see the danger, they can see the fire, they can see the smoke, when that updates and you get a cool spell of weather and the weather will move in cycles, people definitely let their guard down. There\u2019s absolutely no doubt that. At the moment, I\u2019m sure people will be thinking, \u2018That\u2019s all over for me. That\u2019s the end of it.\u2019 This is a slight reprieve in the weather. The danger is the fire conditions will return and we are saying to the community, the tourists and anyone else in the fire-affected area, this is simply a reprieve. People need to be prepared to act again and when we put the call out to leave now or to self evacuate, please listen to those messages and move on. [cont from previous post] Likewise David and Denise Gatrell, who have set up camp on the water\u2019s edge. They evacuated from the village of Towanba, near Eden, last week. First they moved to Eden, then, like John, got sent into Merimbula last night. \u201cWe decided to leave early because a fire was a new experience for us and we were worried we might panic if we stayed,\u201d Denise said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told the village is safe for now but the fire is apparently circling around the village so we don\u2019t know.\u201d Just in the past few minutes a few things have happened. First, the fire in Eden was downgraded from emergency level to watch and act. Then the first aerial support anyone has seen for a while started flying overhead. And now, incredibly, it\u2019s started to rain a little bit. Not enough to make much of a difference, I\u2019d say, but enough to elicit a few cheers from the people camping here. Greetings from Merimbula, just north of Eden on the New South Wales far south coast. I\u2019ve travelled over here today from the Snowy Mountains. After the drive I think I know how Frodo felt heading into Mordor. The light went from orange to red to black and then back again. There are people scattered everywhere. The official evacuation centre at the Sapphire Club is at or near capacity, and a lot of people have just taken up residence in parks along the water\u2019s edge. I spoke to a few of them just a minute ago and they\u2019re in remarkably good cheer despite what they\u2019ve been through. A number of people have been evacuated twice, first into Eden and then, last night, into Merimbula. Eden resident John Ironmonger got a knock on the door from the police at 5pm yesterday was told to get out. Like everyone here, he had no idea whether his property had come under threat and is staying put with a friend for the time being. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get back into Eden and to be honest I wouldn\u2019t want to go back yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was pretty bad yesterday. The sky was much darker than it is here and we didn\u2019t really know what was happening. \u201cThe information wasn\u2019t really coming through other than the local ABC which is all we\u2019ve been relying on. If the house goes it goes, we\u2019re here and we\u2019re safe. \u201cEveryone here has just been shuffled around from place to place.\u201d But the reprieve is not predicted to last long: So while we have these cooler temperatures now, they say by Thursday we should start to see a return of the 40-degree temperatures north of the Great Dividing Range and high 30s south, and weather modelling is indicating another windy weather change Thursday or Friday this week. So while we have relaxed those warnings, we expect emergency warnings to return to the landscape with those dangerous conditions later in the week. There\u2019s an update on the East Gippsland fires: So the cool weather, all that means is we have a bit of time to take a breath in the firefight, we have a bit of time to refocus, we have a bit of time to readjust and to try and somehow come to grips with what we have been seeing in the last few days in East Gippsland. In East Gippsland so far, we have seen nearly 800,000 hectares of forest and farmland affected by fire. And we expect that still to continue to grow as the conditions deteriorate again later this week. So we are asking the community at the moment if they do want to return to their properties, and their access is clear, it is safe to do that at the minute but that they continue to still need to watch and monitor the VicEmergency app and as emergencies and situations change, that they act and heed those warnings and get out of the way of these fires as they move through the landscape. Looks like the M5 is moving again, if you, or someone you know, were stuck on that. It was silly at the time too. Anyone with a newborn, an elderly loved one, or just respiratory issues which make them more vulnerable are in distress. Even if they live in high-rise buildings and vote differently from the Queensland MP. P2 masks are coming to Canberra. They are sold out across the capital, and with mail deliveries still suspended and planes increasingly unable to land, there has been no word on when they would be restocked. John Howard continued: \u201cIt is going to go on for some weeks. And the loss of life has been quite tragic. Any loss of life is tragic in a disaster like this, although the scale in Victoria of some 10 years ago \u2013 was close to 180 people \u2013 perhaps it is a reflection on the more compact nature of Victoria and more people living in houses very close to the bush. What is inspiring out of all of the gloom and personal grief and loss is the volunteer spirit. They are magnificent, those men and women who do the volunteer firefighting. It is something that I think is going around the world ... What is really amazing is the response to the fact that we have all these volunteers who come out, day after day, hour after hour. I\u2019ve got friends who are doing it and it is just part and parcel of life. And it is a reminder of our bush origins too. And that\u2019s something that is quite important. So it is a terrible tragedy and we haven\u2019t seen the end of it yet, but it does bring out the very best in us. And that\u2019s something we ought to be incredibly grateful for amidst the terrible sadness of young men being killed in the service of saving their neighbours. I turned 80 last year, so from that perspective, I can\u2019t recall such a long phase of smoke haze,\u201d John Howard tells ABC Grandstand about the fires. What is different about this set of bushfires is both the intensity and the spread. To have them in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and not long ago in parts of Queensland at the same time is different. For those who have been asking where David Hurley has been, the governor general has been out and about. He\u2019s just been a bit quieter about it. The latest update from VicEmergency is out: This watch and act message is being issued for Castleburn, Cobbannah, Cowa, Crooked River, Dargo, Grant, Shepherdson, Tabberabbera, Talbotville, Waterford, Wongungarra, Treasures. The bushfires north and east of Dargo, Tabberabbera and surrounding areas are not yet under control. Fire activity has subsided in today\u2019s benign weather conditions. Use this time to review your bushfire plan and make any changes needed. John Howard has had a busy day. He took a call from Scott Morrison this morning and has just popped into the Sydney ABC 702 cricket commentary box. Conditions in Victoria have eased but there is no end in sight to the danger. In case you missed Shane Fitzsimmons this morning, here you go: Big four bank ANZ says it will donate at least $1m to bushfire relief, including $300,000 for volunteer fire services in NSW, Victoria and South Australia and $500,000 for local community support services and home loan customers who face financial hardship after their houses burned down. It comes after accounting firm KPMG on Friday pledged a bushfire donation at the same time as it cancelled its annual couta boat race for chief executives. All the banks also have hardship programs in place for customers hit by the fires. The border fire has been downgraded to watch and act. Victoria\u2019s Country Fire Authority has asked people in Freeburgh, Harrietville, Smoko, Wandiligong and surrounding areas in the state\u2019s high country to evacuate because multiple fires in the district are not yet under control. The CFA warns those who stay that emergency services may not be able to help them. A relief centre is open at the Wangaratta Performing Arts Centre. Daniel Andrews has had to delay his press conference, the ABC reports, because his plane can\u2019t land due to smoke. On Wonboyn, where up to 30 people sheltered in a NSW RFS shed after they were cut off by the border fire, the RFS is working on accessing them today. \u201cThere\u2019s a search and rescue operation for those who may still be trapped in townships such as Wonboyn,\u201d the RFS\u2019s Ben Shepherd told the ABC. Getting supplies to them will probably have to come by sea. Helen Davidson has arrived in Wingello. She says six homes have been confirmed to have been destroyed so far, with another four in Bundanoon. If you need help with the government\u2019s disaster management payment application, Centrelink call centres are open. Disaster payment line 180 22 66 open today until 5pm AEDT. Meanwhile New Zealand police have had to ask people in Auckland to stop calling their version of 000, because the sky (orange, as the sunlight is filtered through Australia\u2019s bushfire smoke) is freaking them out. Latest update on the NSW fires: Meanwhile, Australia has reached \u201cpray for\u201d status on social media thanks to French footballer Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s efforts on Instagram and Twitter. Earlier today the Paris Saint-Germain forward, who has more than 37m followers on Instagram, urged his followers on both social media platforms to #prayforaustralia. So far the Instagram version of the message has more than 2m likes. Celeste Barber\u2019s fundraiser is now at $21.5m. She started it on 3 January. The government pledged $26m for additional aerial support on Saturday. Barber\u2019s fundraising could top that. Here is the latest warning on the Eden fire: Current Situation The fire crossed the Victorian border and spread rapidly following a strong southerly change. The fire is burning south of Eden. The fire has impacted the areas of Wonboyn, Kiah, Narrabarba and surrounds. The fire also spread on its western edge near Burragate. Building impact assessment teams will be deployed to assess damage to properties. Advice Wonboyn, Kiah, Narrabarba and surrounds The fire has moved through this area. Monitor the conditions and know what you will do if the fire threatens. Be alert for falling trees and branches. A number of roads are fire affected, blocked or closed. Burragate and Towamba Monitor changing conditions and remain in place. Seek shelter as the fire approaches and protect yourself from the heat of the fire. A number of roads are blocked and closed. Be alert to embers and spot fires. Be aware of the danger of falling trees and branches. Wyndham, Rocky Hall, Nethercote, Eden and surrounds Monitor the conditions and know what you will do if the fire threatens. If your plan is to leave, or you are not prepared, leave towards Merimbula or Pambula. Be alert for falling trees and branches. Local roads may be affected by fire, blocked or closed. The areas of Merimbula, Pambula and surrounds are not under threat. According to the Live Traffic App, there is a section of the M5 which is closed in both directions between Henry Lawson Drive and Heathcote Rd in Hammondville because of thick smoke from nearby fires. The border fire (which was renamed overnight as fires on the Victorian and NSW border merged) is still the one fire crews are most worried about. That is the one that is impacting Eden. More totally normal things. Reports flights are being diverted because of the smoke. Cooma is also dealing with the flooding impacts of a 4.5m-litre water tank exploding. Asked if Labor could also be accused of playing politics with this \u2013 which is what it is accusing the government of having done \u2013 Ed Husic has this to say: I am happy if people get me for the strength of my criticism that I have levelled today, but I think a lot of people will be hopping mad that the way this has been managed at the national level by this government has been found wanting, either drawing national or international criticism about the way they have been going. But I think it is absolutely right to call out some of this stuff because we expect, deserve, and should see it coming out of this government. And I think it\u2019s important that this be called out now in an effort to see better emerge. Because people in those communities, they need support, they need serious support. They don\u2019t need it after the event, they need it right now. Ed Husic is speaking to David Speers about the government\u2019s response and the ad: I was genuinely concerned that the RFS commissioner\u2019s intervention demonstrated something deeper, which is potentially that the RFS had not been consulted or engaged early enough or substantively enough in the federal government\u2019s response that was hurriedly announced yesterday, because they are saying it will take time for them to integrate what has been proposed with their own efforts. So it was not just an issue of communication, it\u2019s an issue of consultation. It\u2019s an issue of using resources in a timely and effective way. And I think we should be all hopping mad about this. And if I can say, I think what the federal government, the way they have been managing this, has either been mean-spirited, flat-footed, or in some cases wrongfooted, and we are absolutely entitled to expect better in terms of the quality of leadership than we are seeing at the national level. It is just plain wrong. Ben Shepherd from the NSW RFS just clarified the Eden advice (in case there was any further confusion) on the ABC: As you just mentioned we did have the fire move across the border yesterday afternoon and move quickly through the areas of one point and move towards Eden. As you mentioned it is still safe for people to move up that roadway towards Merimbula but that road may be closed at short notice. For those people where the path is not clear, it is best to move inside a house or solid structure as the fire moves through to protect you from the heat of the fire. There are fire trucks in the area. There is reduced visibility. We need people to start today and know what they will do when the fire threatened ... Ideally if people have the time to move, we would like them to move on. Being outside, especially as a fire moves through, you are exposed to the smoke and embers, which is not pleasant obviously. If they have time to move to places like Merimbula which is safer than in the Eden township we are asking people to follow those orders. We will continue to provide alerts as they come to hand as well. People should be following those directions. Totally normal things. Ian Campbell, the emergency operations spokesman for the Bega Valley shire council, has just spoken to ABC local radio about the situation in Eden and its surrounds. He says most residents have already left the town. But the message to those who remain is to monitor the situation closely. He said: \u201dMany people have left Eden this morning on the back of advice from NSW police and the Rural Fire Service. Certainly for those still in Eden, it\u2019s crucial that you monitor conditions, get yourself in a safe place, and be aware of what\u2019s going on.\u201d It\u2019s clear that properties just south of Eden have already been lost. Fire and Rescue NSW units in Eden reported an hour ago that they had just attended a house on Jim McMahon Drive in Kiah. A \u201cvery slow fire\u201d was travelling through the area and had destroyed some homes. And for those needing help with their insurance claims. So much of our wildlife is in distress. Australia\u2019s smoke is still reaching New Zealand. Journalists on the ground in Eden are reporting police told people gathered at the Eden wharf they had to evacuate unless they were fully prepared to protect their property. Many of those people have moved north to Merimbula, which also looks like the gates of hell have been opened. Just a little update on the situation in Eden. There is some conflicting information coming out about evacuation advice. Police and the Bega Valley shire council are telling people to leave to Merimbula or Bega immediately. But the Rural Fire Service says no evacuation order is in place for Eden. We\u2019re trying to get some clarity on this. In his press conference earlier, Scott Morrison argued that his government had always drawn the link between climate change and the bush fires and that was not in dispute. Someone may want to tell backbencher Craig Kelly that. Not 24 hours ago, he was on BBC radio in the UK telling listeners that scientists claim there is no link between the fires, the drought, and climate change: HOST: So just to be clear, Mr Kelly. I want to be clear in what you\u2019re saying. You are saying there is no link between these fires in your view and global climate change? KELLY: Well, firstly there is no link. The facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment and on this our climate scientists down here have been very clear and they have said that there is no link between drought and climate change. This claim seems to be the one often evoked on Sky News. The claim that the climate scientist who they quote has repeatedly said is being misquoted. When asked if he was speaking for many Australians, Labor MP Catherine King explained where Kelly sits: HOST: But Mr Kelly is speaking, isn\u2019t he, for many Australians who don\u2019t believe this and who believe the economy depends on mining jobs and this is in many ways a damaging plot to undermine the Australian economy. KELLY: *Chuckles* ... That\u2019s not exactly right, but anyway ... HOST: You\u2019ll have a chance to put it in your own words in a second, Mr Kelly. Catherine King first. KING: To be quite honest, within the parliament Craig is seen well on the far fringe of these issues. He\u2019s certainly not seen in the middle of these issues. Craig would be one of the people who is on the far right of the climate change debate. I think he would perhaps not describe himself as that, but he doesn\u2019t speak for many Australians. He speaks for a small proportion of Australians who have those views. The situation is deteriorating in Eden on the far south coast. A bushfire moved quickly up from the NSW-Victorian border last night, as the southerly change moved up the coast and turned fires northward. The fire, dubbed the \u201cborder fire\u201d, burned last night from the Victorian border to the southern shores of Twofold Bay. It has already affected the areas of Wonboyn, Kiah, Narrabarba and surrounds. Properties have been damaged and building impact assessment teams will be deployed to assess the destruction. The border fire is threatening the town of Eden. An update posted on the Bega Valley shire council\u2019s website a short while ago warned Eden residents, including those in Snug Cove Wharf, to leave now and head to Merimbula or Bega. Authorities were still attempting to define the fire line near Eden. \u201cEden residents, if you are not prepared to mentally and physically defend you house, leave now,\u201d the advice read. \u201cIf you are in the areas of Burragate and Towamba, it is too late to leave. The RFS is advising that you seek shelter as the fire approaches and protect yourself from the heat of the fire.\u201d Authorities say Merimbula, Pambula and surrounding areas are not under threat. The Princess Highway remains closed at Broadwater to southbound traffic. We\u2019re also getting reports that journalists in Eden to cover the far south coast bushfires are being told to evacuate. NORTHERN TERRITORY * No bushfires * Five homes confirmed destroyed ACT * No bushfires * Significant smoke haze from interstate blazes QUEENSLAND * About 30 bushfires burning * 250,000 hectares burned * 45 homes confirmed destroyed WESTERN AUSTRALIA * 30 bushfires burning * 1.5m hectares burned * One home confirmed destroyed TASMANIA * 23 bushfires burning, three of significance * 30,000ha burned * Two homes confirmed destroyed Just to update you on the fire situation across the country. Here is what is happening in each state (via AAP): NSW * 18 people dead * 150 bushfires burning, 64 uncontained * More than 3.6m hectares burned, greater than the size of Belgium * 1,365 homes confirmed destroyed but number expected to rise significantly VICTORIA * Two people dead, seven missing * About 40 bushfires burning * More than 970,000ha burned * 330 structures confirmed destroyed but significantly more expected SOUTH AUSTRALIA * Three people dead * 15 bushfires burning, four of significance * More than 200,000ha burned * 88 homes confirmed destroyed but number expected to rise significantly The Brumbies are (temporarily) leaving Canberra because of the air quality. The number of people missing in Victoria has risen from six to seven, the police minister, Lisa Neville, says. Neville and the emergency services commissioner, Andrew Crisp, have been speaking to the media. She says the state of disaster declared on Thursday will \u201ccontinue today and for the next few days\u201d. The state of disaster, which gives the government extraordinary powers, will stay in place to help authorities deliver relief to fire-hit communities and \u201cbecause we also now are facing some more spike days, particularly Thursday and Friday and particularly up in that north-east area where we have got those active fires that have spread and moved around,\u201d Neville says. Crisp says the emergency is not over. \u201cIt is still dynamic, it is still dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to be aware of the conditions where you are at the moment.\u201d The rain will allow emergency services to get into communities that have been cut off but will not end the danger, he says. \u201cIn terms of people thinking that the rain is going to put the fires out, that\u2019s not the case. There is such a drought, there has been such a drought, particularly in these Gippsland areas, we know these fires are with us for a long time.\u201d So much of the country looks like this at the moment: My colleague Josh Taylor will have more for you on this in a moment, but Craig Kelly went on BBC radio a little earlier and said there was no link between climate change and these fires. He was representing the government when he said it. Well firstly there is no link. The facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment and on this our climate scientists down here have been very clear and they have said that there is no link between drought and climate change. Labor\u2019s Catherine King, who was also being interviewed, explained that Kelly was on the far right. Someone might need to let Scott Morrison know, given his comments this morning: I have to correct the record here. I have seen a number of people suggest that somehow the government does not make this connection. The government has always made this connection and that has never been in dispute. This is distressing but this is just some of what people are dealing with and will have to continue dealing with over the next few weeks and months, so it is important. Victorian authorities say that everyone who wants to get out of Mallacoota should be able to evacuate today. There are also supplies coming into the town for those who choose to stay. Richard Marles on the other hand, did not beat around the bush: The first thing besides this, the Australian defence force has to be above party politics. Scott Morrison and the Liberal party do not own the Australian army. They don\u2019t. Yesterday was one of the worst weather days in this horrendous fire season. And what the prime minister chose to do on that day was to go out and make a party political ad. I mean, we need, in a time of national crisis, national leadership. We need a prime minister who is the prime minister for all Australians, irrespective of how they vote. But if Scott Morrison can\u2019t see himself as being anything more than a Liberal party agent, then ultimately he is not the prime minister for anyone. I mean, what this is about and what we saw this morning is the loss of homes. This is about the loss of lives. This is an unprecedented event which is enormously scary for the whole nation. And what we need is a government which is there providing support for people, providing a sense of comfort, and providing national leadership. What this is not about is the popularity of the prime minister. What this is not about is Liberal party polling. What this is not about is making a party political ad. And what this is not about is Scott Morrison\u2019s own image. Anthony Albanese held a press conference at the same time as Scott Morrison. As per the transcript, he was asked about Morrison\u2019s leadership and Shane Fitzsimmons\u2019 criticisms and said he was \u201cdetermined, during this crisis, to not focus on Scott Morrison\u201d but rather on the people affected by the fires. But he did also mention this: It really is up to the prime minister to explain how it is that he was able to ring the police commissioner about Angus Taylor but didn\u2019t ring the commissioner for the Rural Fire Service in New South Wales about a significant change in policy and strategy that he announced yesterday. People in an area near Mt Buffalo have been told to get out before it gets too dangerous to leave. The area, which stretches from Whorouly South in the north down to the Rose River in the south, is west of an area surrounding Lake Buffalo which the Country Fire Authority ordered evacuated overnight. A bushfire near Lake Buffalo is burning out of control and there are reports of embers falling into the area around Dandongadale, to the south of the lake, the CFA said. The CFA said the fire was moving north and heavy smoke over the entire area would make driving dangerous. They had about six hours to leave, the authority said in a warning issued at 10.47am. People in the Buffalo River Valley should use the Buffalo River Rd to drive towards Myrtleford, those in South Whorouly and the Carboor area should use the Snow Rd to drive to Wangaratta, the CFA said. Meanwhile, fresh watch and act warnings have been issued in some of the areas that have already been hit by fires. These include Mallacoota and the Upper Murray area, including Corryong and Walwa. The last bit on Scott Morrison, on why he thinks there has been criticism of his response to this emergency: What I have noticed in these disasters, which has been \u2013 I was talking to prime minister John Howard this morning, former prime minister Howard this morning \u2013 in comparison with things that were dealt with in the past, there has always been, I think, a good understanding of the first responder nature of state governments. But on this occasion, I think the scale of things has been calling for a more \u2013 the role of national agencies, which have been there as I\u2019ve stressed, but how that flows on to these other questions of state responsibilities of hazard reduction and planning and development laws and things of that nature, that\u2019s fundamentally a discussion for the federation. I think people like things to be as local as possible. They want things to be delivered as locally as possible. That\u2019s always been my inclination. You can have no doubt that we will provide the national perspective on this and integration and coordination using the authorities that we have. People want to see that and just as those wanted to see what we\u2019ve announced yesterday and we built up to now for several weeks. So we will work together to do all those things. That\u2019s the key. We\u2019ve got to work together. We are working together. We are working together incredibly well. That is important, especially for the many months we\u2019ve got to go on this issue. No safe place in Eden. The fire has crossed the Victorian border. Residents are being told to move on futher to Bega or Merimbula - the wharf is no longer considered safe. Eden looks absolutely horrendous. People have been told to get out now. On his previous comments on hazard reduction, Scott Morrison also walks that back a little as well: Let me be clear first about the comments I made on hazard reduction. They\u2019ve been in response to questions like yours just now and they have also reflected what I have been told on the ground. Whether it\u2019s in East Gippsland or other parts of the country. So it would be no surprise to anyone who was closely associated with this, that that is a matter that I would say has been most commonly raised when I\u2019ve been out and about. You\u2019re correct to say those issues are overseen entirely by state governments. As many of the other issues that will come into play \u2013 whether it\u2019s planning and zoning laws and building codes and things of that nature. They are state responsibilities. What is important, I think, in the first instance, is to have a proper consideration of what the contribution of those factors are and what state and territory governments may do in response to those. Morrison has previously raised hazard reduction when asked about the government\u2019s climate change policies. Authorities have repeatedly said they did as many burns as they could, but the safe time of when they could carry out hazard reduction burns has been shortened \u2013 it is getting warmer, quicker, and the drought is exasperating fuel loads, meaning it is harder to get in and do the burns. (I wonder what could be causing that.) What would we do differently next summer? Scott Morrison (who is not at all impacted by the commentary, despite constantly bringing it up): Every summer we handle it differently. Every summer we handle it better. Every summer the response that is provided and the improved response that is provided undoubtedly ensures that we save more lives and save more homes and properties and we save more livelihoods. There\u2019s no doubt about that. After every event like this, we will all work together to do it better next time. I must say, as I said many months ago, our response to these calamitous bushfires is world leading. Australia\u2019s firefighters, emergency services, Australia\u2019s defence forces, are world leaders in responding to these events. That is on display out there now. As much as there will always be frustration when you cannot in all cases completely counteract the forces of nature, there will undoubtedly be shortfalls and frustrations, undoubtedly, but what you do is you identify them and you seek to improve on the way that you address those challenges again in the future, but one thing we can always rely on is the good nature and amazing spirit of the Australian people. That assists greatly in how we respond to these crises and keeping the focus amongst our authorities on the things we need to focus on. There are a lot of distractions out there at the moment. There\u2019s a lot of commentary out there on issues that are a long way away from the things that matter most and that is getting help to the people who need it now. Ultimately though, its the commentary which is to blame, according to Scott Morrison (who, for someone who is not attributing blame, brings this up several times): Let me assure Australians, the purpose is to communicate as simply and helpfully as we possibly can about what the government is doing to get resources, to get supports, to those places that need it. It\u2019s important, I think, that over-analysis of these things can create unnecessary anxiety and we\u2019re simply seeking to help people know what we\u2019re doing. It wasn\u2019t a Liberal party-sponsored ad. It was authorised by me, the leader of the Liberal party, the only thing can I post on my page. That is the same thing that applies to other politicians in Australia. It is simply complying with requirements of Australian law and to infer from that that there was some other purpose in these communications I reject absolutely, absolutely and the commentary on that along those lines, I think, is false. On the ad Scott Morrison\u2019s office released yesterday (complete with that ridiculous backing track), Morrison says: I think this issue received a lot of attention. Let me stress that the postings we\u2019ve made in messages has been to inform the community about what the commonwealth government is doing. That is what we must do. Wherever I\u2019ve been, people have said, \u2018What are you doing? What are you providing?\u2019 It\u2019s important that I communicate what we are doing with the Australian people. As much as we\u2019d all like to only rely on the reporting of the media to get that information out, I would also seek to carry that message directly to the Australian people to ensure they are aware of what we are doing. This is the same format that\u2019s been used to communicate these messages now for months, including the sorts of images you have referred to, and no objection has previously been made when that has been done. There\u2019s been some talk of the authorisation that sits on the end of that video message. That is a requirement of Australian law. It is not something that I can post on my social media page without carrying that authorisation. That does not mean it is a political message in any way, shape or form. It is just complying with Australian law. On whether or not the government was prepared \u2013 because, you know, the prime minister and the defence minister were out of the country, Scott Morrison says: As I have said on a number of occasions, we had similar fears going into last year\u2019s fire season and they were not realised. This year they have been realised and some. Well beyond even what the most severe predictions were. And that is why the response that we have now escalated to has been lifted to that level. There are many views in hindsight, and that is why you have ... the benefit of that hindsight to help you respond to future events, which no doubt will occur again in Australia. But the point, Scott Morrison says, is that we all keep working together: I mean, one part of this fire crisis and catastrophe across the country, which is not unprecedented in one way, but its extent is more extreme than we have seen, and that is the smoke and the haze that sits over this city, that sits over my home in Sydney, and many affected areas, and that smoke apart from its direct health effects, really does, I think, impact on people\u2019s sense of wellbeing, and that can have broader impacts about how people are feeling through these events. And despite all that I have been so impressed by the calmness and support people have provided. I understand that, I really do. Jenny and I understand it, our kids are here, they can breathe the smoke like everybody else, and we have the same concerns that others do who would be in an area that is not impacted directly by fire. But it makes it very ever-present in people\u2019s minds. I can understand how that contributes to how people are feeling about this issue around the country, and that is acknowledged, but what most importantly what is needed is that we just keep working together, and we are. On the blame that the Greens have been getting for this fire crisis (and Scott Morrison himself has raised the issue of hazard reduction at every opportunity, most notably when asked about the government\u2019s climate change policies), Morrison launches into a monologue on blame: There has been a lot of blame being thrown around. And now is a time to focus on the response that is being made. Plenty of people have blamed me, people have blamed the Greens, people have blamed ... Who knows? Blame. It doesn\u2019t help anybody at this time, and over-analysis of those things is not a productive exercise. The appropriate exercise at the moment is coming together, as David [Littleproud] was just saying. That is the other piece of feedback that I get in response to a lot of the noise and blame and commentary and analysis on particular issues that are a long way away from the main issue which we need to focus on, and it is a frustration in elements of the community that too much attention has been placed on that at the moment and there is a need for the community to want to come together, despite the great frustration. Despite the heavy sense of loss and the heavy sense of grief and the fear. Asked whether the government can still deliver its promised surplus, Scott Morrison says: Based on my media statement and my discussions with the treasurer, the treasurer is a member of the national security committee as is the minister for finance and we consider those matters yesterday, and the commitments that we can make, particularly what is needed right now, we can meet within our budget requirements as they are currently assessed. Obviously as you go into the budget, there are other economic parameters which will impact on that ultimate outcome, and I can\u2019t foreshadow those at this present point in time but based on the financial position that was outlined not that long ago in the media statement, that enables us particularly ... to be in a position and next year to be able to provide significant support.\u201d That\u2019s not an answer, you may note. Samantha Maiden gets Linda Reynolds to admit that she was also overseas on holidays during this crisis (it took quite a few repeated questions) Reynolds: Like many of my colleagues I have certainly spent time with my family over Christmas, but throughout that time I can assure you that I have been regularly on the phone with the prime minister, with Minister Littleproud constantly. Maiden: So you haven\u2019t been out of the country? Reynolds: I have had a holiday with my family. Maiden: Was that in Bali? Reynolds: Yes it was. I spent a few days with my family yes. So that is the prime minister (Hawaii), the defence minister (Bali) and the NSW emergency services minister (Europe) who all left the country this bushfire season In terms of \u201cmeet and beat\u201d, apart from the accounting trick of using the Kyoto credits there is also the issue of the amount of carbon these fires have released. You burn all that land, including the soil, and it will have a fairly significant impact. On whether or not Scott Morrison will talk to allies about what they are doing, he again uses the \u201cmeet and beat\u201d line: I participate in these discussions globally at this time and if you look at what is occurring in the United States and you look at what their emissions trajectory is currently, you will note that it is not increasing, and whether that is done and it is achieved in isolation as an individual country or how they choose to engage in an international agreement is ultimately a matter for sovereign governments to determine. Other governments are engaged in their commitments but I am pleased Australia is one of the countries that can say that this year, as we face this crisis, as climate change has impacted on the world\u2019s weather patterns that has led to where we are here today to some extent, combined with many other factors, the drought being the most significant, that right now, Australia is beating the commitments that have been made in 2020, and there are very few countries that can make that claim, so in terms of our response, particularly what we have been able to do, it means our emissions per year are 50m tonnes less on average each year then when we first came to government. This is something that has been achieved through many efforts but they included the efforts of the government as well to ensure we can be in that position and meet the targets we have. We will continue to engage in those forums but most importantly we will continue to carry our share of that burden and demonstrate that through the way that we are going to meet and beat our emissions reduction targets to ensure we can have the proper effect on global temperatures. The government continues to rewrite history on its position on climate change and how it has linked to disasters. Asked whether Australia will exert diplomatic pressure on its allies \u2013 such as the US \u2013 to do more on emissions reductions, Scott Morrison says: I should stress that there is no dispute in this country about the issue of climate change, globally, and its effect on global weather patterns, and that includes how that impacts in Australia. I have to correct the record here. I have seen a number of people suggest that somehow the government does not make this connection. The government has always made this connection and that has never been in dispute. What we are focused on is what our response is and we set that out very clearly and that response, as it always has, will continue to be upgraded to make sure we have met the commitments we have made. And before the PMO calls me, the total of this \u201calways accepts\u201d before this crisis, was pointing to a statement Morrison delivered in February, which mentioned climate change \u201camong a number of other factors\u201d as being to blame for worsening natural disasters. The deputy prime minister, at the beginning of this emergency, said it was only \u201craving inner-city lunatics\u201d who were making the link between climate change and the worsening bushfire season, which was backed up by several members of the government. He also defends what has been done to date \u2013 and says the government had acted as quickly as it needed to. Scott Morrison has also once again defended his handling of the crisis, and his leadership. I continue to demonstrate what we\u2019ve been doing through our actions. There has been plenty of criticism. I\u2019ve had the benefit of a lot of analysis on a lot of issues. But I can\u2019t be distracted by that. The public I know are not distracted by that. What they need us to focus on, all of us actually, all of us, focusing on the needs and the communities in getting the support it needs. That is very much my focus and that\u2019s where it will continue to be, working closely with the states and territories, working closely with my ministers and the agencies, the defence forces, the recovery agency, to be led by Mr Colvin and ensuring they have the support they need. The prime minister has also ruled out a disaster recovery levy to help pay for the recovery. There will be no levy. We have been assuring people that we have been in a position to deal with matters such as this. And so we will be committing everything that is needed and more as it is required. We will be considering the details of that but there is already a firm proposal that was considered by national security committee yesterday about what the initial investment will be and I will make further announcements about that with the treasurer tomorrow, and will be focusing on what the needs are and ensuring it is met. I will give further details about that tomorrow after it has been considered by cabinet. Scott Morrison has again defended the funding his government provided to the nation\u2019s firefighting capabilities ahead of this crisis. Things are moving very quickly at Eden: It looks like Scott Morrison is trying to walk back some of the damage from yesterday\u2019s \u201ccommonwealth stepped in, because NSW wasn\u2019t asking\u201d, which went out to some media outlets yesterday. Asked about NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmon\u2019s frustration at not being told about the ADF deployment, he says: I want to stress the decisions we took yesterday and enacted yesterday were statements all about the scale of this crisis. It is in no way a statement on the performance of the state and territory agencies. I have been consistently complimentary and remain absolute complimentary of their extraordinary work. And without their work, without the planning, without the preparations, I fear what has really been a terrible tragedy would have been far worse. And so we have enjoyed, as the commissioner himself has said, a strong working relationship. There was a breakdown in communications at the defence liaison level with the headquarters yesterday, but that matter was addressed by the minister for defence as she made comment about that this morning in the media. And so there has been a subsequent conversation between myself and the premier, and the minister ... and we have addressed any of those issues that arose from that. We communicated the decision as soon as it had been made. Doesn\u2019t look like we have an Auslan interpreter at this press conference. The government should probably start considering that. The former AFP commissioner Andrew Colvin will head up the national bushfire recovery agency, which will report to minister, David Littleproud. Scott Morrison says the commonwealth services will be working in conjunction with what the states are doing, but he won\u2019t be seeking matching contributions from the states for the commonwealth funding. The government is also announcing mental health support: \u201cThose who have been in some of these areas will know that this fire and the haze and the fear and the quite extreme conditions will have had a profound impact on the mental health and wellbeing of people in these communities, not just in those areas where people are resident but people that would have been there during these fires. \u201cIt\u2019s important we are addressing the mental health needs as well as the many other health needs that will need to be addressed. \u201cThis organisation will be stood up for at least two years and we will be able to talk more about its funding arrangements in the not-too-distant future after cabinet considers the formal proposals, which are coming forward and have already been considered by the national security committee. Our neighbours are offering us more defence support. Scott Morrison: The ADF is engaging with the New Zealand defence force and the Singapore armed forces to identify options for the kind offers of military support they have generously put forward ... And the Papua New Guinea government has made similar offers through the prime minister to me directly, which has been passed on to the ADF for consideration. Scott Morrison says he\u2019ll join the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, later today. You\u2019ll know why eyebrows would be heading a little skyward at that if you have followed along with the relations between the two governments over the past 24 hours. But this is about reassuring the public they are working well together, despite the political games that have been played. The prime minister is in Canberra, holding a press conference updating on what the ADF has been doing. In the last 24 hours, in Victoria, navy support, navy ships evacuated 1,100 isolated persons from Mallacoota and the MV Sycamore arrived in Western Port this morning on the Mornington Peninsula with 61 evacuees and pets. HMAS Choules arrived in Western Port, on Saturday, I should say, with some 1,100 evacuees. Chinooks are also involved in evacuations. The ADF is also working to clear roads as the recovery begins in some areas. Just before the prime minister speaks, we\u2019ll update you on what has happened so far this morning A 47-year-old man suffered a heart attack and died helping a friend prepare his Batlow property against fire Four firefighters have been injured overnight Hundreds of homes have been lost in the southern NSW fires More than 35,000 people remain without power in that same area Canberra\u2019s air quality is once again the worst in the world The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, says NSW is facing something it has never seen before The NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, has expressed his \u201cdisappointment\u201d the prime minister didn\u2019t tell him about the additional ADF deployment ahead of the media announcement, although he welcomes it. The premier was informed. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, was conceded communication could have been better. Essential Energy say 35,600 customers remain without power in southern NSW, a situation which is likely to remain for quite a few days. The prime minister\u2019s press conference is due to start any minute now. We updated you a little while ago on the fundraiser Celeste Barber started for the rural fire service reaching $16m. That has been surpassed again. From AAP: Comedian Celeste Barber has raised more than $18m million for fire services battling Australian blazes. An Australian comedian who won over fans with her celebrity parodies on Instagram has helped raise a staggering $18m from 450,000 donations in three days. Barber, who has 6.4m Instagram followers, drew pledges from as far the UK, US, France, Italy in her bid to raise $20m for the NSW Rural Fire Service. NSW has raised more than $773,000, surpassing a $500,000 target, in one day. There is growing global and celebrity support for bushfire fundraising efforts, with reality TV star Kim Kardashian West among those lending support by sharing social media links on how to donate. Just below Mt Hotham: Here is the latest advice on the border fire from the NSW RFS: A bush fire is burning north from the Victorian border. The fire is more than 140,000ha and is out of control. Current situation The fire crossed the Victorian border and spread rapidly following a strong southerly change. The fire is burning south of Eden. The fire has impacted the areas of Wonboyn, Kiah, Narrabarba and surrounds. The fire also spread on its western edge near Burragate. Building impact assessment teams will be deployed to assess damage to properties. Advice If you are in the area of Wonboyn, Kiah, Narrabarba and surrounds, the fire has moved through this area. Monitor the conditions. Be alert for falling trees and branches. If you are in the areas of Burragate and Towamba, monitor changing conditions and remain in place. Seek shelter as the fire approaches and protect yourself from the heat of the fire. A number of roads are blocked and closed. Be alert to embers and spot fires. Be aware of the danger of falling trees and branches. If you are in the areas of Wyndham, Rocky Hall, Nethercote, Eden and surrounds, continue to monitor conditions and be prepared to act should conditions change. The areas of Merimbula, Pambula and surrounds are not under any current threat. This is one of the areas NSW authorities are worried about today. The air quality in Canberra is getting no better. Woolworths has given an update on which of its stores are open in the fire zones: Woolworths bushfire update 10.30am Sunday 5 January10.30am NSW Woolworths Merimbula, Bega, Tura Beach and Narooma are open today but will operate limited trading hours due to team availability. Woolworths Moruya is open but stock levels remain low and the store will operate limited hours today. Woolworths Ulladulla is open but may need to close early due to team availability. Woolworths Vincentia, Nowra and Culburra beach are open today. Woolworths Batemans Bay remains closed. We are working to open the store today subject to power, team availability and safe access. Woolworths Bermagui is likely to remain closed today due to access to the town, power and team availability. Woolworths Jindabyne and Tumut have reopened after closing early yesterday due to nearby bushfires. Woolworths Bowral and Mittagong in the Southern Highlands are open. VIC Woolworths Bright has reopened today after closing early yesterday. The cooler conditions today don\u2019t mean this is over, by any means. This news clip on Seven Network is still doing the rounds \u2013 and for good reason. The latest update from the NSW RFS has come out: Food, water and other donations are flooding in. There are also those hoping to help when it comes to livestock. Here are some of the people Helen Davidson was talking about in her posts, captured by Jess Hromas. Scott Morrison will hold a press conference at 11am I am told. He is in Canberra. [cont from previous post] While we speak, Moey al-Haje and Ali Kourouche roll up with a trailer full of water, food and toiletries. There are cheers. Al-Haje has had almost no sleep. He was up until 1am getting donations together and then got on the road from Greenacre before dawn. He\u2019s kind of excited, he says. \u201cPeople just donated like beans, snacks, lady stuff like tampons and pads and everything, water,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever we could get we just got. \u201cIt\u2019s good to donate, but where\u2019s it going to? People need stuff right now; they\u2019ve lost everything. I think I\u2019ll bring some more animal food next week.\u201d Maddison Elabed tells me they\u2019ve got an enormous collection of donations, including the trucks and vans to bring everything down. \u201cEverything we got was 100% donated and is 100% for the fires.\u201d They went to Flemington Markets this morning and loaded up. They spent hours making chicken sandwiches. They\u2019re all from western Sydney: Auburn, Guilford, Cabramatta, Greenacre. The reception has been unbelievable, she says. They\u2019ve been inspired by stories of firefighters finishing a shift only to come back to base and find no food. They did a run on Wednesday. \u201cWhen we saw the state of these two firies that were sitting in a car waiting for a food truck to come and it came and it was empty, we were like: you\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d says Melissa Nasr. \u201cGod sent us there,\u201d adds Elabed. \u201cThey were about to leave when we rocked up. They\u2019re saying thank you to us, but we\u2019re saying thank you to them.\u201d They said it\u2019s an eye-opener going out to fire-affected areas. \u201cI know the world is falling apart too but this is our home. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to keep our home safe. People are out there leaving their families to fight and save us. Anything we can do we are gonna do it.\u201d A woman named Margaret Bruce is speaking to the ABC about what happened her Batemans Bay area home on New Year\u2019s: It must have been embers, we don\u2019t know. The grass around the house was like walking on straw, it was just so dry. The people in our street ... are fine ... but our house blew up. There is about eight properties in that little area alone that have been affected by the fire ... We have got our lives; we are all alive. And we are lucky. We are one of the lucky people because we are insured. So, you know, we can replace what we haven\u2019t got. It is just shocking. You just don\u2019t get it. You just think, you\u2019ll be fine. \u201cLike I said, we didn\u2019t think we would have any problem at all, until I lost it, and said, you know, we really need to do something.\u201d They just got out in time. More on the airlift out of Mallacoota. [cont from previous post] Yesterday conditions were \u201cpretty horrendous\u201d. There were some firefighters with heat stress and heat stroke, and one with minor burns, but he\u2019s back at work today. \u201cWe have had some structural losses; we did have reports of structures being under threat in and around Kangaroo Valley. We\u2019ve been trying to ascertain any losses up there.\u201d Today it\u2019s \u201clooking clear\u201d to send in aerial support, Collins says. They had \u201cso many\u201d out yesterday. \u201cBut we could have had 50 more and still wouldn\u2019t have been able to contain the spread.\u201d It looked particularly bad at Bundanoon last night. I ask about the group of people who sought to escape during the fire, only to get stuck in the firefront and require an escort out from firefighters. He doesn\u2019t have details about the incident, but says it\u2019s \u201ca really good talking point\u201d. \u201cWe tell people leave early, leaving early is your safest option. Don\u2019t leave it to the last minute. We saw in 2009 in Victoria a 170-odd people killed and a lot of those people were killed in their cars.\u201d We\u2019re at Nowra and have just had a briefing about the local situation overnight. Brad Collins, public liaison officer with the RFS in Nowra, tells me the night saw a lull after the southerly before it picked up again. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting the strength of the southerly,\u201d he says. It gusted about 85km/h here in Nowra, and over 100km/h over fire grounds down south. \u201cSome of the fire behaviour was terrain-driven as well. Fire runs faster up hill, etcetera etcetera.\u201d Fire was expected to jump the Shoalhaven River and get into the Morton national park but it ran through extraordinarily quickly. The fire is now in the Wingello area, and that will be split off from the Morton fire from a management point of view. This is partly because the Bundanoon-Exeter flank of the Morton fire may join with the Green Wattle Creek fire. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a possibility,\u201d says Collins. \u201cAfter yesterday I\u2019m not ruling anything out.\u201d The interview with these people in Eden was just heartbreaking, and one of thousands we are going to hear as the weeks go on. Adam told the ABC he was \u201cpretty sure I\u2019ve lost my house\u201d. It\u2019s terrible. We\u2019ve got our lives. We\u2019re alive. We can rebuild. Beautiful people there. We are stuck here together. We will get through it. Watching out for people\u2019s mental health is going to be increasingly important as the fires move on. A lot of these people may intellectually know they have lost their home, but that is not the same as actually seeing what they have lost. Keep checking in on your friends and family as these weeks and months continue. AAP has also looked at the Victorian forecast: Steady rain over the next two days could help fire crews gain more control over massive blazes ravaging Victoria\u2019s east and north-east. Light mist fell on Sunday at some centres including Bairnsdale, on the western edge of the East Gippsland fire ground. More widespread cooler conditions are expected to bring respite to the affected areas, a Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster, Keris Arndt, says. \u201cThe conditions are much cooler, moisture\u2019s a lot higher than we\u2019ve seen over previous days and the winds are also easing off a fair bit, especially through Gippsland today,\u201d Arndt said. \u201cHopefully that gives the fire agencies a bit of a chance to have a go at the fires and try to get a bit more control in there.\u201d However, while rain may help dampen the fire ground, it could also prove a double-edged sword for crews by making some areas more difficult to access. Four emergency warnings remain, with three in East Gippsland and one in north-east Victoria. Two evacuation orders are in force near Mt Buffalo and Mt Hotham in north-east Victoria. AAP has an update on the P2 mask filter shortage: National medical stockpiles of particulate-filter masks will be opened up to help authorities on bushfire frontlines in Victoria and NSW. It comes as the ACT State Emergency Service works to deliver P2 masks to stores in Canberra after Australia Post stopped deliveries because of bushfire smoke over the capital. The federal government will send 450,000 masks from the national medical stockpile to help Victorian authorities. It was also working to get masks to NSW frontline workers, having already provided 3000 to Australian federal police officers in bushfire-affected areas. Australia\u2019s acting chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly. said on Saturday the masks were not an alternative to avoiding smoke. \u201cThe effectiveness of P2 masks to protect against high levels of air pollution is limited and they are not recommended for general community use,\u201d Kelly said. Anyone with heart or lung problems should consult a doctor before using P2 masks, and anyone who felt dizzy, faint or out of breath while wearing one should take it off and get to a place with cleaner air. Kelly also said the masks were effective only if fitted perfectly and men had to be clean-shaven to wear one properly. This is happening all over the place, and it is just heartmeltingly lovely how ordinary people are reacting during this emergency. Australians are so much better than David Speers then attempts to find out what has changed with the ADF announcement \u2013 as in, who will be calling the shots: the states, or the commonwealth, on where and when the defence assets will be deployed. Linda Reynolds: So that authority still rests with the states and territory, absolutely. What we found \u2013 this is an unprecedented natural disaster in terms of scope and defence engagement. So what we have said to the states and territories and what the prime minister clearly said yesterday is we are ramping up more assets and making it known through our liaison officer network of what the states right down to the local community level can ask for. Speers: That work, as you said, has been there for a while. Reynolds: You\u2019re talking over me again. Speers: I\u2019m trying to establish what changed. Reynolds: So what that means is that it is still finally the responsibility of the states and territories to ask and coordinate but we are forward positioning and we are making equipment and also activated reservists in these states to make sure the states are very clear on what we can do and we have the people and the resources in location so that they can respond very quickly. So we\u2019ve now got, for example, with the army, we\u2019ve got specialist medical teams available, engineering teams, transport teams, aerial reconnaissance and also of course evacuation assets. So it is ultimately still the states\u2019 and territories\u2019 call, but what the prime minister said yesterday is we are being as forward leaning as possible to make sure that we have the maximum amount of resources available when the states ask for it. That exchange continues: Speers: I\u2019m not talking about communication. My question, minister, sorry, was about consulting. Wouldn\u2019t you want to consult with the operational chief to make sure this is a necessary step rather than just simply making a decision and communicating it? Reynolds: Well, David, you are conflating two issues there. The first one is in terms of the decision that the national security committee took yesterday, which was not only the call-out of the reserves, but also the other measures that we announced yesterday. That was done in absolute consultation with the states in terms of what more resources are required. Speers: So Shane Fitzsimmons was consulted about this? Reynolds: I said that the state authorities were consulted. Speers: Shane Fitzsimmons, the fire commissioner, was consulted? Reynolds: David, with respect, we have liasion officers at all of the impacted state headquarters. We\u2019ve got liasion officers and incident controllers right across New South Wales. We consulted very widely in terms of the resources ... Speers: This is an important point, minister. Reynolds: The commissioner said this morning ... You\u2019re talking over me. Speers: The commissioner said this morning that even the liasion officers you\u2019re referring to weren\u2019t aware of the details. Reynolds: David, that\u2019s the reason we have the liasion officers out there. I do acknowledge yesterday that we could have, defence could have worked quicker to push the information out. We acknowledged that yesterday. We put measures in place to make sure that our defence change chain of command have that information available as soon as possible. I would say in relation to the commissioner of New South Wales, that that information was passed to the premier. That information was communicated to the state authorities. David Speers has started his ABC career with an interview with Linda Reynolds. He asks about Shane Fitzsimmons not being told of the ADF announcement ahead of time yesterday. Speers: What is your reaction or explanation as to why Shane Fitzsimmons, the Rural Fire Service chief in New South Wales, has expressed disappointment and frustration he wasn\u2019t kept in the loop or consulted about this? Reynolds: Well, David, the first thing I would say is that the national security committee of cabinet met yesterday morning to put together this new suite of measures, not just on behalf of defence but on behalf of the federal government. Straight after that meeting, the prime minister personally contacted each of the impacted premiers to advise them of the measures that we had agreed to take. That was done before we went and made the public announcement. Speers: Would you not want to consult the guy who\u2019s actually in charge operationally about whether this was a good idea? Reynolds: Well, the prime minister has been in constant contact with the premiers, daily, in fact, in some cases. Speers: I\u2019m talking about Shane Fitzsimmons, the fire commissioner. Reynolds: David, you asked me a question, please allow me to answer it. The prime minister, as is absolutely normal, will let the state leaders know and it is entirely a matter for the state authorities of how they communicate that through their own bureaucracy and their own emergency management processes. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, tells the ABC that defence bases between Brisbane and Adelaide are being opened to help house people who have lost their homes in the bushfires. She also gives an update on where the HMAS Adelaide, which is working to help the HMAS Choules with evacuations: The HMAS Adelaide, which is our very large amphibious ship, left Sydney yesterday and is now arrived in location off the south coast near Eden, and MV Sycamore and also HMAS Choules dropped off 1.100 evacuatees in Victoria at Western Port. We are in discussions with the New South Wales and Victorian government on how best to utilise these vessels and moving forward. All sets are very capable, particularly HMAS Adelaide. Adelaide has 400 troops embarked. We have 300 tonnes of emergency relief stores. [The ship] has a hospital on board. The Council of Small Business Organisations Australia has released a statement on the \u201chorror and shock\u201d it and its members are feeling, while calling for a coordinated recovery response. It has also said \u201cenough\u201d to the climate denialist garbage, because it has \u201cendangered us all\u201d. From chief executive Peter Strong: Failure to accept and manage change and risk has been a key issue leading up to this disaster. We are concerned that the attitude from climate deniers that \u2018this is normal\u2019 and \u2018nothing to see here\u2019 means that we will continue to have that small number of government MPs with ideological beliefs and dented egos having too much say and too much influence. This will only hold us back from repair and regrowth ... We have for some time been trying to take the emotion out of the climate debate by talking about \u2018change management and risk management\u2019 but the small cadre of deniers in government ranks and elsewhere have refused to budge because they believe they are right and the rest of us are wrong. They have denied anything has changed and when confronted with the common sense of preparing for the risk of fires and disaster they have turned deaf and refused to prepare for what always happens in Australia: bushfires, droughts and floods. Their denial is because they do not believe disasters occur any more often than in the past. This intellectual indifference of the few has endangered us all. No successful business will ignore a risk as unlikely and will always prepare for any situation. You can read the whole statement here Power is still out in a lot of places - we are working on finding out a number. You can find out more here in the meantime. Authorities are still asking residents in NSW and the ACT to keep non-essential power use down, if possible. Stephanie Convery has also done an excellent synopsis of how the Morrison government has reacted to the fire crisis, since it began in September, as well: [Cont from previous post] The road was surrounded by fire. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there\u2019d been a call to take shelter. We came up to a crest or bend and there was a fire surrounding the road,\u201d Mordy says. \u201cWe were in the middle of it so we just had to keep going. \u201cI\u2019m pretty calm but I was terrified. It gave me a massive shock. The raining ash. The fierce wind. The confusion seeing all those cars suddenly pull over.\u201d They spent the night in Wollongong and can\u2019t get back to Bundanoon. The property at this stage is safe, which Mordy describes as \u201ca miracle\u201d given its proximity to the national park. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for people to know the app doesn\u2019t necessarily update fast enough. It was lucky my dad looked at the sky. Sometimes it\u2019s good to look past your screens.\u201d In Bundanoon, the sky turning red was a sign that it was time to leave. Gabrielle Mordy had been visiting her father, Martyn, whose property backs on to national park. It is under threat from the Morton fire, which started after the Currowan fire jumped the Shoalhaven River on Saturday night. For days Gabrielle and Martyn had been preparing and monitoring fire activity. She had been watching the Fires Near Me app and believed they were safe to stay and defend. \u201cWe intended to stay and were preparing the property more. I was watching the app all the time and the fire due to come towards Bundanoon didn\u2019t appear to be moving,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the wind started and then it started to rain ash and black leaves and still the app said we were safe but it was extremely unnerving.\u201d Then pyrocumulonimbus clouds started forming and, at 9pm, Mordy says \u201cthe sky went red\u201d. \u201cAt that point we thought something is really wrong now.\u201d They left in two packed cars and were driving out of town on the Bundanoon Road when \u201call of a sudden the cars in front of us started pulling over\u201d. Helen Davidson has been covering the southern NSW fires overnight. Here is some of her report: \u201cRight here we are the meat in the sandwich, so thanks for coming down.\u201d And so began Mark Coombes briefing for a new shift of firefighters in Nowra. There were fires to the north, fires to the south, minimum 20-metre flame heights on one side of the Shoalhaven River, 40 metres in the other, and in areas that hadn\u2019t burned in decades. The dirty pyrocumulous cloud rumbled with its self-generated thunder outside. \u201cThe southerly is going to hit around nine, 9.30 and unfortunately you\u2019re the ones that deal with it,\u201d Coombes continued. \u201cWhat it\u2019s going to do I have no fucking idea.\u201d To get an idea of what the rest of the night was like, you can find the story here: For many areas, February is the worst month of the fire season. We have a long, long way to go this summer. Campbell Fuller of the Insurance Council of Australia has given an indication of just how much property damage has been done so far: We\u2019re looking at 5,850 insurance claims as of this morning,\u201d he told the ABC. The insurance losses are $375m since 8 November. That\u2019s 430m since the start of the bushfire season, since September. So we\u2019re talking extensive losses across four states in Australia and insurers are keeping a close eye on other parts of the country. Andrew Crisp, the Victorian emergency commissioner, has given the ABC a very quick update on what his state is facing today: We\u2019ve still got four emergency warnings for fires in the east of the state. Three in East Gippsland, one up in the Corryong area. Two \u2018evacuate now\u2019 orders in place. They\u2019re for communities around Dandongadale and Mount Buffalo. What we saw yesterday was significant fire activity; it looks as though we have additional property losses on the eastern side of the Corryong fire, Pine Ridge and Tallawong. The Australia Defence Association is a non-partisan organisation: Piers Morgan is a conservative commentator: And you know who Kevin Rudd is (although I am trying to imagine the response if he did this): Anthony Albanese will hold a press conference at 11am. He is in Melbourne today. Craig Emerson is also on the ABC talking the response and the ad: If they made that announcement yesterday, I haven\u2019t seen Gladys Berejiklian putting ads to air with Liberal [branding] on it and a donate button. That donate button to the Liberal party is just there anyway, but it\u2019s those little things, let\u2019s delete the donate to the Liberal party button, just in case people may think it\u2019s political. To be fair, they did delete the \u201cdonate\u201d to the Liberal party button, but not before it was spotted and spread across social media. That leads to this to and fro: Georgina Downer: It\u2019s incumbent on the government to get out the message what they\u2019re doing to help. ABC host: Why? It wasn\u2019t just informative. It wasn\u2019t telling them important emergency information. It was promoting the government\u2019s response. Downer: That\u2019s your interpretation. She does later admit though that the government\u2019s response has been \u201cslower\u201d than some people would have liked. For some reason Georgina Downer is on the ABC defending the prime minister\u2019s decision to release an ad in the middle of the fire crisis: This advertisement is really just a way for the federal government to get out the message that they are deploying ADF resources. And they are doing what they can to respond to what is a catastrophic set of conditions across Australia. And I would like to also just acknowledge the amazing efforts that are put in across the country by volunteers, and firies and everyday people supporting each other through this very, very difficult season. Here in South Australia we just had catastrophic conditions on Kangaroo Island. Where I live in the Adelaide Hills, just before Christmas, people had lost their homes, people in my school community have lost their homes. It\u2019s been a very difficult time and talking to people who have been on the fire ground, what they have been really focused is getting through this time. They\u2019re not bothered by the politics. What they want is the support they need to get through this season. Meanwhile in Cooma residents also had to deal with flooding after a 4.5m-litre tank burst. From AAP: A large water tank has burst in a southern NSW town flooding streets and homes and injuring a woman. Residents of Cooma, south of Canberra, began raising the alarm about 9.15pm on Saturday with some reporting water had flowed through their homes. Police said a woman suffered minor injuries after water entered her home and knocked her to the ground. Some cars were damaged, including one that was swept 800 metres down a road and into a truck. In case there are still some people down the back who missed that, this is not business as usual. By any measure. The NSW premier doubles down on that point: It\u2019s not something we have experienced before. What we have done during the fire season, when I get briefed and advised on a regular basis, I know the experts take the lessons forward to the next day and next week. The weather activity we\u2019re seeing, the extent and spread of the fires, the speed at which they\u2019re going, the way they are attacking communities that have never seen fire, is unprecedented. We have to accept that. I\u2019m not surprised that nations outside Australia are looking at that as well. Gladys Berejiklian gets very real here as she talks about exactly what the state is facing: We can\u2019t pretend our state is in charted territory. The extent of this bushfire season in living memory, and many experts have been around much longer than I have, who fought fires and observed circumstances, all agree: we\u2019re in uncharted territory. How people interpret that is to them. As the premier of this state, our state is facing a difficult time ahead. I\u2019m absolutely confident we\u2019ll get through it. But we can\u2019t pretend that this is something that we have experienced before. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s the concurrence of events. Normally you have one or two big fires to worry about. We have several of them at the one time, several townships who never ever experienced a threat of bushfire were at threat of being completely wiped out. That\u2019s why through the night many people were monitoring the system. We had townships completely under threat which never happened before. Gladys Berejiklian also steps up to the microphone to reassure people that NSW citizens \u201care at the heart of everything we do\u201d. She says that the prime minister did call her ahead of the announcement and she was \u201cpleased to take the call and welcomed the additional support\u201d. I want to ensure our citizens in New South Wales, I appreciate deeply what our communities are going through. Every time we hear of a life lost, it cuts us deeply. That is our focus. The working relationship with all of our agencies including the federal agencies to date, in my view, has been exceptionally strong. We want that to continue. It will continue, because our citizens need us now more than ever. I can\u2019t thank enough the professional men and women that are here to support those efforts that are supporting every level of government in those efforts and I\u2019ve been humbled to see them in action as they keep motivating and inspiring our volunteers, our firefighters, our emergency services personnel on the ground. What is important to our citizens today and moving forward is that all of us work together to focus on what matters, and what matters is saving life, getting people into homes, those who have lost homes, making sure they have what they need, and start the recovery and rebuilding process. We know for some communities it won\u2019t take just months, it could take years to rebuild. Shane Fitzsimmons finished that answer with this: An assistant commissioner has been dedicated and assigned to provide the conduit between NSW operations and the commonwealth. The focus is looking at how we can best utilise whatever the number out of 3,000 it turns out to be, into helping support particularly recovery efforts and getting to some of our most vulnerable and affected people of NSW, help to clean up their communities, clean up their properties and restore them to functions capability. I was very public this morning and I make no apologies for it. I was disappointed and frustrated in the middle of one of our worst days with massive dislocation and movement of people. I had my conversations with the prime minister\u2019s office. It was an amicable conversation. They apologised in hindsight. We\u2019re all working together now to make the best out of this announcement. Like we have done, to ensure our highest priority and focus is on the communities of NSW, that continue to be so terribly affected by the enormity of this bushfire challenge. Shane Fitzsimmons was asked about his comments regarding being disappointed he was not told about the prime minister\u2019s announcement ahead of time yesterday. Here is what he had to say: The help and assistance we had from the ADF and the commonwealth right throughout the previous months has been exceptional. All that we\u2019ve asked for, we have received. Not only that, the ADF have worked very closely with us in a very proactive sense about offering up other capabilities, other solutions, that we may not be aware of. We have been working extremely closely with the ADF and the commonwealth over the recent months, particularly during the worst of these conditions. The partnership and arrangement has been better than ever before in the history of this state that I can recall over my decades. What I commented about was my disappointment about learning about this intervention yesterday through media reports and having said that, we spent a fair amount of the day yesterday trying to seek clarity from our commonwealth liaison personnel embedded here in the state operations centre, our ADF people embedded here in the state operation centre, it\u2019s fair to say they weren\u2019t across the details either. It took us some time to understand what the announcement was, what it meant, and how it was it expected to be integrated into what was already a high performing and a highly effectively integrated suite of operations across New South Wales. We got through that process. The man who died had traveled from Goulburn to help a friend prepare his Batlow property for the coming fires. He was 47. He began feeling unwell and was being taken for medical attention when he suffered a heart attack and could not be revived. Four firefighters have also been injured \u2013 two protecting the Milton waterworks, who suffered smoke inhalation and exhaustion. Another Cessnock firefighter was also treated for smoke inhalation and exhaustion. A fourth firefighter suffered serious burns to their hands attempting to protect a home. Shane Fitzsimmons on the two fires still at emergency alert levels: The two at emergency is the one down on the southern border region, south-west of Eden. That fire has crossed through and burned to the southern side of Eden, fortunately not impacting the town site. It\u2019s moving a bit further north and towards rural and isolated property just to the west of Eden. Still pretty active down there, and lots of attention from local firefighters. Lots of the people from Eden were evacuated or chose to relocate further north last night out of harm\u2019s way. And they\u2019ll be reassessing that today as to when the passage is clear for people to get back into the community of Eden. We have got this other fire that emergency warning alert level, now called the Morton fire. It\u2019s effectively the Currowan fire that crossed the Shoalhaven and Kangaroo rivers under a very aggressive southerly and south-easterly change last night. We saw it cross in a number of locations. And headed towards the communities, particularly Wingello and Bundanoon, and reports of property damage around Wingello and Bundanoon. NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons explains a little bit more about what firefighters were dealing with yesterday: Once again, can I just commend and praise the extraordinary effort of our men and women, whether they\u2019re paid or volunteers, the effort yesterday was quite remarkable. It goes down as the second busiest and most challenging day in terms of the number of concurrent fires we had burning at the emergency warning alert level, we got to 13 or 14 at any given point, second only to what we saw a couple of months ago, where 17 concurrent fires were burning. It was an awful day yesterday. It was a very difficult day yesterday. But their resolution to, their resolve to making a difference and partnering with their local community has yielded dividends in terms of no unaccounted for people across the fire affected areas A recovery coordinator has been appointed for southern NSW (there is also one in the north) Gladys Berejiklian Of course, the RFS HQ still has embedded, all the 30 government agencies, including the contributions from the ADF, whether it\u2019s Navy or army or other support personnel, and we\u2019ll rely on those resources as we continue to fight fires, where appropriate, we\u2019re now moving into recovery mode to send a strong and clear message to communities we\u2019re with you during the rebuilding process. For some communities, that rebuilding will start in the next few days, for others, it will take a bit longer. Certainly the message today is the milder conditions mean for this episode at least, many towns which will under threat, many communities which feared the worst, can take a slight breather, but that\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t have volatile conditions, we do, because there are still two fires at emergency alert level, that means anything can happen during the day. Gladys Berejiklian says NSW police have confirmed one person died from a heart attack overnight during the Batlow fire. This morning we still have two fires at emergency alert level, and also very sadly one person lost their life due to a cardiac arrest just outside of Batlow last night and police have just issued details about that one deceased person and of course our hearts, thoughts and minds go to their families during their very difficult time. The good news is no one is currently unaccounted for in NSW. The light here is not because of nearby fires \u2013 it is the sunlight coming through the smoke. The duke and duchess of Cambridge have posted about the fires on their official instagram account to their 10.6m followers. They have recently announced a plan to focus on climate change. You can hear what Shane Fitzsimmons had to say to the Today show here: Shane Fitzsimmons and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, are about to hold a press conference, having just received a morning briefing. Relations between the NSW Coalition government and the Morrison Coalition government seem a little strained at the moment. In fact, it seems like Scott Morrison is getting along better with the Victorian Labor premier, Daniel Andrews, at the moment. Instagram influencer and comedian Celeste Barber\u2019s fundraiser for the NSW RFS has surpassed $16m. The prime minister\u2019s office has responded to Shane Fitzsimmons\u2019s \u201cdisappointment\u201d. There are a number of major Victorian roads which are still closed: The latest update from VicRoads shows: Hume Freeway is closed southbound and being diverted through Euroa back to the freeway. Northbound traffic of the Hume Freeway is now open. The Princes Highway is closed between Old Bunga Road (Lakes Entrance) and the New South Wales border in East Gippsland. If travelling, please be vigilant in smoky conditions and use your headlights to be seen. Shane Fitzsimmons, the NSW RFS commissioner who has steered the state through one of the worst fire crisis the country has ever seen, gave a very measured \u2013 but very telling \u2013 interview to the Nine network\u2019s Today Show. Asked about the additional ADF deployment, he had this to say: I found out about it via the media reports. It is disappointing on one of our worst days this season to hear that announcement. Then have to try to work through on top of everything else what it means and how it is going to operate. The announcement came as the NSW RFS were dealing with mass evacuations of southern NSW, and an almost record-breaking number of emergency fire warnings. I spoke to the PM\u2019s office last night in relation to my disappointment in the middle of a very busy day. We are working through it and we will see the resources gainfully employed. We have people assigned at the NSW level particularly looking at utilising those crews to help with the recovery and the support operations to people who have been heavily impacted. It will be a valuable thing. It will help our communities. The Kangaroo Island fire, which has so far claimed two lives, a father and son, is also still burning. About a third of the island has been ravaged. That\u2019s about 150,000ha. At least one resort has been destroyed, but it is still too dangerous to get too much of an idea of what else has been lost. And then we hear this from the NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. He learned of the prime minister\u2019s decision to send in more ADF resources from the media announcement: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has done an exclusive interview with the Sunday News Corp papers. Here is some of what he had to say. On the decision to provide resources without being asked by the states, he said it became \u201cpalpably clear\u201d the commonwealth needed to step in: \u201cWe have spent three to four months operating under \u2026 the national set of arrangements the states and territories recommended and wanted. \u201cNow I have said, \u2018We are doing this.\u2019 \u201d And on the criticisms of his leadership, including the forced handshakes: Whoever wants one, whoever wants to shake the hand, whoever wants to flip the bird \u2026 bring it on. People are in different frames [of mind]. Some people need a hug. You just roll with it; you\u2019ve still got to go out there \u2026 People do want to see you.\u201d And on why he is not taking any of the criticism personally: That\u2019s your job. If you think of it in personal terms you will miss the point \u2026 the point is anger, frustration, feelings of isolation \u2026 what that means is help.\u201d People in Canberra have woken up to a yellow-brown sky and the world\u2019s worst air quality again. More than 900,000ha has been overrun by flames in Victoria, with about 110 properties and 220 outbuildings razed so far. More than 70 new fires were sparked in Victoria in the 24 hours to 6pm on Saturday. Dozens of fires were burning in Victoria early on Sunday, 13 of which were subject to emergency warnings, the highest alert level. Six people remain missing in the East Gippsland blazes, on top of two confirmed dead. The mercury is forecast to peak in the early 20s in East Gippsland, with rainfall of about 20ml expected later in the day. In the north-east, temperatures could hit the late 20s in some parts, with some rainfall \u2013 albeit likely less than 5ml \u2013 expected. This will bring some relief to firefighters but Daniel Andrews has warned Victorians to remain vigilant. Merimbula in the far south coast is the main evacuation zone for the surrounding areas, including Eden. The fire there also briefly closed the Hume highway, which links Sydney to Canberra, between Picton and Majura overnight. The smoke over that 100km stretch was judged too dangerous. The fire is still at emergency alert, so the highway could close again. We\u2019ll keep you updated. We are slowly getting news out of the Southern Highlands after the fires burned through there overnight. It\u2019s not looking good. Also closed in NSW: South of Nowra: \u2022 Jerrawangala to Tomerong \u2013 Turpentine Road is closed \u2022 Wandandian \u2013 Wandean Road is closed \u2022 Nowra Hill to Charleyong \u2013 Braidwood Road/Nerriga Road is closed South of Tilba Tilba: \u2022 Cobargo \u2013 Cobargo Road is closed Around Braidwood: \u2022 Braidwood to Nelligen \u2013 the Kings Highway is closed \u2022 Braidwood to Moruya \u2013 Araluen Road is closed \u2022 Braidwood to Cooma \u2013 Cooma Road is closed In and around the Snowy Mountains: \u2022 Adelong to Tumblong \u2013 Grahamstown Road is closed \u2022 Adelong to Rosewood \u2013 Wondalga Road \u2022 Tumbarumba to Batlow and Gilmore \u2013 Batlow Road is closed \u2022 Green Hills to Courabyra \u2013 Lower Bago Road/Taradale Road \u2022 All roads in the Kosciuszko national park are closed including: o Jindabyne to Khancoban \u2013 Alpine Way o Jindabyne to Charlotte Pass \u2013 Kosciuszko Road o Paddys River to Khancoban \u2013 Swampy Plains Creek Road/Tooma Road/Snow Ridge Road/Goat Ridge Road/Elliott Way At Holbrook: \u2022 Holbrook to Jingelic \u2013 Jingelic Road is closed A number of smaller local roads are also closed in these areas as well as roads across the New South Wales-Victorian border. If you need to travel, take extreme care due to heavy smoke in many areas, be prepared for conditions to change at short notice, and follow the direction of emergency services and traffic crews. Make sure you follow www.livetraffic.com for NSW road closures. The most recent list includes: On the South Coast: The Princes Highway is still closed between; \u2022 Falls Creek (Jervis Bay Road) and Milton (Corks Lane) \u2022 North Batemans Bay and Lake Tabourie \u2022 Mogo and Moruya \u2022 Broadwater (north of Eden) and the Victorian Border In the Southern Highlands: \u2022 The Hume Highway is open after being closed between Wilton and Marulan but there is thick smoke in the area. \u2022 The Illawarra Highway remains closed between Sutton Forest (the Hume Highway) and Moss Vale (Moss Vale Road) \u2022 Nowra Road and Moss Vale Road are closed between Fitzroy Falls and Bomaderry \u2022 Trains are not running between Campbelltown and Goulburn on the Southern Highlands Lane. Replacement buses are running between Campbelltown and Picton only so delay travel. In the Snowy Mountains: \u2022 The Snowy Mountains Highway remains closed between: o Mount Adrah (the Hume Highway) and Gilmore (Batlow Road) o Tumut and Cooma o The Monaro Highway and Princes Highway via Bemboka There is still quite a bit of anger over this ad, put out in the midst of the fire crisis. The prime minister responded to it last night: Not sure that is going to cut it. The governor general, David Hurley, has passed on a condolence message from the Queen to \u201call Australians\u201d over the bushfire emergency. \u201cI have been deeply saddened to hear of the continued bushfires and their devastating impact across many parts of Australia,\u201d the statement read. \u201cMy thanks go out to the emergency services, and those who put their own lives in danger to help communities in need. Prince Philip and I send our thoughts and prayers to all Australians at this difficult time.\u201d NSW authorities are still asking people to lay off the non-essential power use. Fires in the Snowy Mountains have affected the electricity supply. In NSW, two fires are still at the emergency alert level. That\u2019s the border fire in the Bega Valley, near the Victorian border, and the Morton fire, which is in Bundanoon. From the RFS: Bundanoon, Wingello, Penrose, Meryla, Exeter, Avoca, Fitzroy Falls and surrounding areas \u2013 It is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches. Protect yourself from the heat of the fire. If you are in the area of Wonboyn, Kiah, Narrabarba and surrounds, the fire has moved through this area. If you are in the areas of Burragate and Towamba, it is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches and protect yourself from the heat of the fire. If you are in the areas of Wyndham, Rocky Hall, Nethercote, Eden and surrounds, continue to monitor conditions and be prepared to act should conditions change. The areas of Merimbula, Pambula and surrounds are not under any current threat. In the last 30 minutes, Victoria has gone from 11 emergency warnings to five. But authorities are warning people not to get complacent. People in north-east Victoria \u2013 Dandongadale, Wandiligong and Freeburgh \u2013 were told to leave overnight when the wind changed. Six people remain unaccounted for. Nearly one million hectares of land has been burned in Victoria alone. Temperatures have dropped, which is good news for firefighters. The weather bureau puts temps in the low 20s for the East Gippsland today. It\u2019ll be warmer in the north-east, which could reach the high 20s. The big worry today \u2013 and for the near future \u2013 is that the Corryong blaze could merge with the Dunns Road fire across the NSW border. This morning looks like it will be another tough one for firefighters as the fire that took hold in the Southern Highlands overnight continues to rage. We have yet to hear the extent of the damage from the catastrophic conditions yesterday but slightly cooler conditions have seen some fires downgraded. We\u2019ll bring you all the days events as they happen.",

      "body": "<p>I had two new year\u2019s resolutions in 2018; to get a vasectomy and to pass my driving test. When December rolled around, I held my driving licence in my hand with satisfaction. True, I hadn\u2019t achieved both my resolutions, but partial completion isn\u2019t to be sniffed at, right?</p> <p>In 2019, I also had two resolutions \u2013 to get a vasectomy and to rejoin a gym. Again, December came and, again, I only managed one of them. I\u2019m in infinitesimally better physical condition than I was a year ago, so that\u2019s the same as getting a vasectomy. Isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>Do you see a pattern emerging? I\u2019ve stumbled across an amazing, no-fail loophole to stop me feeling bad about never getting a vasectomy. Every year I make a plan to get it done, and every year I sidestep it by creating and executing a different resolution that I can use as a safety net for my own disappointment. Clever, isn\u2019t it? What a genius I am, tricking myself like that. Well done me for outsmarting myself so deftly at every turn.</p> <p>You won\u2019t be surprised to hear that I have two resolutions for 2020 as well. One is to take flying lessons, and the other \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 is to book an appointment for a vasectomy. Really this time. Really and truly. I\u2019m going to do it. Honestly.</p> <p>Except I won\u2019t, will I? This time next year I guarantee that I\u2019ll have ploughed all my money into climate-destroying frivolity, and all because I don\u2019t like the thought of a doctor chopping my balls open.</p> <p>And this is the crux of it. Every time I edge closer towards an appointment, I see flashes of scalpels. I remember word for word how Jamie Oliver described what happened to a friend of his after a vasectomy: \u201cHe cried for three weeks! It went all black!\u201d I hear a mid-slice sneeze. I picture a steamroller bursting open a watermelon. I imagine the pain of that time my two-year-old accidentally trod on my ballsack, and I amplify it by a million.</p> <p><em><strong>But I should</strong></em> get a vasectomy. I know I should. My testicles have served their purpose. They\u2019ve brought two boys into the world \u2013 two happy, incredible little boys who make my heart sing whenever I so much as catch a glimpse of them. But at the same time I know that I would rather drive over my head in my own car than have any more. The thought of starting from scratch again, and all that it entails, fills me with dread. The sleepless nights. The constant alert. The inability to wear white clothes. The expense. The renewed exposure to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/27/mark-rylance-cbeebies-cartoon-bing\" title=\"\">Bing</a></em>. I cannot. Make no mistake, my children are the joy of my life, but give me any more and swear to God I\u2019ll drown myself in a toilet.</p> <p>Plus, I have a feeling that a vasectomy would be good for my marriage. Because it turns out that having tangible evidence that sex leads to children is just about the greatest contraceptive ever created. Before you have kids, you can be forgiven for being a little devil may care about birth control. \u201cIf it happens it happens,\u201d you might say to each other. \u201cWe\u2019re in love! An accidental baby would be an expression of our love!\u201d But once children stop being hypothetical \u2013 once your living room has become a minefield of plastic tat and the arms of your sofa have snail-trails of snot running along them and you\u2019re constantly so tired you can feel your eyeballs vibrating inside your head \u2013 it\u2019s a different matter. Sex takes on an air of Russian roulette. My balls were benign for a long time. Now they\u2019re a pair of hand grenades.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My testicles have now served their purpose. I have two happy boys</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So we have two options: either I get a vasectomy or we wait it out for the menopause. Which would be ideal for me, frankly, but a little selfish. After all, men tend to get a free ride in this field. For as long as I\u2019ve known her, my wife has been the one hurling herself into different hormonal tornadoes in the name of contraception. One pill made her gain weight. Another gave her crashing bursts of depression. An IUD resulted in bacterial vaginosis. And all the while I just stood by, secretly pleased that none of it was happening to me. Surely it\u2019s time for me to take one for the team.</p> <p>I have friends who\u2019ve had vasectomies. \u201cBest thing I ever did,\u201d said one. Another promised it meant \u201cminimal John Wayne walking\u201d. One of my wife\u2019s friends said a vasectomy was \u201cthe best gift a man can give a woman\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely normal,\u201d one of my closest friends told me. Like me, he\u2019d just had his second child when he decided to have a vasectomy but, unlike me, his procrastination was minimal. He told me that it made him feel \u201clike a married man again, and not just a baby factory\u201d, that it had removed so much uncertainty from his life. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t that painful. You\u2019re in, you\u2019re out and that\u2019s that,\u201d he added. So it\u2019s painless, I asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t say painless,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey\u2019re still your balls. They do feel quite tender for a while. But you\u2019ll have felt much worse.\u201d Looking at him, happy in the certainty that he\u2019d never have any more kids, was a revelation. He almost made it sound like a day at a theme park.</p> <p>But still. The last time I seriously broached the idea, I was promoting a book. During one panel I wondered aloud whether anyone in the audience had gone through with a vasectomy. \u201cYEAH!\u201d a voice called back from the darkness. What was it like, I asked in hope more than anything else. \u201cIT REALLY HURT!\u201d the voice yelled back. And that\u2019s the voice I hear every time I think about making an appointment with my GP.</p> <p>Just for the record, the pain is a part of my reticence, but I\u2019m not a coward. I had my eyes lasered, for example. A sucker attached itself to my eyeball, and a laser beam fired itself into my eye until I went blind. Physically, that has to be the equal of a vasectomy, right? After all, they do say that the eyes are the balls of the face.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A good friend tells me that it was the best thing he ever did</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, it\u2019s the permanence. I never want to have any more kids ever again, but then again what if I do? I change my mind about everything all the time. There was a time when I didn\u2019t want kids, and then all of a sudden out of nowhere I really did. What if, when both my kids are at school, I find myself longing for the early days again? For all the firsts; the teeth, the steps, the words? They say you shouldn\u2019t have a vasectomy if you\u2019re under any stress. But stress has been my default for a while now. What if it\u2019s stress that\u2019s colouring my decision? Maybe, once everything straightens out, I\u2019ll welcome more children with open arms.</p> <p>Tentatively, I arrange a call with Dr Camille Tchuinkam, the lead surgeon at Marie Stopes. He goes to great pains to denounce the myth of the painful vasectomy. \u201cThe procedure we use is the non-scalpel technique,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt reduces complications and there\u2019s very little bleeding. We make two small nicks in the scrotum, maybe 2 or 3mm long, and that\u2019s it. You\u2019d only need two days off work.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to know if many people have last minute on-the-table changes of heart, but Dr Tchuinkam explained that it\u2019s quite rare. \u201cWe have a team of counsellors that patients can talk to if they have any reservations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we do not perform the procedure for at least 10 days, to give the patient time to change their minds.\u201d </p> <p><em><strong>All this was</strong></em> doing a lot to ease my mind, but then he said something I will never be able to forget. \u201cIf you have young children, it\u2019s important to let them know that you need rest,\u201d he began, before telling me the story of a man who came home from a vasectomy to be greeted by his two young children who excitedly ran towards him at crotch height. \u201cHe had to go straight back to hospital,\u201d Dr Tchuinkam said, \u201cto the emergency department.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMY GOD,\u201d I shouted in response, doubled over in agony on the other end of the phone at the thought of it. \u201cBut that\u2019s a rare occurrence,\u2019\u2019 he reassured me. \u201cIt\u2019s just two small nicks, and when they heal it looks like a cigarette burn.\u201d A cigarette burn. A cigarette burn.</p> <p>At that point, I\u2019m not afraid to say, I was out. Of all the mental images I wanted in my head, a cigarette being stubbed out on my scrotum was way down the list. If you\u2019re a man reading this, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re now devoting your brain power to trying to avoid thinking about someone stubbing out a cigarette on your testicles. I wish I could promise that the mental image goes away, but it does not. </p> <p>I still have two New Year\u2019s resolutions this year.

      "bodyText": "I had two new year\u2019s resolutions in 2018; to get a vasectomy and to pass my driving test. When December rolled around, I held my driving licence in my hand with satisfaction. True, I hadn\u2019t achieved both my resolutions, but partial completion isn\u2019t to be sniffed at, right? In 2019, I also had two resolutions \u2013 to get a vasectomy and to rejoin a gym. Again, December came and, again, I only managed one of them. I\u2019m in infinitesimally better physical condition than I was a year ago, so that\u2019s the same as getting a vasectomy. Isn\u2019t it? Do you see a pattern emerging? I\u2019ve stumbled across an amazing, no-fail loophole to stop me feeling bad about never getting a vasectomy. Every year I make a plan to get it done, and every year I sidestep it by creating and executing a different resolution that I can use as a safety net for my own disappointment. Clever, isn\u2019t it? What a genius I am, tricking myself like that. Well done me for outsmarting myself so deftly at every turn. You won\u2019t be surprised to hear that I have two resolutions for 2020 as well. One is to take flying lessons, and the other \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 is to book an appointment for a vasectomy. Really this time. Really and truly. I\u2019m going to do it. Honestly. Except I won\u2019t, will I? This time next year I guarantee that I\u2019ll have ploughed all my money into climate-destroying frivolity, and all because I don\u2019t like the thought of a doctor chopping my balls open. And this is the crux of it. Every time I edge closer towards an appointment, I see flashes of scalpels. I remember word for word how Jamie Oliver described what happened to a friend of his after a vasectomy: \u201cHe cried for three weeks! It went all black!\u201d I hear a mid-slice sneeze. I picture a steamroller bursting open a watermelon. I imagine the pain of that time my two-year-old accidentally trod on my ballsack, and I amplify it by a million. But I should get a vasectomy. I know I should. My testicles have served their purpose. They\u2019ve brought two boys into the world \u2013 two happy, incredible little boys who make my heart sing whenever I so much as catch a glimpse of them. But at the same time I know that I would rather drive over my head in my own car than have any more. The thought of starting from scratch again, and all that it entails, fills me with dread. The sleepless nights. The constant alert. The inability to wear white clothes. The expense. The renewed exposure to Bing. I cannot. Make no mistake, my children are the joy of my life, but give me any more and swear to God I\u2019ll drown myself in a toilet. Plus, I have a feeling that a vasectomy would be good for my marriage. Because it turns out that having tangible evidence that sex leads to children is just about the greatest contraceptive ever created. Before you have kids, you can be forgiven for being a little devil may care about birth control. \u201cIf it happens it happens,\u201d you might say to each other. \u201cWe\u2019re in love! An accidental baby would be an expression of our love!\u201d But once children stop being hypothetical \u2013 once your living room has become a minefield of plastic tat and the arms of your sofa have snail-trails of snot running along them and you\u2019re constantly so tired you can feel your eyeballs vibrating inside your head \u2013 it\u2019s a different matter. Sex takes on an air of Russian roulette. My balls were benign for a long time. Now they\u2019re a pair of hand grenades. So we have two options: either I get a vasectomy or we wait it out for the menopause. Which would be ideal for me, frankly, but a little selfish. After all, men tend to get a free ride in this field. For as long as I\u2019ve known her, my wife has been the one hurling herself into different hormonal tornadoes in the name of contraception. One pill made her gain weight. Another gave her crashing bursts of depression. An IUD resulted in bacterial vaginosis. And all the while I just stood by, secretly pleased that none of it was happening to me. Surely it\u2019s time for me to take one for the team. I have friends who\u2019ve had vasectomies. \u201cBest thing I ever did,\u201d said one. Another promised it meant \u201cminimal John Wayne walking\u201d.

Each half closed with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ludwig-van-beethoven\">Beethoven</a> sonata: the first with the Moonlight, Op 27, No 2, the second with the Waldstein, Op 53. Works by Chopin, including the Fantaisie-Impromptu in C sharp minor, Op 66, and the Raindrop Prelude in D flat, prefaced the former. The Waldstein, meanwhile, followed the first of Schumann\u2019s Opus 23 Nachtst\u00fccke, Debussy\u2019s Feux d\u2019Artifice and Bart\u00f3k\u2019s eerie The Night\u2019s Music from Out of Doors \u2013 all performed as an unbroken sequence, its gathering tensions eventually released in the sonata\u2019s final transition from darkness to light.</p> <p>Kolesnikov\u2019s playing combines great emotional intelligence with understated virtuosity: every shift in sonority and mood speaks volumes in interpretations that are consistently striking. His Beethoven was reined in yet intense. The opening movement of the Moonlight, introverted, lamenting and austere, was balanced by an account of the finale that seemed all the more turbulent for its very restraint, while the Waldstein, launched with terrific \u00e9lan, was breathtaking both in its technical finesse and emotional volatility.</p> <p>Weight and elegance, meanwhile, were combined in some wonderfully fluid Chopin, particularly the C sharp minor Scherzo, Op 39. The exquisite, filigree textures of the central trio offset the force of the opening statement. Schumann\u2019s sombre, funereal Nachtst\u00fcck was all fierce implacability, and both Feux d\u2019Artifice and Bart\u00f3k\u2019s The Night Music were marvellous in their colour, dexterity and subtle dynamic gradations. A truly outstanding recital, every second of it. </p>",

The Waldstein, meanwhile, followed the first of Schumann\u2019s Opus 23 Nachtst\u00fccke, Debussy\u2019s Feux d\u2019Artifice and Bart\u00f3k\u2019s eerie The Night\u2019s Music from Out of Doors \u2013 all performed as an unbroken sequence, its gathering tensions eventually released in the sonata\u2019s final transition from darkness to light. Kolesnikov\u2019s playing combines great emotional intelligence with understated virtuosity: every shift in sonority and mood speaks volumes in interpretations that are consistently striking. His Beethoven was reined in yet intense. The opening movement of the Moonlight, introverted, lamenting and austere, was balanced by an account of the finale that seemed all the more turbulent for its very restraint, while the Waldstein, launched with terrific \u00e9lan, was breathtaking both in its technical finesse and emotional volatility. Weight and elegance, meanwhile, were combined in some wonderfully fluid Chopin, particularly the C sharp minor Scherzo, Op 39. The exquisite, filigree textures of the central trio offset the force of the opening statement. Schumann\u2019s sombre, funereal Nachtst\u00fcck was all fierce implacability, and both Feux d\u2019Artifice and Bart\u00f3k\u2019s The Night Music were marvellous in their colour, dexterity and subtle dynamic gradations. A truly outstanding recital, every second of it.",

      "body": "<p>At the beginning of 2019, Ncuti Gatwa had fewer than 1,000 followers on Instagram. He had filmed <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/17/sex-education-asa-butterfield-gillian-anderson-netflix\" title=\"\">Sex Education</a></em> the previous summer, and by January, it was ready for the world to see. Though it starred big names \u2013 Gillian Anderson, Asa Butterfield \u2013 on paper the show sounded more like a cult oddity than a smash hit. Butterfield played Otis, a secondary-school student turned sex therapist for his peers in a gaudy world that sat between a John Hughes movie and a <em>Just </em><em>Seventeen </em>problem page. Gatwa starred as Eric Effiong, Otis\u2019s best friend. Netflix had flown the cast to New York to promote <em>Sex Education</em>, which was released when Gatwa was on the return flight \u2013 and his character was a huge hit. When he landed at Heathrow, Gatwa turned on his phone. In the space of several hours, his follower count had gone up\u2026 by a couple of hundred thousand.</p> <p>\u201cIt definitely felt <em>exposing</em>,\u201d Gatwa says. He\u2019s sitting in a caf\u00e9 in Soho, almost exactly a year after the show changed his life so suddenly. At 27, he is a decade older than Eric, and less flamboyant, though he shares the character\u2019s ebullience. He sounds different, too \u2013 his own accent roams Scotland, Rwanda and Tottenham, where he now lives, and his broad laugh ripples across the busy lunchtime crowd.</p> <p>\u201cI remember the next day, me, Emma [Mackey, who plays Maeve in the show] and Aimee [Lou Wood, who is Aimee] went to Lush, and we were buying our soaps. And our scrubs. I <em>love</em> Lush,\u201d he says, hamming it up, speaking directly into my dictaphone. \u201cEmma said: \u2018Ncuti, we have to go.\u2019 Behind her, I saw, not a frenzy, but a group of people forming. We had been spotted.\u201d They felt it best to do a runner. \u201cIt was an odd experience,\u201d he smiles.</p> <p>Nobody quite seemed to anticipate just how big <em>Sex Education </em>would be. Dealing with the sexual hang-ups of teenagers and adults, it was both sensitive and crude, timeless and timely, funny and sweet, and managed to appeal far beyond any youth audience. As Eric, Gatwa became a magnet for viewers\u2019 empathy and affection. He was an out, proud and loud gay teenager, whose Ghanian-Nigerian family were worried for his wellbeing. While he experienced self-doubt and rejection, in the end he triumphantly embraced who he was, in the most heartwarming prom scene since Lindsay Lohan snapped the tiara in <em>Mean Girls</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eeaaa587050ff1d990638431609359b999db4338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eeaaa587050ff1d990638431609359b999db4338/0_409_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ncuti Gatwa as Eric Effiong, wearing a purple top and denim dungarees and sitting in a chair in a school corridor, staring and looking slightly anxious, in a scene from Sex Education.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">School daze: In Sex Education.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Taylor/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Netflix\u2019s approach to containing spoilers is notoriously strict \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s a Netflix assassin right there,\u201d jokes Gatwa, glancing sideways \u2013 but, of course, Eric will be back for season two, and given that the first ended with him finding unexpected romance, anticipation for what comes next is high. \u201cIn season one, Eric shows how resilient he is, and that resonates with how resilient a lot of people have to be, especially people who are marginalised in this society.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My character resonates with how resilient a lot of marginalised people have to be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a gay man and a black man, Eric is \u201ca minority within a minority, so that\u2019s doubly hard\u201d.

Can you imagine?\u201d \u201cYou know I\u2019m not one to gossip\u2026\u201d Gossip, he says, is everything. \u201cSo a lot of times in black communities, people are scared \u2013 it\u2019s not what they are feeling towards their child, but what aunties are gonna say, what uncles are gonna say.\u201d Eric\u2019s father loves and embraces his son for who he is. \u201cHe\u2019s just scared for the world his son is going to inhabit, and that is very human.\u201d</p> <p>Every day, Gatwa receives a message from someone who tells him that Eric\u2019s experience mirrors their own. He got a DM two days ago that moved him to tears. \u201cThis guy, his English was broken, but I got what he was saying. He said, whenever I watch the dance, when you and Otis dance at the end, I can escape my world for 15 minutes. He said, I can go to my dreams.\u201d Gatwa\u2019s eyes begin to water. \u201cIt was just really beautiful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29a9735512c3ffe8d5e2a8285130bd4944ed857d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29a9735512c3ffe8d5e2a8285130bd4944ed857d/0_1745_4802_2881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They will fall in love with me sooner or later\u2019: Ncuti Gatwa wears blazer by Bottega Veneta, shirt and trousers by Louis Vuitton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They will fall in love with me sooner or later\u2019: Ncuti Gatwa wears blazer by Bottega Veneta, shirt and trousers by Louis Vuitton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Chalkley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How much<em><strong> </strong></em>of Eric\u2019s story resembles his own? \u201cThere are definitely parallels. I related to his sense of isolation, growing up. There\u2019s not many people that look like me in Scotland.\u201d When he was a toddler, Gatwa and his family moved from Rwanda as refugees, fleeing the genocide. He grew up in Oxgangs and Fife, and in a recent BBC documentary, <em>Black and Scottish</em>, talked about being bullied at secondary school in Dunfermline, where new classmates set up a racist Facebook page about him.</p> <p>It sounds awful. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t actually horrendous.\u201d He looks mischievous. \u201cDo I want to say this? Yeah, why not\u2026 it didn\u2019t really bother me that much because I <em>knew</em>.\u201d He is chuckling. \u201cI was like, you can\u2019t <em>know</em> me and not like me. I was actually quite confused! I was like, what? These people don\u2019t like me? I was like, that\u2019s never happened before.\u201d The laugh blooms into a full-blown guffaw. \u201cSo I was like, OK, fine. I\u2019m just going to carry on being myself and they\u2019re going to fall in love with me sooner or later. And they did.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, he became friends with the boys who set up the page. \u201cIt was really a good lesson to me about the difference between hate and ignorance. Obviously their behaviour was inexcusable. But at the same time, I was the first black person that they probably saw in real life.\u201d</p> <p>Did they talk about it afterwards? \u201cThey apologised profusely. Sorry is only a word, isn\u2019t it, but their actions spoke more than that. It wasn\u2019t that horrendous. My mum really toughened me up, as well. I grew up watching her move to this country with three kids on her back. She couldn\u2019t speak the language, didn\u2019t know the culture, no money, no nothing \u2013 and she raised all three of us. As cheesy as it sounds, I\u2019ve been watching strength from young. My mum has dealt with so much shit.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>As a child,</strong></em> Gatwa was always lively, but he existed between two worlds. At home, he was quiet, shy and dedicated to his Bible studies. \u201cOutside the house, I was a live wire,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI was a wild teenager.\u201d He won\u2019t be drawn on details, but reels off a greatest hits of teenage rebellion: \u201cDrinking, smoking, being in places you shouldn\u2019t have been. Sneaking out of my house. Ah Mum, you don\u2019t know that one! But I\u2019m nice now.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want to be an actor as a kid, partly because he didn\u2019t even know it was a possibility, but drama was the only subject he enjoyed and, often, it was the only class he\u2019d show up for. \u201cThe rest, I was, like, bye!

Every single day, someone is getting wanked off in a car, someone\u2019s sucking off someone\u2019s dad. \u2018Oh, what are you doing today?\u2019 \u2018Oh just having my third wank of the day.\u2019 That was the nature of the show.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re laughing, but frankness is part of the series\u2019 charm, and the openness about sex and identity speaks to the generation it depicts. \u201cTeenagers now are so progressive,\u201d Gatwa agrees. \u201cI live with my best friend and his mum, who runs a salon in Tottenham and I\u2019m there all the time. Whenever the young boys come in to get their trims, the conversations they have, they\u2019re like, \u2018Ah Mum, they\u2019re non-binary, you can\u2019t call them \u2018him\u2019.

That\u2019s the generation that\u2019s going to save the world.\u201d</p> <p>It isn\u2019t just kids<em><strong> </strong></em>who come up to him in the street.

For the first time, he looks a little sad. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, softly. \u201cThere\u2019s good days with it, and bad days with it. It\u2019s fine, and it\u2019s not fine. But what do I expect people to think? It\u2019s the only role the world has seen me in.\u201d He graduated from drama school in 2013 and until S<em>ex Education</em>, mostly did theatre, though I remind him of a stint as a policeman in the 2015 Scottish drama <em>Stonemouth</em>, and he howls. \u201cPeople forget about that <em>pivotal</em> role in my career. Really changed things, that one. My mum said I looked like a baby strippergram. Dougie the cop! He will live in my heart forever.\u201d</p> <p>Gatwa says he gets it. Like Eric, he is a chatterbox. \u201cThe thing is, Eric is 16, so he doesn\u2019t need coffee, does he? I will need a coffee at times. Every time you see me I\u2019m not gonna be bubbly and smiley.\u201d Being stopped on the tube, or chased around a soap shop, is all very new. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to get my head around it. There was a particularly tricky time recently when I had just lost a friend. Obviously bereavement is tough but life goes on, you\u2019re out and about in your normal day, and your brain isn\u2019t in the best place. And people still want that selfie and they don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t put that on them. It gets tricky trying to handle your personal and your public life.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>He prefers not</strong></em> to talk about his personal life, but he\u2019s happy to discuss a recent trip to Rwanda, his first there in 12 years. His parents had nine siblings each, so there was a lot of family to see. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I was a bit cautious about going back, because I was, like, \u2018I wonder how they\u2019re going to take me.\u2019 I\u2019ve entered the public sphere in a very specific way. But they\u2019re so protective of me! Very, very protective and very proud.\u201d He was in awe at the beauty he saw. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I was looking at real life. It\u2019s just so nice to be able to fly that flag. That flag and my Scottish flag. I love that I come from both those places.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b58228b030a941f3c782d894590e0702d81c676\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b58228b030a941f3c782d894590e0702d81c676/0_437_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ncuti Gatwa with Nick Blakeley in The Claim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stage player: with Nick Blakeley in The Claim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes, he says, people are confused by how he sounds. \u201cI don\u2019t think you expect to see a young black boy with skin fades coming out with a Scottish accent. Even me!\u201d His accent tends to shift and adapt to wherever he is. \u201cBut way back when I first moved to London, there have been times when people have tried to fight me.\u201d</p> <p>On nights out, people would challenge him about where he\u2019s from. \u201cYou get chatting, like, oh mate, where are you from? Oh I\u2019m from Scotland. Lol, no, where are you actually from? <em>Scotland</em>. Why are you taking the piss? I\u2019m not taking the piss. And people think you\u2019re being a dick.\u201d Confounding expectations, however, does have its benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s booked me a lot of jobs. I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p> <p>Gatwa has finished shooting season two of <em>Sex Education</em>, and is currently filming <em>Last L</em><em>etter from Your Lover</em>, an adaptation of the Jojo Moyes novel, starring Felicity Jones (he plays her flatmate). Then he\u2019s going to the US to shoot a film, where he will play the lead. \u201cIf I talk about it any more, I might get sued.\u201d He\u2019s happy, he says, taking roles where he can make people laugh and think at the same time. But ultimately, he has one goal from it all, and that\u2019s to buy his mum a house. \u201cThose are my dreams. Buy mum a house, build a school in Rwanda,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cThen carry on making enough money to buy soaps from Lush.\u201d</p> <p><em>Sex Education series two is on Netflix from 17 January</em></p> <p><em>Ncuti Gatwa styling by Bemi Shaw and grooming by Keshia West</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "At the beginning of 2019, Ncuti Gatwa had fewer than 1,000 followers on Instagram. He had filmed Sex Education the previous summer, and by January, it was ready for the world to see. Though it starred big names \u2013 Gillian Anderson, Asa Butterfield \u2013 on paper the show sounded more like a cult oddity than a smash hit. Butterfield played Otis, a secondary-school student turned sex therapist for his peers in a gaudy world that sat between a John Hughes movie and a Just Seventeen problem page. Gatwa starred as Eric Effiong, Otis\u2019s best friend. Netflix had flown the cast to New York to promote Sex Education, which was released when Gatwa was on the return flight \u2013 and his character was a huge hit. When he landed at Heathrow, Gatwa turned on his phone. In the space of several hours, his follower count had gone up\u2026 by a couple of hundred thousand. \u201cIt definitely felt exposing,\u201d Gatwa says. He\u2019s sitting in a caf\u00e9 in Soho, almost exactly a year after the show changed his life so suddenly. At 27, he is a decade older than Eric, and less flamboyant, though he shares the character\u2019s ebullience. He sounds different, too \u2013 his own accent roams Scotland, Rwanda and Tottenham, where he now lives, and his broad laugh ripples across the busy lunchtime crowd. \u201cI remember the next day, me, Emma [Mackey, who plays Maeve in the show] and Aimee [Lou Wood, who is Aimee] went to Lush, and we were buying our soaps. And our scrubs. I love Lush,\u201d he says, hamming it up, speaking directly into my dictaphone. \u201cEmma said: \u2018Ncuti, we have to go.\u2019 Behind her, I saw, not a frenzy, but a group of people forming. We had been spotted.\u201d They felt it best to do a runner. \u201cIt was an odd experience,\u201d he smiles. Nobody quite seemed to anticipate just how big Sex Education would be. Dealing with the sexual hang-ups of teenagers and adults, it was both sensitive and crude, timeless and timely, funny and sweet, and managed to appeal far beyond any youth audience. As Eric, Gatwa became a magnet for viewers\u2019 empathy and affection. He was an out, proud and loud gay teenager, whose Ghanian-Nigerian family were worried for his wellbeing. While he experienced self-doubt and rejection, in the end he triumphantly embraced who he was, in the most heartwarming prom scene since Lindsay Lohan snapped the tiara in Mean Girls. Netflix\u2019s approach to containing spoilers is notoriously strict \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s a Netflix assassin right there,\u201d jokes Gatwa, glancing sideways \u2013 but, of course, Eric will be back for season two, and given that the first ended with him finding unexpected romance, anticipation for what comes next is high. \u201cIn season one, Eric shows how resilient he is, and that resonates with how resilient a lot of people have to be, especially people who are marginalised in this society.\u201d As a gay man and a black man, Eric is \u201ca minority within a minority, so that\u2019s doubly hard\u201d. Gatwa particularly loves the relationship Eric has with his father, who quietly accepts his son\u2019s homosexuality while being cautious about what that will mean for his life. \u201cI felt, perhaps, if you are from that culture and that background, and are having a situation where you\u2019ve got somebody gay or LGBTQIA+ in your family, and you\u2019re struggling with it, you can watch the show and be like: \u2018It\u2019s fine to love and embrace my child.\u2019\u201d Eric is from a Ghanian-Nigerian family; Gatwa\u2019s family is Rwandan. But they share a religious upbringing. \u201cWithin church communities, within black communities, and within black church communities, gossip is thy friend. Gossip will be thy friend!\u201d He slaps his hands on the table and slips into an impression of women in church: \u201cDid you see what sister Ama\u2019s son has done?\u201d \u201cWhat! And she accepted it! Can you imagine?\u201d \u201cYou know I\u2019m not one to gossip\u2026\u201d Gossip, he says, is everything. \u201cSo a lot of times in black communities, people are scared \u2013 it\u2019s not what they are feeling towards their child, but what aunties are gonna say, what uncles are gonna say.\u201d Eric\u2019s father loves and embraces his son for who he is. \u201cHe\u2019s just scared for the world his son is going to inhabit, and that is very human.\u201d Every day, Gatwa receives a message from someone who tells him that Eric\u2019s experience mirrors their own. He got a DM two days ago that moved him to tears. \u201cThis guy, his English was broken, but I got what he was saying. He said, whenever I watch the dance, when you and Otis dance at the end, I can escape my world for 15 minutes. He said, I can go to my dreams.\u201d Gatwa\u2019s eyes begin to water. \u201cIt was just really beautiful.\u201d How much of Eric\u2019s story resembles his own? \u201cThere are definitely parallels.

I\u2019m just going to carry on being myself and they\u2019re going to fall in love with me sooner or later.

Do people expect him to be Eric? For the first time, he looks a little sad. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, softly. \u201cThere\u2019s good days with it, and bad days with it. It\u2019s fine, and it\u2019s not fine. But what do I expect people to think? It\u2019s the only role the world has seen me in.\u201d He graduated from drama school in 2013 and until Sex Education, mostly did theatre, though I remind him of a stint as a policeman in the 2015 Scottish drama Stonemouth, and he howls. \u201cPeople forget about that pivotal role in my career. Really changed things, that one. My mum said I looked like a baby strippergram. Dougie the cop! He will live in my heart forever.\u201d Gatwa says he gets it. Like Eric, he is a chatterbox. \u201cThe thing is, Eric is 16, so he doesn\u2019t need coffee, does he? I will need a coffee at times. Every time you see me I\u2019m not gonna be bubbly and smiley.\u201d Being stopped on the tube, or chased around a soap shop, is all very new. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to get my head around it. There was a particularly tricky time recently when I had just lost a friend. Obviously bereavement is tough but life goes on, you\u2019re out and about in your normal day, and your brain isn\u2019t in the best place. And people still want that selfie and they don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t put that on them. It gets tricky trying to handle your personal and your public life.\u201d He prefers not to talk about his personal life, but he\u2019s happy to discuss a recent trip to Rwanda, his first there in 12 years. His parents had nine siblings each, so there was a lot of family to see. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, I was a bit cautious about going back, because I was, like, \u2018I wonder how they\u2019re going to take me.\u2019 I\u2019ve entered the public sphere in a very specific way. But they\u2019re so protective of me! Very, very protective and very proud.\u201d He was in awe at the beauty he saw. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I was looking at real life. It\u2019s just so nice to be able to fly that flag. That flag and my Scottish flag. I love that I come from both those places.\u201d Sometimes, he says, people are confused by how he sounds. \u201cI don\u2019t think you expect to see a young black boy with skin fades coming out with a Scottish accent. Even me!\u201d His accent tends to shift and adapt to wherever he is. \u201cBut way back when I first moved to London, there have been times when people have tried to fight me.\u201d On nights out, people would challenge him about where he\u2019s from. \u201cYou get chatting, like, oh mate, where are you from? Oh I\u2019m from Scotland. Lol, no, where are you actually from? Scotland. Why are you taking the piss? I\u2019m not taking the piss. And people think you\u2019re being a dick.\u201d Confounding expectations, however, does have its benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s booked me a lot of jobs. I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d Gatwa has finished shooting season two of Sex Education, and is currently filming Last Letter from Your Lover, an adaptation of the Jojo Moyes novel, starring Felicity Jones (he plays her flatmate). Then he\u2019s going to the US to shoot a film, where he will play the lead. \u201cIf I talk about it any more, I might get sued.\u201d He\u2019s happy, he says, taking roles where he can make people laugh and think at the same time. But ultimately, he has one goal from it all, and that\u2019s to buy his mum a house. \u201cThose are my dreams. Buy mum a house, build a school in Rwanda,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cThen carry on making enough money to buy soaps from Lush.\u201d Sex Education series two is on Netflix from 17 January Ncuti Gatwa styling by Bemi Shaw and grooming by Keshia West",

      "body": "<p>On the morning of 14 August 1945 towards the end of the second world war, 16-year-old Arek Hersh and 300 other Jewish children boarded a squadron of 10 converted Stirling bombers and took off from Prague. They were organised in groups of 30 to each aeroplane, with 15 sitting on each side on the floor. Hersh remembers it vividly: \u201cThey cut us some bread,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought it was cake. They gave us each a piece and it was great.\u201d About eight hours later, they landed at RAF Crosby-on-Eden, near Carlisle.</p> <p>The children were the first intake of a pioneering rehabilitation scheme, in which boys and girls from labour and concentration camps in eastern Europe were transported to the Lake District to find new families and start afresh. Their journey has been dramatised by the screenwriter Simon Block and the result is a timely and moving BBC film <em>The Windermere Children</em>, starring Thomas Kretschmann and Romola Garai, to be shown this month, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.</p> <p>At 91, Hersh is spry with a mischievous sense of humour. For almost half a century, he spoke to no one about his Holocaust experience. Not to his three daughters, who are old enough now not only to have kids of their own but also grandchildren. Nor to Jean, his second wife, whom he married in the early 1970s. Eventually, around 1995, Hersh decided to write it all down. The words came excruciatingly slowly. \u201cTwo lines a day,\u201d he recalls, when we meet at his comfortable home just north of Leeds. \u201cBut I wrote it, and then after that I could speak, I could talk about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbe5d6b6dd7a0599d46d3cafaab5e0f5de7b2ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbe5d6b6dd7a0599d46d3cafaab5e0f5de7b2ecc/0_300_6720_4180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arek Hersh, Holocaust survivor, photographed at his home near Leeds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"622\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was very, very lucky\u2019: Arek Hersh, Holocaust survivor, photographed at his home near Leeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the war, Hersh \u2013 Herszlikowicz back then \u2013 lived with his parents, brother and three sisters in Sieradz, a garrison town in west Poland. His father was a bootmaker, much in demand for making officers\u2019 footwear. When the Nazis invaded, they came first for Hersh\u2019s father, but he escaped; they came back for his brother, but he also slipped away. That left 11-year-old Arek, who was packed off to a labour camp near Poznan to lay lines and sleepers for the Poznan-Warsaw railway, which would speed up the German attack on the Soviet Union. One of his responsibilities was to clean the room of the camp commandant, who every day would leave Hersh a hunk of bread on his desk. It wasn\u2019t much, but Hersh believes it saved his life. \u201cWe started with 2,500 men,\u201d he says. \u201cWithin 18 months, there were only 11 of us left alive. And I was one of them. Very, very lucky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuck\u201d is a word that comes up again and again in Hersh\u2019s account. When he was sent to Auschwitz in 1944, he told the SS officer that he was 17 and a locksmith. He wasn\u2019t either of those things; he just wanted to suggest that he might be useful to the Nazis. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I said, and they told me to go to the right side,\u201d says Hersh. \u201cAnd 180 children all went to the wrong side. And they were murdered.\u201d</p> <p>The most gruelling experience for Hersh personally, however, came in the early months of 1945, when he was evacuated first on foot, in the bitter cold, to the Buchenwald camp in Germany and finally to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia on what he calls \u201cthe train of damnation\u201d. \u201cA whole month on open wagons without food,\u201d says Hersh, shaking his head. \u201cWe ate grass. I ate the leather on my left shoe to keep going. I didn\u2019t swallow but I chewed it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Your first instinct is to try to think your way into their heads. But you realise that\u2019s impossible</p> <footer> <cite>Simon Block, screenwriter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hersh was in Theresienstadt, expecting any moment to be killed, when the camp was liberated by the Russian army on 8 May, 1945. He was moved on to Prague and it was here he was selected for the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, which was set up by the British philanthropist Leonard Montefiore, a leading figure in the Anglo-Jewish Association. Montefiore persuaded the British government to accept 1,000 displaced children aged eight to 16; the Home Office agreed on condition that the funds were found by the Jewish community. In the end 650 boys and 80 girls came over.</p> <p>What kind of physical and mental shape must these children have been in? How do you begin to repair the damage done to individuals, who in many cases were the only surviving members of large families? How do you try to imagine what they might be thinking? These were the questions that faced the therapists and educators at Windermere who were to help them in August 1945. It was also a quandary for the team behind the new drama.</p> <p>\u201cYour first instinct is to try to think your way into their heads,\u201d says Simon Block. \u201cBut you realise that\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t imagine what Arek, who was in four different concentration and labour camps including Auschwitz, went through. And not just for a day, but for years. You can\u2019t recreate that trauma; all you can do is reflect how their behaviour may have manifested some of that while they were at Windermere.\u201d</p> <p>Hersh turns up the electric fire a notch and Jean walks in with a tray of tea, biscuits and cake, and instructs me with brisk hospitality to tuck in, because her husband will probably forget. On the walls are photographs of Hersh with the Queen, Prince Charles and Liza Minnelli. \u201cOh yes, she dedicated a song to me one time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>After landing at Crosby-on-Eden, Hersh and the other children were driven to the Calgarth estate in the village of Troutbeck Bridge. A mile from Windermere, it was a wartime housing scheme that had been used for workers from the Short Sunderland aeroplane factory, which had relocated there to evade the bombing. Dormitory accommodation was provided as well as single rooms for older boys, like Hersh. \u201cEach one had a bed, a chest of drawers,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was everything you needed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e9077233e742232da433e085d38f87d1184ef2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e9077233e742232da433e085d38f87d1184ef2f/0_0_4284_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Survivors today, with the actors who play them in The Windermere Children (left to right): Chaim \u2018Harry\u2019 Olmer, Kacper Swietek, Arek Hersh, Tomasz Studzinski, Pascal Fischer, Ben Helfgott, Marek Wroblewski, Sam Laskier, Kuba Sprenger, Ike Alterman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Survivors today, with the actors who play them in The Windermere Children (left to right): Chaim \u2018Harry\u2019 Olmer, Kacper Swietek, Arek Hersh, Tomasz Studzinski, Pascal Fischer, Ben Helfgott, Marek Wroblewski, Sam Laskier, Kuba Sprenger, Ike Alterman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Sloan/BBC/Wall to Wall/ZDF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Windermere programme is not as well known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/2019/feb/08/kindertransport-britains-response-to-the-growing-refugee-crisis-in-1938\" title=\"\">Kindertransport initiative</a>, which moved nearly 10,000 mostly Jewish children from Nazi-occupied territories to Britain between 1938 and 1939.

      "bodyText": "On the morning of 14 August 1945 towards the end of the second world war, 16-year-old Arek Hersh and 300 other Jewish children boarded a squadron of 10 converted Stirling bombers and took off from Prague. They were organised in groups of 30 to each aeroplane, with 15 sitting on each side on the floor. Hersh remembers it vividly: \u201cThey cut us some bread,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought it was cake. They gave us each a piece and it was great.\u201d About eight hours later, they landed at RAF Crosby-on-Eden, near Carlisle. The children were the first intake of a pioneering rehabilitation scheme, in which boys and girls from labour and concentration camps in eastern Europe were transported to the Lake District to find new families and start afresh. Their journey has been dramatised by the screenwriter Simon Block and the result is a timely and moving BBC film The Windermere Children, starring Thomas Kretschmann and Romola Garai, to be shown this month, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. At 91, Hersh is spry with a mischievous sense of humour. For almost half a century, he spoke to no one about his Holocaust experience. Not to his three daughters, who are old enough now not only to have kids of their own but also grandchildren. Nor to Jean, his second wife, whom he married in the early 1970s. Eventually, around 1995, Hersh decided to write it all down. The words came excruciatingly slowly. \u201cTwo lines a day,\u201d he recalls, when we meet at his comfortable home just north of Leeds. \u201cBut I wrote it, and then after that I could speak, I could talk about it.\u201d Before the war, Hersh \u2013 Herszlikowicz back then \u2013 lived with his parents, brother and three sisters in Sieradz, a garrison town in west Poland. His father was a bootmaker, much in demand for making officers\u2019 footwear. When the Nazis invaded, they came first for Hersh\u2019s father, but he escaped; they came back for his brother, but he also slipped away. That left 11-year-old Arek, who was packed off to a labour camp near Poznan to lay lines and sleepers for the Poznan-Warsaw railway, which would speed up the German attack on the Soviet Union. One of his responsibilities was to clean the room of the camp commandant, who every day would leave Hersh a hunk of bread on his desk. It wasn\u2019t much, but Hersh believes it saved his life. \u201cWe started with 2,500 men,\u201d he says. \u201cWithin 18 months, there were only 11 of us left alive. And I was one of them. Very, very lucky.\u201d \u201cLuck\u201d is a word that comes up again and again in Hersh\u2019s account. When he was sent to Auschwitz in 1944, he told the SS officer that he was 17 and a locksmith.

The Flyers remain comfortably clear on top at 13-3, but Adelaide have given them something to think about leading into the playoffs. The Lightning made it a round-12 double after destroying the Fire in Townsville on Friday 87-61.</p> <p>Southside started off their western road trip by taking care of the Lynx 90-75 in Perth when Rebecca Cole was running hot with 30 points.</p> <p>There was a major upset in Bendigo on Friday as the battling Spirit edged out reigning champions Canberra 94-90. It came on a weekend when the Capitals were forced to cancel their game against Perth at the AIS because of hazardous conditions in Canberra from the bushfires devastating Australia. The Capitals have not been able to train at the AIS or the University of Canberra since New Year\u2019s Eve.</p> <p>In the final game, the championship-contending Melbourne Boomers smashed Sydney Uni 86-63.

My, hasn\u2019t it been a big weekend on several fronts. The more the country burns, the less significant, relevant even, sport seems to be. But, smoke haze and air quality permitting, sport is carrying on. In <strong>cricket</strong>, Australia have spent Sunday tightening their grip around New Zealand\u2019s illness-weakened neck. In <strong>tennis</strong>, Australia - minus Nick Kyrgios, whose initiative to get behind bushfire relief has thankfully caught on - did the business against Canada in the ATP Cup. In the <strong>W-League</strong>, Melbourne Victory did their finals chances no harm with a win over Newcastle. To come, the same two clubs do battle in the <strong>A-League</strong> at the same time as the Sixers lock horns with the Strikers in the <strong>Big Bash League</strong>. So, there\u2019s plenty on and doubtless plenty more skirting the periphery that might pique our interest.

      "bodyText": "And this is where Sportwatch ends this Sunday. Josh Philippe and the Sixers were too good for the Strikers in the Big Bash, Melbourne Victory showed they\u2019re not done with a big win over Newcastle in the A-League, the Victory also did the job against the Jets in the W-League and Australia were too good for Canada in the ATP Cup. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned the Sydney Test. A big day of sport. Thanks for your company. It was always hard to tell how many the Strikers would need and in the end their 176-6, was, just, not enough for this Sixers line-up. Curran finishes the job with a six (with three balls to spare) but Philippe was the man, batting through to finish with 83 off 52 balls. He is a real talent. BBL: 19 overs: Sydney Sixers 173-3 (Philippe 82, Curran 4) v Adelaide Strikers (176-6) Philippe goes nuts, scoring most of the 21 runs off Neser\u2019s over, and this match is now absolutely the Sixers\u2019 to lose. Just four runs to win. Neser returns 0-48 from his four overs. Ouch. BBL: 18 overs: Sydney Sixers 152-3 (Philippe 65, Curran 0) v Adelaide Strikers (176-6) A ripper of a catch by Rashid Khan in the deep does for Vince - for some reason it\u2019s sent upstairs for an interminable number of reviews - keeps the Strikers in with a sniff. BBL: 17 overs: Sydney Sixers 145-2 (Philippe 63, Vince 8) v Adelaide Strikers (176-6) Philippe, dropped by Neser in the 16th over, is making the Strikers pay. But though wickets are not an issue, runs still are. Could go either way, but the Sixers are still favoured. BBL: 15 overs: Sydney Sixers 123-2 (Philippe 50, Vince 0) v Adelaide Strikers (176-6) Rashid Khan, back in the attack, does what he does best and breaks through, enticing Hughes into an expansive shot which finds its way down the throat of Short at deep midwicket. Philippe, meanwhile, stands in Adelaide\u2019s way and reaches his fifty off 36 balls. BBL: 13 overs: Sydney Sixers 105-1 (Philippe 35, Hughes 21) v Adelaide Strikers (176-6) The asking rate is now a shade over 10 runs per over, which looks entirely achievable for the Sixers with nine wickets in hand on a perfect evening in Coffs. WNBL wrap: Adelaide are now the team to beat Adelaide are the real WNBL deal, proving it with a stunning 104-93 win against the ladder-leading Southside Flyers. Last season\u2019s beaten grand finalists proved too good on Sunday for the Melbourne-based team, who were on the second leg of their weekend road trip. The Lightning, powered by captain Nicole Seekamp (10 points, 20 assists) and Lauren Nicholson (24 points), prevented the Flyers all but locking up top spot on the ladder. Australian basketball legend Lauren Jackson said on social media the Lightning (10-6) were a genuine championship threat and were hitting top form at the right time. The Flyers remain comfortably clear on top at 13-3, but Adelaide have given them something to think about leading into the playoffs. The Lightning made it a round-12 double after destroying the Fire in Townsville on Friday 87-61. Southside started off their western road trip by taking care of the Lynx 90-75 in Perth when Rebecca Cole was running hot with 30 points. There was a major upset in Bendigo on Friday as the battling Spirit edged out reigning champions Canberra 94-90. It came on a weekend when the Capitals were forced to cancel their game against Perth at the AIS because of hazardous conditions in Canberra from the bushfires devastating Australia. The Capitals have not been able to train at the AIS or the University of Canberra since New Year\u2019s Eve. In the final game, the championship-contending Melbourne Boomers smashed Sydney Uni 86-63. The Boomers will travel to Adelaide on Friday as the Lightning aim to take another scalp. - with thanks to AAP BBL: 9 overs: Sydney Sixers 75-1 (Philippe 25, Hughes 2) v Adelaide Strikers (176-6) An important breakthrough for the Strikers with Avendano going for 47 off 33 balls. His moment of reckoning, a skied attempted pull shot off the bowling of Conway, hung in the air long enough for us all to grow a beard as Carey loitered under it, put the kettle on, and somehow managed to take the catch. Here\u2019s that Avendano blow off Siddle\u2019s bowling. Wow! BBL: 8 overs: Sydney Sixers 68-0 (Avendano 43, Philippe 24) v Adelaide Strikers (176-6) They\u2019re coming out of the screws now. Both openers are seeing them like beach balls, and if they carry on like this we\u2019ll know that 176 isn\u2019t par at this ground. You have to see Avendano\u2019s pull shot off Siddle for six to believe it. To be fair to Pete, he recovered well and only went for nine in the over. If too much cricket isn\u2019t enough cricket for your liking, wrap your inners around this liveblog of the South Africa-England Test match at Newlands. BBL: 5 overs: Sydney Sixers 35-0 (Avendano 25, Philippe 9) v Adelaide Strikers (176-6) A solid start to the Sixers\u2019 chase, with no wickets lost but, amazingly, Philippe not scoring at more than a run a ball. There\u2019s time... A game to forget for Newcastle but a special result for Melbourne Victory, who bizarrely looked better without Ola Toivonen on the park. Kruse was immense and the four-goal margin was entirely fitting. This, the their second win on the bounce, was a timely reminder that the Victory can do something if they manage to make the finals. As for the Jets, where does one start... A-League: GOAL! Melbourne Victory 4-0 Newcastle (Millar OG, 86\u2019) Oh dear. It\u2019s been that kind of night for the Jets and this tops it off nicely, than you very much. A nice cross in from Lesiotis stretches the Newcastle defence and Millar, sliding in to repel the challenge, can do no more than dribble the ball into the net. Whistle please! NBL: South East Melbourne 92-97 New Zealand Breakers New Zealand Breakers have endured a NBL season full of drama and tragedy, yet the roster has overcome adversity to become the competition\u2019s danger team. Following a fifth straight win - and fourth on the road - the Breakers are quickly closing in on the top-four. They edged South East Melbourne 97-92 on Sunday, just days after the death of their manager Fata Letoa, to sit fifth. The Breakers ruined the Phoenix\u2019s first game at Melbourne\u2019s State Basketball Centre and moved closed to play-off contention as round 14 drew to a close. - with thanks to AAP BBL: 20 overs: Adelaide Strikers 176-6 v Sydney Sixers An unbeaten 40 off 28 balls to Wells, and some lusty hitting at the end from Neser (25 off 15) and Khan (14no off 6), gets Adelaide to the sort of total they looked like tallying when Weatherald and co were hitting with impunity early on. A-League: GOAL! Melbourne Victory 3-0 Newcastle (Nabbout, 64\u2019) Kruse involved again - he\u2019s having a blinder tonight - and Nabbout drills it home from inside the box to pretty much make it goodnight nurse. The Jets are a rabble now, out of shape and three goals to the bad. A-League: GOAL! Melbourne Victory 2-0 Newcastle (Basha, 61\u2019) One change for the Jets early in the second half, with Burns making way for Koutroumbis. Newcastle have enjoyed the better of the opening minutes of this stanza but it\u2019s the Victory who score against the run of play and double their lead. Moss can do no more than parry Kruse\u2019s shot into Basha\u2019s path, and the birthday boy makes no mistake in slotting it home. That\u2019s two goals for two people celebrating their birthday today. You wouldn\u2019t read about it. BBL: 17 overs: Adelaide Strikers 138-5 (Wells 32, Neser 9) v Sydney Sixers A comedy run-out sees Short depart without facing a ball and, though Wells is batting like a man possessed, one wonders how many the Strikers might have scored without their various brain fades. One also wonders what constitutes a worthy total at this ground? ATP Cup update: Dimitrov does the business for Bulgaria Grigor Dimitrov has helped edge Bulgaria a step closer to the ATP Cup finals after his straight sets win over Radu Albot secured the tie for his country on Sunday. The world No 20 looked in fine touch, registering a 6-2 6-3 win over the Moldovan. While it was a cooler day in Sydney following Saturday\u2019s scorching 45C heat, the the winds brought with it bushfire smoke haze and dust which impacted Ken Rosewall Arena despite its new roof \u201cObviously I see a little bit more now. It\u2019s definitely not pleasant. But I even noticed it this morning when we went to the court to warm up. The court was a little bit more dustier than it was the previous days,\u201d Dimitrov said. \u201cClearly it is what it is. You know, we can control only what we can.\u201d Earlier, Dimitar Kuzmanov gave Bulgaria the perfect start with a 6-1 7-5 win over Alexander Cozbinov. Moldova picked up a rubber when Albot teamed with Cozbinov to beat Dimitrov and Alexandar Lazarov 6-4 7-6 (7-4). The victory leaves the Bulgarians at 2-0 for the competition along with Australia who downed Canada 3-0 in Group F. - with thanks to AAP BBL: 13 overs: Adelaide Strikers 94-3 (Wells 12, White 4) v Sydney Sixers Hazlewood finishes with 1-18 from his four overs and he\u2019s been largely responsible for putting the skids on the Strikers\u2019 progress. Really, what else would you expect from such a fantastic bowler? A-League: HT: Melbourne Victory 1-0 Newcastle So it remains 1-nil to the Victory, and while the Jets haven\u2019t been without their chances, the home team are full value for Kruse\u2019s strike after nine minutes. Interestingly, the Victory are undefeated in their past four matches against Newcastle at AAMI Park, despite not going into half-time with the lead in any of them. Not sure if that\u2019s a good or bad sign for either team. BBL: 10 overs: Adelaide Strikers 81-3 (Wells 6, White 2) v Sydney Sixers A couple of quick wickets have slowed the Strikers somewhat, with Salt holing out to Pope for 25 and Carey playing all around a straight, full one from Hazlewood to be castled for 29. A-League: 33 mins: Melbourne Victory 1-0 Newcastle Burns has gone into the referee\u2019s book fort his challenge on Kruse and that\u2019s the first yellow card of the match. Not long after, Traor\u00e9 shimmies and shakes in the Jets box and looks a chance of scoring before being shut down. BBL: 5 overs: Adelaide Strikers 52-1 (Salt 17, Carey 16) v Sydney Sixers The loss of Weatherald has done nothing to stymie the Strikers. Carey - loving this guy as a prospect - just took Curran to town with a six and a four. Looks a good deck in Coffs but it\u2019s also a small ground. Strap yourselves in for some big scoring. A-League: GOAL! Melbourne Victory 1-0 Newcastle (Kruse, 9\u2019) The Victory get off to the perfect start with Kruse latching onto Broxham\u2019s long ball and beating the keeper. They\u2019d had the better of the opening exchanges, the hosts, and this goal didn\u2019t come as a surprise. BBL: Adelaide Strikers 24-1 (2 overs) v Sydney Sixers The Strikers are were off to a flyer. Fourteen runs came off Dwarshuis\u2019s opening over and Weatherald and Salt were seeing them large. But on the last ball of Bird\u2019s over, Weatherald holed out to Dwarshuis at third man for 16 off nine balls. Dying by the sword as he lived by it, with a little bit of revenge for the man who got caned in the first over of the match. Cricket: Check out the report of day three of the final Test between Australia and New Zealand in Sydney. Spoiler alert: it doesn\u2019t make for good reading if you\u2019re a Kiwi. BBL: Adelaide Strikers have called correctly and will bat first against Sydney Sixers in Coffs Harbour. Best of all, Josh Hazlewood lines up for the Sixers in his first game in the BBL for almost six years. A-League: we\u2019re barely moments away from the Victory-Jets game. How on earth can Melbourne Victory win without Ola Toivonen? That\u2019s like asking Christmas to happen without Saint Nick and his reindeers doing their thing. We\u2019ll see. Anyway, here\u2019s the teams. MELBOURNE VICTORY (4-2-3-1): Lawrence Thomas (GK); Anthony Lesiotis, James Donachie, Leigh Broxham, Adama Traore; Jakob Poulsen, Migjen Basha; Andrew Nabbout, Kristijan Dobras, Elvis Kamsoba; Robbie Kruse. SUBS: Brendan White (GK), Storm Roux, Corey Brown, Kenny Athiu, Joshua Hope, Jay Barnett. NEWCASTLE JETS (4-4-2): Glen Moss (GK); Matthew Millar, Lachlan Jackson, Nikolai Topor-Stanley, Bobby Burns; Steven Ugarkovic, Benjamin Kantarovski, Patrick Langlois, Jason Hoffman; Angus Thurgate, Dimitrios Petratos. SUBS: Lewis Italiano (GK), Nick Fitzgerald, Kaine Sheppard, Johnny Koutroumbis, Matthew Ridenton. The Victory\u2019s finals chances have a beating heart after seeing off Newcastle. Gema Simon\u2019s goal after 61 minutes halved the Jets\u2019 deficit and gave the home side something to worry about, but their two first-half goals were enough to secure the three points. The story of the day, however, was the Victory\u2019s Darian Jenkins scoring her first W-League goal on her 25th birthday. Memories are made of this. ATP Cup update: Australia crush Canada The surprise withdrawal of Nick Kyrgios has not stopped Australia gaining sweet revenge and claiming victory in their ATP Cup tie against Canada in Brisbane. Alex de Minaur came back from a set and a break down on Sunday to defeat world No.15 Denis Shapovalov 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 6-2 in three hours, giving the hosts an unbeatable 2-0 lead. Earlier, hometown hero John Millman stepped up after Kyrgios pulled out with a back complaint to down world No.21 Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4 6-2 at Pat Rafter Arena. An undefeated Australia will qualify for the finals in Sydney as the Group F winners if Germany beat Greece later on Sunday. - with thanks to AAP That screw, it is a turning. This has been a relentlessly glorious summer for Australia\u2019s cricketers and, again, it\u2019s a case of when, not if, Australia put New Zealand to bed in the third Test. And that will make it a perfect set of five. Seriously, this is a serious Test cricket team. Jonathan Howcroft is wrapping up his thoughts on day three at the SCG.

      "body": "<p>Are some sports just crisis junkies? Less than a week into a new decade cricket already needs rescuing again. So forget all you can of the past six months \u2013 a World Cup final that stood alone in history, one of the greatest ever Test comebacks, the good-news expansion of top-tier nations \u2013 and concentrate, if you will, on the negatives. Test cricket just isn\u2019t popular enough. And that, the combined wisdom of the international cricket authorities has decided, means it\u2019s too long. Apparently we should all start getting used to the idea that in future, Test matches will be played over four, not five, days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/05/cricket-south-africa-england-second-test-day-three-over-by-over-live\">South Africa v England: second Test, day three \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be fair, we\u2019re all feeling a little bloated.

This is the moment we take a long, hard look at ourselves and wonder if we could do with trimming a bit of fat. Does this five-day fixture really suit me any more? Wouldn\u2019t a little nip/tuck make for an altogether more attractive prospect?</p> <p>I get where the insecurity is coming from, I really do. It\u2019s hard to compete on the open market when you\u2019ve already been knocking around for over a century and everyone\u2019s talking about how sexy your young cousins are. God, didn\u2019t the World Cup final look good in that super over? And isn\u2019t T20 so hot right now? No wonder Test cricket feels unloved by comparison. It just bothers me that it\u2019s become so desperate and insecure it feels the need to lop bits off itself.</p> <p>Especially since no one \u2013 no one that follows it, plays it or turns up at their nearest ground once a year to drink beer while it happens somewhere in the background \u2013 has a fundamental problem with the format as it currently exists.

      "bodyText": "Are some sports just crisis junkies? Less than a week into a new decade cricket already needs rescuing again. So forget all you can of the past six months \u2013 a World Cup final that stood alone in history, one of the greatest ever Test comebacks, the good-news expansion of top-tier nations \u2013 and concentrate, if you will, on the negatives. Test cricket just isn\u2019t popular enough. And that, the combined wisdom of the international cricket authorities has decided, means it\u2019s too long. Apparently we should all start getting used to the idea that in future, Test matches will be played over four, not five, days. To be fair, we\u2019re all feeling a little bloated. It\u2019s the week after the week after Christmas, a time of the year when our bodies are constituted of 70% mincemeat. No one feels at their best right now. This is the moment we take a long, hard look at ourselves and wonder if we could do with trimming a bit of fat. Does this five-day fixture really suit me any more? Wouldn\u2019t a little nip/tuck make for an altogether more attractive prospect? I get where the insecurity is coming from, I really do. It\u2019s hard to compete on the open market when you\u2019ve already been knocking around for over a century and everyone\u2019s talking about how sexy your young cousins are. God, didn\u2019t the World Cup final look good in that super over? And isn\u2019t T20 so hot right now? No wonder Test cricket feels unloved by comparison. It just bothers me that it\u2019s become so desperate and insecure it feels the need to lop bits off itself. Especially since no one \u2013 no one that follows it, plays it or turns up at their nearest ground once a year to drink beer while it happens somewhere in the background \u2013 has a fundamental problem with the format as it currently exists. Even the strongest advocates of this four-day wheeze \u2013 who include the former England captain Michael Vaughan \u2013 admit that nothing can compare with the five-day game as an ultimate battle of skill and character. So, have hours of focus grouping discovered that the one thing preventing people engaging with cricket is that it\u2019s 24 hours too long? No. If they had, you can bet that the cricket boards \u2013 who frequently appear to care less about the people who love their sport than notional \u201cfuture audiences\u201d \u2013 would be telling us so. Four-day Test matches won\u2019t make for a better game, just a more financially convenient one. As we know, venues take a hit when games don\u2019t make it to the final day, and yes, it\u2019s annoying for broadcasters, too, who have to fill their Monday scheduling with cheap archive footage. More Tests than ever are finishing within four days \u2013 an indication that either wickets are getting better at producing results or that batters don\u2019t know how to hang around any more. Now the money men are looking on those unfulfilled hours of play with the same greedy eyes a property developer gives, say, school playing fields. Aside from maximising profits, any number of sham arguments are being thrown up as to why four-day Tests would be good for the game. There\u2019s a saintly suggestion being wafted around that players will get the extra time back as preparation or rest days: this from the very boards who overstuffed the cricketing calendar in the first place. If you believe this one, then the 2010s really did do a number on you, and I\u2019m sorry. On the plus side, you\u2019ve only four months to wait for the arrival of the Easter Bunny. Even more specious are the claims that we\u2019ll all enjoy four-day cricket more \u2013 honest \u2013 because teams will be forced to hurry the game along. These conveniently ignore two well-known factors in Test cricket: weather and attrition. With no slack in which to make up time lost to rain, and bowlers battling fatigue after a 98-over day in the field, shortened Test matches will actually make draws more likely, not less.

Steven C Miller\u2019s thriller (not to be confused with the long-running BBC drama) works overtime to justify its trigger-happy hero. Indeed, Frank\u2019s rash instincts enable him to track a kidnapping victim trapped in a water tank with 45 minutes to live. The tone veers haphazardly from tense, high-stakes cat-and-mouse chase to ill-judged satire, pairing Eckhart\u2019s rightwing cop with millennial vlogger Ava Brooks (Courtney Eaton), who is live-streaming the chase.",

      "bodyText": "Betting odds predict the loudest sounds of cheering and popping corks in Los Angeles on Sunday night will come from inside the Beverly Hilton Hotel. For this is where HBO and WarnerMedia \u2013 makers of Succession, Big Little Lies and Chernobyl \u2013 are due to celebrate after scooping many of the top prizes at the Golden Globe awards. But whoever really does win big, it is certain the mood will also be pretty jubilant next door on Wilshire Boulevard at Circa 55, the poolside restaurant where Netflix is holding a party to mark its own extraordinary awards showing. The streaming channel and production house dominates proceedings this year, with a total of 34 nominations. It has notched up 17 in both the film and the television categories. Alongside its critically acclaimed feature-length hits, such as Martin Scorsese\u2019s epic The Irishman and Noah Baumbach\u2019s Marriage Story, the sheer number of original television shows which have been made by Netflix has ensured it a place in most of the small-screen-award categories. Among its contenders for glory are the third season of the prestige juggernaut The Crown, starring Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret, and the new, gritty mini-series, Unbelievable. Both shows have received four nominations each. The gentle American comedy The Kominsky Method, starring Michael Douglas as a vintage acting coach and Alan Arkin as his jaded agent, has earned three, while the new high school show, The Politician, has two chances to help Netflix walk away with a trophy. After only six years of producing drama, the rise of Netflix has been astonishing. It grabbed audience attention early on with its successful show House of Cards, and two years ago it first managed to beat the experienced studio machine at HBO with a long tally of Emmy nominations. Last year, however, HBO was back in the lead once again, by a distance of 20 nominations, and the studio and American satellite and cable channel eventually claimed six more prizes than Netflix. This weekend, as the Golden Globes kicks off the 2020 awards calendar, Netflix has outstripped everyone else with the sheer number of starters that it has placed in the field, despite the fact that HBO has been judged likely to take home at least six of the 11 trophies to be handed out for television shows later tonight. The 77th Golden Globes awards, which was voted for by 90 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, will be presented this year by the British comic actor and standup Ricky Gervais, who has done the job four times already. Last year Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh did the honours. In America the ceremony, a notoriously unruly younger brother to next month\u2019s Oscars\u2019 shindig, will go out live on NBC, an old-fashioned broadcast channel. The fact that streaming-channel shows, of the kind offered by newcomers Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, FX and Apple TV Plus, have now pushed out most of the other TV drama contenders, is the cause of some industry embarrassment. As Variety, the showbusiness trade journal, has pointed out, it is an uncomfortable and possibly unsustainable situation for a mainstream broadcast channel to be putting out an awards show that congratulates the makers of dramas its own viewers cannot watch. It is true, of course, that there has always been a gap between the views of critics and those of the general public. But the divide is now also between the privileged few who have seen all of the competing shows and those who have only heard of them. As streaming services do not yet release their ratings figures, or the number of downloads, it could be that not many of those watching the Golden Globes will have ever seen Unbelievable, or Apple\u2019s The Morning Show, which is hotly tipped to win an award for Jennifer Aniston. Similarly in Britain, the much-nominated HBO show Succession, which has been acclaimed for British writer Jesse Armstrong\u2019s bleak and funny storytelling and which stars British actors Brian Cox and Matthew Macfadyen, can only be seen by Sky subscribers.",

      "body": "<p>I can\u2019t remember a new year when I haven\u2019t made a resolution. Get more sleep, drink more water, drink less booze, eat more fruit, learn Spanish. But there was only one pledge I\u2019ve ever managed to stick to for longer than a few weeks, and possibly the only one that made me feel better about myself instead of worse \u2013 I broke up with fast fashion.</p> <p>No new clothes (or at least no \u201cnew-new\u201d clothes) for a year. No more payday hauls or bad day pick-me-ups. No more casual flirtation with one of the most exploitative and wasteful industries on the planet. Goodbye, my problematic friend.</p> <p>Before you say it, I know. Swearing off shopping shouldn\u2019t be a hardship. For plenty of people it\u2019s a default state, through lack of funds, lack of choice or just lack of interest. As a sometime-fashion journalist working in the fickle world of women\u2019s media, with trends that rise and fall on the back of a hot-or-not barometer, I know clothes take up a larger space in my life and brain than they do for the average person. But I also know so many people who feel shackled by fashion without the professional pressure; so many other women who shop as if it\u2019s a side hustle they\u2019re obliged to keep afloat. And if not buying, then browsing, scrolling, trying on, returning, thinking, thinking, always thinking about shopping.</p> <p>That said, it\u2019s remarkable how many times this year men have fallen over themselves to tell me, proudly, that they never buy clothes. Never! Hate shopping! As though it\u2019s pure coincidence I picked up the message that as a woman, my clothes matter more than theirs do. Like there\u2019s no patriarchal whiff to the whole situation. Like simply opting out might not have occurred to me.</p> <p>Of course it\u2019s occurred to me. On all those harried shopping missions, every time the Asos scroll threatened to give me carpal tunnel syndrome, the thought would always be there in the back of my mind: why do I even care? Why does anyone?</p> <p>But what the Jeremys with their homogenous, wife-bought wardrobes fail to recognise is that loving clothes isn\u2019t a character weakness to be stamped out like smoking. Clothes can be cultural currency, tribal identity and a precious tool of self-expression. An outfit can set you apart from one crowd, and win you a place in another. Virginia Woolf got it: \u201cVain trifles as they seem, clothes have, they say, more important offices than to merely keep us warm. They change our view of the world and the world\u2019s view of us.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years, clothes have been my comfort blanket and confidence boost. They\u2019ve been a recreational hobby, a competitive sport and a way to bond with people in pub toilets. I\u2019ve hunted for those holy grail garments the way a hardcore collector might hunt out rare stamps or action figures (then, to my shame, kept them nearly as boxfresh). I\u2019ve used clothes to draw attention to myself and I\u2019ve used them as camouflage, buying the illusion of grown-up professionalism in weekly instalments at Zara at a time when my salary barely covered my bus pass. Like Cher from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/clueless\" title=\"\">Clueless</a></em>, I too have a \u201cmost capable-looking outfit\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f7861e855acc69663411f468874a969ddd8921b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f7861e855acc69663411f468874a969ddd8921b/0_2397_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Bravo holding a selection of colourful clothes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s amazing how often you can medicate trend flu with something that\u2019s already in your wardrobe\u2019: Lauren Bravo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, of course, once you invest a thing with so much potential to make you feel good, it has equal potential to make you feel bad. Each outfit an exam, to be passed or failed. At least once a week I would have a wardrobe crisis before leaving the house; standing in my pants and flinging clothes around my bedroom, believing I had nothing to wear even as I was elbow-deep in evidence to the contrary. On those days, I would plan emergency trips to H&amp;M at lunchtime, the way you might nip into Boots for painkillers to ease a headache. Somewhere along the way, I think I gave clothes too much power.</p> <p>I know I gave them too much time. And money. Once I stopped shopping, spare cash appeared in my account and periods of free time began to appear in my week. It\u2019s incredible, the things you can get done when you\u2019re not forever standing in a Post Office queue with an armful of Asos returns. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve launched a startup or finally learned Spanish, but I\u2019ve read a lot more books and had precisely zero existential crises in the changing rooms at &amp; Other Stories. I\u2019ve watched myself rise, incrementally, out of the depths of my overdraft, with each dress and bag I haven\u2019t bought. It\u2019s progress.</p> <p>To be clear: I haven\u2019t stopped shopping entirely. Charity shops have filled the gap left by the high street, along with the occasional preowned gem from eBay and <a href=\"https://www.depop.com/\" title=\"\">Depop</a>. But secondhand shopping is a very different beast; it\u2019s the slow-release energy to fast fashion\u2019s sugar rush. While the high street sells the idea that every shopping trip should end in a purchase, thrift stores manage your expectations. You learn to appreciate the trawl as much as the haul, getting gooey-eyed about the history stitched into each seam. Going home empty-handed feels less like defeat. You\u2019ve saved the money and still had a nice day out.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that second- hand shopping isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution. It\u2019s harder to find larger clothes in thrift shops, and the sustainable fashion world in general has a long way to go before it caters for all bodies equally. But then, so does the high street.</p> <p><em><strong>I always knew </strong></em>I hated changing rooms, but it wasn\u2019t until I quit shopping that I realised just how much self-loathing lurked behind those curtains. Fast fashion made me feel as though I was failing it, every time the zip didn\u2019t do up, or the buttons gaped, or the outfit that looked chic and insouciant on the mannequin looked strange and lumpen on me. I blamed myself, my body, when in fact \u2013 and I\u2019m furious it took me 31 years to grasp this \u2013 it\u2019s the clothes that should be auditioning for you. Not the other way round.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to say that breaking up with fast fashion has cured the morning meltdowns. They\u2019re certainly less frequent, but the wrong recipe of weather, schedule and hormones can still tip me into sartorial crisis. And I still get struck down by \u201ctrend flu\u201d \u2013 that feverish, all-consuming need to buy some viral item you hadn\u2019t even liked the week before. This year: giant pearl hairclips, puffer jackets and the Zara dress. I went to bed and rode them all out.</p> <p>I also learned new tricks to eke more wear out of my existing wardrobe: like layering \u2013 an artform I\u2019d previously believed you could only do if you were Scandinavian or owned your own kiln.

But there was only one pledge I\u2019ve ever managed to stick to for longer than a few weeks, and possibly the only one that made me feel better about myself instead of worse \u2013 I broke up with fast fashion. No new clothes (or at least no \u201cnew-new\u201d clothes) for a year. No more payday hauls or bad day pick-me-ups. No more casual flirtation with one of the most exploitative and wasteful industries on the planet. Goodbye, my problematic friend. Before you say it, I know. Swearing off shopping shouldn\u2019t be a hardship. For plenty of people it\u2019s a default state, through lack of funds, lack of choice or just lack of interest. As a sometime-fashion journalist working in the fickle world of women\u2019s media, with trends that rise and fall on the back of a hot-or-not barometer, I know clothes take up a larger space in my life and brain than they do for the average person. But I also know so many people who feel shackled by fashion without the professional pressure; so many other women who shop as if it\u2019s a side hustle they\u2019re obliged to keep afloat. And if not buying, then browsing, scrolling, trying on, returning, thinking, thinking, always thinking about shopping. That said, it\u2019s remarkable how many times this year men have fallen over themselves to tell me, proudly, that they never buy clothes. Never! Hate shopping! As though it\u2019s pure coincidence I picked up the message that as a woman, my clothes matter more than theirs do. Like there\u2019s no patriarchal whiff to the whole situation. Like simply opting out might not have occurred to me. Of course it\u2019s occurred to me. On all those harried shopping missions, every time the Asos scroll threatened to give me carpal tunnel syndrome, the thought would always be there in the back of my mind: why do I even care? Why does anyone? But what the Jeremys with their homogenous, wife-bought wardrobes fail to recognise is that loving clothes isn\u2019t a character weakness to be stamped out like smoking. Clothes can be cultural currency, tribal identity and a precious tool of self-expression. An outfit can set you apart from one crowd, and win you a place in another. Virginia Woolf got it: \u201cVain trifles as they seem, clothes have, they say, more important offices than to merely keep us warm. They change our view of the world and the world\u2019s view of us.\u201d Over the years, clothes have been my comfort blanket and confidence boost. They\u2019ve been a recreational hobby, a competitive sport and a way to bond with people in pub toilets. I\u2019ve hunted for those holy grail garments the way a hardcore collector might hunt out rare stamps or action figures (then, to my shame, kept them nearly as boxfresh). I\u2019ve used clothes to draw attention to myself and I\u2019ve used them as camouflage, buying the illusion of grown-up professionalism in weekly instalments at Zara at a time when my salary barely covered my bus pass. Like Cher from Clueless, I too have a \u201cmost capable-looking outfit\u201d. But, of course, once you invest a thing with so much potential to make you feel good, it has equal potential to make you feel bad. Each outfit an exam, to be passed or failed. At least once a week I would have a wardrobe crisis before leaving the house; standing in my pants and flinging clothes around my bedroom, believing I had nothing to wear even as I was elbow-deep in evidence to the contrary. On those days, I would plan emergency trips to H&amp;M at lunchtime, the way you might nip into Boots for painkillers to ease a headache. Somewhere along the way, I think I gave clothes too much power. I know I gave them too much time. And money. Once I stopped shopping, spare cash appeared in my account and periods of free time began to appear in my week. It\u2019s incredible, the things you can get done when you\u2019re not forever standing in a Post Office queue with an armful of Asos returns. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve launched a startup or finally learned Spanish, but I\u2019ve read a lot more books and had precisely zero existential crises in the changing rooms at &amp; Other Stories. I\u2019ve watched myself rise, incrementally, out of the depths of my overdraft, with each dress and bag I haven\u2019t bought. It\u2019s progress. To be clear: I haven\u2019t stopped shopping entirely. Charity shops have filled the gap left by the high street, along with the occasional preowned gem from eBay and Depop. But secondhand shopping is a very different beast; it\u2019s the slow-release energy to fast fashion\u2019s sugar rush. While the high street sells the idea that every shopping trip should end in a purchase, thrift stores manage your expectations. You learn to appreciate the trawl as much as the haul, getting gooey-eyed about the history stitched into each seam. Going home empty-handed feels less like defeat. You\u2019ve saved the money and still had a nice day out. Of course, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that second- hand shopping isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution. It\u2019s harder to find larger clothes in thrift shops, and the sustainable fashion world in general has a long way to go before it caters for all bodies equally. But then, so does the high street. I always knew I hated changing rooms, but it wasn\u2019t until I quit shopping that I realised just how much self-loathing lurked behind those curtains. Fast fashion made me feel as though I was failing it, every time the zip didn\u2019t do up, or the buttons gaped, or the outfit that looked chic and insouciant on the mannequin looked strange and lumpen on me. I blamed myself, my body, when in fact \u2013 and I\u2019m furious it took me 31 years to grasp this \u2013 it\u2019s the clothes that should be auditioning for you. Not the other way round. I\u2019d love to say that breaking up with fast fashion has cured the morning meltdowns. They\u2019re certainly less frequent, but the wrong recipe of weather, schedule and hormones can still tip me into sartorial crisis. And I still get struck down by \u201ctrend flu\u201d \u2013 that feverish, all-consuming need to buy some viral item you hadn\u2019t even liked the week before. This year: giant pearl hairclips, puffer jackets and the Zara dress. I went to bed and rode them all out. I also learned new tricks to eke more wear out of my existing wardrobe: like layering \u2013 an artform I\u2019d previously believed you could only do if you were Scandinavian or owned your own kiln. Turns out no! You simply take your clothes and\u2026 put them on top of other clothes. Slimfit polonecks under summery slips, shirts under short-sleeved sweaters, jumpers over dresses over jeans. Aside from one mishap with a mustard tank top and a white shirt that can only be described as \u201cDisney woodcutter\u201d, I\u2019ve had a surprisingly good success rate. As so many business gurus will tell you, constraints force creativity. And when you limit your shopping options, you find yourself getting inventive with new tools instead. Sometimes superglue, sometimes scissors. My sewing skills have rusted since their GCSE Textiles heyday but since I stopped shopping, I\u2019ve started tinkering more. I\u2019ll take up a hem, change a neckline. Put press studs between the gaping buttons. When a hankering for new jeans hit last month, I unearthed an ancient pair of mid-rise stretch bootcuts \u2013 bootcut! \u2013 and chopped them into ankle-length flares. They\u2019re not exactly the jeans of my dreams, but they\u2019re close enough. And I\u2019m old enough to know by now that the jeans of my dreams don\u2019t exist. I also know I\u2019m not a \u201ccapsule wardrobe\u201d person. Even so, a good wardrobe cull can be cathartic, and there\u2019s a strong argument for stripping back your wardrobe to an edited selection of reliable, high-quality pieces (I can see clearly now the rayon is gone, as Johnny Nash almost sang). But it can also be counterintuitive, especially if you\u2019re not ready to swear off trends entirely. Not yet. Ignore anyone who tells you to get rid of everything you haven\u2019t worn in a year.

Peer-to-peer rental platforms such as HURR Collective and My Wardrobe have arrived on the scene to formalise and monetise the process, the latter even hiring former Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson as chairman.

I slept through the fear. I slept through the dread. I slept through the recriminations and regrets. And I slept through Jools Holland insisting on playing inappropriate boogie-woogie piano with \u2013 who will it be this year? \u2013 Peter Br\u00f6tzmann, Napalm Death, Youssou N\u2019Dour, Mark and Roxanne from LadBaby, or the future festive ghost of his own grinning self.</p> <p>This New Year\u2019s Eve I lay on my back in the garden, long after midnight, belly full of Butty Bach\u2122 \u00ae beer and mini Quorn\u2122 \u00ae sausages, and looked at the stars.

      "bodyText": "My best New Year\u2019s Eve was 15 years ago. A mis-calibrated dose of prescription painkillers in a bed and breakfast near Wootton Courtenay meant I slept through the whole thing. I slept through the fear. I slept through the dread. I slept through the recriminations and regrets. And I slept through Jools Holland insisting on playing inappropriate boogie-woogie piano with \u2013 who will it be this year? \u2013 Peter Br\u00f6tzmann, Napalm Death, Youssou N\u2019Dour, Mark and Roxanne from LadBaby, or the future festive ghost of his own grinning self. This New Year\u2019s Eve I lay on my back in the garden, long after midnight, belly full of Butty Bach\u2122 \u00ae beer and mini Quorn\u2122 \u00ae sausages, and looked at the stars. Do they have elections on those distant worlds, I wondered? Is there an alien Dominic Cummings, and if so, how would you know? Does the alien Sir Iain Duncan Smith eat his own mucus in public like our Earth Sir Iain, or does he just eat crisps? On Alien Sir Iain\u2019s world is crisp-eating considered disgusting, while finger-picked mucus is the cuisine of the Princesses of Mars? And is that the space Jennifer Arcuri dancing round the Pole Star? Remember her? Thought not. Sniffing the air, I suddenly realised I had accidentally laid my head in fox excrement. I did not know what I should do. Beat the fox responsible to death with a Remain-voting baseball bat, while cross-dressed in a kimono, like a sick metropolitan elitist? Or wear red and white finery and harry it with hounds, before tearing its body to shreds and smearing its blood upon a nearby child\u2019s crying face, like a rural Tory voter merely upholding an ancient tradition threatened by political correctness gone mad? (Delete as applicable to suit your social and political prejudices.) Then I regained my composure, and simply lay there in the wet dark, the year yet young around me, grinding my head into the fox faeces, mashing it luxuriously into my precious remaining hairs.

We\u2019ve been doing these cooperative games where you\u2019re all working together against the game rather than each other. In this game you\u2019re trying to prevent diseases, which might even have sinister origins, from spreading around the world. It evolves through the year: you start in January, then stuff will happen, and in February you scratch off things, you open boxes and you stick stuff on the board, characters die and it\u2019s really dramatic. It\u2019s quite a commitment, but I\u2019m hooked. 6. Film Knives Out (Rian Johnson) I\u2019m very excited to see Knives Out. I\u2019ve deliberately not looked it up yet so I don\u2019t really know a huge amount about it \u2013 I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s some kind of sexy Cluedo but I have no idea. It seems like perfect festive fodder to me. At this time of year, what I want to be watching is a good whodunnit with a glamorous cast wearing carefully chosen outfits, and this looks absolutely perfect for that. I\u2019ve actually got plans to dedicate a whole day to watching it.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a cold Saturday morning in November, yet hundreds of people have descended on Beckton District Park in east London for a day of tree planting. Dozens of shovels stuck into the muddy earth are waiting to be grabbed by newcomers, while four cordoned-off areas are already full of volunteers measuring and digging holes, before carefully planting the young seedlings, called whips.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy the time the day is done, you look around and there are thousands of trees,\u201d says Jazmin Glen, 26, a volunteer supervisor at the event. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think you might come back in however many years and there\u2019s an actual forest here that you\u2019ve been a part of creating.\u201d</p> \n<p>The team hope to plant 9,000 trees by the end of the day, and although right now the spindly plants look half dead, Glen says they are just dormant and will start to bloom in a couple of seasons.</p> \n<p>The day has been organised by <a href=\"https://www.treesforcities.org/our-work?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1uP6-7if5gIVhbTtCh2s3AsHEAAYASAAEgINt_D_BwE\" title=\"\">Trees for Cities</a>, one of the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer\u2019s </em>four <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/20/the-guardian-view-on-trees-for-christmas-our-charity-appeal-is-rooted-in-hope\" title=\"\">climate emergency appeal charities</a>, and the only UK voluntary organisation working on a national scale to plant trees in urban areas most in need \u2013 often places that have high levels of both social and environmental deprivation.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe places that are greenest are often the wealthiest, with the best sort of social indicators,\u201d says the charity\u2019s chief executive, David Elliott. \u201cSo our work tends to focus on the more deprived parts of towns and cities, where our projects can bring a whole range of benefits to people.\u201d</p> \n<p>These benefits include improving air quality, reducing flooding, easing noise pollution and regenerating green spaces for local communities. This particular site in Beckton is next to the busy A1020 and just across the river from London City airport.</p> \n<p>The mayor of Newham, Rokhsana Fiaz, was also at the event and said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really amazing that we\u2019re working with charities like Trees for Cities, because it\u2019s bringing focus to the resident population here in Newham about the importance of nature, ecology and tree planting, but also its contribution in response to the climate emergency.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d16d0dc7062f6b5711c4aa6d41f0183773391d85\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d16d0dc7062f6b5711c4aa6d41f0183773391d85/0_236_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Elliott, Trees for Cities chief executive, plants a seedling with his children.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Elliott, Trees for Cities chief executive, plants a seedling with his children.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Recent analysis from the British Heart Foundation has found the borough to be the most polluted in the UK, and its council last year declared a climate emergency. Yet while the environmental benefits are obvious, they don\u2019t reflect the joy many young people experience on getting involved in tree planting.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we work on big estates, for example, you get young people coming out and engaging with stuff that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to do. It\u2019s very powerful, actually,\u201d says Elliott.</p> \n<p>Jackson Pereira from nearby East Ham is at the event with his family, including his young daughters, Amelia and Ava, and nieces, Harshini and Lassyhani. He says there aren\u2019t many woodland areas near their home for the kids to run around in, so he\u2019s keen to contribute to creating more green spaces for children in cities to enjoy and learn from.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve said to them, \u2018When you\u2019re Daddy\u2019s age, and you come back here, it will look totally different.\u2019 Amelia has already said she\u2019s going to mark her tree and she wants to climb it once it\u2019s high enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are many children attending from local beavers and other scout groups, benefiting from an experience they can\u2019t get in a classroom. Harshini, aged seven, says: \u201cNow we know we shouldn\u2019t waste paper and we know how hard it is to grow a tree.\u201d</p> \n<p>The family hopes the event will make a lasting impact on the youngsters, like it did for Yanis, who was 13 when he attended a Trees for Cities planting session in Seven Kings Park, in the neighbouring borough of Redbridge, last year. He enjoyed it so much he joined the Orchard Leaders club at his secondary school, through which he planted trees every Friday after school on a nearby field.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t really want to go, I just wanted to sit at my computer, but as I went on I realised that it\u2019s a very important problem, and also it\u2019s actually very enjoyable,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>His mother, Bego\u00f1a Belmonte, said she was proud of her son: \u201cHe did it over the winter period, as well. Which is very commendable because of the cold and the wet.\u201d The next tree planting session in their area is scheduled for March. \u201cI really loved the experience of being involved with Trees for Cities, and I wish there were more local projects we could participate in.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ce7278d17b721a19de9413b24999a16bc256808\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ce7278d17b721a19de9413b24999a16bc256808/0_277_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson Pereira, centre, and members of his family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson Pereira, centre, and members of his family.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Dragoi/The Guardian/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most volunteers agree the best thing about these events is being able to turn serious concern over the climate crisis towards a productive end. Elliott says: \u201cI suppose the beauty of tree planting is it\u2019s a real practical thing and you can see, from the beginning to the end of the day, the difference you\u2019ve made. Hopefully those trees will be there for hundreds of years, helping to constantly improve the environment.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a cold Saturday morning in November, yet hundreds of people have descended on Beckton District Park in east London for a day of tree planting. Dozens of shovels stuck into the muddy earth are waiting to be grabbed by newcomers, while four cordoned-off areas are already full of volunteers measuring and digging holes, before carefully planting the young seedlings, called whips. \u201cBy the time the day is done, you look around and there are thousands of trees,\u201d says Jazmin Glen, 26, a volunteer supervisor at the event. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think you might come back in however many years and there\u2019s an actual forest here that you\u2019ve been a part of creating.\u201d The team hope to plant 9,000 trees by the end of the day, and although right now the spindly plants look half dead, Glen says they are just dormant and will start to bloom in a couple of seasons. The day has been organised by Trees for Cities, one of the Guardian and Observer\u2019s four climate emergency appeal charities, and the only UK voluntary organisation working on a national scale to plant trees in urban areas most in need \u2013 often places that have high levels of both social and environmental deprivation. \u201cThe places that are greenest are often the wealthiest, with the best sort of social indicators,\u201d says the charity\u2019s chief executive, David Elliott. \u201cSo our work tends to focus on the more deprived parts of towns and cities, where our projects can bring a whole range of benefits to people.\u201d These benefits include improving air quality, reducing flooding, easing noise pollution and regenerating green spaces for local communities. This particular site in Beckton is next to the busy A1020 and just across the river from London City airport. The mayor of Newham, Rokhsana Fiaz, was also at the event and said: \u201cI think it\u2019s really amazing that we\u2019re working with charities like Trees for Cities, because it\u2019s bringing focus to the resident population here in Newham about the importance of nature, ecology and tree planting, but also its contribution in response to the climate emergency.\u201d Recent analysis from the British Heart Foundation has found the borough to be the most polluted in the UK, and its council last year declared a climate emergency. Yet while the environmental benefits are obvious, they don\u2019t reflect the joy many young people experience on getting involved in tree planting. \u201cWhen we work on big estates, for example, you get young people coming out and engaging with stuff that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to do. It\u2019s very powerful, actually,\u201d says Elliott. Jackson Pereira from nearby East Ham is at the event with his family, including his young daughters, Amelia and Ava, and nieces, Harshini and Lassyhani. He says there aren\u2019t many woodland areas near their home for the kids to run around in, so he\u2019s keen to contribute to creating more green spaces for children in cities to enjoy and learn from. \u201cI\u2019ve said to them, \u2018When you\u2019re Daddy\u2019s age, and you come back here, it will look totally different.\u2019 Amelia has already said she\u2019s going to mark her tree and she wants to climb it once it\u2019s high enough.\u201d There are many children attending from local beavers and other scout groups, benefiting from an experience they can\u2019t get in a classroom. Harshini, aged seven, says: \u201cNow we know we shouldn\u2019t waste paper and we know how hard it is to grow a tree.\u201d The family hopes the event will make a lasting impact on the youngsters, like it did for Yanis, who was 13 when he attended a Trees for Cities planting session in Seven Kings Park, in the neighbouring borough of Redbridge, last year. He enjoyed it so much he joined the Orchard Leaders club at his secondary school, through which he planted trees every Friday after school on a nearby field. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t really want to go, I just wanted to sit at my computer, but as I went on I realised that it\u2019s a very important problem, and also it\u2019s actually very enjoyable,\u201d he says. His mother, Bego\u00f1a Belmonte, said she was proud of her son: \u201cHe did it over the winter period, as well. Which is very commendable because of the cold and the wet.\u201d The next tree planting session in their area is scheduled for March. \u201cI really loved the experience of being involved with Trees for Cities, and I wish there were more local projects we could participate in.\u201d Most volunteers agree the best thing about these events is being able to turn serious concern over the climate crisis towards a productive end. Elliott says: \u201cI suppose the beauty of tree planting is it\u2019s a real practical thing and you can see, from the beginning to the end of the day, the difference you\u2019ve made. Hopefully those trees will be there for hundreds of years, helping to constantly improve the environment. We\u2019re offering something which is really tangible.\u201d For Abbas Ali, a 24-year-old auditor who lives in Canary Wharf, it\u2019s a welcome opportunity to spend time out among nature, meeting other people. \u201cI think that\u2019s something everyone misses when they live in London \u2013 it\u2019s a breath of fresh air,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t participate in Extinction Rebellion because it\u2019s a bit intense. So this is something that I care about and it\u2019s also a really good way to spend your Saturday. I would probably just be watching TV otherwise.\u201d Looking to the future, Elliott says the main focus of Trees for Cities will be training and empowering the next generation of young people, whether individuals or community groups. \u201cWe want to give them the motivation, the ideas, the resources and knowhow to go out and start taking ownership of their local spaces, doing tree planting and greening projects themselves.\u201d Volunteer supervisor Glen is one of those young planters keen to do her bit to help save the planet. \u201cThere are so many different things that need to come together to tackle such a big problem,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s nice to feel like you are doing something towards helping.\u201d \u2022 The Guardian and Observer\u2019s climate emergency appeal ends at midnight on 12 January",

      "body": "<p>It all started when I bumped into Gareth Malone at a party. We had met a few times before, and he was always the friendly figure you see on television. Part of the choirmaster\u2019s appeal is his authenticity and, even though his hair is now greying, the phrase \u201cboyish charm\u201d clings to him.</p> <p>But at that particular party, I was giving him a piece of my mind. \u201cGareth,\u201d I said, \u201ccould you please drop this television project immediately.\u201d The project in question meant we were competing with one another \u2013 with Gareth as Goliath and us as David, but with only one logical outcome, at least as far as the BBC was concerned.</p> <p>Since 2014, my partner \u2013 choir director MJ Paranzino \u2013 and I have been creating choirs in prisons, a combination of prisoners and volunteers, the latter mostly from MJ\u2019s choirs in the community. When the prisoners come out, they join the choirs or just keep in touch and are supported in their rehabilitation. The full-circle charity is called <a href=\"https://libertychoir.org/\" title=\"\">Liberty Choir</a>. Our flagship prison is one of the largest and most challenging in Europe \u2013 HMP Wandsworth \u2013 but there are Liberty choirs in High Down and Downview, both in Surrey, and we are about to expand into two more prisons.</p> <p>The work is rewarding and challenging but attracting funding is always tricky, which is why, if a charity such as ours sees the chance to tell its story on television, we will do all we can to grab it. And over the years, a number of producers and directors have shown interest in us to make a sort of musical version of <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>.</p> <p>In 2015, the film-maker Sara Martin made a documentary about one of our patrons, Pink Floyd\u2019s David Gilmour, when he released a solo album whose title single \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/david-gilmour-rattle-that-lock-review\" title=\"\">Rattle That Lock</a> \u2013 featured Liberty Choir.

One of our older ladies cha-cha\u2019d with a six-foot five Idris Elba lookalike; a young Somalian refugee took my hand and we bopped around in our chairs; three teenage versions of the Drifters started to croon and lay down beats. It was a moment of pure joy and, of course, the TV team asked if we could recreate it when they came back with the cameras. The answer, equally obviously, was no. Can you imagine the tabloid headlines \u2013 \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d or perhaps \u201cI Predict a Riot\u201d?</p> <p>Next came the time-consuming process of getting permissions from the Ministry of Justice for which of our singing prisoners could be captured on camera.</p> <p>Finally, all clearances given, it was the day for Gareth and the crew to arrive.

It takes place in the 18th-century chapel <a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/exhibitions/saadqureshi\" title=\"\">at Yorkshire Sculpture Park</a>. Inside this austere Palladian church, with its high windows, white walls and stark black woodwork, Qureshi has built nothing less than a vision of paradise.</p> <p>A Lilliputian dreamscape of temples and towers that spreads through the building, rising from floor to ceiling, this vision is both large and small. As well it might be, given that paradise is such an uncertain figment in the minds of us mortals.</p> <p>Still more apt is the fact that Qureshi\u2019s afterworld seems to emerge entirely out of the elements of this one, from waterfalls and gorges, to palm trees, verandahs, mosques and even Palladian churches.</p> <p>At eye-height, as you enter, is a Himalayan mountain lightly scattered with snow.

      "bodyText": "The art year begins with a strange and beautiful show by the British artist Saad Qureshi \u2013 his first in a public gallery. It takes place in the 18th-century chapel at Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Inside this austere Palladian church, with its high windows, white walls and stark black woodwork, Qureshi has built nothing less than a vision of paradise. A Lilliputian dreamscape of temples and towers that spreads through the building, rising from floor to ceiling, this vision is both large and small. As well it might be, given that paradise is such an uncertain figment in the minds of us mortals. Still more apt is the fact that Qureshi\u2019s afterworld seems to emerge entirely out of the elements of this one, from waterfalls and gorges, to palm trees, verandahs, mosques and even Palladian churches. At eye-height, as you enter, is a Himalayan mountain lightly scattered with snow. Hanging from its slopes, upside down, is what appears to be a Hindu temple. But it might equally be an unusually elegant deer hide, or a shelter for mountaineers. In the foothills way below is an exquisite valley of streams and trees, lined with oriental pagodas. In another part of the installation, the landscape rolls towards an architectural structure that seems to partake of both the Taj Mahal and Versailles; a palace of remembrance, or pleasure? And a whole new terrain rises up into a colossal tower, something like Brueghel\u2019s Babel but with a joyous surrounding helter-skelter. How you get to heaven is an issue in this case \u2013 there appears to be both a gate, and an entrance cave, though no obvious way of rising up inside unless through internal staircases. The architecture is magnificent \u2013 mosques, synagogues, perpendicular and gothic spires, modernist churches, the towers of Trebizond. All of this is created out of wood, steel, sand, acrylic and insulation material, painted a lunar grey. The effect is of something both solid and melting into thin air, densely real in every detail and yet spectral. Qureshi shows his workings \u2013 a metal strut visible here and there, or an occasional palette mark in the moulding of this eerie grey substance. The facture is humble, but the ideas are sublime and intricate. Qureshi, at 33, is one of our most pensive and poetic artists. He has a gift for this otherworldliness. In the past, he has created landscapes out of brick dust, Martian red and teeming with memories of fallen civilisations. His scorched drawings, made with a soldering iron, show imaginary mountainscapes forming and disappearing all at once. And huge images on plywood in charcoal and ink resemble geological territories in which one might almost make out indistinct figures, unless they have returned to ash. What will paradise be like? This was the question Qureshi asked people all over the country. He was surprised to find many connections between the seven heavens of his own Muslim upbringing and the floating worlds of other faiths. Everywhere \u2013 and in everything he makes here \u2013 there was a sense of ascension: a rising up. The vision here is clearly ecumenical. That is particularly evident in the seven grand gates Qureshi has made for this show, positioned around the chapel, which invoke the wrought iron designs of different cultures and religions. And it is continued in the full moon that hangs in the little vestry, from which grows like a tree a many-towered house of prayer, it seems to each and any god. None of the works here can be seen in their entirety all at once. You have to walk round and around, looking into each scene, and navigating the landscapes between them.

Seats in the Midlands and the north that had always returned Labour MPs turned blue for the first time. As the serious job of government begins, the challenge now facing the prime minister is to ensure these first-time Tory voters continue to support the party in the future. It is the one-nation Conservative tradition the government must now look to if it wants to maintain the support of voters in areas that were once Labour heartlands. These voters may have supported Johnson to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d but they have also been historically mistrustful of his party and feel left behind by the promises of a metropolitan political class that seems remote from the issues that affect their daily lives. The end of austerity, and Johnson\u2019s renewed focus on investment in transport and other big infrastructure improvements in the north of England, is a welcome start in connecting with some of these first-time Conservative voters. But there is more to do, and the government will also need to ensure that unintentional injustices that have emerged in the benefits system are properly addressed so that the safety net of the welfare state is more readily and immediately available to those who fall on hard times.

Now that obsession is set to reach new heights with a host of novels that draw inspiration from the author\u2019s life and fiction.</p> <p>Coming in the first half of this year are: Gill Hornby\u2019s <em>Miss Austen,</em> reimagining the author through the eyes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/07/rare-jane-austen-letter-to-sister-to-be-sold-at-auction\" title=\"\">her sister Cassandra</a>; Janice Hadlow\u2019s <em>The Other Bennet Sister,</em> asking us to consider <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>\u2019s Mary in a different light; and Helen Moffett\u2019s <em>Charlotte</em>, picking up the story of that same novel\u2019s Charlotte Lucas.

Really? Did they?\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/may/19/gill-hornby-hive-interview\" title=\"\">Hornby</a>. \u201cThe reality is that Jane was never going to marry. She had nought pence, was quite difficult, and not the kind of girl who sucked up to a man when he walked into a room. Nor I think did she care about that.\u201d</p> <p>Hornby was interested in the role Austen\u2019s sister played in allowing the author to write. \u201cCassandra was Jane\u2019s support system. She had enormous pride and investment in Jane\u2019s work. When they\u2019re living in Chawton, she runs the house and says: \u2018You get on with it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If <em>Miss Austen</em> delves deep into the author\u2019s interior life \u2013 among the novel\u2019s many highlights are a series of letters between the two sisters which Hornby admits she initially worried were something of a \u201cliberty\u201d \u2013 the year\u2019s other Austen-related novels mine more familiar ground.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I started thinking about Mary, I couldn\u2019t get her out of my head,\u201d said Hadlow, adding that she hoped <em>The Other Bennet Sister</em> would allow us to view the plain sibling in a fresh light. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> for as long as I can remember, and Mary sits on the margins of the book and doesn\u2019t, at first glance, have much to recommend her. She is the only plain daughter in a family of beauties \u2026 she can\u2019t open her mouth without saying something dull or sententious. She\u2019s still a teenager at the time of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> but she\u2019s already a prig and a bore.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"992248eaea7f1e8459a0756d77f68427ffeafb4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/992248eaea7f1e8459a0756d77f68427ffeafb4b/0_0_1617_2616/618.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Austen by Gill Hornby reimagines the life of the author through the eyes of her sister Cassandra.\" width=\"618\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miss Austen by Gill Hornby reimagines the life of the author through the eyes of her sister Cassandra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: book jacket</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hadlow felt touched by Mary\u2019s plight. \u201cI found myself feeling increasingly sorry for her and began to wonder who she might be if she was moved from the margins? What would the world of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> look like when seen through her eyes? How might our sympathies shift?\u201d</p> <p>A similar empathy lay behind South African novelist Moffett\u2019s decision to make Charlotte Lucas the heroine of her novel. Charlotte\u2019s fate \u2013 marriage to the appalling Mr Collins \u2013 has long been seen as one of Austen\u2019s more bleak endings, albeit a realistic one, and Moffett was keen to explore what might happen next.</p> <p>\u201cWhat sort of a life did she have after making a hasty and expedient marriage? What about happiness? Was that a luxury? And was love even more of a fantasy?

      "bodyText": "Jane Austen\u2019s books are constantly adapted for television and film; her world has spun off into an entire cottage industry where people dress up as her characters and attend Regency-style balls. Now that obsession is set to reach new heights with a host of novels that draw inspiration from the author\u2019s life and fiction. Coming in the first half of this year are: Gill Hornby\u2019s Miss Austen, reimagining the author through the eyes of her sister Cassandra; Janice Hadlow\u2019s The Other Bennet Sister, asking us to consider Pride and Prejudice\u2019s Mary in a different light; and Helen Moffett\u2019s Charlotte, picking up the story of that same novel\u2019s Charlotte Lucas. All of them are attempts to recreate the Austen universe for different times by means of lesser-known characters, both fictional and real. \u201cOne of the things that inspired me was that ridiculous notion of, \u2018poor Jane, she never found marriage, and those books provided her with an outlet for all her desires\u2019. Really? Did they?\u201d said Hornby. \u201cThe reality is that Jane was never going to marry. She had nought pence, was quite difficult, and not the kind of girl who sucked up to a man when he walked into a room. Nor I think did she care about that.\u201d Hornby was interested in the role Austen\u2019s sister played in allowing the author to write. \u201cCassandra was Jane\u2019s support system. She had enormous pride and investment in Jane\u2019s work. When they\u2019re living in Chawton, she runs the house and says: \u2018You get on with it.\u2019\u201d If Miss Austen delves deep into the author\u2019s interior life \u2013 among the novel\u2019s many highlights are a series of letters between the two sisters which Hornby admits she initially worried were something of a \u201cliberty\u201d \u2013 the year\u2019s other Austen-related novels mine more familiar ground. \u201cOnce I started thinking about Mary, I couldn\u2019t get her out of my head,\u201d said Hadlow, adding that she hoped The Other Bennet Sister would allow us to view the plain sibling in a fresh light. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading Pride and Prejudice for as long as I can remember, and Mary sits on the margins of the book and doesn\u2019t, at first glance, have much to recommend her. She is the only plain daughter in a family of beauties \u2026 she can\u2019t open her mouth without saying something dull or sententious. She\u2019s still a teenager at the time of Pride and Prejudice but she\u2019s already a prig and a bore.\u201d Hadlow felt touched by Mary\u2019s plight. \u201cI found myself feeling increasingly sorry for her and began to wonder who she might be if she was moved from the margins? What would the world of Pride and Prejudice look like when seen through her eyes? How might our sympathies shift?\u201d A similar empathy lay behind South African novelist Moffett\u2019s decision to make Charlotte Lucas the heroine of her novel. Charlotte\u2019s fate \u2013 marriage to the appalling Mr Collins \u2013 has long been seen as one of Austen\u2019s more bleak endings, albeit a realistic one, and Moffett was keen to explore what might happen next. \u201cWhat sort of a life did she have after making a hasty and expedient marriage? What about happiness? Was that a luxury? And was love even more of a fantasy? I wanted to make clear that an ordinary life, an everyday life, even in a society that restricts women\u2019s autonomy is worth scrutinising, recording, exploring. I wanted to look at how a woman with apparently little or no power could be an active agent in the lives of others. I think this is hugely important: the power of the apparently powerless.\u201d While none of this is entirely new \u2013 indeed the last decade has seen a boom in Austen-related fiction, with entire shelves given over to it in US bookshops, and authors from PD James to Joanna Trollope trying their hand at spin-offs and updates \u2013 the three novels are linked by their interest in smaller, less obviously exciting lives. It is this concentration on quiet acts of heroism that ensures that they do they far more than simply coast on Austen\u2019s bonnet strings. \u201cOne of the things that drew me to Gill\u2019s novel was the way in which she presents Jane through the prism of Cassandra,\u201d said Hornby\u2019s editor Selina Walker. \u201cShe makes a very good case for the notion that if it wasn\u2019t for Cassandra, then there wouldn\u2019t be any books, and that attracted me.\u201d Sam Humphreys, Hadlow\u2019s editor, agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a lot of Austen-related fiction but perhaps not always from mainstream publishers,\u201d she said. \u201cI suspect some of this renewed interest stems from the current climate: in times of uncertainty we tend to turn to the familiar, to our traditional sources of comfort \u2013 and who better than Jane Austen?\u201d Hornby herself believes the reason Austen continues to endure \u2013 a new film version of Emma is released next month \u2013 is because \u201cwe never tire of the domestic novel.

Arguably, not much. In two-and-a-half years, his government has pushed through deeper economic reforms than any president in the past four decades. His changes to the French labour market, the state-owned railways, welfare and tax-collection systems have been well considered and long overdue.</p> <p>France has suffered for decades from jobless growth. In the past two years, it has shifted, partly thanks to reforms started by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande under Macron\u2019s influence. More than 260,000 new job opportunities were created last year, mostly in the private sector. More than 700,000 new businesses were launched, a new high that broke the record set in 2018.</p> <p>The two \u201cpopular revolts\u201d against Macron should also be placed in context. The <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/gilets-jaunes-mark-anniversary-of-first-protest\" title=\"\">gilets jaunes</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/gilets-jaunes-mark-anniversary-of-first-protest\" title=\"\"> rebellion</a> continues but has mutated from something powerful, atypical and anti-political into a more traditional and marginal movement of the hard left. The transport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/29/macron-forced-to-step-in-to-defuse-crisis-over-pension-reforms\" title=\"\">strikes against pension reform</a> currently involve around 0.1% of the French workforce. Under 7% of railway workers are on strike, compared with 30% in early December.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s real failures have been less tangible. He came from nowhere, partly through outrageous fortune, to become president at the age of 39 in a country that had grown used to gerontocracy. He has since failed to build a solid electoral base or a flourishing grass-roots movement. He has failed to convince more than a narrow sliver of the electorate that there is a coherent philosophy to \u201cMacronism\u201d. He regards his economic and social reforms \u2013 and his plans for strengthening the EU \u2013 as necessary to protect French, and European, prosperity, culture and sovereignty. A great many French people, especially on the left and far right, believe that he is somehow un-French: a man influenced by alien and outdated, ultra-liberal, Anglo-Saxon attitudes. In his first months, he made clumsy attempts to rekindle the almost mystic relationship with the French people that Charles de Gaulle and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand enjoyed. He tried to be what one French commentator called a \u201cliberal strongman\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Macron is a revolutionary in a suit, not a politician. He is a convinced democrat who grows impatient with democracy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Macron is a revolutionary in a suit, not a politician. He is a convinced democrat who grows easily impatient with democracy. He has a lucid vision of where he thinks France and Europe should go next (a mixture of freer markets internally and hi-tech protectionism to prevent Chinese or US domination). He is impatient with the messy democratic processes, in France, Brussels and Berlin, needed to achieve his goals. As a result, Macron, the anti-populist intellectual, has a fascination with populists, cultivating bromances with Mr Trump (failed), Vladimir Putin (on-off) and Mr Johnson (watch this space). Unsurprisingly, the \u201cliberal strongman\u201d approach failed. Populist leaders cultivate enemies and make visceral appeals unconstrained by the truth. Macron is not above the occasional mistruth or exaggeration but, unlike the trio listed above, he does not lie shamelessly. Instead, he Macronsplains.</p> <p>Put him before 100 people in a village hall and he will speak impressively on everything from class sizes to rural railways. Put him before two foreign journalists (like his tour de force interview with the <em>Economist </em>in November)and he will present a brilliantly joined-up view of his policies on Brexit, EU reform, hi-tech protectionism, Russian and European defence. What he cannot do is find the emotive language to enlist a majority of French people in a crusade for \u201creform of the eurozone\u201d or \u201cScandinavian-style flexi-security\u201d. Quite possibly, such language does not exist.</p> <p>He has therefore zig-zagged through. He has sometimes been \u201cJupiter\u201d (his own word), allowing the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to deal with the mortals. He has sometimes been a brilliant young man visiting the mortals in shirt-sleeves. After the gilets jaunes revolted, Macron embarked on a national tour of village halls to listen to complaints and offer solutions. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/10/macron-great-debate-france-turning-point-or-puffed-up-nonsense\" title=\"\">Great Debate</a>, mocked at first, was a huge success and helped deflate the yellow vests (although \u20ac17bn in tax breaks for the lower paid and other concessions helped).</p> <p>The row over pension reform is a microcosm of the visionary but politically impractical side of Macronism. There was no pressing financial need to shore up a chaotic system of 42 state pension schemes that has already been tinkered with five times since 2003. Pensions are the third rail of French politics. You touch them at your peril. The almost complete absence of private pensions in France means that any state pension reform worries the whole electorate.</p> <p>A prudent politician, after the gilets jaunes revolt, might have delayed the reform until after the 2022 elections. There can be no immediate economic or electoral bonus from a reform that will not take place fully until 2037. But Macron saw pension reform as central to his drive to alter the way France thinks \u2013 to prepare the French for a world in which people change careers and work longer. As things stand, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9920a26-6750-11e9-9adc-98bf1d35a056\" title=\"\">the French work productively but put in fewer hours, on average, than any other western democracy</a>. Early retirement is not the sole explanation but one of the principle ones.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On New Year's Eve, he was expected to come down off Olympus and make peace offerings. He offered nothing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Something strange has happened in recent months, however. Macron has gone off the radar on pension reform. No Macronsplaining; no second tour of stand-up gigs in town halls; no set-piece speech or \u201cletter to the French\u201d. All were mooted and dropped. On New Year\u2019s Eve, he was expected to come down from Olympus and make peace offerings. He offered nothing. He called for a \u201crapid compromise\u201d but left it to Philippe to do the heavy lifting. He was neither Jupiter nor the brilliant young man in shirt-sleeves. He was simply limp. Some allies suggest he stayed out of the pensions snake pit because he is confident the strikes will abate and the reform will go through, in unheroic, much amended form.</p> <p>Others complain that he has taken his eye off domestic policy since the European elections last spring. He has diverted his mental energy to European and international affairs, ranging from European defence, to Iran, to the jihadist threat in the Sahel. One senior source said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be in the front-line trenches again on pensions. He thinks he can make more of a difference in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>If the pensions reform goes through, as it probably will, Macron\u2019s domestic manifesto will have almost been delivered. He can hope to regain some popularity from the rising tide of jobs and from tax cuts that will take effect from this month. His current opinion poll ratings, in the low to mid 30s, are not disastrous for midterm and no serious rivals have emerged. He only needs to score in the high 20s in the presidential election first round in 2022 to reach a second round run-off, almost certainly a rematch of his 2017 showdown with Marine Le Pen. The far-right leader has also been quiet recently. She hopes for good results in the council elections in March. All opinion polls and precedents suggest that even a wounded and unpopular Macron would beat her in 2022 (though by less than the 66-34 drubbing of 2017).</p> <p>A large question remains. Which Macron will France, Europe and post-Brexit Britain see in the next two years? The cocksure Macron of 2017-8, the chastened, shirt-sleeved Macron of 2019 or the downbeat Macron of last Tuesday, the \u201cliberal strongman\u201d wearied by democracy?</p> <p>It is going to be a dangerous year. For all his faults, the world will be the better for a confident, dynamic Macron.</p> <p>\u2022 John Lichfield is a journalist based in France since 1997</p>",

Macron is not above the occasional mistruth or exaggeration but, unlike the trio listed above, he does not lie shamelessly. Instead, he Macronsplains. Put him before 100 people in a village hall and he will speak impressively on everything from class sizes to rural railways. Put him before two foreign journalists (like his tour de force interview with the Economist in November)and he will present a brilliantly joined-up view of his policies on Brexit, EU reform, hi-tech protectionism, Russian and European defence. What he cannot do is find the emotive language to enlist a majority of French people in a crusade for \u201creform of the eurozone\u201d or \u201cScandinavian-style flexi-security\u201d. Quite possibly, such language does not exist. He has therefore zig-zagged through. He has sometimes been \u201cJupiter\u201d (his own word), allowing the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to deal with the mortals. He has sometimes been a brilliant young man visiting the mortals in shirt-sleeves. After the gilets jaunes revolted, Macron embarked on a national tour of village halls to listen to complaints and offer solutions. His Great Debate, mocked at first, was a huge success and helped deflate the yellow vests (although \u20ac17bn in tax breaks for the lower paid and other concessions helped). The row over pension reform is a microcosm of the visionary but politically impractical side of Macronism. There was no pressing financial need to shore up a chaotic system of 42 state pension schemes that has already been tinkered with five times since 2003. Pensions are the third rail of French politics. You touch them at your peril. The almost complete absence of private pensions in France means that any state pension reform worries the whole electorate. A prudent politician, after the gilets jaunes revolt, might have delayed the reform until after the 2022 elections. There can be no immediate economic or electoral bonus from a reform that will not take place fully until 2037. But Macron saw pension reform as central to his drive to alter the way France thinks \u2013 to prepare the French for a world in which people change careers and work longer. As things stand, the French work productively but put in fewer hours, on average, than any other western democracy. Early retirement is not the sole explanation but one of the principle ones. Something strange has happened in recent months, however. Macron has gone off the radar on pension reform. No Macronsplaining; no second tour of stand-up gigs in town halls; no set-piece speech or \u201cletter to the French\u201d. All were mooted and dropped. On New Year\u2019s Eve, he was expected to come down from Olympus and make peace offerings. He offered nothing. He called for a \u201crapid compromise\u201d but left it to Philippe to do the heavy lifting. He was neither Jupiter nor the brilliant young man in shirt-sleeves. He was simply limp. Some allies suggest he stayed out of the pensions snake pit because he is confident the strikes will abate and the reform will go through, in unheroic, much amended form. Others complain that he has taken his eye off domestic policy since the European elections last spring. He has diverted his mental energy to European and international affairs, ranging from European defence, to Iran, to the jihadist threat in the Sahel. One senior source said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be in the front-line trenches again on pensions. He thinks he can make more of a difference in Europe.\u201d If the pensions reform goes through, as it probably will, Macron\u2019s domestic manifesto will have almost been delivered. He can hope to regain some popularity from the rising tide of jobs and from tax cuts that will take effect from this month. His current opinion poll ratings, in the low to mid 30s, are not disastrous for midterm and no serious rivals have emerged. He only needs to score in the high 20s in the presidential election first round in 2022 to reach a second round run-off, almost certainly a rematch of his 2017 showdown with Marine Le Pen. The far-right leader has also been quiet recently. She hopes for good results in the council elections in March. All opinion polls and precedents suggest that even a wounded and unpopular Macron would beat her in 2022 (though by less than the 66-34 drubbing of 2017). A large question remains. Which Macron will France, Europe and post-Brexit Britain see in the next two years? The cocksure Macron of 2017-8, the chastened, shirt-sleeved Macron of 2019 or the downbeat Macron of last Tuesday, the \u201cliberal strongman\u201d wearied by democracy? It is going to be a dangerous year. For all his faults, the world will be the better for a confident, dynamic Macron. \u2022 John Lichfield is a journalist based in France since 1997",

Angela fills a kettle, is belting out \u201cClose the coalhouse door, lad. There\u2019s blood inside\u201d as Rebecca Long-Bailey enters, leaving the front door ajar. Rebecca \u2019Ow do Ange, flippin\u2019 \u2019eck, me vision\u2019s in\u2019t Guardian, there\u2019s nowt can stop me now! (Spots the teapot). Ooh mint I\u2019m gagging for a brew (the Northern accent is wearing off) \u2013 if it\u2019s really not too much trouble Angela dear. Angela Put wood in\u2019t \u2019ole. (Rebecca is motionless) Shut the door. I\u2019d have thought you\u2019d know that. Now pack it in. Or do I tell everyone about your aubergine habit? Not many \u2019effing aubergines where I were raised, any road. Rebecca (Closing the door) Come on Ange, don\u2019t you want to hear about my \u2013 our \u2013 leadership bid? Actually, aubergines aren\u2019t bourgeois. I checked with Jon Lansmann. Angela And prosecco? Rebecca Seumas always says nothing\u2019s too good for the workers \u2013 look Ange, if this is about your dry shampoo, I\u2019m sorry (she takes an aubergine and holds it erect). Remind you of anything? Angela Ooh Bex. Rebecca See, 100% genuine earthy humour! I have to act super-Northern, Seumas says, now Thornberry has bought herself a white van. She\u2019d no choice, to be fair, not after Lisa Nandy got Wigan Athletic tattooed on her face. Artful cow. So I\u2019ve ordered a kestrel. Typical feisty Northerner, me, spend spend spend! Angela What happens when they find out you were a solicitor? Rebecca I still didn\u2019t taste hummus till I were evacuated. Just wait till you hear my vision, Ange, took me and Seumas a whole hour, he said it was literally his most immersively Northern experience since the last Alan Bennett, but \u2013 I can trust you? Angela Go on then, what\u2019s new? Rebecca Progressive patriotism! Angela Oh my God Bex, how long, what do the doctors say? Rebecca I\u2019m fine you daft \u2019aporth, but it won\u2019t happen without you, what do you say Ange? First woman leader, woman deputy, and Northern with it. Jeremy and John say we\u2019ll walk it, dream ticket. Angela Right, listen to bloody Bill and Ben, what if they\u2019re wrong again? Rebecca Careful now Ange, walls have ears. Angela (shouting) Flamin\u2019 hope so \u2013 if it\u2019s genuine Northerners they\u2019re after it\u2019s me should stand. Rebecca What \u2013 because you had a kid at 16? Angela What of it? Rebecca Listen, any of us girls could have, we just weren\u2019t ambitious like your ladyship, quietly building a political career while we were doing To Kill a Mockingbird. Well you forgot something\u2026 Angela What? (The doorbell. Rebecca answers. Enter John McDonnell, Jeremy Corbyn and Seumas Milne.) Rebecca Men. Powerful male powerful men. There\u2019s more to winning than regional accents. Angela (quietly) Oh shit. John (talking over everyone): Lapsang for me, Becky, dash of milk; weak ginger infusion for Jeremy, with manuka, and \u2013 what do you want Seumas? He\u2019s been in one of his moods since he heard about Starmer\u2019s ferret, go on make it an Americano, has she (indicates Angela) signed yet? Angela Think I might be a bit too posh for you John, now Rebecca\u2019s remembered her scabies. Mind at least I wasn\u2019t raised in a manor, eh Jeremy? Rebecca How could you Ange? You\u2019re all right Jeremy, she\u2019s just kidding. Jeremy (advancing, arms out) Come on friends, group hug, we\u2019ll only win our heroic fight against the wickedly vile Conservatives if we come together, North and South, young and old, men and women\u2026 John Shut it. Where\u2019s my Becky with that tea, haven\u2019t got all night. Angela Grand, before you lads bugger off, question: why d\u2019you lose, big-time? Rebecca It\u2019s OK everybody, she knows it\u2019s all the media\u2019s fault, it\u2019s more your role play, for if someone asks, am I right Ange? John Don\u2019t you start. You wouldn\u2019t expect me to anticipate the findings of a democratically constituted NEC sub-committee which will produce a full report following a timely period of reflection. Thoughts, Seumas? Seumas May I borrow your bathroom, sorry ladies, \u201ctoilet\u201d? My hair feels wrong. Exit Seumas. The doorbell. Rebecca answers. Emily Thornberry pushes past. She has a kestrel. Emily Angela? Darling, there\u2019s literally no one else I can ask \u2013 how do you work one of these? Enter Starmer. Keir Angela, I heard every word, they\u2019re not really feminist at all, they\u2019re using you! Angela Says the 97th male heir to the all-misogynist Labour party. John Bloody women. Jeremy Will someone kindly explain? Enter Seumas Seumas So Starmer, you traitor, you\u2019re too late. Angela is ours now. And you, Thornberry \u2013 out. Emily Come on Kes, we\u2019re leaving. Exit Thornberry, with Kes, and Starmer. Seumas Again I have proved, comrade girls, that our system \u2013 the Corbynist system \u2013 is stronger and more resilient than ever. Oppose it at your peril. And be assured that as leader I offer you eternal vigilance, nothing is more precious than the honour and safety of the party\u2019s womenfolk. Northern ones especially. Rebecca I will still win, won\u2019t I? Seumas? John? Jeremy? Progressive patriotism wasn\u2019t too \u2013 patriotic? All look expectantly at Angela. Angela I\u2019ll let you know after me tea. Yorkshire, three sugars Seumas petal, and make it snappy. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columinist",

Mike Small is co-founder of Citizen, launched last April to bring together local groups seeking to restore Edinburgh as \u201ca place for people rather than profit\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cTourists have flocked to Edinburgh for centuries, attracted by its natural beauty and its wonderful built heritage,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to put on cheap makeup and fancy new clothes to make itself look good. Each year the Hogmanay celebration and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/23/edinburgh-christmas-german-market-splits-opinions-local-residents\">the Christmas market</a> on Princes Street Gardens that accompanies it, together with the ever-growing international festival and fringe, eats up more and more of our public spaces.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of claims that permanent residents were made to wear wristbands and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/28/edinburgh-hogmanay-social-curfew-police\" title=\"\">seek permits for private visitors</a> to their own homes during the Hogmanay celebrations, more than 1,000 residents have applied to join Citizen. A campaign of \u201ccivic sabotage\u201d has already been discussed. Protesters could film roped-off events on smartphones and then beam footage onto buildings in neighbourhoods where residents resent being charged up to \u00a3170 to go into their own city centre to see them. Flash crowds well-briefed in Scotland\u2019s public access and right of way laws may also seek admission at entry hotspots in the security cordon.</p> <p>Underbelly and the council claim their winter festivals are raising the profile of Edinburgh and bringing in much-needed tourism revenue. The company said 183,857 people attended the city\u2019s Hogmanay last year, and there were 929,219 registered visitors to the Christmas market \u2013 99% of whom rated it \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d. A further 28,000 tickets to Edinburgh\u2019s Christmas were given to young people and community groups. From this the company calculated that the community benefit was more than \u00a31m and that the combined contract for the two events saves the city \u00a31m per year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Edinburgh doesn\u2019t need to put on cheap make-up and fancy new clothes to make itself look good</p> <footer> <cite>Mike Small, Citizen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Underbelly\u2019s Ed Bartlam, who co-directed Edinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay last week, said: \u201cBalance is the key word. You\u2019ve got to find the balance of viewpoints. There\u2019s a view of some people in the city that there\u2019s too many events related to tourism. But there\u2019s a huge majority, I think, that just love these events, love Hogmanay.\u201d</p> <p>Small questioned how savings to the city were calculated. \u201cIt\u2019s disingenuous to talk about savings and huge visitor increases. Edinburgh has been one of Europe\u2019s most popular visitor destinations for decades. Have we reached a point where the main measure of a city\u2019s worth is calculated in increased profits and privatising the heart of the city?</p> <p>\u201cAt this time of year our own citizens who pay for the city\u2019s year-round upkeep want to come together with friends, family and visitors from overseas without paying a private company for the privilege.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing here is a process where everything is commoditised and where the need to make bigger profits is more important than the lived experience and culture of the city itself. Nor has there been anything resembling a public consultation about any of this.\u201d</p> <p>As well as producing Edinburgh\u2019s Christmas and Hogmanay, Underbelly has put on Christmas in Leicester Square, West End Live in Trafalgar Square and Pride in London for Westminster city council. Critics say it may soon become difficult to differentiate one festival from another as their unique identities are lost in endless pop-up stalls, \u201cBavarian\u201d markets and open-air concerts. </p> <p>In Glasgow, where the local economy is bracing itself for further cuts in public spending, the suggestion that it too could attempt its own lucrative Hogmanay festival was given short shrift by a council source: \u201cWe\u2019d never turn Glasgow into a theme park.\u201d</p>",

Mike Small is co-founder of Citizen, launched last April to bring together local groups seeking to restore Edinburgh as \u201ca place for people rather than profit\u201d. \u201cTourists have flocked to Edinburgh for centuries, attracted by its natural beauty and its wonderful built heritage,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to put on cheap makeup and fancy new clothes to make itself look good. Each year the Hogmanay celebration and the Christmas market on Princes Street Gardens that accompanies it, together with the ever-growing international festival and fringe, eats up more and more of our public spaces.\u201d In the wake of claims that permanent residents were made to wear wristbands and seek permits for private visitors to their own homes during the Hogmanay celebrations, more than 1,000 residents have applied to join Citizen. A campaign of \u201ccivic sabotage\u201d has already been discussed. Protesters could film roped-off events on smartphones and then beam footage onto buildings in neighbourhoods where residents resent being charged up to \u00a3170 to go into their own city centre to see them. Flash crowds well-briefed in Scotland\u2019s public access and right of way laws may also seek admission at entry hotspots in the security cordon. Underbelly and the council claim their winter festivals are raising the profile of Edinburgh and bringing in much-needed tourism revenue. The company said 183,857 people attended the city\u2019s Hogmanay last year, and there were 929,219 registered visitors to the Christmas market \u2013 99% of whom rated it \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d. A further 28,000 tickets to Edinburgh\u2019s Christmas were given to young people and community groups. From this the company calculated that the community benefit was more than \u00a31m and that the combined contract for the two events saves the city \u00a31m per year. Underbelly\u2019s Ed Bartlam, who co-directed Edinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay last week, said: \u201cBalance is the key word. You\u2019ve got to find the balance of viewpoints. There\u2019s a view of some people in the city that there\u2019s too many events related to tourism. But there\u2019s a huge majority, I think, that just love these events, love Hogmanay.\u201d Small questioned how savings to the city were calculated. \u201cIt\u2019s disingenuous to talk about savings and huge visitor increases. Edinburgh has been one of Europe\u2019s most popular visitor destinations for decades. Have we reached a point where the main measure of a city\u2019s worth is calculated in increased profits and privatising the heart of the city? \u201cAt this time of year our own citizens who pay for the city\u2019s year-round upkeep want to come together with friends, family and visitors from overseas without paying a private company for the privilege. \u201cWhat we are seeing here is a process where everything is commoditised and where the need to make bigger profits is more important than the lived experience and culture of the city itself. Nor has there been anything resembling a public consultation about any of this.\u201d As well as producing Edinburgh\u2019s Christmas and Hogmanay, Underbelly has put on Christmas in Leicester Square, West End Live in Trafalgar Square and Pride in London for Westminster city council. Critics say it may soon become difficult to differentiate one festival from another as their unique identities are lost in endless pop-up stalls, \u201cBavarian\u201d markets and open-air concerts. In Glasgow, where the local economy is bracing itself for further cuts in public spending, the suggestion that it too could attempt its own lucrative Hogmanay festival was given short shrift by a council source: \u201cWe\u2019d never turn Glasgow into a theme park.\u201d",

Travelling by private charter, the architect of Tehran\u2019s strategic efforts from Lebanon through Syria and Iraq to Yemen would have avoided all formalities at one of the world\u2019s most securely guarded airports.</p> \n<p>As his plane touched down just after midnight on Friday morning after reportedly disappearing from commercial flight trackers shortly before landing, two cars were waiting to greet the burly general at the aircraft steps.</p> \n<p>On the tarmac was a familiar face, Suleimani\u2019s long-time associate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/abu-mahdi-al-muhandis-iraq-iran-militias-suleimani\" title=\"\">Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis</a>, the Iraqi leader of the Iranian-backed Shia militia Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, whose supporters had laid siege to the US embassy in Baghdad for two days last week in retaliation for US airstrikes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/30/us-airstrikes-iran-tehran-militia-iraq\" title=\"\">killed 25 militia fighters</a> on 29 December.</p> \n<p>Muhandis and Suleimani had urgent matters to discuss \u2013 not least their joint desire to pile pressure on the US. Despite Muhandis ordering his militia away from the American embassy in Baghdad\u2019s fortified Green Zone, they had been targeted by the Americans in response to a series of attacks on bases where US troops were present.</p> \n<p>Suleimani also had pressing issues on his mind. According to US officials, he had flown to Baghdad concerned about escalating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/29/iraqi-protesters-demonstrations-month-of-violence\" title=\"\">anti-government protests in Iraq</a>, some of them fuelled by anti-Iranian sentiment, and anxious to canvass further assistance from Muhandis in countering them. Growing numbers of Iraqis have become disillusioned by a failing economy and ballooning unemployment, and angered by the power wielded in their country by Tehran.</p> \n<p>Climbing into the first car with Muhandis, with their guards following in the second, Suleimani and his small convoy sped towards an access road by the far end of the runway.</p> \n<p>What the cars\u2019 occupants did not know was that details of Suleimani\u2019s visit had been leaked days before. They were being observed by an American MQ-9 Reaper drone transmitting their movements to the Pentagon and CIA.</p> \n<p>As the SUVs turned to skirt the airport\u2019s low perimeter wall topped with barbed wire, at a safe distance from other travellers and Iraqi officials, the drone fired two missiles, slamming into the first car carrying Suleimani and Muhandis, buckling the metal and setting it on fire.</p> \n<p>A third missile followed quickly, striking the second car carrying the bodyguards. The impacts were as devastating as they were lethal. While Muhandis appears to have been vaporised on contact, Suleimani\u2019s hand, covered in grey ash, was pictured dangling through a window, identifiable by the ruby ring he always wore.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"05ef8c1c-b4d9-4cc0-a5fb-60ba6bdf369e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hApKcYbTB70?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The assassination of Suleimani, ordered by President Donald Trump from his Florida golf resort, took only an instant, but it is a moment that now threatens radically to transform the volatile politics of the Middle East and challenge the basis of America\u2019s own engagement there.</p> \n<p>And as so often with Trump, it was an act that was deeply contradictory, flying in the face of everything the president had said before, not least his repeatedly expressed desire to exit what he has called \u201cthe stupid endless Mideast wars\u201d. Far from promising a quick way out of the \u201cstupid wars\u201d, many experts agree, Trump\u2019s decision to kill Suleimani seems to presage only a deeper and more violent entanglement.</p> \n<p>Confronted with the questions \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201cwhy now?\u201d, many observers have struggled to move beyond both the enormity of the event and fear of what many believe will be an inevitable blowback.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is hard to overstate the significance,\u201d remarked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/david-petraeus\" title=\"\">David Petraeus</a>, former head of the CIA and a former commander in Iraq, adding grimly: \u201cThere will be responses in Iraq and likely Syria and the region.\u201d</p> \n<p>A second former acting head of the CIA from the Obama era, Michael Morell, was more brutally forthright. \u201cThere will be dead Americans, dead civilian Americans, as a result of this,\u201d he said, adding for good measure: \u201cI think we\u2019ve now ended any hope of keeping Iraq out of Iran\u2019s arms.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/middle-eastmap/giv-3902RqitN0cdTTGx/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/middle-eastmap/giv-3902RqitN0cdTTGx/\">.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>What few have any doubt about, however, is that Suleimani\u2019s assassination, an act that the George W Bush and Obama administrations both eschewed, has escalated the conflict between Tehran and Washington that has intensified since Trump withdrew from the Obama-era deal to curb Tehran\u2019s alleged nuclear weapons programme, and instead ratcheted up sanctions in the policy known as \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d</p> \n<p>By one reading, the US drone strike was the culmination of a deadly cycle of events that began, largely unnoticed at first, on 27 December more than 250km north of Baghdad on the sprawling K1 air base outside the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, a centre for the fight against the remnants of Isis still operating in the western desert.</p> \n<p>At 7.30 in the evening, a barrage of 31 107mm Katyusha rockets, fired from a lorry, slammed into a building housing Iraqi federal police and the counterterrorism service. The Iraqis, however, were not the target. Instead, the missiles were aimed at an area housing around 100 US and other foreign trainers, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/us/politics/american-rocket-attack-iraq.html\" title=\"\">killing one American civilian interpreter</a> and injuring several more.</p> \n<p>In the immediate aftermath it was at first suspected that remnants of Isis had launched the attack. But within hours US officials, including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, were pointing to another suspect \u2013 the Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah militia, set up by Muhandis.</p> \n<p>The officials pointed to a recent pattern of rocket attacks they attributed to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. Pompeo warned that any further attacks \u201cwill be answered with a decisive US response\u201d.</p> \n<p>But a response to the K1 attack, as it would turn out, was already well in train. The Pentagon authorised airstrikes on several Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah bases identified as housing the perpetrators of the attack, killing 25 and wounding dozens more. Suddenly, a conflict which had been simmering largely under the radar was thrust into view.</p> \n<p>On New Year\u2019s Eve it was the turn of the militia to respond. Summoning supporters to the vast US embassy in Baghdad, they stormed the compound\u2019s reception, sacking it and setting it on fire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b13baa4f-af81-4988-b930-1d728a716877\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tkjJdrma24E?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three days later Suleimani flew into Baghdad, and to his death, with the US alleging he had travelled there to orchestrate new attacks on its forces with his right-hand man in Iraq, Muhandis.</p> \n<p>The manner of Suleimani\u2019s death at the hands of a US foe he had for so long opposed, often violently, has added a new layer of complexity to the legacy of a figure whose life story was full of bloody contradictions.</p> \n<p>A key figure in the grotesque slaughter of the Syrian war, where he helped prop up the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad, Suleimani was also instrumental in the fight against Isis in Iraq, earning him the admiration of many Shia there. And while some saw him as the Middle East\u2019s malign puppet-master, he saw himself as a loyal servant of Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Either way, he had become an almost mythical figure in the region, a far cry from his humble roots.</p> \n<p>Born in impoverished circumstances, and with little formal education, his school was the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps where he became commander of the Quds Force in 1998, tasked with expanding Iran\u2019s influence through covert operations and through ties with the network of proxies he developed from Lebanon to Yemen.</p> \n<p>His skills as a tactician earned him a grudging respect even in senior US military circles.</p> \n<p>One telling assessment was supplied last year by the American general who once contemplated killing him, Stanley McChrystal, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/gt-essay/irans-deadly-puppet-master-qassem-suleimani/\" title=\"\">writing in </a><em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/gt-essay/irans-deadly-puppet-master-qassem-suleimani/\" title=\"\">Foreign Policy</a></em>. In almost admiring terms, the former commander in Iraq painted Suleimani as a \u201cconfident, proven leader\u201d, \u201ca calculating and practical strategist\u201d and a \u201cshrewd pragmatist\u201d.</p> \n<p>For Vali Nasr, however, the Iranian-American academic and author who served as dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Suleimani\u2019s reputation was as much a creation of Washington as it was of Iran.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe US built him since 2008 so he was the only military commander who was known in US foreign policy circles,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>, adding that there were other figures active in prosecuting Iran\u2019s strategy while Suleimani occupied a role similar to the role of US Central Command.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4144519df9debebc5776f256ee2d4fb85285eafc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4144519df9debebc5776f256ee2d4fb85285eafc/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at an Evangelicals for Trump event in Miami on 3 January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at an Evangelicals for Trump event in Miami on 3 January.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAlthough he was very capable in many ways, he was seen as this one-man army responsible for everything happening in Iraq and Syria, which wasn\u2019t accurate. Now he\u2019s dead, the assumptions of the Trump administration appear completely naive in terms of what to expect, not least the comments in Pompeo\u2019s talking points saying that Iraqis are happy that they\u2019ve been liberated from him.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are more complicated than that. Iraqis can be simultaneously unhappy over Iran\u2019s meddling but still have a warm view of Qassem Suleimani who they credit with defending the south against Isis and who was the one who showed up in Erbil with enormous amounts of weaponry to provide defence for the Kurds.\u201d And far from strengthening US influence in Iraq, argues Nasr, the assassination may have \u201cpulverised\u201d US relations with Iraq\u2019s government. \u201cThe momentum is now with the hardliners to push the US out.\u201d<br>Ali Vaez, an Iran expert with Crisis Group, is also sceptical of the assumptions in the Trump administration over the hoped-for outcomes from Suleimani\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe biggest problem here,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>, \u201cis that the Americans believe their own rhetoric. The fact that the US designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps [of which Suleimani\u2019s Quds Force was a key part] as a terrorist organisation doesn\u2019t mean that it functions like a terrorist organisation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean if you decapitate it, it will be paralysed. It\u2019s a state institution of the armed forces of Iran. I think he will be difficult to replace but not impossible. The Quds Force has lots of people with similar profiles with a similar degree of experience and expertise who would be able to push forward Iran\u2019s regional policy.</p> \n<p>Vaez cautions too: \u201cIt\u2019s often the case that the man standing behind steps in, even if he lacks the vision and tactical skills, and risks being more of a hardliner, which will only exacerbate the stresses.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the events of the last week appear at first surprising, all they have really done is highlight a competition for influence in Iraq that has festered since the moment US-led forces deposed Saddam in 2003, a conflict in which Suleimani has long been a key player.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad5e1c0e-1518-4fdb-bc26-8d80249d4a79\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/musxBAJezP4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While the Bush administration had glibly assumed the victors\u2019 spoils would fall to the US in what it saw hubristically as an opportunity to reshape the Middle East, Tehran also saw an opportunity to influence its old neighbour and foe with the replacement of the Sunni-dominated Baath party by its Shia co-religionists.</p> \n<p>Among exiles returning after the war were those who had sought refuge in Iran in the Saddam era, including veterans of the Badr Corps \u2013 Iraqis who had sided with Iran in the conflict\u2019s brutal trench warfare that, with its use of poison gas and massed attacks, seemed like a rerun of the battles on the Western Front.</p> \n<p>One of those key figures was Muhandis, born in Basra to an Iraqi father and Iranian mother, who had fled Iraq in the Saddam era and had risen through the ranks in Iran to become a senior commander.</p> \n<p>Even as the US forces were battling an insurgency by Sunnis drawn from the old Baath party ranks and a new iteration of al-Qaida, Shia militias, many taking guidance from Iran and Suleimani, were pursuing their own agenda to undermine the US-led vision for Iraq, a policy that would see the lives of some 700 US servicemen laid at Suleimani\u2019s door.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51c59dc0f808ba388ad33e2b66af68c9cb7118a2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51c59dc0f808ba388ad33e2b66af68c9cb7118a2/0_202_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iranians take to the streets as they mourn the death of Qassem Soleimani.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iranians take to the streets as they mourn the death of Qassem Soleimani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Media</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If that tension was put on the back burner during the devastating rise of Isis in Iraq, when Suleimani and the US would be fighting a common enemy, all that changed with the election of Trump and his abrupt withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. As Trump formed an alliance with Saudi Arabia against Tehran, the scene was set for the escalation of a series of proxy wars across the region, one that in recent months has seen the Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah militia targeting US interests in Iraq.</p> \n<p>According to a Reuters report on Saturday, that involved a meeting in October in a Baghdad villa where Suleimani told militia commanders under the direction of Muhandis to form a new group of low-profile paramilitaries \u2013 unknown to the United States \u2013 who could carry out rocket attacks on Americans housed at Iraqi military bases.</p> \n<p>And despite the celebration of Trump and his allies, for some experts the killing of Suleimani smacked not of strength, but of weakness.</p> \n<p>\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to escalate hostilities by killing Qassem Suleimani epitomises the failure of his strategy for dealing with Iran,\u201d said David Schanzer, an expert on terrorism at Duke University.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump abandoned diplomacy as a means to constrain Iran by backing out of the nuclear accord in 2018, opting instead to use punitive economic sanctions to pressure Iran to end its aggressive behaviour. The result? Iran is now advancing its nuclear programme, acting with greater aggression in the region, and fomenting greater violence inside neighbouring Iraq.\u201d</p> \n<p>All of which raises the question of why Trump took what may be the biggest gamble of his presidency?</p> \n<p>At Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s pink-walled Florida resort where the president had retreated from Washington to celebrate the holidays, there was no hint early last week of what was being contemplated.</p> \n<p>Even on Tuesday evening in the aftermath of the violent attack on the US embassy in Baghdad, Trump\u2019s messaging on Iran, and its allied militias in Iraq, was typically muddled as he mused on the prospect of war with Iran. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a good idea for Iran. It wouldn\u2019t last very long,\u201d Trump said as he warned of the consequences of further attacks. \u201cDo I want to [go to war]? No. I want to have peace. I like peace.\u201d</p> \n<p>Reporting in the US media suggests, however, that behind the scenes Trump and his advisers were already heavily engaged in drawing up a response to the K1 attack, including the retaliatory airstrikes, when the president was alerted that US intelligence agencies had learned that Suleimani was flying to Baghdad from Damascus.</p> \n<p>And on the agenda since at least last Sunday, even before the violent demonstrations at the US embassy, was the proposed assassination of Suleimani, a notion, some suggest, that may have first been mooted as long ago as early summer.</p> \n<p>According to the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/how-trump-decided-to-kill-a-top-iranian-general/2020/01/03/77ce3cc4-2e62-11ea-bcd4-24597950008f_story.html\" title=\"\">Washington Post</a></em>, Trump was prodded by officials who reminded him that he had failed to respond to previous attacks blamed on Iran, including the mining of oil tankers in the Gulf, the shooting down of a US surveillance drone and the rocket attack on a Saudi oil facility.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe argument is, if you don\u2019t ever respond to them, they think they can get by with anything,\u201d one White House official told the paper.</p> \n<p>When it came to the crunch, the moment of decision was oddly banal. On Thursday, just hours before the assassination, Trump played a round of golf, then later huddled with his campaign team to review plans for this year\u2019s election, leaving the meeting for a few minutes at around 5pm, the moment, some believe, when he delivered the \u201ckill order\u201d.</p> \n<p>And after the fact there has been a slew of new rationalisations.</p> \n<p>In a conference call with US media on Friday, the national security adviser, Robert C O\u2019Brien, described the strike as \u201caimed at disrupting ongoing attacks that were being planned by Suleimani and deterring future Iranian attacks through their proxies or through the \u2026 Quds Force directly against Americans,\u201d while Trump himself suggested the killing was intended to prevent a war, not provoke one.</p> \n<p>That may be a moot point.</p> \n<p>By Saturday, as thousands of mourners for Suleimani <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/tears-mix-with-vows-of-vengeance-at-suleimani-funeral-march-baghdad\" title=\"\">marched through Baghdad chanting anti-American slogans</a>, what was certain, even as Washington deployed 3,000 fresh troops to the Middle East, is that the next move will be decided in Tehran.</p> \n<p>Every major newspaper and state-controlled TV broadcast has focused on Suleimani\u2019s death, with even reformist newspapers such as <em>Aftab-e Yazd</em> warning of revenge, and new billboards carrying the same message.</p> \n<p>\u201cHis work and path will not cease, and severe revenge awaits those criminals who have tainted their filthy hands with his blood and the blood of the other martyrs,\u201d Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, while the defence minister, Amir Hatami, promised a \u201ccrushing\u201d response.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac335a25d9a39e6531438a9097d12411c2ac0f49\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac335a25d9a39e6531438a9097d12411c2ac0f49/0_66_2105_1263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at a funeral for his fighters killed in US airstrikes retaliating for attacks by his militia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thaier Al-Sudani/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The only question is the timing, with many anticipating that there will be careful deliberations among Iran\u2019s leaders before any response.</p> \n<p>\u201cLook, this is a pragmatic regime not a suicidal one,\u201d said Vaez, \u201cand the pragmatism emanates from the very top. That pragmatism is not going to change but Iran will have to respond to this otherwise it will be seen as weakness inviting more US aggression. But retaliation is inevitable even if the risk of a miscalculation is very high.\u201d</p> \n<p>The key calculation in Tehran, argued Vaez, is predicting Washington\u2019s response and whether a \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d might force a withdrawal similar to the one after the 1983 bombing of a US marines barracks in Beirut that claimed 241 lives, or whether a more proportionate response \u2013 perhaps targeting a senior US official for assassination \u2013 is a safer course.</p> \n<p>And back in the US not everyone is buying the official explanations for the killing. \u201c[Suleimani] has been killing Americans in Iraq since 2003,\u201d Jon Soltz, chairman of VoteVets.org and an Iraq war veteran told the <em>New York Times</em>. \u201cI was in one of his attacks in Taji in 2011. They were dropping 240mm rockets on us. So this is not a surprise that he\u2019s involved in killing Americans.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the question is what was different last night? The onus is on Trump to prove something was different, or this is no different than another weapons of mass destruction play.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Qassem Suleimani, the 62-year-old head of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, and one of the most powerful men in the Middle East, the short flight from Damascus to Baghdad late on Thursday was routine. Travelling by private charter, the architect of Tehran\u2019s strategic efforts from Lebanon through Syria and Iraq to Yemen would have avoided all formalities at one of the world\u2019s most securely guarded airports. As his plane touched down just after midnight on Friday morning after reportedly disappearing from commercial flight trackers shortly before landing, two cars were waiting to greet the burly general at the aircraft steps. On the tarmac was a familiar face, Suleimani\u2019s long-time associate Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the Iraqi leader of the Iranian-backed Shia militia Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, whose supporters had laid siege to the US embassy in Baghdad for two days last week in retaliation for US airstrikes that killed 25 militia fighters on 29 December. Muhandis and Suleimani had urgent matters to discuss \u2013 not least their joint desire to pile pressure on the US. Despite Muhandis ordering his militia away from the American embassy in Baghdad\u2019s fortified Green Zone, they had been targeted by the Americans in response to a series of attacks on bases where US troops were present. Suleimani also had pressing issues on his mind. According to US officials, he had flown to Baghdad concerned about escalating anti-government protests in Iraq, some of them fuelled by anti-Iranian sentiment, and anxious to canvass further assistance from Muhandis in countering them. Growing numbers of Iraqis have become disillusioned by a failing economy and ballooning unemployment, and angered by the power wielded in their country by Tehran. Climbing into the first car with Muhandis, with their guards following in the second, Suleimani and his small convoy sped towards an access road by the far end of the runway. What the cars\u2019 occupants did not know was that details of Suleimani\u2019s visit had been leaked days before. They were being observed by an American MQ-9 Reaper drone transmitting their movements to the Pentagon and CIA. As the SUVs turned to skirt the airport\u2019s low perimeter wall topped with barbed wire, at a safe distance from other travellers and Iraqi officials, the drone fired two missiles, slamming into the first car carrying Suleimani and Muhandis, buckling the metal and setting it on fire. A third missile followed quickly, striking the second car carrying the bodyguards. The impacts were as devastating as they were lethal. While Muhandis appears to have been vaporised on contact, Suleimani\u2019s hand, covered in grey ash, was pictured dangling through a window, identifiable by the ruby ring he always wore. The assassination of Suleimani, ordered by President Donald Trump from his Florida golf resort, took only an instant, but it is a moment that now threatens radically to transform the volatile politics of the Middle East and challenge the basis of America\u2019s own engagement there. And as so often with Trump, it was an act that was deeply contradictory, flying in the face of everything the president had said before, not least his repeatedly expressed desire to exit what he has called \u201cthe stupid endless Mideast wars\u201d. Far from promising a quick way out of the \u201cstupid wars\u201d, many experts agree, Trump\u2019s decision to kill Suleimani seems to presage only a deeper and more violent entanglement. Confronted with the questions \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201cwhy now?\u201d, many observers have struggled to move beyond both the enormity of the event and fear of what many believe will be an inevitable blowback. \u201cIt is hard to overstate the significance,\u201d remarked David Petraeus, former head of the CIA and a former commander in Iraq, adding grimly: \u201cThere will be responses in Iraq and likely Syria and the region.\u201d A second former acting head of the CIA from the Obama era, Michael Morell, was more brutally forthright. \u201cThere will be dead Americans, dead civilian Americans, as a result of this,\u201d he said, adding for good measure: \u201cI think we\u2019ve now ended any hope of keeping Iraq out of Iran\u2019s arms.\u201d What few have any doubt about, however, is that Suleimani\u2019s assassination, an act that the George W Bush and Obama administrations both eschewed, has escalated the conflict between Tehran and Washington that has intensified since Trump withdrew from the Obama-era deal to curb Tehran\u2019s alleged nuclear weapons programme, and instead ratcheted up sanctions in the policy known as \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d By one reading, the US drone strike was the culmination of a deadly cycle of events that began, largely unnoticed at first, on 27 December more than 250km north of Baghdad on the sprawling K1 air base outside the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, a centre for the fight against the remnants of Isis still operating in the western desert. At 7.30 in the evening, a barrage of 31 107mm Katyusha rockets, fired from a lorry, slammed into a building housing Iraqi federal police and the counterterrorism service. The Iraqis, however, were not the target. Instead, the missiles were aimed at an area housing around 100 US and other foreign trainers, killing one American civilian interpreter and injuring several more. In the immediate aftermath it was at first suspected that remnants of Isis had launched the attack. But within hours US officials, including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, were pointing to another suspect \u2013 the Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah militia, set up by Muhandis. The officials pointed to a recent pattern of rocket attacks they attributed to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. Pompeo warned that any further attacks \u201cwill be answered with a decisive US response\u201d. But a response to the K1 attack, as it would turn out, was already well in train. The Pentagon authorised airstrikes on several Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah bases identified as housing the perpetrators of the attack, killing 25 and wounding dozens more. Suddenly, a conflict which had been simmering largely under the radar was thrust into view. On New Year\u2019s Eve it was the turn of the militia to respond. Summoning supporters to the vast US embassy in Baghdad, they stormed the compound\u2019s reception, sacking it and setting it on fire. Three days later Suleimani flew into Baghdad, and to his death, with the US alleging he had travelled there to orchestrate new attacks on its forces with his right-hand man in Iraq, Muhandis. The manner of Suleimani\u2019s death at the hands of a US foe he had for so long opposed, often violently, has added a new layer of complexity to the legacy of a figure whose life story was full of bloody contradictions. A key figure in the grotesque slaughter of the Syrian war, where he helped prop up the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad, Suleimani was also instrumental in the fight against Isis in Iraq, earning him the admiration of many Shia there. And while some saw him as the Middle East\u2019s malign puppet-master, he saw himself as a loyal servant of Iran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Either way, he had become an almost mythical figure in the region, a far cry from his humble roots. Born in impoverished circumstances, and with little formal education, his school was the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps where he became commander of the Quds Force in 1998, tasked with expanding Iran\u2019s influence through covert operations and through ties with the network of proxies he developed from Lebanon to Yemen. His skills as a tactician earned him a grudging respect even in senior US military circles. One telling assessment was supplied last year by the American general who once contemplated killing him, Stanley McChrystal, writing in Foreign Policy. In almost admiring terms, the former commander in Iraq painted Suleimani as a \u201cconfident, proven leader\u201d, \u201ca calculating and practical strategist\u201d and a \u201cshrewd pragmatist\u201d. For Vali Nasr, however, the Iranian-American academic and author who served as dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Suleimani\u2019s reputation was as much a creation of Washington as it was of Iran. \u201cThe US built him since 2008 so he was the only military commander who was known in US foreign policy circles,\u201d he told the Observer, adding that there were other figures active in prosecuting Iran\u2019s strategy while Suleimani occupied a role similar to the role of US Central Command. \u201cAlthough he was very capable in many ways, he was seen as this one-man army responsible for everything happening in Iraq and Syria, which wasn\u2019t accurate. Now he\u2019s dead, the assumptions of the Trump administration appear completely naive in terms of what to expect, not least the comments in Pompeo\u2019s talking points saying that Iraqis are happy that they\u2019ve been liberated from him. \u201cPeople are more complicated than that. Iraqis can be simultaneously unhappy over Iran\u2019s meddling but still have a warm view of Qassem Suleimani who they credit with defending the south against Isis and who was the one who showed up in Erbil with enormous amounts of weaponry to provide defence for the Kurds.\u201d And far from strengthening US influence in Iraq, argues Nasr, the assassination may have \u201cpulverised\u201d US relations with Iraq\u2019s government. \u201cThe momentum is now with the hardliners to push the US out.\u201d Ali Vaez, an Iran expert with Crisis Group, is also sceptical of the assumptions in the Trump administration over the hoped-for outcomes from Suleimani\u2019s killing. \u201cThe biggest problem here,\u201d he told the Observer, \u201cis that the Americans believe their own rhetoric. The fact that the US designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps [of which Suleimani\u2019s Quds Force was a key part] as a terrorist organisation doesn\u2019t mean that it functions like a terrorist organisation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean if you decapitate it, it will be paralysed. It\u2019s a state institution of the armed forces of Iran. I think he will be difficult to replace but not impossible. The Quds Force has lots of people with similar profiles with a similar degree of experience and expertise who would be able to push forward Iran\u2019s regional policy. Vaez cautions too: \u201cIt\u2019s often the case that the man standing behind steps in, even if he lacks the vision and tactical skills, and risks being more of a hardliner, which will only exacerbate the stresses.\u201d If the events of the last week appear at first surprising, all they have really done is highlight a competition for influence in Iraq that has festered since the moment US-led forces deposed Saddam in 2003, a conflict in which Suleimani has long been a key player. While the Bush administration had glibly assumed the victors\u2019 spoils would fall to the US in what it saw hubristically as an opportunity to reshape the Middle East, Tehran also saw an opportunity to influence its old neighbour and foe with the replacement of the Sunni-dominated Baath party by its Shia co-religionists. Among exiles returning after the war were those who had sought refuge in Iran in the Saddam era, including veterans of the Badr Corps \u2013 Iraqis who had sided with Iran in the conflict\u2019s brutal trench warfare that, with its use of poison gas and massed attacks, seemed like a rerun of the battles on the Western Front. One of those key figures was Muhandis, born in Basra to an Iraqi father and Iranian mother, who had fled Iraq in the Saddam era and had risen through the ranks in Iran to become a senior commander. Even as the US forces were battling an insurgency by Sunnis drawn from the old Baath party ranks and a new iteration of al-Qaida, Shia militias, many taking guidance from Iran and Suleimani, were pursuing their own agenda to undermine the US-led vision for Iraq, a policy that would see the lives of some 700 US servicemen laid at Suleimani\u2019s door. If that tension was put on the back burner during the devastating rise of Isis in Iraq, when Suleimani and the US would be fighting a common enemy, all that changed with the election of Trump and his abrupt withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. As Trump formed an alliance with Saudi Arabia against Tehran, the scene was set for the escalation of a series of proxy wars across the region, one that in recent months has seen the Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah militia targeting US interests in Iraq. According to a Reuters report on Saturday, that involved a meeting in October in a Baghdad villa where Suleimani told militia commanders under the direction of Muhandis to form a new group of low-profile paramilitaries \u2013 unknown to the United States \u2013 who could carry out rocket attacks on Americans housed at Iraqi military bases. And despite the celebration of Trump and his allies, for some experts the killing of Suleimani smacked not of strength, but of weakness. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to escalate hostilities by killing Qassem Suleimani epitomises the failure of his strategy for dealing with Iran,\u201d said David Schanzer, an expert on terrorism at Duke University. \u201cTrump abandoned diplomacy as a means to constrain Iran by backing out of the nuclear accord in 2018, opting instead to use punitive economic sanctions to pressure Iran to end its aggressive behaviour. The result? Iran is now advancing its nuclear programme, acting with greater aggression in the region, and fomenting greater violence inside neighbouring Iraq.\u201d All of which raises the question of why Trump took what may be the biggest gamble of his presidency? At Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s pink-walled Florida resort where the president had retreated from Washington to celebrate the holidays, there was no hint early last week of what was being contemplated. Even on Tuesday evening in the aftermath of the violent attack on the US embassy in Baghdad, Trump\u2019s messaging on Iran, and its allied militias in Iraq, was typically muddled as he mused on the prospect of war with Iran. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a good idea for Iran. It wouldn\u2019t last very long,\u201d Trump said as he warned of the consequences of further attacks. \u201cDo I want to [go to war]? No. I want to have peace. I like peace.\u201d Reporting in the US media suggests, however, that behind the scenes Trump and his advisers were already heavily engaged in drawing up a response to the K1 attack, including the retaliatory airstrikes, when the president was alerted that US intelligence agencies had learned that Suleimani was flying to Baghdad from Damascus. And on the agenda since at least last Sunday, even before the violent demonstrations at the US embassy, was the proposed assassination of Suleimani, a notion, some suggest, that may have first been mooted as long ago as early summer. According to the Washington Post, Trump was prodded by officials who reminded him that he had failed to respond to previous attacks blamed on Iran, including the mining of oil tankers in the Gulf, the shooting down of a US surveillance drone and the rocket attack on a Saudi oil facility. \u201cThe argument is, if you don\u2019t ever respond to them, they think they can get by with anything,\u201d one White House official told the paper. When it came to the crunch, the moment of decision was oddly banal. On Thursday, just hours before the assassination, Trump played a round of golf, then later huddled with his campaign team to review plans for this year\u2019s election, leaving the meeting for a few minutes at around 5pm, the moment, some believe, when he delivered the \u201ckill order\u201d. And after the fact there has been a slew of new rationalisations. In a conference call with US media on Friday, the national security adviser, Robert C O\u2019Brien, described the strike as \u201caimed at disrupting ongoing attacks that were being planned by Suleimani and deterring future Iranian attacks through their proxies or through the \u2026 Quds Force directly against Americans,\u201d while Trump himself suggested the killing was intended to prevent a war, not provoke one. That may be a moot point. By Saturday, as thousands of mourners for Suleimani marched through Baghdad chanting anti-American slogans, what was certain, even as Washington deployed 3,000 fresh troops to the Middle East, is that the next move will be decided in Tehran. Every major newspaper and state-controlled TV broadcast has focused on Suleimani\u2019s death, with even reformist newspapers such as Aftab-e Yazd warning of revenge, and new billboards carrying the same message. \u201cHis work and path will not cease, and severe revenge awaits those criminals who have tainted their filthy hands with his blood and the blood of the other martyrs,\u201d Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, while the defence minister, Amir Hatami, promised a \u201ccrushing\u201d response. The only question is the timing, with many anticipating that there will be careful deliberations among Iran\u2019s leaders before any response. \u201cLook, this is a pragmatic regime not a suicidal one,\u201d said Vaez, \u201cand the pragmatism emanates from the very top. That pragmatism is not going to change but Iran will have to respond to this otherwise it will be seen as weakness inviting more US aggression. But retaliation is inevitable even if the risk of a miscalculation is very high.\u201d The key calculation in Tehran, argued Vaez, is predicting Washington\u2019s response and whether a \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d might force a withdrawal similar to the one after the 1983 bombing of a US marines barracks in Beirut that claimed 241 lives, or whether a more proportionate response \u2013 perhaps targeting a senior US official for assassination \u2013 is a safer course. And back in the US not everyone is buying the official explanations for the killing. \u201c[Suleimani] has been killing Americans in Iraq since 2003,\u201d Jon Soltz, chairman of VoteVets.org and an Iraq war veteran told the New York Times. \u201cI was in one of his attacks in Taji in 2011. They were dropping 240mm rockets on us. So this is not a surprise that he\u2019s involved in killing Americans. \u201cBut the question is what was different last night? The onus is on Trump to prove something was different, or this is no different than another weapons of mass destruction play.\u201d",

In a development that has taken even seasoned sinologists aback, Home Credit \u2013 a domestic loans company owned by Petr Kellner that has lent an estimated \u00a310bn to Chinese consumers \u2013 paid a PR firm to place articles in the local media giving a more positive picture of a country widely associated with political repression and human rights abuses.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accurate picture.\u201d The revelations coincide with a recent warning by the Czech intelligence service, BIS, that Chinese influence campaigns pose a greater threat to national security than alleged meddling by the Russian government of Vladimir Putin. \u201cThe BIS considers primarily the increase in the activities of Chinese intelligence officers as the fundamental security problem,\u201d the report says. \u201cThese activities can be clearly assessed as searching for and contacting potential cooperators and agents among Czech citizens.\u201d Czech ties with Beijing grew closer after 2014 when the regime granted Home Credit a nationwide licence to offer domestic loans, the first foreign company to be given the right. Experts say this would only have happened on the understanding that Home Credit would work to ensure favourable coverage of China in the Czech media and political discourse. It heralded several trips to China by Zeman, who is close to Kellner, and culminated in a state visit in 2016 by the Chinese leader Xi Jinping to Prague. The rapprochement \u2013 which also saw the purchase of a Czech brewery, television station and Slavia Prague football club by a Chinese energy company, CEFC \u2013 reversed the policy adopted by the late V\u00e1clav Havel, the Czech Republic\u2019s first post-communist president who had championed human rights, and the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet. But relations began to sour last year when the Czech government of prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161, acting on advice from the country\u2019s cybersecurity agency, banned Huawei phones from ministerial buildings, prompting Chinese protests and a rebuke from Zeman, who accused the security services of \u201cdirty tricks\u201d. They took a further turn for the worse when Prague\u2019s liberal mayor, Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib, refused to abide by the One China policy \u2013 recognising China\u2019s territorial claim to Taiwan \u2013 accepted by his predecessor as part of a twinning arrangement between the Czech capital and Beijing. In retaliation, China scrapped the agreement and cancelled a planned tour of the country by the Prague Philharmonia. Amid the rows, criticism began to appear in Chinese state media of Home Credit\u2019s lending practices, accompanied by several failures in court to fully recover unpaid debts. That has fuelled speculation that the company began to fear for the future of its interests in China. When Sinopsis reported the Chinese media criticism on its website, it received a \u201ccease and desist\u201d legal warning from Home Credit which threatened to sue unless in the absence of an apology. The company accuses Sinopsis of failing to correct \u201cmisleading or incorrect statements\u201d. Home Credit had earlier abandoned a \u00a350,000 sponsorship deal with Charles University \u2013 which foreswore each institution from damaging the other\u2019s good name \u2013 after a backlash from academics, who feared it would muzzle any criticism of China. Now critics see a new threat, from PPF\u2019s recent \u00a31.62bn purchase from AT&amp;T of Central European Media Enterprises (CME), a company which includes the Czech Republic\u2019s most-watched commercial TV station, Nova, as well as channels in neighbouring countries. PPF has dismissed warnings about potential political interference in the station\u2019s output but some are sceptical. \u201cPPF negotiated this deal saying that they would never meddle in politics,\u201d said Petr Kutilek, a Czech political analyst and human rights activist. \u201cBut from the Home Credit affair, you actually see them meddling in politics.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The tennis player Alexander Zverev has blue eyes and shaggy blond hair and is 6ft 7in tall. His legs are stilts, and his face, journalists have pointed out, is that of an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model. Zverev actually has a modelling contract with Zegna, the Italian fashion brand, partly because he is a well-known tennis player, but also because he looks less like a tennis player and more like a luxury clothes horse.</p> <p>Zverev is 22. He joined the pro circuit in 2013, when he was 16. At the end of 2018, he was ranked the fourth best men\u2019s tennis player in the world, behind Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer \u2013 the big three \u2013 but ahead of younger challengers. He\u2019d recently won the ATP Finals, in London, the so-called fifth grand slam, becoming the youngest player to win the tournament in a decade. As a kid he\u2019d been the world junior No 1 and a junior grand slam champion. For years, fans had thought of him as tennis\u2019s crown prince \u2013 the prodigal heir. Both Nadal and Djokovic had hinted at Zverev becoming their eventual successor. Here, <em>finally</em>, after the failed attempts of other once up-and-coming players, was a talent poised to dethrone the game\u2019s elder greats. At the end of one 2018 tournament, Boris Becker announced: \u201cA star has arrived.\u201d</p> <p>For a while, life was good. Life was trouble-free! Zverev would appear at tournaments, project supreme self-confidence, absorb any and all stress (\u201cPressure is a privilege,\u201d he says, in that throwaway, sportsperson way), and rain down hard, flat serves at 140mph.</p> <p>And then, just like that, the narrative flipped.</p> <p>In January last year, Zverev broke up with his agent, Patricio Apey, a former player, with whom Zverev had worked since he was 15. (What began as a tiff evolved into a protracted legal battle, which is ongoing, even now.) Then, in short order, he separated from his girlfriend, the Russian player Olya Sharypova; his father, himself a former pro, as well as Zverev\u2019s long-time coach, fell ill and returned home to Germany, where Zverev grew up; and he endured a strange period in which Ivan Lendl was technically hired as his coach, but often failed to turn up to his games. For a while last year, Zverev didn\u2019t <em>have</em> a coach. Pro tennis players often arrive at tournaments with an almighty entourage. At two competitions in 2019, Zverev appeared alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"728274f3f898fbd1020577195d2d04b6cd001aee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/728274f3f898fbd1020577195d2d04b6cd001aee/0_71_3215_1929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Zverev and Novak Djokovic shaking hands at the net at the end of a match\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Net call: losing to Novak Djokovic at the 2019 French Open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the first half of the 2019 season, Zverev\u2019s performances teetered, then collapsed over the edge. He lost in the second round at Indian Wells, in March. He lost at a competition in Miami (first round, same month), against a player ranked 155 in the world. And then in Marrakech (second round), Monte Carlo (second round), Barcelona (first round), Rome (first round) and Stuttgart (first round). Zverev had been tipped to <em>win</em> competitions, not spill out of opening rounds. But what had once seemed so easy \u2013 the winning \u2013 all of a sudden became very hard. You couldn\u2019t call it a slump, really. In six months, he barely won.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine Zverev suffering a kind of crisis. His self-belief wavered. He became dejected and impetuous and difficult to be around. At Wimbledon, last July, he lost in the first round to the Czech qualifier Jiri Vesely (wily journeyman, rank 124). After the game, Zverev slunk into a press conference. His hair was roughly tousled and his blue eyes dulled \u2013 a surly, sorry wreck. \u201cI\u2019m not very high on confidence right now,\u201d he said, and then, for emphasis: \u201cMy confidence is <em>below</em> zero.\u201d When a reporter asked why, Zverev replied: \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t won much this year,\u201d and looked away in disgust. But then he elaborated a little. \u201cI get down on myself a lot,\u201d he said, before alluding to personal problems.

In October, he reached the final of the Shanghai Masters and the semi-final of the China Open, in Beijing \u2013 top-tier events. He\u2019s in London to defend his title at the ATP Finals \u2013 where he will thrash Rafael Nadal, but lose in the semi-finals, to Dominic Thiem \u2013 to which only the best eight players on the men\u2019s tour get invited. (Zverev finished the season, thanks to his late surge, ranked 7 in the world.) By the time this conversation is published, he will have toured south America with Roger Federer, played his part in breaking the record for the largest crowd attendance at a tennis match (42,217, at a stadium in Mexico City), gently consoled Federer after one of their exhibition matches almost evolved into a riot, loosened up during the off-season break, represented Germany at the ATP Cup (first match: a loss in which Zverev, perhaps not <em>all</em> the way back, served several double faults, angrily smashed a racket against the floor, and was later described by one newspaper as a \u201ctennis hothead\u201d) and returned to the tour ready for the Australian Open, later this month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0264d710fa90ed5aba156e24d3c2086e5872bd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0264d710fa90ed5aba156e24d3c2086e5872bd5/0_2277_6200_3719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of Alex Zverev's face with the left half obscured by a tennis racquet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You know, in my mind, I\u2019m not that young any more, and I need to start improving\u2019: Alexander Zverev has his eye focused on tennis\u2019s No 1 spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Perou/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has had time to reflect on all of this, too: the strange, unexpected upturn in form. He has taken his whole season apart and analysed it piece by piece. And what he has come to understand is this: all he ever needed to do was \u2013 his words \u2013 \u201cLet go.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s right, in a way, about the letting go. After Wimbledon he did take a break \u2013 a short holiday. And then he announced, to himself more than anyone else, that if he continued to play so poorly he\u2019d finish his season early and go again in 2020. \u201cThat loosened me up a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me not <em>think</em> about anything.\u201d He relaxed into the routines he developed early in his career, when he arrived at tournaments hopeful, but not expecting to win.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Other people my age are finishing college and trying to find a job</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was just, like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to enjoy playing the best players in the world, enjoy being out here, hopefully give myself the best chances to win matches.\u2019\u201d The pressure lifted. \u201cThe thing is, there\u2019s nobody in the world that puts more pressure on myself than me.\u201d And he grew up, maybe, though: \u201cIt\u2019s never nice to say about yourself that you\u2019ve grown up.\u201d</p> <p>But letting go isn\u2019t the full story. In August, Zverev signed papers with a new management company, Team8, a firm established by Roger Federer. (Zverev did not organise this interview, his new publicist did.) His father recovered and returned to the tour \u2013 a calming presence. And he began dating the German supermodel <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brendapatea/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Brenda Patea</a>, who now appears in Zverev\u2019s Instagram feed \u2013 modern love \u2013 and who is as leggy and good-looking as he is. Slowly, a kind of stability returned. Whatever personal and professional foundations crumbled at the beginning of last year \u2013 no management, no support staff, no partner \u2013 Zverev has painstakingly rebuilt, brick by brick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be2dfa49ef125d7088ecbc5adb422cac73a0390d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be2dfa49ef125d7088ecbc5adb422cac73a0390d/0_31_1621_1358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Zverev as a boy with his older brother in front of a tennis net, with his parents standing behind them, the other side of the net\" width=\"1000\" height=\"838\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s never nice to say about yourself that you\u2019ve grown up\u2019: as a boy with his family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nadine Rupp/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So yes, he \u201clet go\u201d. He thought less about things. He relaxed. He took the pressure off. And it helped. But he did that only because he\u2019d once again formed a loyal supporting staff, which provided him the opportunity to. Which is what it means to grow up, isn\u2019t it? Realising you can\u2019t do everything yourself.</p> <p>Maybe because he\u2019s so tall, or maybe because he started playing tennis professionally at 14 and it seems like he\u2019s been on the circuit for years (which, technically, he has), people forget Zverev is just 22. \u201cOther people my age would be finishing college and trying to find a job.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t see himself as a young man. \u201cYou know, in my mind, I\u2019m not that young any more, and I need to start improving.\u201d It is his responsibility, he thinks, now that he\u2019s back to something close to his best, now that\u2019s he\u2019s <em>let go</em>, to fulfill his potential. \u201cThe other guys\u201d \u2013 Federer, Nadal, Djokovic \u2013 \u201chave been there for 20 years. They know how to get it done. They know what it takes to win. Are we going to take over at some point? Yes! We have to! They\u2019re not going to be there for ever\u2026 And anyway, I actually don\u2019t <em>want</em> those guys to retire. I just want to be better than them. I\u2019m not sitting at home and thinking, \u2018OK, I still have, what, two, three years until they retire, and then I\u2019m going to take over tennis.\u2019 No, that\u2019s not how it is.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIf we just wait for them to retire, all we\u2019re going to hear for the rest of our careers is, \u2018Yeah, but those guys were better than you.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be the No 1 in the world because other people aren\u2019t playing. I want to be No 1 because I\u2019m better than everybody else.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The tennis player Alexander Zverev has blue eyes and shaggy blond hair and is 6ft 7in tall. His legs are stilts, and his face, journalists have pointed out, is that of an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model. Zverev actually has a modelling contract with Zegna, the Italian fashion brand, partly because he is a well-known tennis player, but also because he looks less like a tennis player and more like a luxury clothes horse. Zverev is 22. He joined the pro circuit in 2013, when he was 16. At the end of 2018, he was ranked the fourth best men\u2019s tennis player in the world, behind Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer \u2013 the big three \u2013 but ahead of younger challengers. He\u2019d recently won the ATP Finals, in London, the so-called fifth grand slam, becoming the youngest player to win the tournament in a decade. As a kid he\u2019d been the world junior No 1 and a junior grand slam champion. For years, fans had thought of him as tennis\u2019s crown prince \u2013 the prodigal heir. Both Nadal and Djokovic had hinted at Zverev becoming their eventual successor. Here, finally, after the failed attempts of other once up-and-coming players, was a talent poised to dethrone the game\u2019s elder greats. At the end of one 2018 tournament, Boris Becker announced: \u201cA star has arrived.\u201d For a while, life was good. Life was trouble-free! Zverev would appear at tournaments, project supreme self-confidence, absorb any and all stress (\u201cPressure is a privilege,\u201d he says, in that throwaway, sportsperson way), and rain down hard, flat serves at 140mph. And then, just like that, the narrative flipped. In January last year, Zverev broke up with his agent, Patricio Apey, a former player, with whom Zverev had worked since he was 15. (What began as a tiff evolved into a protracted legal battle, which is ongoing, even now.) Then, in short order, he separated from his girlfriend, the Russian player Olya Sharypova; his father, himself a former pro, as well as Zverev\u2019s long-time coach, fell ill and returned home to Germany, where Zverev grew up; and he endured a strange period in which Ivan Lendl was technically hired as his coach, but often failed to turn up to his games. For a while last year, Zverev didn\u2019t have a coach. Pro tennis players often arrive at tournaments with an almighty entourage. At two competitions in 2019, Zverev appeared alone. During the first half of the 2019 season, Zverev\u2019s performances teetered, then collapsed over the edge. He lost in the second round at Indian Wells, in March. He lost at a competition in Miami (first round, same month), against a player ranked 155 in the world. And then in Marrakech (second round), Monte Carlo (second round), Barcelona (first round), Rome (first round) and Stuttgart (first round). Zverev had been tipped to win competitions, not spill out of opening rounds. But what had once seemed so easy \u2013 the winning \u2013 all of a sudden became very hard. You couldn\u2019t call it a slump, really. In six months, he barely won. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine Zverev suffering a kind of crisis. His self-belief wavered. He became dejected and impetuous and difficult to be around. At Wimbledon, last July, he lost in the first round to the Czech qualifier Jiri Vesely (wily journeyman, rank 124). After the game, Zverev slunk into a press conference. His hair was roughly tousled and his blue eyes dulled \u2013 a surly, sorry wreck. \u201cI\u2019m not very high on confidence right now,\u201d he said, and then, for emphasis: \u201cMy confidence is below zero.\u201d When a reporter asked why, Zverev replied: \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t won much this year,\u201d and looked away in disgust. But then he elaborated a little. \u201cI get down on myself a lot,\u201d he said, before alluding to personal problems. When he later mentioned he might need a break from the game, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear if he meant a holiday, or if he planned to walk away from tennis and never come back. I meet Zverev in a busy hotel restaurant in central London. It\u2019s a Tuesday in November, mid-morning. He has arrived in head-to-toe tracksuit, shaggy hair, wiry, not powerfully built, tall enough for people to make a big deal of his height. Around us, staff are clearing away breakfast things.

Everything a manager has to do, I had to do myself.\u201d He says this in the most straightforward way \u2013 a kind of it is what it is \u2013 and then he describes, plainly and rationally, a months-long period during which he performed several different jobs all at once: the job of being a player, and a manager, and a coach, and an assistant, and a second assistant, booking hotel rooms, thrashing out contracts, playing at tournaments, registering for new tournaments, liaising with lawyers, liaising with tour officials, practising, calling in gear. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody to do the little things,\u201d he says. Like respond to emails. So many emails! \u201cYou know, doing that every week, it\u2019s not easy, concentration-wise.\u201d These days, an athlete\u2019s life is managed almost entirely by other people.

And then he announced, to himself more than anyone else, that if he continued to play so poorly he\u2019d finish his season early and go again in 2020. \u201cThat loosened me up a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me not think about anything.\u201d He relaxed into the routines he developed early in his career, when he arrived at tournaments hopeful, but not expecting to win. \u201cI was just, like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to enjoy playing the best players in the world, enjoy being out here, hopefully give myself the best chances to win matches.\u2019\u201d The pressure lifted. \u201cThe thing is, there\u2019s nobody in the world that puts more pressure on myself than me.\u201d And he grew up, maybe, though: \u201cIt\u2019s never nice to say about yourself that you\u2019ve grown up.\u201d But letting go isn\u2019t the full story. In August, Zverev signed papers with a new management company, Team8, a firm established by Roger Federer. (Zverev did not organise this interview, his new publicist did.) His father recovered and returned to the tour \u2013 a calming presence. And he began dating the German supermodel Brenda Patea, who now appears in Zverev\u2019s Instagram feed \u2013 modern love \u2013 and who is as leggy and good-looking as he is. Slowly, a kind of stability returned. Whatever personal and professional foundations crumbled at the beginning of last year \u2013 no management, no support staff, no partner \u2013 Zverev has painstakingly rebuilt, brick by brick. So yes, he \u201clet go\u201d. He thought less about things. He relaxed. He took the pressure off. And it helped. But he did that only because he\u2019d once again formed a loyal supporting staff, which provided him the opportunity to. Which is what it means to grow up, isn\u2019t it? Realising you can\u2019t do everything yourself. Maybe because he\u2019s so tall, or maybe because he started playing tennis professionally at 14 and it seems like he\u2019s been on the circuit for years (which, technically, he has), people forget Zverev is just 22. \u201cOther people my age would be finishing college and trying to find a job.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t see himself as a young man. \u201cYou know, in my mind, I\u2019m not that young any more, and I need to start improving.\u201d It is his responsibility, he thinks, now that he\u2019s back to something close to his best, now that\u2019s he\u2019s let go, to fulfill his potential. \u201cThe other guys\u201d \u2013 Federer, Nadal, Djokovic \u2013 \u201chave been there for 20 years. They know how to get it done. They know what it takes to win. Are we going to take over at some point? Yes! We have to! They\u2019re not going to be there for ever\u2026 And anyway, I actually don\u2019t want those guys to retire. I just want to be better than them. I\u2019m not sitting at home and thinking, \u2018OK, I still have, what, two, three years until they retire, and then I\u2019m going to take over tennis.\u2019 No, that\u2019s not how it is.\u201d He adds: \u201cIf we just wait for them to retire, all we\u2019re going to hear for the rest of our careers is, \u2018Yeah, but those guys were better than you.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be the No 1 in the world because other people aren\u2019t playing. I want to be No 1 because I\u2019m better than everybody else.\u201d",

Indeed, space engineers have not planned so much activity \u2013 for both manned and robot projects \u2013 since the heady days of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. At last, humanity is returning to explore the heavens with renewed vigour.</p> <p>However, it is not just the US and Russia that are dominating this year\u2019s space agenda. India, Japan and China are all planning complex programmes and are vying to become space powers in their own rights. Their plans for 2020 include missions to the moon, Mars and the asteroids. At the same time, the US will inaugurate its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/03/nasa-invites-bids-from-firms-to-build-lunar-lander-for-2024-mission\" title=\"\">Artemis programme</a>, which will eventually lead to a series of manned deep-space missions and a space station that will orbit the moon later in the next decade. Europe will be closely involved in Artemis and will also send its first robot rover to Mars in 2020. For good measure, the United Arab Emirates plans to become a space power in 2020, with its own robot mission to the red planet.</p> <h2><strong>The moon</strong> </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d24e6fbed188ea0f2954997b6066171b90f803e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d24e6fbed188ea0f2954997b6066171b90f803e3/0_0_2968_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A proposed design for a Nasa Artemis programme ascent vehicle leaving the surface of the moon, separating from a descent vehicle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A proposed design for a Nasa Artemis programme ascent vehicle leaving the surface of the moon, separating from a descent vehicle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China aims to become the third nation to bring samples of lunar soil back to Earth in the wake of US and Soviet successes decades ago. Its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/03/china-probe-change-4-land-far-side-moon-basin-crater\" title=\"\">Chang\u2019e 5 robot mission</a> is scheduled to blast off from the Wenchang satellite launch centre in Hainan in late 2020. The purpose of the project \u2013 named after the Chinese moon goddess, Chang\u2019e \u2013 is to collect about 2kg of lunar rocks and return them to Earth. A robot lander will scoop samples into an ascent vehicle, which will be blasted into space to dock automatically with a probe circling the moon. The samples will then be transferred to a capsule and fired back to Earth.</p> <p>It will be a highly complex business involving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/26/china-plans-bring-moon-rocks-earth-spacewatch\" title=\"\">several dockings and manoeuvres in orbit</a>. By contrast, the last robot lunar sample return \u2013 accomplished by the Soviet Union\u2019s 1976 Luna 24 mission \u2013 did so using a much simpler direct return. Chang\u2019e 5\u2019s more adventurous route is considered by many to be evidence that the Chinese are using the mission as a dress rehearsal for manned lunar landings in the near future.</p> <p>US scientists are also planning a moon mission late next year \u2013 but on an even grander scale. The first of the country\u2019s Orion capsules is scheduled for launch as part of an unmanned Artemis programme test flight. Orion will spend about three weeks in space, including six days orbiting the moon. The craft will have a complete life-support system and crew seats, but no crew. A European-built service module will play a key role in all Artemis missions. It will power Orion capsules after their launch from Nasa\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Future missions will be manned, however, with the ultimate aim being to land \u201cthe first woman and the next man\u201d on the moon by 2024.

In July and early August, Earth and Mars will be in their best positions for craft to be sent to the latter. Nasa will take advantage of this launch window with its Mars 2020 rover, which will seek evidence that Mars was a place where water flowed and life could have evolved. It will also search for signs of ancient microbial life.</p> <p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\" title=\"\">Mars 2020</a> will also mark the beginning of a highly ambitious, decade-long Martian exploration programme. The robot rover will drill for samples of the most promising rocks. It will place these in metal tubes, seal them and leave them in caches at designated sites on the planet\u2019s surface. These caches will be collected by future joint European and US missions and brought back to Earth \u2013 by around 2030. About 500g of rock will be returned for scrutiny in laboratories across the world, which should transform our knowledge about past conditions on Mars.</p> <p>The design of the Mars 2020 rover is based on Nasa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/06/mars-curiosity-rover-nasa-perfect-landing\" title=\"\">successful Curiosity vehicle</a> but has been upgraded with higher-resolution colour navigation cameras, an extra computer \u201cbrain\u201d for processing images and making maps, and more sophisticated auto-navigation software.</p> <p>In addition, Europe will send its own robot rover to Mars this year. In late July or early August, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/mar/14/exomars-mars-exploration-mission-begins-with-proton-rocket-launches-in-kazakhstan-video\" title=\"\">Russian Proton rocket</a> will blast a relatively small robot vehicle to Mars as part of the European Space Agency\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/15/exomars-race-against-time-to-launch-troubled-europe-mission-to-mars\" title=\"\">ExoMars project</a>. The rover is British built and has been named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/23/sexism-in-science-did-watson-and-crick-really-steal-rosalind-franklins-data\" title=\"\">Rosalind Franklin</a> after the UK DNA pioneer. Using a drill able to penetrate two metres below the surface, it will retrieve material that has been shielded from the intense radiation that bombards Mars and which may contain evidence of past and possibly even present life on the planet. (Mars 2020 will not be able to drill this deep.)</p> <p>However, ExoMars has already been delayed by technical problems, and recent failures of its parachute system in trials have caused real concerns for engineers who fear they might have to delay the mission further. Improved chute systems \u2013 which will slow the craft down before retro-rockets eventually land the probe, gently, on Mars after its nine-month space journey \u2013 are being tested. It is too early to know whether they will be ready for this summer\u2019s launch, however. \u201cIt is going to be very tight getting the probe ready,\u201d says ExoMars\u2019s manager, Pietro Baglioni. \u201cI think we have only a 50-50 chance that we will be able to go ahead as scheduled.\u201d ExoMars\u2019s next launch window would then be in 2022.</p> <p>For good measure, China also plans to send a probe to Mars in 2020. It has tried before to reach the red planet \u2013 in partnership with Russia. However, the Russian spaceship that was carrying China\u2019s Yinghuo-1 probe crashed in January 2012. After that, China started its own Mars exploration programme and has completed a crucial landing test in northern Hebei province. Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, said the lander went through a series of tests at a sprawling site littered with small mounds of rocks to simulate Mars\u2019s terrain.</p> <p>The Chinese probe, Huoxing-1, will deploy an orbiter that will circle Mars and a rover that will drop on to the planet\u2019s surface.

      "bodyText": "Space missions of a startling variety and ambition are scheduled for launch this year. Indeed, space engineers have not planned so much activity \u2013 for both manned and robot projects \u2013 since the heady days of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. At last, humanity is returning to explore the heavens with renewed vigour. However, it is not just the US and Russia that are dominating this year\u2019s space agenda. India, Japan and China are all planning complex programmes and are vying to become space powers in their own rights. Their plans for 2020 include missions to the moon, Mars and the asteroids. At the same time, the US will inaugurate its Artemis programme, which will eventually lead to a series of manned deep-space missions and a space station that will orbit the moon later in the next decade. Europe will be closely involved in Artemis and will also send its first robot rover to Mars in 2020. For good measure, the United Arab Emirates plans to become a space power in 2020, with its own robot mission to the red planet. The moon China aims to become the third nation to bring samples of lunar soil back to Earth in the wake of US and Soviet successes decades ago. Its Chang\u2019e 5 robot mission is scheduled to blast off from the Wenchang satellite launch centre in Hainan in late 2020. The purpose of the project \u2013 named after the Chinese moon goddess, Chang\u2019e \u2013 is to collect about 2kg of lunar rocks and return them to Earth. A robot lander will scoop samples into an ascent vehicle, which will be blasted into space to dock automatically with a probe circling the moon. The samples will then be transferred to a capsule and fired back to Earth. It will be a highly complex business involving several dockings and manoeuvres in orbit. By contrast, the last robot lunar sample return \u2013 accomplished by the Soviet Union\u2019s 1976 Luna 24 mission \u2013 did so using a much simpler direct return. Chang\u2019e 5\u2019s more adventurous route is considered by many to be evidence that the Chinese are using the mission as a dress rehearsal for manned lunar landings in the near future. US scientists are also planning a moon mission late next year \u2013 but on an even grander scale. The first of the country\u2019s Orion capsules is scheduled for launch as part of an unmanned Artemis programme test flight. Orion will spend about three weeks in space, including six days orbiting the moon. The craft will have a complete life-support system and crew seats, but no crew. A European-built service module will play a key role in all Artemis missions. It will power Orion capsules after their launch from Nasa\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Future missions will be manned, however, with the ultimate aim being to land \u201cthe first woman and the next man\u201d on the moon by 2024. A manned space station in lunar orbit, called Lunar Gateway, is also planned. In addition, India is to send a new lander mission to the moon in November: Chandrayaan-3. It will attempt what its predecessor failed to achieve. Chandrayaan-2 was India\u2019s first attempt at a lunar touchdown, but its main lander craft and robot rover crashed after a communication failure. Mars The fourth rock from the sun will become a focus of attention for space engineers this year. In July and early August, Earth and Mars will be in their best positions for craft to be sent to the latter. Nasa will take advantage of this launch window with its Mars 2020 rover, which will seek evidence that Mars was a place where water flowed and life could have evolved. It will also search for signs of ancient microbial life. Mars 2020 will also mark the beginning of a highly ambitious, decade-long Martian exploration programme. The robot rover will drill for samples of the most promising rocks. It will place these in metal tubes, seal them and leave them in caches at designated sites on the planet\u2019s surface. These caches will be collected by future joint European and US missions and brought back to Earth \u2013 by around 2030. About 500g of rock will be returned for scrutiny in laboratories across the world, which should transform our knowledge about past conditions on Mars. The design of the Mars 2020 rover is based on Nasa\u2019s successful Curiosity vehicle but has been upgraded with higher-resolution colour navigation cameras, an extra computer \u201cbrain\u201d for processing images and making maps, and more sophisticated auto-navigation software. In addition, Europe will send its own robot rover to Mars this year. In late July or early August, a Russian Proton rocket will blast a relatively small robot vehicle to Mars as part of the European Space Agency\u2019s ExoMars project. The rover is British built and has been named Rosalind Franklin after the UK DNA pioneer. Using a drill able to penetrate two metres below the surface, it will retrieve material that has been shielded from the intense radiation that bombards Mars and which may contain evidence of past and possibly even present life on the planet. (Mars 2020 will not be able to drill this deep.) However, ExoMars has already been delayed by technical problems, and recent failures of its parachute system in trials have caused real concerns for engineers who fear they might have to delay the mission further. Improved chute systems \u2013 which will slow the craft down before retro-rockets eventually land the probe, gently, on Mars after its nine-month space journey \u2013 are being tested. It is too early to know whether they will be ready for this summer\u2019s launch, however. \u201cIt is going to be very tight getting the probe ready,\u201d says ExoMars\u2019s manager, Pietro Baglioni. \u201cI think we have only a 50-50 chance that we will be able to go ahead as scheduled.\u201d ExoMars\u2019s next launch window would then be in 2022. For good measure, China also plans to send a probe to Mars in 2020. It has tried before to reach the red planet \u2013 in partnership with Russia. However, the Russian spaceship that was carrying China\u2019s Yinghuo-1 probe crashed in January 2012. After that, China started its own Mars exploration programme and has completed a crucial landing test in northern Hebei province. Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, said the lander went through a series of tests at a sprawling site littered with small mounds of rocks to simulate Mars\u2019s terrain. The Chinese probe, Huoxing-1, will deploy an orbiter that will circle Mars and a rover that will drop on to the planet\u2019s surface. The mission will be launched in July or August with a Long March 5 heavy lift-off rocket. Again, the aim is to find evidence of current and past life on Mars. Not to be outdone, the United Arab Emirates plans to launch its first deep-space probe, the Hope Mars Mission, which has been built by the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre in partnership with the University of Colorado and Arizona State University. The robot spacecraft will study the Martian climate and try to understand why the planet has experienced drastic climate changes. Asteroids Nasa\u2019s Osiris-Rex, which launched in 2016, is currently orbiting Bennu, a small, spheroidal asteroid with a diameter of about 520 metres, made of carbon-rich rock \u2013 a material that scientists believe is representative of the cloud of swirling gas and dust from which the solar system formed 4.6bn years ago. This summer, Osiris-Rex will sweep close to Bennu\u2019s surface, extend a robot arm and release a puff of gas that will send pieces of rock and dust flying up from the surface \u2013 and into a collection tube. The spacecraft will then start its journey home, releasing a container with samples of asteroid inside as it nears Earth in September 2023, so that the container drops on to the Utah desert. However, Osiris-Rex is likely to be pipped at the post in its attempt to return pieces of asteroid to Earth by Japan\u2019s Hayabusa2 mission. It met with the near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu in June 2018 and began surveying it for a year and a half before taking samples that it is now carrying back to Earth. The probe \u2013 and its cargo \u2013 are expected to reach Earth in late 2020. Commercial launches Private firms are playing an increasingly important role in reducing the cost of space travel, and this year the first astronauts are likely to fly on board commercial spacecraft. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is set to launch Crew Dragon, its first manned mission, early this year. An unmanned version docked with the International Space Station in March 2019. If successful, SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon is likely to become one of the main ways that US astronauts travel to and from the space station. At present, they fly with Russia\u2019s Soyuz spacecraft after the US\u2019s main launcher, the space shuttle, was retired in 2011.

Roman Griffin Davis plays the 10-year-old growing up under the Third Reich, whose jolly dreams of becoming an Aryan war hero are thwarted by his innate sensitivity and squeamishness. Nicknamed Jojo Rabbit after failing to strangle a bunny when ordered to do so at a Nazi youth training camp, our antihero promptly blows himself up with a hand grenade, rendering him unfit for future combat. Instead, he\u2019s assigned more menial tasks, including handing out recruitment leaflets, spurred on by visions of his imaginary F\u00fchrer friend.</p> <p>Beneath the fanaticism, Jojo is a frightened boy whose sister has died and whose father has disappeared in battle. But his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), has a secret: she\u2019s a covert anti-fascist who is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/20/leave-no-traces-thomasin-mckenzie-the-bees-have-left-the-deepest-mark-on-me\" title=\"\"><em>Leave No Trace</em></a> star Thomasin McKenzie), in the attic. When Jojo stumbles upon Elsa, he is initially horrified, believing her to be a monster.

He also commented that my facial expression while he was describing his forthcoming movie was \u201ckind of confusion, and sort of fear, disgust and doubt; a lot of doubt \u2013 which is probably the expression that I have on <em>my</em> face when I talk about it\u2026\u201d</p> <p>That sense of doubt was not dispelled by the finished film, which, although clearly sincere in its intentions, is neither sharp nor funny enough to cut to the heart of its subject matter. Whereas Waititi\u2019s 2016 gem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/18/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-review-unpolished-charm\" title=\"\"><em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em></a> transformed Barry Crump\u2019s novel <em>Wild Pork and Watercress</em> into a note-perfect blend of screen comedy, tragedy and pathos, <em>Jojo Rabbit</em> struggles to achieve the same seamless intertwining of light and dark. It\u2019s not just that the intended interplay between corruption and innocence fails to hit that sweet spot through which great art can transform unspeakable subject matter into something magically accessible; it\u2019s more that the general tone borders all too often on the bland \u2013 a fatal flaw.</p> <p>There are positives. Sam Rockwell has fun with the role of Captain Klenzendorf, a drunk would-be warrior taken away from the battlefield by the loss of an eye, now apparently resigned to absurd, humiliating defeat; and McKenzie manages to inject a sense of gravitas into the key role of Elsa, even when the script gives her precious little to work with.</p> <p>I suspect the strangely good-natured feel of the film will win the hearts of many viewers, but my own head remained too muddled by its uneven and oddly indecisive approach to embrace whatever quirky virtues it may possess.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL4McUzXfFI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tL4McUzXfFI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL4McUzXfFI\">Watch the official trailer of JoJo Rabbit</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Instead, he\u2019s assigned more menial tasks, including handing out recruitment leaflets, spurred on by visions of his imaginary F\u00fchrer friend. Beneath the fanaticism, Jojo is a frightened boy whose sister has died and whose father has disappeared in battle. But his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), has a secret: she\u2019s a covert anti-fascist who is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa (Leave No Trace star Thomasin McKenzie), in the attic. When Jojo stumbles upon Elsa, he is initially horrified, believing her to be a monster. But gradually the pair strike up a love-hate relationship that infuriates Imaginary Adolf and causes Jojo to start to rethink his allegiances. From early scenes audaciously intercutting Triumph of the Will footage with the German Beatlemania sounds of Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand (other playfully anachronistic pop tunes include Tom Waits\u2019s I Don\u2019t Wanna Grow Up and David Bowie\u2019s Helden), to later interludes in which Imaginary Adolf acts more like a petulant schoolboy than a murderous dictator, Waititi strives to capture young Jojo\u2019s wide-eyed point of view. There\u2019s a distant echo here of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, another 12-certificate film that looked at the horrors of nazism from the perspective of children. But Mark Herman\u2019s adaptation of John Boyne\u2019s novel had an altogether clearer agenda, leaving the audience in no doubt as to the purpose of the drama. In a podcast interview that I recorded with Waititi toward the end of 2018, he described Jojo Rabbit (which he was then editing) as a \u201cstrange art comedy\u201d that ventured into \u201cdangerous waters\u201d. He also commented that my facial expression while he was describing his forthcoming movie was \u201ckind of confusion, and sort of fear, disgust and doubt; a lot of doubt \u2013 which is probably the expression that I have on my face when I talk about it\u2026\u201d That sense of doubt was not dispelled by the finished film, which, although clearly sincere in its intentions, is neither sharp nor funny enough to cut to the heart of its subject matter. Whereas Waititi\u2019s 2016 gem Hunt for the Wilderpeople transformed Barry Crump\u2019s novel Wild Pork and Watercress into a note-perfect blend of screen comedy, tragedy and pathos, Jojo Rabbit struggles to achieve the same seamless intertwining of light and dark. It\u2019s not just that the intended interplay between corruption and innocence fails to hit that sweet spot through which great art can transform unspeakable subject matter into something magically accessible; it\u2019s more that the general tone borders all too often on the bland \u2013 a fatal flaw. There are positives. Sam Rockwell has fun with the role of Captain Klenzendorf, a drunk would-be warrior taken away from the battlefield by the loss of an eye, now apparently resigned to absurd, humiliating defeat; and McKenzie manages to inject a sense of gravitas into the key role of Elsa, even when the script gives her precious little to work with. I suspect the strangely good-natured feel of the film will win the hearts of many viewers, but my own head remained too muddled by its uneven and oddly indecisive approach to embrace whatever quirky virtues it may possess.",

While the UK still lags behind some European countries \u2013 particularly for fast chargers \u2013 we will simply have to sort out the charging infrastructure to match the numbers being driven,\u201d he says. Not everyone is so sure. Shaw is adamant we should be focusing on other ways to get around. \u201cElectric vehicles do not solve congestion or all our air-quality problems \u2013 the suggestion they do is incredibly misleading,\u201d she says. \u201cFundamentally, we need to change the way we travel. The new government needs to prioritise active travel to tackle unacceptable road danger, climate change, toxic levels of air pollution and the health crisis due to sedentary lifestyles. \u201cOur towns and cities should be places where walking is the natural choice for local, every-day journeys and blocking up pavements with EV charging points and cables flies in the face of that.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Underneath our skins, we are all Africans. That is the recent, simple conclusion of scientists studying the origins of our species. Genes, ancient stone tools and fossil bones \u2013 analysed over the past few decades \u2013 make it clear that men and women today are the direct descendants of hunter-gatherers who evolved somewhere in Africa and took over the continent before one group departed to conquer the rest of the world tens of thousands of years ago.</p> <p>Where exactly in Africa we first appeared has never been established, however. Some researchers have argued that the cradle of humankind lay in the east, in Ethiopia or Kenya. Others have put their money on South Africa. But most were sure it would only be a matter of time before our species\u2019 birthplace was pinpointed: perhaps on land covering a huge estuary that once groaned with fish or near a vast slice of savannah rich with game. It was here, in some Stone Age paradise, that our more primitive predecessors honed their intellectual and cultural skills and were transformed into <em>Homo sapiens</em>, a species of primate notable for its rounded skull, small face, prominent chin, advanced tools, high intelligence and sophisticated culture.</p> <p>It is a neat picture. However, in recent years cracks have begun to appear in this simple image of our distant past, mainly because plausible candidates for our birthplace have proved hard to find. As a result, a growing number of researchers are turning away from the idea that such an Arcadia existed. As the Harvard geneticist David Reich has put it: \u201cWhen it comes to human ancestry, there was no Garden of Eden.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, archaeologists, fossil experts and geneticists are backing a dramatic new idea to explain the evolution of <em>Homo sapiens</em>. They say a multitude of different places in Africa acted as the cradle of modern humankind. We did not appear in one place and then spread. Instead we constantly evolved for almost half a million years across the sprawling vastness of the continent.</p> <p>Chris Stringer, of the Natural History Museum, London, explains. \u201cThe immediate predecessors of modern humans probably arose in Africa about 500,000 years ago and evolved into separate populations,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen times were bad \u2013 for example, when the Sahara was arid, as it is now \u2013 you would get little isolated pockets of humans clinging on to existence. Some of these people would have gone extinct. Others managed to hang on.\u201d</p> <p>Later, when conditions improved \u2013 for instance, when the Sahara became green again and lakes and rivers formed \u2013 surviving populations expanded and came into contact with each other. When they did, they would have exchanged ideas \u2013 and genes. Then the climate would have turned grim again and they would have separated.</p> <p>\u201cThis happened over and over again in different places for different reasons for the next 400,000 years,\u201d adds Stringer. \u201cThe end product was <em>Homo sapiens</em>, the species that is more or less the version of modern humanity that now inhabits every continent on Earth.\u201d</p> <p>This point is backed by Eleanor Scerri, of the University of Oxford. \u201c<em>Homo sapiens</em> probably descended from a set of interlinked groups of people, who were separated and connected at different times. Each one had different combinations of physical features, with their own mix of ancestral and modern traits.\u201d</p> <p>Normally, animals that spread across a continent tend to split into different sub-species and eventually evolve into completely new species. In the case of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, however, something very different happened. We kept connections, probably because of our species\u2019 propensity for long-range social networking, and instead evolved slowly but en masse across Africa.</p> <p>In other words, our socialising strongly influenced the course of our evolution, a point emphasised by geneticist Mark Thomas of University College London. He argues that culture \u2013 the accumulation of knowledge, beliefs and values in a society or tribe \u2013 has been vital to our survival. \u201cWithout culture we would be dead,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know things today that were worked out by ancestors tens of thousands of years ago and have been passed along over the generations. Culture is our life-support system.\u201d </p> <p>One reason for the previous belief that humanity had a single place of origin can be traced to the work of early molecular biologists, such as Allan Wilson of the University of California, Berkeley. In 1987, his team used gene analysis to study mitochondrial DNA, a form of genetic material inherited solely from mothers.</p> <p>By comparing variations in the mitochondrial DNA of individuals selected from around the globe, Wilson was able to create a giant family tree for humanity, one that put its roots firmly in Africa. However, Wilson went further. He argued that this genetic tree could be traced back, not just to one group of <em>Homo sapiens</em> but to a single mother, a mitochondrial matriarch who gave rise to our entire species.</p> <p>The notion that there was an African Eve was highly influential. If there was a single mother for humanity, then she must have lived somewhere and so the notion arose that there was a specific place that was our homeland. Over the decades, many contenders were put forward as sites that might have been the cradle of humankind, including a recent suggestion by scientists who claimed mitochondrial DNA indicated humanity\u2019s roots could be traced to Botswana.</p> <p>Many researchers no longer believe these simple explanations, however, and point to other studies that appear to confound them. For example, analyses of the Y-chromosome, which determines maleness in humans and is therefore inherited solely through the male line, suggest that modern humanity probably originated in west Africa \u2013 because the greatest variation in the DNA of the human Y-chromosome is found there, and variations in DNA tend to increase as time passes.</p> <p>In this way, the rather odd situation arises where our African Eve inhabited one part of the continent while her Adam appeared in a different, distant part of the continent. Not a good way to start a dynasty, one would have thought.</p> <p>And then there is the human skull. The oldest rounded, modern, humanlike skull has been found in Ethiopia. At the same time, the oldest symbolic expression in terms of engraving and art is found in Blombas cave in South Africa while the most ancient symbolic burials are found at the other end of the continent, just outside Africa in Israel, where in one case, a 100,000-year-old grave has been found to contain a body adorned with deer antlers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f738f3f23c2ebbc992de5b0f44dda0729357737\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f738f3f23c2ebbc992de5b0f44dda0729357737/0_0_2322_1393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A skull found in the Qafzeh cave in Israal, among the earliest Eurasian homo sapiens to be found.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A skull found in the Qafzeh cave in Israal, among the earliest Eurasian homo sapiens to be found.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Natural History Museum/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is no evidence at all that one single part of Africa produced all this modern behaviour,\u201d says Stringer.</p> <p>Instead, it is argued that for much of our existence, different groups of humans displayed some but not all of this constellation of features before they were slowly shared as our social networks broadened. As peoples mixed, they picked up biological and behavioural solutions that had already been tested by other populations.</p> <p>Slowly, success built upon success and modern humanity emerged in all its glory and sophistication. There was no sudden breakthrough among a set of people who acquired symbolic thought, hairlessness and art in a single evolutionary event. It was more a matter of mutual exchange of intellectual and genetic attributes over great distances and long periods of time.</p> <p>A major problem in understanding this notion comes from the fact that ancestry is so often explained in terms of trees, either as a family tree or of an evolutionary tree that charts how species arise from others. They have single trunks that divide into branches and focus thoughts toward single origins.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful metaphor but it also turns out to be a deeply mistaken one,\u201d says anthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in an article for the science newsletter <em>Aeon</em>. Instead he argues that our evolutionary history is more like a braided river, a band of streams that weave into and out of each other before eventually merging over hundreds of thousands of years into the same huge channel.</p> <p>However, a note of caution is sounded by geneticist Pontus Skoglund at the Francis Crick Institute in London. \u201cWe have to be careful, for we are talking about events that occurred hundreds of thousands of years ago. The trouble is we only have ancient DNA from fossils that are a few thousand years old. That makes it difficult to be completely certain about how populations interacted in those distant days. We need more evidence.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There must have been dozens of long-lasting populations. Many more are out there, waiting for anthropologists to unearth them</p> <footer> <cite>Prof John Hawks, University of Wisconsin-Madison</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This point is acknowledged by Stringer. \u201cThe problem with DNA is that it starts to break down after death, and that the warmer the conditions the quicker that process happens,\u201d he says. For parts of the world where it is relatively cool, for example in Europe or in deep caves, that is not a problem. DNA that is hundreds of thousands of year old has been found in these places, extracted and studied. But in Africa heat is a real problem.</p> <p>\u201cIt restricts the kind of evidence we can gather,\u201d adds Stringer. \u201cWe are like the proverbial drunk who has dropped his keys in the street but can only look where the street lamp is shining \u2013 because that is the only place where he can see \u2013 even though his keys are in the dark. We are restricted in where we can look. We have to bear that in mind.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless Stringer and other supporters of the pan-African theory of human evolution are confident this completely new way of looking at our species\u2019s appearance in Africa will bring fresh insights into the development of human societies, not just in the past 500,000 years but back to the point seven million years ago when the lineage that led to <em>Homo sapiens</em> separated from other primate lineages in Africa.</p> <p>\u201cWhat inspires most about the braided stream of our origins is what it implies for future discoveries,\u201d says Hawks. \u201cAcross the seven million years or more of hominin evolution, there must have been dozens of such long-lasting populations, sometimes mixing and sharing adaptations with each other. Many more are out there, waiting for anthropologists to unearth them.\u201d</p> <h2>The birth of art</h2> <p>A few weeks ago, researchers announced they had made a startling discovery on the Indonesian island of South Sulawesi: a wall-painting depicting humans and animals. Using a technique known as uranium-thorium dating, the Australian and Indonesian scientists showed the work was about 44,000 years old, the oldest known cave art created by our species.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51302d78881fac873423bd6d41d4ca16480d64f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51302d78881fac873423bd6d41d4ca16480d64f0/276_0_1582_949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the South Sulawesi paintings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the South Sulawesi paintings</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxime Aubert/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The painting consists of six mammals \u2013 two Sulawesi warty pigs and four dwarf buffaloes \u2013 and several human-like figures, one with the head of a bird, another with a tail. The images suggest a myth or legend is unfolding on the cave wall.</p> <p>\u201cIt has all the key elements of modern human cognition: a narrative scene and human-like figures that don\u2019t really exist in the real world,\u201d says Professor Maxime Aubert, at Australia\u2019s Griffith University. \u201cEverything is there by 44,000 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>South Sulawesi is thousands of miles from Europe, home of virtually all other palaeolithic rock art. And that formidable geographical gap is important. In Europe, the magnificently depicted mammoths, lions and rhinos of the Lascaux, Chauvet, and Altamira caverns show something special was going on in the heads of their creators. They were thinking symbolically by letting one thing, daubs of paint, stand for another: an animal. These artists were infusing their lives with meaning beyond basic impulses to survive.</p> <p>Such obvious sophistication has led some scientists to conclude early Europeans were, intellectually, more gifted than other members of early <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Perhaps a genetic mutation occurred in their brains as they first entered the continent from Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81de0c77154d2a2a84919e86184616ad0f1c727a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81de0c77154d2a2a84919e86184616ad0f1c727a/0_2_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the Lascaux cave paintings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the Lascaux cave paintings.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Aventurier/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Always controversial, the notion has now been firmly quashed by the Sulawesi cave dating. Its art is 10,000 years older than Lascaux\u2019s or Altamira\u2019s but it is just as sophisticated.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that cave art began in Europe has very clearly been shown to be wrong,\u201d says Stringer.</p> <p>In other words, Homo sapiens reached its capacity for symbolic thinking, storytelling and abstract thought long before we arrived in Europe 40,000 years ago. Neurologically we were already fully armed and had been so for a long time before we emerged from an African homeland 70,000 years ago to take over the world. These were the abilities that had been honed for hundreds of thousands of years across the length and breadth of Africa.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2020.

Perhaps a genetic mutation occurred in their brains as they first entered the continent from Africa. Always controversial, the notion has now been firmly quashed by the Sulawesi cave dating. Its art is 10,000 years older than Lascaux\u2019s or Altamira\u2019s but it is just as sophisticated. \u201cThe idea that cave art began in Europe has very clearly been shown to be wrong,\u201d says Stringer. In other words, Homo sapiens reached its capacity for symbolic thinking, storytelling and abstract thought long before we arrived in Europe 40,000 years ago. Neurologically we were already fully armed and had been so for a long time before we emerged from an African homeland 70,000 years ago to take over the world. These were the abilities that had been honed for hundreds of thousands of years across the length and breadth of Africa. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2020.

To find out if they can chip away at the Black Caps tomorrow, join me and Adam Collins right here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f30f8222d4e2dc6130dc2ab4e28f8a4aec24a79a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30f8222d4e2dc6130dc2ab4e28f8a4aec24a79a/0_0_4020_2437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SCG\" width=\"1000\" height=\"606\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The SCG enjoyed a spin bowling masterclass from Nathan Lyon on day three of the third Test.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Ng/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T07:12:20.730Z\">at 7.12am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1188db8f08c39722644fad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T07:01:32.007Z\">7.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>16th over: Australia 40-0 (Warner 23, Burns 16) </strong>It might be the fag end of a long old day but Neil Wagner isn\u2019t giving anything away.

I don\u2019t know how many more instances of this we need to see before the ICC look at investing in specialist television umpires. It completely undermines DRS more broadly when this keeps happening. They could take care of the front line as well, which became a big issue at Cape Town during South Africa\u2019s innings overnight, Broad shown to have overstepped when finding van der Dussen\u2019s edge. The broadcaster then proved the umpires weren\u2019t looking for it as multiple instances were highlighted of no-balls going uncalled.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s your daily report from the SCG. Australia reasserted their authority over the third Test on day three at the SCG. Nathan Lyon was the star, spinning his way to five wickets against a New Zealand batting order that contrived to lose wickets. A long slow day (one ending four overs shy of the required allotment despite lasting an extra half-hour) was made testing because this SCG pitch has all-but died. There is no bounce on offer to the pace bowlers, even with the new ball, and the game is increasingly a war of attrition. Australia are now the only side that can win, but they will want to give themselves plenty of time to bowl New Zealand out for a second time on such a docile surface. To find out if they can chip away at the Black Caps tomorrow, join me and Adam Collins right here. 16th over: Australia 40-0 (Warner 23, Burns 16) It might be the fag end of a long old day but Neil Wagner isn\u2019t giving anything away. He strains every sinew to chase down a lovely late cut from Warner, turning a certain four into a memorable three. Both teams do their best to waste time and ensure this is the final over the day. Umpire Erasmus is in no hurry either, and his dawdling confirms the close of play. Not a great sight for supposedly the pinnacle of the sport, especially considering the day was four overs short of a full complement of overs. Ah, cricket. 15th over: Australia 37-0 (Warner 20, Burns 16) Wagner bowls a maiden to Burns with the batsman unlucky not to pierce the field with some crisp strokes to largely line and length deliveries. The solitary bumper strikes the batsman on his back but umpire Erasmus - harshly in my opinion - signals dead ball, after two leg-byes had been jogged. 14th over: Australia 37-0 (Warner 20, Burns 16) This long, slow, hazy day is dribbling to a close. Somerville\u2019s latest over takes an age with fielding changes and further attention being paid to the stricken Blundell dragging proceedings out. Both batsmen nurdle singles as the crowd streams away from the SCG. 13th over: Australia 35-0 (Warner 19, Burns 15) After a couple of overs of tease Wagner goes back to his bodyline-lite approach. It almost pays dividends immediately when Warner fails to connect with a glance off his hip, but once the strike is rotated it\u2019s back to line and length, which Burns handles with aplomb. The New Zealand physio - who has been overworked all tour - is out again. Tom Blundell looks to have done himself a mischief fielding, possibly throwing his shoulder out of kilter, and Wagner is having some attention paid to his knee. 12th over: Australia 34-0 (Warner 18, Burns 15) More dodgy calling, and again Burns is diving full stretch to make his ground! This time it was a good decision to reject a second run after first turning and setting off for the other end. Following those scrapes he\u2019s uncomfortable on strike, inside-edging onto his pad then missing a sweep, but both instances end with Somerville looking forlorn. 11th over: Australia 33-0 (Warner 17, Burns 15) As expected, Wagner is back on immediately, and he settles into a conventional line and length to Burns from around the wicket. After an edgy start to the over Burns finds his timing and drives square through the off-side for three. Wagner moves over the wicket to Warner and hits the bat hard with his heavy ball, forcing the batsman to remove his bottom hand and shake it loose. Perhaps distracted by numb fingers Warner then tips and runs for a very tight single that invited calamity for his partner but the required direct hit did not materialise. 10th over: Australia 29-0 (Warner 16, Burns 12) Just the one over from Wagner (presumably he will switch ends) meaning Will Somerville comes into the attack for the first look at spin this innings. Burns allows him to get away with a couple of half-track looseners before finally whipping off his hip to rotate the strike. Warner tries to move his feet to engineer some runs but the angle into him from Somerville keeps things tight. 9th over: Australia 28-0 (Warner 16, Burns 11) Better from Henry, finding a probing line and length from around the wicket to Warner, and slipping in a skiddy bouncer for good measure that forced the batsman into evasive action. Maiden. 8th over: Australia 28-0 (Warner 16, Burns 11) First look at Wagner for the innings, and it will be fascinating to see how he attacks on this dead deck. Poorly, is the answer, at least to begin with. He opens on a regulation length and Warner trusts his eye to hit through the line for two then four, then one through the off-side. No bouncers whatsoever. Australia\u2019s pitch doctoring to combat New Zealand\u2019s strike weapon looks to have done the trick. Sorry - don\u2019t rise to my bait. 7th over: Australia 21-0 (Warner 9, Burns 11) Henry pulls his length back this over, and not to good effect. The genuine bouncer does not get up at all, but the wide long-hop does - and Burns slaps it through point for four. Hi Dan, presuming we\u2019re talking about this NZ line-up against this Australian attack, with the surface still to deteriorate over the next 24 hours... I\u2019d put 175 around evens, anything over 200 in Australia\u2019s favour, and anything over 250 practically out of the question. Australia\u2019s pace attack has too much control and Nathan Lyon is a proven wicket-taker in these conditions. That combination means by day five there\u2019s enough deliveries with a batsman\u2019s name on it, without enough run-scoring opportunities to put the pressure back on the fielding team. Now, give me India in a similar situation right now and I\u2019d probably add 50 or so to each of those brackets. 6th over: Australia 15-0 (Warner 8, Burns 6) CdG also finds that full length, allowing Warner to throw his hands at the ball without fear and collect two through extra cover. The remainder of the over, like so many passages of play to come, is pretty tepid with the 120kph bowler making run scoring awkward on this lifeless deck. 5th over: Australia 13-0 (Warner 6, Burns 6) The hittable length on this pitch now is very small and very full, and that\u2019s where Henry lands to Burns, inviting a drive in the V that the Australian opener executes to perfection. 4th over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 6, Burns 2) Maiden from CdG to Warner with the Australian unprepared to take unnecessary risks on a pitch proving increasingly difficult to trust. 3rd over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 6, Burns 2) Warner\u2019s in busy, hard-running mode, tipping and running against Henry to keep the game moving. The ball is barely bouncing out in the middle though, making scoring runs a heck of a challenge. 2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 5, Burns 2) Colin de Grandhomme shares the new ball for New Zealand and after Warner gets off the mark with a couple through the covers he does well to jam his bat down on a delivery that barely bounces. Warner quickly puts that scare to the back of his mind and clips three more runs wide of mid-on, allowing Burns on strike. The Queenslander also opens his account with a couple through point before he suffers his own pea-shooter, luckily for him, outside off stump. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Warner 0, Burns 0) Nice start from Henry. He raps Warner on the pads with one that cuts in from around the wicket, then forces him to take evasive action with a sharp bouncer. Ok, the players are back out. 70 minutes of play left in the day. A big hour ahead for Joe Burns. That\u2019s Nathan Lyon\u2019s 17th five-for. He now has five-wicket hauls against every Test side he has faced. Unsurprisingly, Australia have not enforced the follow-on. Lyon has his five-for! Henry looked composed at the crease despite his broken thumb but succumbs to some smart keeping from Tim Paine. The New Zealander took a stride forward to play a defensive stroke but the ball just rolled off the face of the bat, straight to Paine, who snaffled it quickly and whipped off the bails with the batsman still sliding his way down the pitch with his forward press, a cm or two outside his ground. 95th over: New Zealand 249-9 (Astle 25, Henry 1) Starc continues to direct his deliveries towards Henry\u2019s gloves but the tailender does well to get out of the way or block with his bat for four deliveries then pinches a leg-bye from the fifth. Astle then takes over, stepping to leg and swatting a four over long off like Chris Lynn in prime form. Kennedy poses an interesting question by email. Could this be allowed under ICC playing regulations? \u201cQuestion for the seasoned OBOers. Is anyone allowed to be a sub fielder? Could they auction an over of sub fielding out to who ever donates the most to the McGrath foundation?\u201d 94th over: New Zealand 244-9 (Astle 21, Henry 1) Astle has to take command now and he states his intention with a second ball four, lofting Lyon back over his head. He accepts a single from the proceeding delivery, handing Henry three balls to repel - which he does - and even (perhaps stupidly) runs a single from the last of the over to retain the strike. 93rd over: New Zealand 238-9 (Astle 16, Henry 0) Matt Henry, broken thumb and all, is out in the middle to join Todd Astle, and a compassionless Mitchell Starc targets the gloves from the off. Henry survives, just. Nathan Lyon now has 384 Tests wickets, that\u2019s one more than Ian Botham. Yeah, about Nathan Lyon... Neil Wagner is happy to dot one delivery, but not two. A massive heave across the line fails to connect with any leather and a stock delivery from around the wicket gently bumps into middle stump. Awful, awful batting. Speaking of Nathan Lyon... It takes just four deliveries with the new ball for the GOAT to bag his third wicket. There\u2019s precious little turn on offer with the hard Kookaburra but Somerville continues to play for it, fishing outside off for a while before Lyon adjusts his approach, straightens, and knocks back off stump. 91st over: New Zealand 237-7 (Astle 15, Somerville 0) Pattinson rolls his ankle a fraction during his over to Astle, and replays show the landing area for the fast bowler\u2019s front foot is very uneven indeed. Two from the over as New Zealand regroup and Australia plug away, waiting for Lyon to spin some more magic. 90th over: New Zealand 235-7 (Astle 13, Somerville 0) Astle and Somerville are far from the poorest nos. 8 &amp; 9 you\u2019ll find at Test level. The former has look assured for 50 balls already, the latter safely negotiates a Cummins maiden on a ground he knows well from his NSW days. This pitch is becoming a dead parrot sketch, so much so Cummins jokes that Tim Paine should put on a helmet and stand up to the stumps. 89th over: New Zealand 235-7 (Astle 13, Somerville 0) Pattinson replaces Starc for his first blast with the sort-of new ball, and he bowls a very sub-scontinental maiden, hitting good lines and lengths only to watch the ball pitch and die. 88th over: New Zealand 235-7 (Astle 13, Somerville 0) That was a terrific duel. Phillips rode his luck but showed he has the skill and temperament to prosper at Test level. Cummins demonstrated why he is the no.1 bowler in the world right now; relentless. Amen, Mango. The third ball of the innings goes the way of the second, into the midwicket boundary. Cummins has had no success with his short ball to Phillips and he gets the treatment again. The controlled swivel and wristy pull - fast becoming Phillips\u2019 trademark - brings up a debut 50. And then he\u2019s out. Line and length from Cummins, some nip back into the right-hander, through the gate, and it\u2019s all over red rover. Australia\u2019s insistence their second ball of the innings is flawed has paid dividends. A handsome NSW branded timber case has been brought out to allow umpire Erasmus to select a replacement. 87th over: New Zealand 231-6 (Phillips 48, Astle 13) A much better short ball from Starc forces Phillips into an ungainly shot, but one he still manages to roll his wrists over. Otherwise it\u2019s another over that demonstrates how this surface offers few demons with the pacemen operating with the new ball. It\u2019s all bit sub-continental, what with the hazy outlook and the fielding side waiting for some reverse swing or the return of Nathan Lyon. 86th over: New Zealand 229-6 (Phillips 47, Astle 12) The wind has picked up at the SCG, bringing with it an ominous gloom. That heavy atmosphere is reflected on-field where the dead pitch is leading to some attritional cricket. 85th over: New Zealand 227-6 (Phillips 46, Astle 11) New Zealand dab a couple of singles from Starc\u2019s latest over. Not much happening with this new ball either in the air or off the pitch. Channel Seven has coded the previous two overs before James Pattinson\u2019s no-ball dismissal of Glenn Phillips, and guess what - five uncalled no-balls! As soon as the no-ball was called Pattinson corrected immediately. How can this be allowed to continue? What a mess the ICC have created for themselves. 84th over: New Zealand 225-6 (Phillips 45, Astle 10) Blimey! Phillips goes back to his pull shot after almost perishing with it before tea, and this time he hammers it high over square leg for six! Pat Cummins is not often dismissed like that, but Phillips looked like vintage Ricky Ponting executing that stroke. That was the only scoring shot in an otherwise exemplary Cummins over. The short ball is no longer the bowler\u2019s friend on this dead SCG track. 83rd over: New Zealand 219-6 (Phillips 39, Astle 10) \u201cGood cricket all round\u201d says Ricky Ponting as play begins after tea with a nicely pitched in-swinger from Starc, met with a solid forward defensive stroke by Glenn Phillips. Starc attempts a similar delivery next ball but Phillips presents the full face of the bat to send a checked drive back past the non-striker for four. Four more from the next delivery, but with far less control. Starc this time catching the outside edge but the ball scoots through gully along the ground. And that prompts Starc to hand the ball to Aleem Dar to have it scrutinised! Is that a record? Three deliveries into a new ball and it\u2019s already being put through the handcuffs to check it\u2019s adequately spherical. The floodlights are starting to take effect at the SCG. It\u2019s a murky afternoon in Sydney with the smoke haze from the south and west starting to drift towards the eastern suburbs. Australia have taken the new ball. Mitchell Starc will have first use immediately after tea. There are 36 overs left to be bowled in the day, so we\u2019re likely to be playing through the extra half-hour allotted for teams for whom six hours isn\u2019t enough to send down 90 overs. But yeah, let\u2019s push for four-day Tests. Australia are in control of the third Test now after New Zealand disappointed during the afternoon session, losing three wickets, two in needless fashion. However, the home side still requires 14 more wickets to celebrate victory, a task that looks to be a grind on an SCG pitch that is dying by the hour. 82nd over: New Zealand 210-6 (Phillips 30, Astle 10) Still no new ball with Labuschagne given another over, and he almost jags a wicket with a beautiful leg-spinner that catches the outside edge of Astle\u2019s bat but squirts safely into the off-side. The inconsistency of the part-time option is then on display with a loose delivery down the leg-side helped on its way by Astle for four. 81st over: New Zealand 206-6 (Phillips 30, Astle 6) Australia persist with the old ball, for now, handing Nathan Lyon his 28th over. Todd Astle responds by skipping down the track and dumping a four straight back over the bowler\u2019s head. 80th over: New Zealand 201-6 (Phillips 30, Astle 1) Labuschagne gets another dart, in what may well be the final over with this ball. New Zealand negotiate it safely. All eyes on Aleem Dar - will he raise a shiny new Kookaburra over his head? 79th over: New Zealand 199-6 (Phillips 29, Astle 0) Pattinson only has himself to blame, but it will be interesting to follow the TV coverage and see if they identify a pattern of overstepping that was not called by the on-field umpires. Phillips, on debut as a consequence of the flu ravaging the New Zealand dressing room, has now been dropped twice and caught off a no-ball. Massive let-off for Phillips, but what on earth are New Zealand thinking? With three men out on the leg-side boundary he tries to pull James Pattinson on a surface with untrustworthy bounce and can only send the ball straight to Travis Head on the midwicket fence. But he is reprieved when replays show Pattinson has overstepped by a couple of millimetres. Another Test, another batsman called back after the fact. The ICC has got to get a handle on this. 78th over: New Zealand 197-6 (Phillips 28, Astle 0) Starc returns after that solitary and successful Labuschagne over to try and mop up the tail with the reverse-swinging old ball. He doesn\u2019t strike immediately but the low bounce worries New Zealand twice. On the first occasion he hits Phillips in his midriff with a bouncer that fails to get up, then he has Astle jamming down on a ball that threatened to grubber its way into his stumps. 77th over: New Zealand 195-6 (Phillips 27, Astle 0) Replays of that run out just made de Grandhomme\u2019s performance even more infuriating. He jogged the first run, took an age to set off for the second, and had plenty of time to abort the mission. Meanwhile Pattinson sends down a maiden to Phillips. The feisty quick hasn\u2019t been at his best this match and again his line and length isn\u2019t a patch on the high standard set by Pat Cummins. 76th over: New Zealand 195-6 (Phillips 27, Astle 0) Labuschagne bowled nicely but that over was all about CdG\u2019s brain fade. The NZ management must be tearing their hair out. Good grief. Colin de Grandhomme, what are you doing? A brisk but ultimately inconsequential innings comes to an end in desperate fashion. After driving new bowler Marnus Labuschagne into the outfield de Grandhomme turns for a suicidal second and perishes. Matthew Wade was on the ball at midwicket in a flash and his throw was in Tim Paine\u2019s hands soon enough to flick the bails off and send the last recognised Kiwi batsman packing. That was dreadful cricket from New Zealand. 75th over: New Zealand 194-5 (Phillips 27, de Grandhomme 19) CdG continues to keep the scoreboard moving. Pattinson drops short and offers a smidgen of width that de Grandhomme accepts to cut smartly behind point for four. He is a big powerful lad the Harare-born right-hander. With bat in hand he makes the massive modern blades look like the toothpicks of old. 74th over: New Zealand 189-5 (Phillips 27, de Grandhomme 14) CdG continues to live dangerously. An easy single is on offer from a Lyon long-hop but the big allrounder goes for a big lofted flip and almost sends it down Travis Head\u2019s throat at long leg. He escapes with a single, allowing Phillips to show him how it\u2019s done, first capitalising on length with a neat straight drive, then rocking back and punishing the overcorrection through midwicket for consecutive boundaries. 73rd over: New Zealand 180-5 (Phillips 19, de Grandhomme 13) Pattinson replaces Starc and his first delivery is right in the slot for CdG who shows the class he possesses with bat in hand, leaning into a thumping cover drive. He collects four more the following delivery with a fine tickle off his pads after Pattinson leaked down the leg-side. 72nd over: New Zealand 171-5 (Phillips 19, de Grandhomme 4) Another drop from Nathan Lyon off his own bowling! Perhaps his injured right thumb from his earlier drop forced him to go for this effort with just his left hand instead of both? Either way, that\u2019s a let-off for Phillips who failed to punish a rare full toss. 71st over: New Zealand 169-5 (Phillips 17, de Grandhomme 4) What was that about cavalier Colin? With leaden feet he swings his blade at Starc with the ball on the up and he\u2019s lucky to watch a sliced drive fly a metre or two wide of a diving Wade at cover. I\u2019m in favour of a counterattack to push the onus back on the bowlers, but shots like that are an accident waiting to happen. 70th over: New Zealand 167-5 (Phillips 17, de Grandhomme 2) Lyon looks like taking a wicket most deliveries. His ability to land the ball in the right areas consistently and exploit the natural variation is glorious to watch. New Zealand play him well this over, both batsmen rotating the strike and looking to capitalise on anything too full or too wide. CdG owes his team a decent performance with the bat, he\u2019s looked a touch too cavalier this series. There\u2019s still a little spark left in New Zealand cricket... Thank you very much Adam. Remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. 69th over: New Zealand 164-5 (Phillips 15, de Grandhomme 1) The field is set up for the short ball at de Grandhomme - it\u2019s only a matter of time before Starc has a pop at it. Around the wicket, he\u2019s angling in at the stumps to begin. There\u2019s nothing easy about this, another delivery keeping a fraction low. Now he has a flash at one well outside the off-stump, failing to make contact. Leave that alone, Col. Two balls to come, surely he goes short? Not yet - this is the yorker, a leading edge ending up at cover and getting him off the mark. So close. Phillips deals with the final ball, taking them to DRINKS. With this day and match at halfway, I\u2019ll handover to JP Howcroft to steer you through from here. I\u2019ll be back on the OBO tomorrow from Cape Town and then with you at Sydney after that. Bye! 68th over: New Zealand 163-5 (Phillips 15, de Grandhomme 0) Lyon to Phillips with four men around the bat in a box field. Sure enough, they have plenty to say too with the Black Caps at risk of folding here. There\u2019s a bit of variable bounce out of those footmarks now as well, one keeping low from the rough. A maiden it is. 67th over: New Zealand 163-5 (Phillips 15, de Grandhomme 0) de Grandhomme keeps out a full one to finish. Starc was on after another excellent Cummins spell. There is no respite with these Aussie quicks at the moment. A lot has been said about Labuschagne\u2019s golden summer but I can\u2019t think of a season where a group of fast bowlers have been as good as this, complemented so well by Lyon. Chops on a wide one. Ugly. It takes Starc only five balls in this new spell to strike. 66th over: New Zealand 162-4 (Phillips 14, Watling 9)\u201cThis is Glenn Phillips\u2019 biggest challenge,\u201d Brendon McCullum says of facing the relentless Nathan Lyon. He does it well through this over, defending well and collecting a single to finish. 65th over: New Zealand 161-4 (Phillips 13, Watling 9) Cummins gives Watling another bumper before this over is done, ducked this time. A good decision. NOT OUT! Clearly off the arm guard, not the glove. Australia are out of reviews. IS WATLING CAUGHT AT SHORT LEG? Cummins had him in all sorts of bother with a bumper, taken by Wade. It is given not out on the field so Paine sends it up to the DRS for a second look. They are very confident, but so is Watling. 64th over: New Zealand 160-4 (Phillips 12, Watling 9) That\u2019s the shot of the session so far from Watling, getting a big stride in at Lyon before stroking him with fantastic timing out to the boundary in front of the Bill O\u2019Reilly Stand. On radio, they report that it is very smokey now at the SCG. The suggestion is that it\u2019ll get worse in the final session, which might then force the players off the field. 63rd over: New Zealand 156-4 (Phillips 12, Watling 5) A compact drive from Watling off Cummins, down to long-off for three from an attempted yorker that arrived on the full. Phillips gets himself in a tangle against a shorter ball around shoulder height, fortunate not to pop it into Paine\u2019s gloves down the legside. I\u2019m getting in way too early here but centuries on debut is something I have a strong interest in; 11 New Zealand men have achieved it, the most recent Tom Blundell in 2017. Of course, Matthew Sinclair made his a double the in the final Test Match of 1999. Some other fun names, including cult hero Mark Greatbatch! 62nd over: New Zealand 153-4 (Phillips 12, Watling 2) Nice shot from Phillips to move into double figures, pulling Lyon out to the midwicket rope. It wasn\u2019t that short but he made it look like it with fast feet and hands. Lyon bounces straight back with one that grips out of the rough and finds the newcomer\u2019s inside edge - Labuschagne looked in the game at silly point but it didn\u2019t go to hand. 61st over: New Zealand 149-4 (Phillips 8, Watling 2) Phillips does well to get out of the Cummins frying pan first ball of the new over, carefully placing a short ball behind square. Since that chance he returned to Lyon before lunch, he\u2019s looked okay. Watling is meditative, defending the rest. He can bat time, we know that. 60th over: New Zealand 148-4 (Phillips 7, Watling 2) Watling then Phillips start the over with a single each into the offside from Lyon, the former happy to defend the rest. He\u2019s a handful here with these big footmarks to aim at. Lyon has never picked up a five-wicket bag at the SCG - this is a fantastic opportunity to correct that. 59th over: New Zealand 146-4 (Phillips 6, Watling 1) Nothing easy about this for Phillips with Cummins, slamming into the channel outside the off-stump, giving him nothing. He\u2019s faced 31 balls for his six so far, which is fine, of course. Maiden. 58th over: New Zealand 146-4 (Phillips 6, Watling 1) Four catchers around the bat for Lyon, boxing Watling in. I\u2019m pleased to see a silly point in place; doesn\u2019t get given one anywhere near enough for mine. He\u2019s landing in those two patches of rough throughout the over, Watling getting through the early interrogation. 57th over: New Zealand 146-4 (Phillips 6, Watling 1) The new man is off the mark first ball with a clip to midwicket. After jagging the wicket-taking delivery back at Taylor, the classy Cummins is shaping away from Phillips now before finishing with an quick bouncer. He\u2019s starting 2020 as he finished 2019 - the best there is. No reprieve, umpire\u2019s call on impact and very much hitting middle! Cummins got it done with his first ball after the break, past the inside edge after doing just enough. Beautifully bowled on a track is giving plenty to bowlers hitting the seam. HAS CUMMINS TRAPPED TAYLOR LBW? Aleem Dar thinks so, raising his finger. Taylor takes his time but ultimately elects to review. Let\u2019s go to the DRS! 56th over: New Zealand 145-3 (Taylor 22, Phillips 6) Phillips gets the first runs of the session, three of them, driven down to long off. Nicely played. Taylor gets a single too, whipping confidently into the legside, playing with the spin. The players are back on the field. James Pattinson sprints out chasing the TV drone camera - gotta love him. Aleem Dar is running too! From one side of the wicket to the other at square leg so play can continue and the crowd love it. Lyon will start off with the ball, from the Paddington End; Phillips is on strike. PLAY! Nathan Lyon is speaking to TV. He hasn\u2019t got anything to say, as is the custom with these interviews at the intervals. I have no idea why they bother. With three wickets - two of those falling with the score on 117 - Australia take the honours for the morning session. It looked like New Zealand were going to make it to lunch one down but Raval, who was in great touch, missed Lyon\u2019s straight before Latham inexplicably pushed a catch off Cummins to mid-on moments later. Blundell was the early wicket to fall, getting into a tangle off Lyon to put the spinner into the book for the first time. He\u2019s the man most likely to take a bag, even after putting down Phillips in his follow-through when the new man was on 2. We go to the break with the Black Caps still 313 runs behind. A long way to go. 55th over: New Zealand 141-3 (Taylor 21, Phillips 3) Travis Head started the session with his off-spin and he\u2019s back now to finish it. I suspect the plan from Paine was to race through the over in 90 seconds so to give Lyon another chance, but Taylor denied them that chance when lashing a half-volley through point for four. Oh, and he does it again to finish - that\u2019s a lovely stroke. Lyon tries to give his hat over in order to get another one in but they aren\u2019t having it... that\u2019s LUNCH. 54th over: New Zealand 131-3 (Taylor 11, Phillips 3) Lyon straight into his shoebox to Phillips, the maiden played carefully with just a few minutes on the clock before the break. That is probably his final over of the session. 53rd over: New Zealand 131-3 (Taylor 11, Phillips 3) Taylor gets one to cut first up from Pattinson here and makes no mistake putting it away. He\u2019s settled well against the pace, readying himself for lunch in a couple of overs from now. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi Gavin Robertson. No, not that one. \u201cAs a Scot who lives in Australia, I often describe my interest in cricket as being grounded in a love of any sport in which I can watch England being soundly beaten on a regular basis. Regarding the Welsh question, isn\u2019t Tasmania the Wales of Australia? It\u2019s a different world down there. Even though they do speak English too.\u201d Yep, I don\u2019t mind that. I\u2019ve taken my girlfriend to Tassie a couple of times when she\u2019s been in Australia over the last few summers. She doesn\u2019t understand why I like to visit all these old Tasmanian Football League grounds but I\u2019m convinced there is something special about them. This year we dropped into Sandy Bay, Glenorchy, York Park and North Hobart Oval. Last year it was Bellerive and the TCA Ground. Next? New Norfolk, I reckon. I\u2019m clearly a great catch... 52nd over: New Zealand 125-3 (Taylor 6, Phillips 2) Well, you do not often see Lyon dropping catches off his own bowling but he has put Phillips down in his follow through! He\u2019s taken some spectacular grabs over the journey - this couldn\u2019t have been much more straightforward. He\u2019s hurt his thumb when dropping the catch too, drawing blood. The Australian medico is straight out to take a look, patching him up before play resumes and the maiden is completed. 51st over: New Zealand 125-3 (Taylor 6, Phillips 2) Pattinson is straight back into the act with Ross Taylor to the middle, having sorted him out last week. It\u2019s close to working too, finding his outside edge second ball, through about fifth slip for four. He gets another couple glancing to fine leg after shuffling across his stumps - he had to make contact or he was in the gun for lbw. Now driving, Taylor makes great contact but Burns pulls down a brilliant stop at cover, definitely saving four runs. There\u2019s a credible shout for leg before after that when Taylor appears to miss his glance but there was some inside edge there. Plenty going on now! 50th over: New Zealand 119-3 (Taylor 0, Phillips 2) So, the Black Caps have two new men in the middle, neither having faced a ball, with Phillips on debut. Australia have a chance to run amok in the 25 minutes before lunch. The latter is off the mark second ball, his first runs in Test cricket down to fine leg. Cummins backs it up with a bumper, only just clearing his helmet. He\u2019s better in defence to finish, making solid contact on the front foot. The end of a successful over. The first of those wickets on 117. Oh no! He\u2019s middled it straight to mid-on! What a weird way for the captain to fall, one short of a half-century. After so much good work, they\u2019re in strife again. Yep, that\u2019s very out, hitting leg stump three quarters of the way up. A handy innings comes to an end. Just before he was given out I was reflecting on how confident he was looking to Lyon, but the spinner has developed an excellent straighter ball to left-handers over the last few years and it worked a treat here. 49th over: New Zealand 117-2 (Latham 49) IS RAVAL LBW? He\u2019s given out to Lyon on the field, beaten on the inside edge by a straighter delivery around the wicket. He sends it upstairs, surely more in hope than expectation? We\u2019ll find out. Stand by. 48th over: New Zealand 114-1 (Latham 46, Raval 31) I just heard Pat Cummins called as Pat Cummings again. By a former teammate, too. How is this possible? He\u2019s only been playing international cricket since 2011. Anyway, he\u2019s in here at Raval, hiding the ball in his run-up, suggesting he\u2019s looking for reverse. But the approach seems to be more about getting under his armpit, that awkward length Cummins hits more consistently than anyone in the game - apart from Wagner, come to think of it. He\u2019s fuller later in the over, Raval defending well. Maiden. 47th over: New Zealand 114-1 (Latham 46, Raval 31) JEET! That\u2019s the second time Raval has really launched into a pull shot off Pattinson and the result is the same, crashing into the rope at midwicket as he moves into the 30s. There was no way he could have anticipated batting in a Test Match this week. Go you good thing. 46th over: New Zealand 109-1 (Latham 46, Raval 26) Cummins to Raval, who is off strike with one to fine leg off the inside portion of his bat. Latham ducks and defends. \u201cWell, in cricket terms, it fits into England, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d writes Mark Houghton. \u201cSince the \u2018England\u2019 team, at least on a technicality, represents both England and Wales.\u201d Sure, but not culturally. Or so my late grandmother would have argued. She didn\u2019t learn English until she was 16! A different world. 45th over: New Zealand 108-1 (Latham 46, Raval 25) Back from drinks and Pattinson goes again, Raval turning the first ball down to long leg for another single. To 25 in 40 balls - good going. Latham deals with the rest, happy enough to leave and defend and not a lot more. He\u2019s setting himself for an all dayer. 44th over: New Zealand 107-1 (Latham 46, Raval 24) Cummins is on to give Lyon a break, beginning his first spell of the day. But Raval isn\u2019t intimidated by the number one bowler in the world, pushing from the balls of his feet behind point for his third boundary. A lovely stroke. He keeps the strike from the final delivery of the first hour of play as they take a drink. They\u2019re going well. 43rd over: New Zealand 102-1 (Latham 46, Raval 19) Yes, Jeet! I\u2019m already invested in his innings; what a great story if he kicked on to three figures? He\u2019s giving himself every opportunity to score against the quicks, this time taking Pattinson on with a perfect pull shot, forward of the man at square leg and quickly out to the rope. On strike later in the over, Latham eases a couple through point. This is by far New Zealand\u2019s best start of the series, now into triple figures. 42nd over: New Zealand 94-1 (Latham 43, Raval 14) Lyon to Latham, using his sweep for the first time today out to backward square for one. Raval is happiest on the front foot to the spinner, getting a big stride in whenever the length allows. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Simon McMahon. \u201cMuch love and support from here in Scotland for both the bushfire effort, and Jane McGrath day. I\u2019ve got friends in both Australia and New Zealand - the England and Scotland of the Southern Hemisphere, eh? A great day of Test cricket helps solve everything, though, right?\u201d That sounds about right by way of comparison but I\u2019m not quite sure where Wales fits in? I was in the north-west corner before Christmas - a fantastic spot. Thanks for the well wishes. One positive development is some rain about today. 41st over: New Zealand 93-1 (Latham 42, Raval 14) Yep, that is Starc finished for now with Pattinson on from the Randwick End. He was only called upon for four overs last night, so he should be fresh. To Raval, the Victorian getting nice shape away from around the wicket - perhaps a hint of reverse swing? Two words we haven\u2019t said too often since the sandpaper debacle. A lot to like about Raval\u2019s push through point later in the over, all the way along the turf and into the rope. I\u2019m backing him in to do something significant here - he\u2019s started really well. 40th over: New Zealand 89-1 (Latham 42, Raval 10) A lovely offbreak to begin the Lyon over, spinning a long way from round the wicket, just beyond Raval\u2019s edge and then his off-stump. But the No3 puts it behind him quickly, stroking an attractive drive through cover for three more to move into double figures. 39th over: New Zealand 86-1 (Latham 42, Raval 7) Starc is picked off for three from both of the first two deliveries, Latham flicking him through midwicket then Raval tucking off his hip. He\u2019s started well. Latham whips another single through midwicket before Raval ends the productive over with one behind point. I suspect that\u2019ll be the left-armer finished for now, Cummins surely on to replace him. 38th over: New Zealand 78-1 (Latham 38, Raval 3) Nicely played Raval, timing Lyon against the spin through midwicket off the front foot for a couple. Beware of the unwell batsman, of course. He\u2019s defending well off the front foot too, getting well forward to blunt the turn. Already a good contest between these two. 37th over: New Zealand 76-1 (Latham 38, Raval 1) Jeet Raval, only playing this week due to the illness that ravaged the dressing room, plays and misses at the first ball he sees from Starc. He gives him nothing until the final delivery, turned away from leg stump out to midwicket to get him off the mark. Relief for him. 36th over: New Zealand 75-1 (Latham 38, Raval 0) Lyon to Latham, who he has driving early in the over, doing the tidiying up in his follow through. On 381 wickets, he\u2019s now just three away now from overtaking Ian Botham. That\u2019s nearly two with Latham cutting off an outside edge! \u201cThat\u2019s too full to be cutting,\u201d says Simon Katich on SEN radio. He gets four for it, just wide of slip. Ooh, and he\u2019s beaten by a big turning off-break to finish. Lyon has quickly found his mojo. 35th over: New Zealand 71-1 (Latham 34, Raval 0) Probing from Starc to begin outside the off stump but well played by Latham through the cordon with soft hands for a couple. There\u2019s a brief delay as the corporate types behind the bowler don\u2019t realise they are in Latham\u2019s eyeline moving around on the second deck of the Trumper Stand. They\u2019ll be popular. Back on it, Starc completes an accurate over with a fuller ball that Latham pushes to extra cover for a single. Good batting. 34th over: New Zealand 68-1 (Latham 31, Raval 0) Raval, the recalled opener, has one delivery to get through and he does so in defence. A wicket maiden for Lyon. He\u2019s dragged a half-tracker on! But Lyon earned that with the previous two deliveries, beating the edge then landing in the footmarks. Caught in two minds, the opener got into strife on the back foot, the ball trickling onto his stumps. 33rd over: New Zealand 68-0 (Latham 31, Blundell 34) Starc is hitting the radar well into the mid-140s but Latham is seeing them nicely in defence early on here. He has to adapt in the crease to a delivery that keeps just a fraction low at 147kph, but keeps it out easily enough. The skipper gets a chance to score from the penultimate ball off his pads and accepts the invitation, clipping four down to the fine leg rope. That\u2019s the first boundary of day three. A quiet start, all told. 32nd over: New Zealand 64-0 (Latham 27, Blundell 34) Right, so Head was letting Lyon change to the Paddington End, which Warne is supportive of on telly. They highlight the footmarks on the broadcast, which Lyon hits from the get go. Blundell does well, able to defend from deep in the crease. He\u2019s brought forward later in the over bringing the three close catchers into play, which Tim Paine enjoys. \u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d he says on the stump mic. Indeed it is. Another maiden. 31st over: New Zealand 64-0 (Latham 27, Blundell 34) Starc gets first crack from the pace trio, operating with just a slip in the cordon with two men out for the hook in front of the Members and Ladies Stands. But Latham isn\u2019t interested in any of that though, leaving the bulk of this over outside the off stump. A maiden. \u201cGreetings from the Midlands, Adam.\u201d Hello from North London, Sarah! I spent my afternoon between OBO stints watching my Dulwich Hamlet pile on six goals. \u201cLooking forward to a great day of cricket, but even in the rainy cold Old Dart, all my thoughts are with those suffering from the devastating bushfires. Quick question though: is there a PayPal account for Jane McGrath Day donations?\u201d Good shout. Per the below tweet, all the details are at pinktest.com.au 30th over: New Zealand 64-0 (Latham 27, Blundell 34) Nothing wrong with his radar or rip, the part-timer right where he should be to the left-handed Latham from round the wicket. The stand-in skipper opens his account for the day with a single cut close to his stumps out to deep point. Nothing wrong with that as far as Australia are concerned. Even if he was bowling that over to help change ends, I suspect Paine will give him another one given how well that set went. The players are on the field. Travis Head is taking the first over? Seriously! Well, there we have it. Latham is the man on strike, resuming on 26. PLAY! A reminder to keep bidding on Russell Jackson\u2019s bat! A former member of the Guardian sport team, Russ is doing a fantastic job raising money for bushfire relief, donating this wonderful bat he had signed by ten Test captains. Get involved! The application of technology comes up yet again. On both sides of the Indian Ocean. I\u2019m sure we all saw it, the hotspot on Tom Blundell\u2019s bat only for Nigel Llong to give him not out when it was sent upstairs late yesterday. I don\u2019t know how many more instances of this we need to see before the ICC look at investing in specialist television umpires. It completely undermines DRS more broadly when this keeps happening. They could take care of the front line as well, which became a big issue at Cape Town during South Africa\u2019s innings overnight, Broad shown to have overstepped when finding van der Dussen\u2019s edge. The broadcaster then proved the umpires weren\u2019t looking for it as multiple instances were highlighted of no-balls going uncalled. We need to keep the pressure on with this. Matthew Wade is fine. After copping a whack to the helmet at short leg last night, the Australian batsman has been assessed as fit by the medical staff this morning. Morning. While the nation\u2019s attention remains very much fixed on the unfolding bushfire disaster, today at the SCG also marks another important fundraising efforts: Jane McGrath Day in support or breast cancer support and research through the McGrath Foundation. As it has been for the last 11 years, the ground will turn pink with both sides presenting their caps to Glenn McGrath for auction. On the field, this Test is tilted heavily in favour of the home side but the New Zealand tourists held it together admirably on Saturday with ball then bat. Despite Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s heavy accumulation and maiden double ton, they were able to take the seven remaining wickets for 165 runs before reaching 63 for no loss across the final session through Tom Blundell and stand-in skipper Tom Latham. If they can bat all day, the match will be in the ballpark of parity with two days to go. Considering the way the Black Caps have routinely folded on this tour, that would be an achievement in itself and a reminder of why they came into this series as the number two Test side in the world. It won\u2019t be as hot in the middle today, so the Aussie quicks should be able to back up for multiple spells. As always, I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout the first half of the day before passing the OBO baton to JP Howcroft. Drop me a line at any time.",

It is, rather, as Will Davies observed in his book The Happiness Industry, partly a means of behaviour management on the part of both governments and private enterprise, to ensure a more pliant society and a more productive and profitable one. It is partly, also, a means of \u201cself-optimisation\u201d, by which, as psychologist Peter Bloom observes, \u201csmall-scale personal empowerment\u201d goes hand in hand with \u201clarge-scale social disempowerment\u201d. Aristotle argued that \u201ceudaimonia\u201d (which is often translated as happiness, but is probably better thought of as meaning a flourishing life) is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake. He did not mean by this that it is an end we should set out to seek but, rather, the end we can achieve if we live our life well. Happiness is not, and cannot be, a goal in itself. It can only be the by-product of other goals. To seek happiness is a bit like trying to be cool. The more you are desperate for it, the less you will be. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>There is a scene in Salman Rushdie\u2019s <em>The Satanic Verses</em> in which one of the central characters, Saladin, finds himself incarcerated in a detention centre for illegal immigrants.</p> <p>Saladin discovers that his fellow inmates have been transformed into beasts \u2013 water buffaloes, snakes, manticores. How do they do it? Saladin asks a fellow prisoner. \u201cThey describe us,\u201d comes the reply, \u201cthat\u2019s all. They have the power of description and we succumb to the pictures they construct.\u201d</p> <p>In the real world, people don\u2019t simply \u201csuccumb\u201d to the pictures others construct of them. There is, however, an important truth expressed in that scene. Our descriptions of the world are also part of the world and help shape it.</p> <p>We continually carve up the social world into myriad categories \u2013 women, blacks, graduates, the unemployed and so on. Without doing so, we would be unable to discern patterns, understand changes, anticipate developments. But social categories don\u2019t just allow us to look at reality \u2013 they help constitute that reality, too.</p> <p>To understand the power of social categories, and their power to distort, think about the controversy last week after two private schools \u2013 Dulwich College and Winchester College \u2013 refused a donation from Bryan Thwaites intended to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/30/private-schools-defend-refusal-of-1m-donation-to-help-poor-white-boys\" title=\"\">provide scholarships</a> for disadvantaged white, working-class boys. The refusal was condemned by figures such as Trevor Phillips, former head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), who called it \u201c<a href=\"https://standpointmag.co.uk/issues/december-2019-january-2020/guilt-makes-fools-of-the-exam-passing-classes/\" title=\"\">the liberal guilt</a> of a largely brahmin caste\u201d standing in the way of someone who \u201cwanted to do the right thing by families who need support\u201d.</p> <p>In principle, there is nothing wrong with any policy that seeks to help any social group that is disadvantaged. It is immaterial whether that group be white or black, working class or not. Nor is there any question that the education system lets down white, working-class boys. <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/11-to-16-years-old/gcse-results-attainment-8-for-children-aged-14-to-16-key-stage-4/latest#by-ethnicity-gender-and-area\" title=\"\">GCSE results</a> published in August showed that white boys receiving free school meals (a proxy for poverty) fared worst of all groups. More than half of England\u2019s universities, according to one report, have fewer than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-47227157\" title=\"\">5% poor white students</a> in their intakes.</p> <p>Such data might suggest that a policy targeting white, working-class boys is a useful, and necessary measure. But the issue is not so straightforward. \u201cWhite working class\u201d is a category whose very existence paradoxically helps mask the problems facing the \u201cwhite working class\u201d.</p> <p>I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/british-education-failure-white-working-class\" title=\"\">written before</a> about the way that ethnic categories in education obscure the real reasons for the poor performance of certain minority groups. It is class, far more than ethnicity, which shapes educational attainment. This issue is greatly amplified in the debate about the \u201cwhite working class\u201d.</p> <p>More than most categories, it has helped define reality as much as allowed us to understand it. We rarely talk of the \u201cblack working class\u201d or the \u201cMuslim working class\u201d. Instead, \u201cworking class\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d have become synonymous. Minorities are seen as belonging to classless \u201ccommunities\u201d, while \u201cclass\u201d has become a category applied primarily to the white population. This has distorted the ways in which we think of the white working class, racialising the very idea of class and leading many to suggest that being white plays as much a part in their disadvantages as being working class. Whiteness does play a role, though not in the way that most such commentators mean.</p> <p>In the case of minorities, racial categories may obscure the real reasons for the poor educational performance of certain groups. But, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/17/minority-ethnic-britons-face-shocking-job-discrimination\" title=\"\">employment</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/03/flatshare-bias-room-seekers-with-muslim-name-get-fewer-replies\" title=\"\">accommodation</a>, racism is real.</p> <p>Whites don\u2019t face this type of discrimination. (I\u2019m not suggesting that whites can\u2019t be victims of racism, just that they\u2019re not in Britain today.) What white, working -class people do face, however, is what we might call the racialisation of disadvantage.</p> <p>It\u2019s become common to view racism through the prism of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d \u2013 the idea that all white people have social advantages over non-whites. In accepting that all whites, whether bankers or cleaners, carry with them a certain privilege by virtue of being white, the poverty and deprivation faced by sections of the white population becomes all too easy to ignore.

      "bodyText": "There is a scene in Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in which one of the central characters, Saladin, finds himself incarcerated in a detention centre for illegal immigrants. Saladin discovers that his fellow inmates have been transformed into beasts \u2013 water buffaloes, snakes, manticores. How do they do it? Saladin asks a fellow prisoner. \u201cThey describe us,\u201d comes the reply, \u201cthat\u2019s all. They have the power of description and we succumb to the pictures they construct.\u201d In the real world, people don\u2019t simply \u201csuccumb\u201d to the pictures others construct of them. There is, however, an important truth expressed in that scene. Our descriptions of the world are also part of the world and help shape it. We continually carve up the social world into myriad categories \u2013 women, blacks, graduates, the unemployed and so on. Without doing so, we would be unable to discern patterns, understand changes, anticipate developments. But social categories don\u2019t just allow us to look at reality \u2013 they help constitute that reality, too. To understand the power of social categories, and their power to distort, think about the controversy last week after two private schools \u2013 Dulwich College and Winchester College \u2013 refused a donation from Bryan Thwaites intended to provide scholarships for disadvantaged white, working-class boys. The refusal was condemned by figures such as Trevor Phillips, former head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), who called it \u201cthe liberal guilt of a largely brahmin caste\u201d standing in the way of someone who \u201cwanted to do the right thing by families who need support\u201d. In principle, there is nothing wrong with any policy that seeks to help any social group that is disadvantaged. It is immaterial whether that group be white or black, working class or not. Nor is there any question that the education system lets down white, working-class boys. GCSE results published in August showed that white boys receiving free school meals (a proxy for poverty) fared worst of all groups. More than half of England\u2019s universities, according to one report, have fewer than 5% poor white students in their intakes. Such data might suggest that a policy targeting white, working-class boys is a useful, and necessary measure. But the issue is not so straightforward. \u201cWhite working class\u201d is a category whose very existence paradoxically helps mask the problems facing the \u201cwhite working class\u201d. I have written before about the way that ethnic categories in education obscure the real reasons for the poor performance of certain minority groups. It is class, far more than ethnicity, which shapes educational attainment. This issue is greatly amplified in the debate about the \u201cwhite working class\u201d. More than most categories, it has helped define reality as much as allowed us to understand it. We rarely talk of the \u201cblack working class\u201d or the \u201cMuslim working class\u201d. Instead, \u201cworking class\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d have become synonymous. Minorities are seen as belonging to classless \u201ccommunities\u201d, while \u201cclass\u201d has become a category applied primarily to the white population. This has distorted the ways in which we think of the white working class, racialising the very idea of class and leading many to suggest that being white plays as much a part in their disadvantages as being working class. Whiteness does play a role, though not in the way that most such commentators mean. In the case of minorities, racial categories may obscure the real reasons for the poor educational performance of certain groups. But, from employment to accommodation, racism is real. Whites don\u2019t face this type of discrimination. (I\u2019m not suggesting that whites can\u2019t be victims of racism, just that they\u2019re not in Britain today.) What white, working -class people do face, however, is what we might call the racialisation of disadvantage. It\u2019s become common to view racism through the prism of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d \u2013 the idea that all white people have social advantages over non-whites. In accepting that all whites, whether bankers or cleaners, carry with them a certain privilege by virtue of being white, the poverty and deprivation faced by sections of the white population becomes all too easy to ignore. This in turn breeds greater resentment within sections of the working class about their marginalisation and abandonment and entrenches the idea of a \u201cwhite identity\u201d, further racialising the notion of class. Thwaites\u2019s money is apparently now going to state schools with disadvantaged white pupils. That is certainly more useful than donating to private schools. But more useful still would be to rethink the very concept of the \u201cwhite working class\u201d and to reflect on how we use categories and descriptions, especially in trying to understand the relationship between race and class. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "The mood in Ayia Napa, out of season but in the news, is bleak. The few tourists in town seem to have largely come from sub-zero winter temperatures in Russia and eastern Europe and are impervious to the unrelenting grey drizzle, or the fact that very little is open for business. But calls last week to boycott the resort over the case of a British teenager who accused 12 Israeli men of raping her in July last year has shaken locals. They rely heavily on holiday trade to survive the cooler months when the town shuts down and empties. \u201cAyia Napa is already suffering: we are going down since the last four years,\u201d says Lena, a receptionist at one of the few family-friendly hotels in a town synonymous with \u201cadults-only\u201d establishments aimed at young, drunken holidaymakers who stay up all night and sleep all day. \u201cBoycotting does not make sense because of one problem. There is one problem and everyone is judged.\u201d Lena alludes only to \u201cthe problem\u201d, but the case of the teenager and her rape accusation has dominated headlines here as in Britain. Locals are defensive, and the mayor, Yiannis Karousos, has threatened to sue the teenager for defamation and blocked any criticism of his town on Twitter. The British woman, who was 18 at the time of the incident, was treated in hospital for serious injuries consistent with rape. Two weeks later, in an eight-hour police interview conducted without a lawyer and not recorded, she signed a statement retracting her claims. The Israeli men, aged between 15 and 22, were released and sent home, reportedly popping champagne at Tel Aviv airport and chanting \u201cthe Brit is a whore\u201d. Their accuser, who has been diagnosed with PTSD and a sleeping disorder, was charged with \u201cpublic mischief\u201d and spent a month in prison and six more detained in safe houses on the island. Following her conviction last week, she will be sentenced in the coming days. She is appealing against the conviction, and her mother has urged a boycott of Ayia Napa, warning that the resort is \u201cabsolutely unsafe\u201d. On an empty street between a Flintstones-themed bar and a strip club covered in giant soft-porn hoardings, an Indian family visiting from Shimla say they agree. \u201cI did not know it was like this,\u201d says the mother in Hindi, gesturing towards a neon-lit parlour promising permanent tattoos (even though it\u2019s temporarily closed). \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t let our [teenage] son come here alone on holiday. It\u2019s not because we don\u2019t trust him, but the risk is too high for young people, boys or girls, when everything is made to encourage bad behaviour.\u201d Ayia Napa\u2019s reputation as a party town was cemented in popular culture in the late 1990s by UK garage stars, but it has gone on to become a tabloid fixture for its disturbing excess of drink, violence and sexual assault. Pambos Napa Rocks, the hotel where the British teenager was staying, has a preponderance of one-star reviews on Trip Advisor where customers have written about their rooms being dirty and dangerous. Another British teenager wrote in June 2019 that she had been attacked while asleep in her bed: \u201cI was woken up to a man on top of me who had broken into the room through the balcony door.\u201d Many of the locals I speak to are sensitive about how the case has portrayed their town. Everyone, they say, comes to Ayia Napa for sex. \u201cPeople come to Ayia Napa to do what they can\u2019t do at home,\u201d says taxi driver Louka, who was born in the UK but has lived in Cyprus for 45 years. \u201cThis is the place to get anything you want.\u201d Ayia Napa is marketed as one of the top five destinations in the world for a \u201clads\u2019 holiday\u201d by travel companies including Lastminute.com and Loveholidays.com.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Visitors have been asked not to come to the island unless it is essential.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost tourists want to visit our beautiful iconic sites \u2013 and of course there\u2019s no access to that end of the island,\u201d Bates said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to give us all a bit of breathing space and then come back later.\u201d</p> \n<p>The state government has appointed the wildlife official Mike Williams to lead the recovery.

Firefighters on the island have been battling fires since before Christmas that blazed out of control after extreme weather on Friday. The fires, which are still burning, started at the western end of the 160km-long island, and have burned about a third of it, killing two people and devastating the island\u2019s two main industries, tourism and farming. The former pilot Dick Lang and his son, Clayton Lang, were killed when fire overran their car on Friday. Ferries have been running almost around the clock to evacuate thousands of tourists back to the South Australian mainland, the former mayor Jayne Bates said. Bates lives in Penneshaw, which is on the east of the island closest to the mainland and hosts its ferry terminal. Most of the tourist attractions are at the western end of the island. They include the luxury Southern Ocean Lodge, which has been destroyed by fire, and the Flinders Chase wilderness area. Bates said a large number of farm buildings had also been destroyed. \u201cA lot of our blokes have gone out today to destroy injured sheep \u2013 you\u2019re talking thousands,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re digging pits.\u201d The fires were \u201cthe worst we\u2019ve ever had\u201d, she said. \u201cWe had a big one in 2007 but not to this extent. \u201cAnd the loss of the two lives \u2013 well.\u201d The fire had also destroyed at least $20m worth of bluegum and pine trees on plantations run by Kanagaroo Island Plantation Timber. On Friday KIPT said it was still assessing the damage, but at least 13% of its forests had been burned. The company said it would try to salvage wood from the areas that have already burned by bringing forward harvesting. Also damaged in the fire was the Middle River Water Treatment Plant, prompting SA Water to urge island residents to limit non-essential water use. About 600 properties remained without power on Sunday, with SA Power Networks working to restore services. \u201cIt was unfightable,\u201d Bates said of the fire. \u201cIs this our new normal? That\u2019s the fear.\u201d She said the fires were \u201cgreatly subdued, but we\u2019re in for some warmer weather midweek\u201d. Temperatures were forecast to reach 32C degrees on Wednesday and 37C degrees on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Fire crews from Adelaide have relieved tired local volunteers, but Bates said locals would be keen to handle the mop-up. She said tourists were evacuated to Penneshaw before boarding Sealink ferries to the mainland. \u201cThis is our very busiest peak time, this is when the influx comes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were 10 or 11,000 people here in total \u2013 that\u2019s a bit of a guess.\u201d Visitors have been asked not to come to the island unless it is essential. \u201cMost tourists want to visit our beautiful iconic sites \u2013 and of course there\u2019s no access to that end of the island,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIt\u2019s best to give us all a bit of breathing space and then come back later.\u201d The state government has appointed the wildlife official Mike Williams to lead the recovery.

A physical fight. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>An angry Antonio is difficult to picture. From afar the West Ham forward seems the happy type, a cult hero who always has a funny goal celebration up his sleeve, and this 29-year-old father of three does not disappoint when we meet at Football Beyond Borders\u2019 office in Brixton. Antonio has given up his Thursday evening to support FBB, an education charity that uses the power of football to support disadvantaged young people in the United Kingdom, and it does not take long to understand how much community means to him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/03/west-ham-conor-coventry-new-deal-football\">West Ham finally agree new deal with highly rated midfielder Conor Coventry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Antonio is from south London and he looks a natural while mentoring a group of boys who have struggled at school and are here because FBB has teamed up with the Wellness Project, a homelessness charity, to provide care packages for young people living on the streets during Christmas. \u201cThey remind me of my school days,\u201d he says. \u201cGrowing up in south London you are naturally quite boisterous.\u201d</p> <p>Antonio speaks from the heart and he tells a story about losing the anger. \u201cI was 14,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve gone with my friends to Tooting to chill with them. Two of my friends end up going to Graveney [a school]. They stole two bikes off two kids. I was there. The next day, the idiots rode those bikes to school. They stole those bikes when we were in uniform so they knew we went to Southfields school. One guy got taken by the teacher, the other got a call saying: \u2018Don\u2019t touch the bike.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI get a call the next day saying everyone\u2019s saying I stole the bike. I had to go down to the police station, explain everything. The guy who stole the bike was short and fat with canerows. I was skinny with no hair. Obviously I still had to go because five or six people said it was me and they were meant to be my friends.</p> <p>\u201cThe next day I go to school angry, squaring up to everybody. I went to the last person and he\u2019s gone: \u2018Do you wanna fight me?\u2019 I\u2019m about to lose my head and his hand reaches into his bag. I\u2019m running at him, my nephew pulls me back. I find out within an hour the guy had a knife. I\u2019m about to fight this guy and he might have stabbed me. From there I\u2019ve just been the calmest person there is.\u201d</p> <p>Not every child achieves that clarity. Antonio knows about gang culture and he despairs at the recent rise in knife crime in London, arguing that the young are being failed by the people in power. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 times worse than when I was growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve completely lost touch of how we need to treat kids. London is becoming more of a business than a place for families. You can\u2019t live here. We\u2019re not investing in the future.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to buy a house. Everything\u2019s turned into business blocks. There\u2019s hardly any parks any more. Every little space of green is turned into flats. Kids will always be there. People who are businessmen and women will turn into family. So what about kids coming up now? There is nothing for them to do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8707ce8f33875d27100e4479103e0c10096fafb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8707ce8f33875d27100e4479103e0c10096fafb6/100_112_3812_2287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michail Antonio thinks West Ham can improve after their recent poor form which cost Manuel Pellegrini his job.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michail Antonio thinks West Ham can improve after their recent poor form which cost Manuel Pellegrini his job.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Antonio, who was unhurt in a Christmas Day car crash, had it different. He buzzes when he remembers his childhood, which was mainly spent playing football. He loved going to youth centres or adventure playgrounds. He remembers the tuck shop. He remembers playing table tennis, pool and PlayStation. Above all, he remembers making friends. And now? \u201cThey\u2019re all shut down or you have to pay for them and people can\u2019t afford it any more,\u201d Antonio says. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve played the blame game. I\u2019m blaming the government for shutting down all these youth centres and adventure playgrounds.</p> <p>\u201cKids now wouldn\u2019t know about youth centres. I just feel if they had the opportunity to do that they wouldn\u2019t be on the side of the street trying to cause chaos. But when you\u2019re bored you just try to do things and half the time it is mischievous.\u201d</p> <p>This is where charities such as FBB have an impact. The goal is to show kids another way, to lead them down a better path, and Antonio is proof that dedication pays off. It all began for him in non-league football, with Tooting &amp; Mitcham, and he remembers his father worrying about his future. \u201cI was turning 16 and asking him for money,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was like: \u2018You\u2019re old enough to work now.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll play football.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s not a job.\u2019\u201d A cheeky smile. \u201cI went to my mum and she\u2019d give me the money.\u201d</p> <p>Antonio\u2019s elder brother urged him to stick at it. He worked his way up the ladder, starting with Reading, and West Ham were smart to sign him for \u00a37m from Nottingham Forest in 2015. Antonio is unpolished but Premier League defenders hate playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/29/michail-antonio-morphs-invisible-man-shining-light-west-ham-england-sam-allardyce\" title=\"\">against his speed and strength</a>.</p> <p>West Ham, who visit Gillingham in the FA Cup on Sunday, are on a bad run and have replaced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/31/david-moyes-west-ham-manager-old-new\" title=\"\">Manuel Pellegrini with David Moyes</a>. \u201cThis is my fifth season and every year we hit a blip,\u201d Antonio says. \u201cBut then after that we pick up and go again. I just feel it should be a bit tighter as a team.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/west-ham-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham put four past Bournemouth to welcome back David Moyes in style</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Antonio\u2019s respect for his brother is obvious. \u201cHe\u2019s the first person I speak to for advice,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was the time when I thought about joining a gang. When you\u2019re young and the girls are attracted to the bad boys, the bad boys had all the money. I didn\u2019t have much so I wanted to attract that. But my brother was like: \u2018Why would you join one gang when you know someone in that other gang? You\u2019ll have to fight your own friends.\u2019 That happened two months after that discussion. One of my friends stabbed another friend. He died.\u201d</p> <p>For Antonio, the key is a close support network. He remembers a teacher at Southfields, Mr Holt, who always stuck up for him when he was in trouble. The reality, though, is that not every child can count on that safety net. What happens then?</p> <p>\u201cHe gets kicked out of school and you can never tell what he\u2019s going to be,\u201d Antonio says. \u201cWhen I was younger there were kids who got kicked out of school and ended up selling drugs and ended up in prison. There are other kids who got kicked out and they managed to make their own career.</p> <p>\u201cThese charities and social events help these kids shape their personality and realise that distracting the class or having a short temper is just unnecessary. Life is a results game. You turn up late for work four or five times, you get sacked. It\u2019s doing the right things and that\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about life. Everything is about results.\u201d</p> <p><em>Michail Antonio was speaking at a Football Beyond Borders event in partnership with Unique Sports Management, aiming to support 1,000 young people back into education in 2020</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI had a short temper growing up,\u201d Michail Antonio says. \u201cWhen I was younger, from primary school to 14, you just needed to call me a dickhead and I\u2019d have a fight with you. A physical fight. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d An angry Antonio is difficult to picture. From afar the West Ham forward seems the happy type, a cult hero who always has a funny goal celebration up his sleeve, and this 29-year-old father of three does not disappoint when we meet at Football Beyond Borders\u2019 office in Brixton. Antonio has given up his Thursday evening to support FBB, an education charity that uses the power of football to support disadvantaged young people in the United Kingdom, and it does not take long to understand how much community means to him. Antonio is from south London and he looks a natural while mentoring a group of boys who have struggled at school and are here because FBB has teamed up with the Wellness Project, a homelessness charity, to provide care packages for young people living on the streets during Christmas. \u201cThey remind me of my school days,\u201d he says. \u201cGrowing up in south London you are naturally quite boisterous.\u201d Antonio speaks from the heart and he tells a story about losing the anger. \u201cI was 14,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve gone with my friends to Tooting to chill with them. Two of my friends end up going to Graveney [a school]. They stole two bikes off two kids. I was there. The next day, the idiots rode those bikes to school. They stole those bikes when we were in uniform so they knew we went to Southfields school. One guy got taken by the teacher, the other got a call saying: \u2018Don\u2019t touch the bike.\u2019 \u201cI get a call the next day saying everyone\u2019s saying I stole the bike. I had to go down to the police station, explain everything. The guy who stole the bike was short and fat with canerows. I was skinny with no hair. Obviously I still had to go because five or six people said it was me and they were meant to be my friends. \u201cThe next day I go to school angry, squaring up to everybody. I went to the last person and he\u2019s gone: \u2018Do you wanna fight me?\u2019 I\u2019m about to lose my head and his hand reaches into his bag. I\u2019m running at him, my nephew pulls me back. I find out within an hour the guy had a knife. I\u2019m about to fight this guy and he might have stabbed me. From there I\u2019ve just been the calmest person there is.\u201d Not every child achieves that clarity. Antonio knows about gang culture and he despairs at the recent rise in knife crime in London, arguing that the young are being failed by the people in power. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 times worse than when I was growing up,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve completely lost touch of how we need to treat kids. London is becoming more of a business than a place for families. You can\u2019t live here. We\u2019re not investing in the future. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to buy a house. Everything\u2019s turned into business blocks. There\u2019s hardly any parks any more. Every little space of green is turned into flats. Kids will always be there. People who are businessmen and women will turn into family. So what about kids coming up now? There is nothing for them to do.\u201d Antonio, who was unhurt in a Christmas Day car crash, had it different. He buzzes when he remembers his childhood, which was mainly spent playing football. He loved going to youth centres or adventure playgrounds. He remembers the tuck shop. He remembers playing table tennis, pool and PlayStation. Above all, he remembers making friends. And now? \u201cThey\u2019re all shut down or you have to pay for them and people can\u2019t afford it any more,\u201d Antonio says. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve played the blame game. I\u2019m blaming the government for shutting down all these youth centres and adventure playgrounds. \u201cKids now wouldn\u2019t know about youth centres. I just feel if they had the opportunity to do that they wouldn\u2019t be on the side of the street trying to cause chaos. But when you\u2019re bored you just try to do things and half the time it is mischievous.\u201d This is where charities such as FBB have an impact. The goal is to show kids another way, to lead them down a better path, and Antonio is proof that dedication pays off. It all began for him in non-league football, with Tooting &amp; Mitcham, and he remembers his father worrying about his future. \u201cI was turning 16 and asking him for money,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was like: \u2018You\u2019re old enough to work now.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll play football.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s not a job.\u2019\u201d A cheeky smile. \u201cI went to my mum and she\u2019d give me the money.\u201d Antonio\u2019s elder brother urged him to stick at it. He worked his way up the ladder, starting with Reading, and West Ham were smart to sign him for \u00a37m from Nottingham Forest in 2015. Antonio is unpolished but Premier League defenders hate playing against his speed and strength. West Ham, who visit Gillingham in the FA Cup on Sunday, are on a bad run and have replaced Manuel Pellegrini with David Moyes. \u201cThis is my fifth season and every year we hit a blip,\u201d Antonio says. \u201cBut then after that we pick up and go again. I just feel it should be a bit tighter as a team.\u201d Antonio\u2019s respect for his brother is obvious. \u201cHe\u2019s the first person I speak to for advice,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was the time when I thought about joining a gang. When you\u2019re young and the girls are attracted to the bad boys, the bad boys had all the money. I didn\u2019t have much so I wanted to attract that. But my brother was like: \u2018Why would you join one gang when you know someone in that other gang? You\u2019ll have to fight your own friends.\u2019 That happened two months after that discussion. One of my friends stabbed another friend. He died.\u201d For Antonio, the key is a close support network. He remembers a teacher at Southfields, Mr Holt, who always stuck up for him when he was in trouble. The reality, though, is that not every child can count on that safety net. What happens then? \u201cHe gets kicked out of school and you can never tell what he\u2019s going to be,\u201d Antonio says. \u201cWhen I was younger there were kids who got kicked out of school and ended up selling drugs and ended up in prison. There are other kids who got kicked out and they managed to make their own career. \u201cThese charities and social events help these kids shape their personality and realise that distracting the class or having a short temper is just unnecessary. Life is a results game. You turn up late for work four or five times, you get sacked. It\u2019s doing the right things and that\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about life. Everything is about results.\u201d Michail Antonio was speaking at a Football Beyond Borders event in partnership with Unique Sports Management, aiming to support 1,000 young people back into education in 2020",

      "body": "<p>So much for the idea that bull markets in shares die of old age. This theory has been widely touted for at least the past four years and, 12 months ago, it seemed as if the naysayers were on to something. Global share prices, as measured by the broad MSCI World index, fell 3% in 2018, with much of the blame pinned on the brewing China-US trade war. But then came 2019: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/31/global-stock-markets-post-best-year-since-financial-crisis\" title=\"\">a surge of 24% in the same index</a>.</p> <p>Life doesn\u2019t seem quite as nice if you gaze solely at the FTSE 100 index \u2013 a fall of 12.5% in 2018 and a rebound of 12% in 2019. Still, last year was the best performance in three years for the London market\u2019s blue chip index. Death by old age did not occur.</p> <p>Can the run continue? Predicting major turns in stock markets is a mug\u2019s game and you would be hard-pressed to find a single forecaster with a convincing record over the necessary span of a few decades. There are too many factors at play. We can, though, perhaps say this about the outlook for 2020: if you\u2019re hunting for events that could derail a bull market, the current list is long.</p> <p>Indeed, it became significantly longer at the end of last week with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/qassem-suleimani-iran-death-middle-east-us-trump\" title=\"\">the killing by US drone of the powerful Iranian general Qassem Suleimani</a>. The oil market \u2013 which clearly contains the potential to upset global growth \u2013 reacted by pushing up the price of crude by more than 3%, but that modest reaction may be a useless guide if a new chapter in Middle East instability has begun.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A change in the interest-rate weather is the most common cause of a turn in stock markets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If retaliation by Iran took the form of strikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities or tankers passing through the strait of Hormuz \u2013 a critical route for a fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply \u2013 it is safe to assume the price of a barrel of crude would go substantially higher.</p> <p>Then there is the US-China trade quarrel, investors\u2019 obsession for the past 18 months. The buoyancy in stock markets in the past year has flowed largely from a reappraisal of events: instead of fretting about a breakdown in relations, the market switched to applauding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/13/china-confirms-phase-one-trade-deal-us-tariffs\" title=\"\">President Trump\u2019s promised arrival of a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal</a>. Since Trump has a re-election campaign to fight this year, goes the reasoning, he won\u2019t want to risk sending stock prices lower by disappointing investors with the fine details.</p> <p>That theory, though, feels a little too comfortable. A lot of faith has been invested in the idea that a successful first phase makes a wider deal, and the removal of all major tariffs, inevitable. Things are rarely so straightforward with Trump.</p> <p>Closer to home, one could make a similar point about the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trade negotiation with the EU. UK manufacturers, in particular, still have every reason to fear that their supply chains could be seriously disrupted. Trade negotiations can have messy conclusions.</p> <p>Behind all those factors sits the knowledge that a change in the interest-rate weather is the most common cause of a turn in stock markets. Back in 2018, investors worried about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to tighten policy and then, in 2019, were cheered by the Fed backing off. That soft-shoe shuffle, though, can\u2019t disguise the fact that central banks\u2019 ability to fight any recession with cheaper money is limited. Coffers are depleted all around the world, even if China opened the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/02/financial-markets-surge-after-87bn-chinese-cash-boost\" title=\"\">by pumping money into its financial system</a>.</p> <p>Bull markets, as the old saying goes, climb the wall of worry. It is perfectly possible they will continue to do so in 2020: to repeat, age is not the barrier. But it looks a brave bet given the risks from so many directions. After a 24% gain in 2019, merely going sideways would count as a decent result.</p> <h2>Mayors must get a say in future of Northern rail franchise<br></h2> <p>The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, started 2020 by telling passengers to expect \u201ca year of action towards creating a rail industry relentlessly focused on improving their experience\u201d. His first offering, though, was more a piece of non-action.</p> <p>Northern rail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/03/grant-shapps-faces-calls-set-out-strategy-future-northern-rail\" title=\"\">could be stripped of its franchise</a> and replaced by a state-owned \u201coperator of last resort\u201d; but, then again, the current operator, Arriva, could be handed a new contract with revised terms. Shapps hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet.</p> <p>What he really meant by \u201cyear of action\u201d was that the government will publish a white paper this year with proposals to reform the running of the railways. That, at least, is something to cheer. Customer satisfaction is the lowest it has been for a decade, especially among commuters \u2013 and on Northern\u2019s patch the mood could be called furious. Almost everyone agrees reform is needed.</p> <p>What form should it take? Keith Williams, former chief executive of BA, will publish his government-commissioned review in the coming weeks and the broad outline seems clear: less day-to-day control by the Department for Transport; a new national body to coordinate the system; and an end to the franchising system in its current form, though still with private sector participation.</p> <p>The deeply unclear part, though, is how much local control to grant. In the case of Northern, the answer should be: as much as possible. It\u2019s what the mayors of Manchester and Liverpool want and, given that London already has greater control via Transport for London, their request should be granted.</p> <p>Arriva, it should be said, is not a caricature villain with its Northern franchise; some faults are beyond its control, such as delays caused by Network Rail, the state-controlled owner and operator of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure. But the point remains: if you really want a system that responds actively to customers, take more decisions locally.</p> <h2><br>Regulation could lengthen odds on bright future for bookies</h2> <p>With a potentially pivotal year ahead for the UK gambling industry, battle lines are already being drawn. High street bookmakers lost their fight against tighter restrictions on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) last year as the government bowed to pressure and slashed the maximum permitted stake from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. The industry fought hard against any curbs at all but this draconian restriction means a dependable cash cow was brutally sacrificed.</p> <p>Now, campaigners are preparing to open a new front, this time on online gambling. In a report late last year, a group of MPs who were instrumental in the FOBT campaign asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/03/call-for-radical-overhaul-of-online-casinos-after-far-reaching-inquiry\" title=\"\">why the same restriction \u2013 a maximum \u00a32 stake \u2013 should not also apply to online slot machines</a>. When the stock market opened the following day, investors, detecting the rumble of approaching regulation, ditched gambling shares to the tune of \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Then, last week, the <em>Guardian</em> revealed that regulator the Gambling Commission was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/gambling-report-shows-industrys-reliance-on-loss-making-customers\" title=\"\">considering a ban on \u201cVIP\u201d schemes</a>. These programmes single out customers who lose large sums and offer them loyalty rewards \u2013 cashback on losing bets, free bonus \u201cspins\u201d, even football or boxing tickets.</p> <p>According to data compiled by the Commission, one operator derives 83% of its account deposits from VIPs, even though they make up only 2% of accounts.</p> <p>If these schemes go the way of FOBTs, it could deal a serious blow to online gambling revenues. Factor in other possible changes, such as a ban on credit card betting or tighter affordability checks, and the immediate future looks potentially bleak for bookies.</p> <p>The industry, via a newly formed trade body called the Betting &amp; Gaming Council, is reportedly ready to come out swinging, defending itself more effectively than it did over FOBTs.</p> <p>But recent history shows that the house doesn\u2019t always win any more.</p>",

If retaliation by Iran took the form of strikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities or tankers passing through the strait of Hormuz \u2013 a critical route for a fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply \u2013 it is safe to assume the price of a barrel of crude would go substantially higher. Then there is the US-China trade quarrel, investors\u2019 obsession for the past 18 months. The buoyancy in stock markets in the past year has flowed largely from a reappraisal of events: instead of fretting about a breakdown in relations, the market switched to applauding President Trump\u2019s promised arrival of a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal. Since Trump has a re-election campaign to fight this year, goes the reasoning, he won\u2019t want to risk sending stock prices lower by disappointing investors with the fine details. That theory, though, feels a little too comfortable. A lot of faith has been invested in the idea that a successful first phase makes a wider deal, and the removal of all major tariffs, inevitable. Things are rarely so straightforward with Trump. Closer to home, one could make a similar point about the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trade negotiation with the EU. UK manufacturers, in particular, still have every reason to fear that their supply chains could be seriously disrupted. Trade negotiations can have messy conclusions. Behind all those factors sits the knowledge that a change in the interest-rate weather is the most common cause of a turn in stock markets. Back in 2018, investors worried about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to tighten policy and then, in 2019, were cheered by the Fed backing off. That soft-shoe shuffle, though, can\u2019t disguise the fact that central banks\u2019 ability to fight any recession with cheaper money is limited. Coffers are depleted all around the world, even if China opened the year by pumping money into its financial system. Bull markets, as the old saying goes, climb the wall of worry. It is perfectly possible they will continue to do so in 2020: to repeat, age is not the barrier. But it looks a brave bet given the risks from so many directions. After a 24% gain in 2019, merely going sideways would count as a decent result. Mayors must get a say in future of Northern rail franchise The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, started 2020 by telling passengers to expect \u201ca year of action towards creating a rail industry relentlessly focused on improving their experience\u201d. His first offering, though, was more a piece of non-action. Northern rail could be stripped of its franchise and replaced by a state-owned \u201coperator of last resort\u201d; but, then again, the current operator, Arriva, could be handed a new contract with revised terms. Shapps hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet. What he really meant by \u201cyear of action\u201d was that the government will publish a white paper this year with proposals to reform the running of the railways. That, at least, is something to cheer. Customer satisfaction is the lowest it has been for a decade, especially among commuters \u2013 and on Northern\u2019s patch the mood could be called furious. Almost everyone agrees reform is needed. What form should it take? Keith Williams, former chief executive of BA, will publish his government-commissioned review in the coming weeks and the broad outline seems clear: less day-to-day control by the Department for Transport; a new national body to coordinate the system; and an end to the franchising system in its current form, though still with private sector participation. The deeply unclear part, though, is how much local control to grant. In the case of Northern, the answer should be: as much as possible. It\u2019s what the mayors of Manchester and Liverpool want and, given that London already has greater control via Transport for London, their request should be granted. Arriva, it should be said, is not a caricature villain with its Northern franchise; some faults are beyond its control, such as delays caused by Network Rail, the state-controlled owner and operator of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure. But the point remains: if you really want a system that responds actively to customers, take more decisions locally. Regulation could lengthen odds on bright future for bookies With a potentially pivotal year ahead for the UK gambling industry, battle lines are already being drawn. High street bookmakers lost their fight against tighter restrictions on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) last year as the government bowed to pressure and slashed the maximum permitted stake from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. The industry fought hard against any curbs at all but this draconian restriction means a dependable cash cow was brutally sacrificed. Now, campaigners are preparing to open a new front, this time on online gambling. In a report late last year, a group of MPs who were instrumental in the FOBT campaign asked why the same restriction \u2013 a maximum \u00a32 stake \u2013 should not also apply to online slot machines. When the stock market opened the following day, investors, detecting the rumble of approaching regulation, ditched gambling shares to the tune of \u00a31bn. Then, last week, the Guardian revealed that regulator the Gambling Commission was considering a ban on \u201cVIP\u201d schemes. These programmes single out customers who lose large sums and offer them loyalty rewards \u2013 cashback on losing bets, free bonus \u201cspins\u201d, even football or boxing tickets. According to data compiled by the Commission, one operator derives 83% of its account deposits from VIPs, even though they make up only 2% of accounts. If these schemes go the way of FOBTs, it could deal a serious blow to online gambling revenues. Factor in other possible changes, such as a ban on credit card betting or tighter affordability checks, and the immediate future looks potentially bleak for bookies. The industry, via a newly formed trade body called the Betting &amp; Gaming Council, is reportedly ready to come out swinging, defending itself more effectively than it did over FOBTs. But recent history shows that the house doesn\u2019t always win any more.",

It\u2019s where my partner and I had our first rendezvous.</p> <p><strong>And Sunday night?</strong> There\u2019s no routine. If I\u2019m visiting a city for research I try to meet older artists, to record their history. I prepare my Instagram for the week ahead, too.

We never cook at home; there are books all over the kitchen. I\u2019ve even curated shows in it. My partner, Koo Jeong A, and I have coffee and a conversation out every morning. On Sundays we talk for longer, picking a new spot every time. A day out? To London Zoo. I like to visit the animals, but it\u2019s mostly for the architecture. The Snowdon Aviary was designed by Cedric Price, Frank Newby and Antony Armstrong-Jones in the 1960s. What\u2019s extraordinary is how it moves with the weather. It\u2019s my favourite structure in the capital. Do you work? I visit artists\u2019 studios. My week is full of meetings, dinners and performances. On Sunday, I meet artists in the spaces they work in. It\u2019s liberated time, a moment of delinking. How were Sundays spent growing up? We lived in eastern Switzerland, near Lake Constance \u2013 waters shared by three countries. I spent a lot of time crossing borders \u2013 Germany, Austria \u2013 surrounded by a whole host of languages. A favourite spot? Caf\u00e9 de Flore in Paris. I love it not for the food or the drinks, but for the life-changing conversations and encounters I\u2019ve had there. It\u2019s where my partner and I had our first rendezvous. And Sunday night? There\u2019s no routine. If I\u2019m visiting a city for research I try to meet older artists, to record their history. I prepare my Instagram for the week ahead, too. I post notes and doodles from artists, architects and poets. We live in an age of extinction. I want to celebrate things that disappear.",

The shock claim is made by David Snoxell, a former British high commissioner to Mauritius from whom Britain purchased the islands in 1965. The UK\u2019s claim to the islands \u2013 and its subsequent eviction of their inhabitants to make way for the US base \u2013 is deeply contentious and has been the subject of escalating legal challenges. Last February the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principal judicial body of the United Nations, issued an advisory opinion that found the UK was in unlawful occupation of the islands and demanded that they be returned to Mauritius as quickly as possible. The UN general assembly endorsed the opinion in May and set a deadline for implementation of 22 November 2019, which the UK ignored. \u201cIt must be in the UK\u2019s interest to be seen to abide by international law, especially now the UK is in search of a new role in the world, following withdrawal from the EU and the uncertainty of our special relationship with the US,\u201d Snoxell said. \u201cTo continue in breach of human rights and the rule of law will have implications for the UK\u2019s reputation and permanent seat on the security council, as happened in November 2017 when for the first time the UK judge on the ICJ failed to be re-elected.

      "body": "<p>Vaping companies could be asked to fund research into the health effects of flavoured liquids used in e-cigarettes under plans being considered by the UK\u2019s medicines watchdog. The proposal, outlined to the <em>Observer</em> by an expert on tobacco control, comes as studies link e-liquid flavours such as mint, creme brulee and cinnamon to heart and lung problems.</p> <p>Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50978321\" title=\"\">US announced a ban on most e-liquid flavours</a> over fears that vaping has reached epidemic proportions among teenagers. But this ban applies only to vape \u201cpods\u201d \u2013 individual cartridges used in vape pens to deliver flavour popular with young people \u2013 and not to the larger \u201ctanks\u201d, and some experts worry that users will simply switch.</p> <p>Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at Nottingham University, who sits on the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)\u2019s panel on e-cigarettes, said flavours were really important to smokers: \u201cIf you restrict the flavours, you may restrict the tolerability of vaping to people trying it for the first time, but you will also lose an awful lot of smokers.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no way of saying that cinnamon is safer than orange. I don\u2019t see how you draw the line</p> <footer> <cite>John Britton, health expert</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The US\u2019s shift has invited scrutiny of the UK\u2019s stance on e-liquids, which has been criticised by bodies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/14/vaping-flavours-health-concern-children\" title=\"\">such as the European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee</a>. An expert committee on toxicity will report to the Department of Health in the spring but it is not expected to recommend that flavours be banned. Alternatives to a ban are being explored, Britton said. \u201cOne suggestion is for vaping companies to club together to get flavours licensed. This would give these companies a marketing advantage and perhaps set their shareholders\u2019 concerns about future litigation at rest. Most vaping companies are small, and can\u2019t afford the time or investment in to get a flavour through the medicine licensing process.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cThe only way that could happen would really be if a number of companies grouped together and applied for a common licence for a particular flavour or set of flavours. Then you would have something that would be safe to medicinal standards and at that point you can stop worrying about it.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the larger vaping companies are owned by big tobacco, which has a history of manipulating scientific evidence. Measures would be needed to ensure any flavour testing was carried out by independent experts selected by the relevant health bodies. A new testing regime could see the end to certain flavours.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the list of flavours that are available in the UK, it\u2019s huge,\u201d Britton said. \u201cIt would be very hard to argue that all of those are necessary but how do you then say \u2018this one is OK and this one isn\u2019t\u2019? You could say \u2018OK, no flavours\u2019 in which case you will make vaping unacceptable to most vapers. Or you could say \u2018we\u2019ll allow a limited list of, say, half a dozen flavours\u2019. But how do you decide what those should be? There is no way of saying that cinnamon is safer than orange. I don\u2019t see how you draw the line.\u201d</p> <p>Compared with the US, the UK heavily regulates the promotion of e-cigarettes to young people. However, the number of young users in the UK has increased in recent years.</p> <p>A UK Vaping Industry spokeswoman said: \u201cAll nicotine-containing flavours are submitted to the MHRA for testing to ensure that no toxic compounds are formed in the process of vaping and we work vigorously to make sure that non-regulated products do not enter the UK market. We work collaboratively with UK regulators to ensure that the highest production standards are adhered to, not only over the manufacture of vaping equipment and liquids, but also to ensure full compliance by our members with the strict rules that forbid sales and marketing aimed at under-18s.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vaping companies could be asked to fund research into the health effects of flavoured liquids used in e-cigarettes under plans being considered by the UK\u2019s medicines watchdog. The proposal, outlined to the Observer by an expert on tobacco control, comes as studies link e-liquid flavours such as mint, creme brulee and cinnamon to heart and lung problems. Last week, the US announced a ban on most e-liquid flavours over fears that vaping has reached epidemic proportions among teenagers. But this ban applies only to vape \u201cpods\u201d \u2013 individual cartridges used in vape pens to deliver flavour popular with young people \u2013 and not to the larger \u201ctanks\u201d, and some experts worry that users will simply switch. Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at Nottingham University, who sits on the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)\u2019s panel on e-cigarettes, said flavours were really important to smokers: \u201cIf you restrict the flavours, you may restrict the tolerability of vaping to people trying it for the first time, but you will also lose an awful lot of smokers.\u201d The US\u2019s shift has invited scrutiny of the UK\u2019s stance on e-liquids, which has been criticised by bodies such as the European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee. An expert committee on toxicity will report to the Department of Health in the spring but it is not expected to recommend that flavours be banned. Alternatives to a ban are being explored, Britton said. \u201cOne suggestion is for vaping companies to club together to get flavours licensed. This would give these companies a marketing advantage and perhaps set their shareholders\u2019 concerns about future litigation at rest. Most vaping companies are small, and can\u2019t afford the time or investment in to get a flavour through the medicine licensing process.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe only way that could happen would really be if a number of companies grouped together and applied for a common licence for a particular flavour or set of flavours. Then you would have something that would be safe to medicinal standards and at that point you can stop worrying about it.\u201d Some of the larger vaping companies are owned by big tobacco, which has a history of manipulating scientific evidence. Measures would be needed to ensure any flavour testing was carried out by independent experts selected by the relevant health bodies. A new testing regime could see the end to certain flavours. \u201cIf you look at the list of flavours that are available in the UK, it\u2019s huge,\u201d Britton said. \u201cIt would be very hard to argue that all of those are necessary but how do you then say \u2018this one is OK and this one isn\u2019t\u2019? You could say \u2018OK, no flavours\u2019 in which case you will make vaping unacceptable to most vapers. Or you could say \u2018we\u2019ll allow a limited list of, say, half a dozen flavours\u2019. But how do you decide what those should be? There is no way of saying that cinnamon is safer than orange. I don\u2019t see how you draw the line.\u201d Compared with the US, the UK heavily regulates the promotion of e-cigarettes to young people. However, the number of young users in the UK has increased in recent years. A UK Vaping Industry spokeswoman said: \u201cAll nicotine-containing flavours are submitted to the MHRA for testing to ensure that no toxic compounds are formed in the process of vaping and we work vigorously to make sure that non-regulated products do not enter the UK market. We work collaboratively with UK regulators to ensure that the highest production standards are adhered to, not only over the manufacture of vaping equipment and liquids, but also to ensure full compliance by our members with the strict rules that forbid sales and marketing aimed at under-18s.\u201d",

Yet this renewed interest in extraterrestrial matters is real as we make clear in our survey of forthcoming space missions. Not since the heyday of the space race to the moon in the 60s has so much space activity been planned, though this time missions will not be dominated by America and Russia but will also involve China, India and Japan as well as private companies such as SpaceX and Boeing, which plan to launch their own manned spaceships. For good measure, the European Space Agency, of which Britain is a major, active participant, has also decided over the past few weeks to step up its commitment to space exploration with a \u20ac12.5bn (\u00a310.7bn) package of projects.

On a beautiful Edinburgh summer\u2019s day when the sun barely bothers to set, this could be joyous. I go on a late November day, when half the North Sea is being deposited on the hilltop. I feel intrepid simply for getting to the door.</p> <p>There is one other challenge. In the evenings, like its sister restaurant, the <a href=\"https://www.thegardenerscottage.co/\" title=\"\">Gardener\u2019s Cottage</a> at the bottom of the hill, it only serves a tasting menu. It\u2019s \u00a350 for five courses and \u00a370 for seven. There\u2019s quite a lot of this in Edinburgh right now. They do something similar at <a href=\"https://www.timberyard.co/\" title=\"\">Timberyard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sixbynico.co.uk/edinburgh/\" title=\"\">Six by Nico</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thetableedinburgh.com/\" title=\"\">the Table</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aizle.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Aizle</a> and a few others beside. If they\u2019re finding enough custom happy to have what they\u2019re given, then good for them. But too often a tasting menu feels to me like double maths, only with fancy glasses and better-dressed teachers. It\u2019s to be endured. And then paid for.</p> <p>That is the case for the prosecution. Here then is the defence: at lunchtime, when it\u2019s a short \u00e0 la carte, the Lookout is worth busting your lungs for. The view is spectacular, even when the cloud-base is descending on the city like a duvet being chucked over a bed, but you won\u2019t look up much because the food is so diverting. It is simple ideas, well executed, using great ingredients in the service of big flavours. Across our lunch everything feels thoughtful and thought out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"561a09833d28fa84ab19ba48c50e50fcdc3c2ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/561a09833d28fa84ab19ba48c50e50fcdc3c2ecc/0_124_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018In a puddle of buttery broth bringing it all together\u2019: hake, mussels and leeks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In a puddle of buttery broth bringing it all together\u2019: hake, mussels and leeks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three fat rock oysters arrive. One is in a crisp, lacy tempura overcoat. The other two are unadorned, but come with a shell generously filled with their own XO sauce. It\u2019s a deep rust colour, and rich with the profound savouriness of dried seafood and sugar and oils. I know I\u2019m meant to put it on the oysters, and I do, but I also end up spooning it away neat, until I\u2019m scraping at the mother-of-pearl. They come with a well-made sourdough and lick-the-plate-clean butter.</p> <p>There are just four choices for the first two courses. The star of our starters is a cuttlefish risotto made night-black from the ink. On top are the very freshest of cockles still in the shell, which are salty and sweet and bright. Cockles are the equal of any poulard clam, but most of them get ripped from their shells, pickled and sent away to people with more taste. We suck at the meat then use the shells to scoop away. There are a few bitter leaves on top wilting gently in the heat. By comparison a frothy bowl of pumpkin soup, the surface sprinkled with pumpkin seeds, seems almost demure. But glancing up at the rain slapping the glass like a cat demanding to be let in, this soup suddenly makes it feel as if the food and weather have been matched. Bouncing around in the bottom of the bowl are squeaky, fresh beechnuts. Both of these dishes are \u00a38. It\u2019s a lot for the soup, and very good value for the risotto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"982edfa46c666295d14046a462f554f3fcc4ab5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/982edfa46c666295d14046a462f554f3fcc4ab5b/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beef with Jerusalem artichokes on a round white plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Perfectly grilled and glazed\u2019: beef with Jerusalem artichokes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A chunk of pearly hake, the flakes sliding away from each other, sits atop an unmanicured mess of gently saut\u00e9ed leeks, nutty new potatoes and melon-bellied mussels, which are a warming shade of tangerine. It is described as coming with \u201ccurry\u201d, which in this case means the puddle of buttery broth bringing it all together has been spiced lightly with a garam masala.</p> <p>The darkness to this lightness is a perfectly grilled and glazed beef fillet, with roasted and charcoal-grilled pieces of Jerusalem artichoke. There\u2019s also a jug of a luscious onion broth to pour over it all. We have been sniffing all this on the air for so long now it\u2019s almost a relief to be eating it \u2013 for, while major extraction has been fitted, it really isn\u2019t up to the job. Occasionally, they try opening the front door to let a little of the smoke out, but the weather is determined and angry. Get a table as near to a window as possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56b061ec0808e55b876e35a3a989eb7a11efc079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56b061ec0808e55b876e35a3a989eb7a11efc079/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crescent of apple tart and a blob of cream on a round dark plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Chunks of fruit roasted to golden\u2019: apple tart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside, we have grilled and blackened hispi cabbage \u2013 I love acrylamide, me; no really, I do \u2013 with dollops of Berkswell cheese, and more cheese grated over the top, plus pink fir potatoes still in their skins, first fried then roasted. Remember, this is Edinburgh on a dreich day. You will need something to sustain you on the trip down the hill. We finish with a slab of apple tart, made with chunks of fruit roasted to golden, and a whipped chocolate mousse, with booze-soaked prunes and a chocolate tuile. It\u2019s not uncommon for strangers to tell me how jealous they are of what I do for a living. I tell them it\u2019s a writing job not an eating job, and so on. But reading this back, even I\u2019m jealous of me.</p> <p>Of course, there is a price, which is not helped by a short wine list that opens at \u00a329 for a bottle of Moscatel and doesn\u2019t loiter for long in the \u00a330s. Two glasses of admittedly terrific Albari\u00f1o come in at \u00a327. With mains around the \u00a320 mark the bill will build up quickly, though there is a no-choice three-course set lunch from Monday to Friday for \u00a325. Think of it as high-altitude dining, with prices to match. And be prepared to put all your clothes in the wash the moment you get home. Taken in the round, however, I\u2019d put it all in the column headed \u201cAbsolutely worth it.\u201d</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>It also takes effort to get to the Moorcock Inn, high on the moor at Sowerby Bridge, but it will be rewarded. Chef Alisdair Brooke-Taylor and his partner Aimee Turford, who runs front of house, walk the line between generous boozer and cutting-edge restaurant. The pub menu might include baked sea bass or a game terrine with pickles; the restaurant tasting menu, a snip at \u00a339 for nine dishes each, heads off towards crab with creamed corn and fermented mushrooms and celeriac with goat ricotta (<em><a href=\"https://www.themoorcock.co.uk/\">themoorcock.co.uk</a></em>).</p> <p>The top 100 UK restaurant list, compiled by the crowd-sourced guide Harden\u2019s from their contributor\u2019s reports, makes interesting reading. 10% of them are Indian, Kent is the strongest county in the UK, and the North West makes the strongest showing after the South East (<em><a href=\"https://www.hardens.com/\">hardens.com</a></em>).</p> <p>While some high street chains are finding the going tough, others are prospering. Pizza chain Franco Manca, which started as a single outlet in South London, has reported half year revenues up 9% to \u00a336 million. David Page, chairman of parent company Fulham Shore, says they have identified 40 UK towns and cities for openings over the next five years, which would bring the total to 90 sites.</p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>",

A chunk of pearly hake, the flakes sliding away from each other, sits atop an unmanicured mess of gently saut\u00e9ed leeks, nutty new potatoes and melon-bellied mussels, which are a warming shade of tangerine. It is described as coming with \u201ccurry\u201d, which in this case means the puddle of buttery broth bringing it all together has been spiced lightly with a garam masala. The darkness to this lightness is a perfectly grilled and glazed beef fillet, with roasted and charcoal-grilled pieces of Jerusalem artichoke. There\u2019s also a jug of a luscious onion broth to pour over it all. We have been sniffing all this on the air for so long now it\u2019s almost a relief to be eating it \u2013 for, while major extraction has been fitted, it really isn\u2019t up to the job. Occasionally, they try opening the front door to let a little of the smoke out, but the weather is determined and angry. Get a table as near to a window as possible. Alongside, we have grilled and blackened hispi cabbage \u2013 I love acrylamide, me; no really, I do \u2013 with dollops of Berkswell cheese, and more cheese grated over the top, plus pink fir potatoes still in their skins, first fried then roasted. Remember, this is Edinburgh on a dreich day. You will need something to sustain you on the trip down the hill. We finish with a slab of apple tart, made with chunks of fruit roasted to golden, and a whipped chocolate mousse, with booze-soaked prunes and a chocolate tuile. It\u2019s not uncommon for strangers to tell me how jealous they are of what I do for a living. I tell them it\u2019s a writing job not an eating job, and so on. But reading this back, even I\u2019m jealous of me. Of course, there is a price, which is not helped by a short wine list that opens at \u00a329 for a bottle of Moscatel and doesn\u2019t loiter for long in the \u00a330s. Two glasses of admittedly terrific Albari\u00f1o come in at \u00a327. With mains around the \u00a320 mark the bill will build up quickly, though there is a no-choice three-course set lunch from Monday to Friday for \u00a325. Think of it as high-altitude dining, with prices to match. And be prepared to put all your clothes in the wash the moment you get home. Taken in the round, however, I\u2019d put it all in the column headed \u201cAbsolutely worth it.\u201d News bites It also takes effort to get to the Moorcock Inn, high on the moor at Sowerby Bridge, but it will be rewarded. Chef Alisdair Brooke-Taylor and his partner Aimee Turford, who runs front of house, walk the line between generous boozer and cutting-edge restaurant. The pub menu might include baked sea bass or a game terrine with pickles; the restaurant tasting menu, a snip at \u00a339 for nine dishes each, heads off towards crab with creamed corn and fermented mushrooms and celeriac with goat ricotta (themoorcock.co.uk). The top 100 UK restaurant list, compiled by the crowd-sourced guide Harden\u2019s from their contributor\u2019s reports, makes interesting reading. 10% of them are Indian, Kent is the strongest county in the UK, and the North West makes the strongest showing after the South East (hardens.com). While some high street chains are finding the going tough, others are prospering. Pizza chain Franco Manca, which started as a single outlet in South London, has reported half year revenues up 9% to \u00a336 million. David Page, chairman of parent company Fulham Shore, says they have identified 40 UK towns and cities for openings over the next five years, which would bring the total to 90 sites.

      "bodyText": "It does not need a committee to determine the reasons for Labour\u2019s election defeat: a divided party, an unpopular leader too sympathetic to leftwing autocrats, dithering over Brexit, failure to deal with the charge of antisemitism, an ill-thought-out manifesto. The list goes on (\u201cDefeated MPs call for \u2018unflinching\u2019 Labour review\u201d, News). The need is for action and I fear diagnosis will be a comforting substitute for doing something. Doing something will be up to the next leader. He or she must be personable, intelligent, articulate, diligent, pragmatic and a master of detail. Their primary job will be to oppose a populist government. Labour needs to develop plans to deal with the perennial problems: housing, transport, the NHS, care for the old, drugs. Then there are more recent and more intractable problems: climate crisis, automation, globalisation, fake news and internet intrusion. The choice of leader will determine the future of Labour and, indeed, whether it has a future. It is not just Labour that is at risk but democracy. The members of the party must get this right. Philip Symmons Gillingham, Dorset After much thought, I have decided to join the Labour party so that I can cast a vote in the election of a new leader. I read that Barbara Ellen is considering doing the same (\u201cShould I rejoin Labour to vote for a new leader? Tricky...\u201d, Comment). Don\u2019t hesitate, Barbara. Indeed, why doesn\u2019t the Observer, which has printed much excellent commentary on the lamentable state of the party under Jeremy Corbyn, mount a campaign to encourage all who believe in the need for a moderate leader to do likewise? The party needs an influx of new members to help bring this about. Claire Coxhead Basildon, Essex Michael Savage\u2019s piece on the four ex-Tories who paid the electoral price for opposing Brexit only goes part of the way, (\u201cOut but not down: Tory anti-Brexiters tell where the next battle will be fought\u201d, News). The MPs from both major parties who took a stand on principle should all be recognised. Their enforced exit from the Commons is a sharp commentary on the state of British politics and the inadequacy of its electoral system. Whether or not one agrees with their politics, there needs to be some way of keeping these brave MPs in politics. At a time when intellectual rigour is in desperately short supply across the political spectrum, they represented an important corner of political depth and bravery. They must not be lost to politics. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds The damage prisons do What is the matter with our nation over prisoners and their treatment? (\u201cPrisons chaos fuels massive legal bill as violence surges\u201d, News.) Throughout the lives of one unheeding government after another, the consensus of those steeped in experience and knowledge has been disregarded to our grave cost. Too often, the focus has been on reinforcing the long-disproved premise that prison works, rather than reserving that costly last resort for those relatively few offenders where public safety demands it. On 20 July 1910, then home secretary Winston Churchill clearsightedly spoke of the need for \u201ca constant heart-searching\u201d and an \u201ceagerness to rehabilitate\u201d representing the \u201cmark and measure... and virtue of a nation\u201d. Practitioners confronting these realities daily have long recognised that early, measured and skilled non-custodial interventions are the more effective strategy rather than over-reliance on an incarceration likely to result in a more deeply ingrained criminality on release. The longer we fail to act on this truism the greater the societal and economic damage.

Miller, meanwhile, is waging Trump\u2019s ongoing war against people legally seeking asylum in the United States \u2013 featuring family separations, caged children and inhumane detention. Miller even got Trump to pardon Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who was ordered by a federal judge to stop detaining people solely on suspicion of their immigration status. Arpaio disregarded the order, which is why he was convicted of criminal contempt of court. From now on, rogue sheriffs will be less constrained. You see the pattern: whistleblowers intimidated, the justice department politicized, findings of special counsels and inspectors general distorted or ignored, foreign policy made by a private citizen unaccountable to anybody, rogue military officers and rogue sheriffs pardoned. Each instance is disturbing on its own. Viewed as a whole, Trump\u2019s lawlessness is systematically corrupting justice in the US. Impartial justice is the keystone of a democracy. Even if the Senate fails to remove Trump for impeachable offenses, American voters must do so next November.",

      "bodyText": "The End of the World Has Already Happened Radio 4 | BBC Sounds Today guest edited by Greta Thunberg Radio 4 | BBC Sounds Wild Music Radio 4 | BBC Sounds Cillian Murphy 6 Music | BBC Sounds As radio news brought us visceral eyewitness accounts of the wildfires raging across Australia, Radio 4 welcomed in the new year with The End of the World Has Already Happened. Presented by Timothy Morton, who has been dubbed \u201cthe philosopher-poet of the Anthropocene\u201d, the programme did its best to undercut the apocalyptic thrust of its title by exploring the ways we might overcome our seeming powerlessness in the face of impending global catastrophe. Morton spoke to psychologists as well as activists, the former mapping out a human landscape of helplessness, denial or a retreat into what Amy Westervelt, an American climate journalist, called \u201ctechnocratic saviour mode\u201d \u2013 the belief that technology and human innovation will come to our rescue. Against all this, the righteous anger expressed by Hilton Kelley was a bracing counterblast. A relentless campaigner against the petrochemical industry that has poisoned the earth, air and water in his native Port Arthur, Texas, he spoke passionately for local activism, calling out \u201cthe white people who dump on us then go back to their clean suburbs\u201d. Closer to home, environmental journalist George Monbiot posited a shift in our collective thinking from the politically realistic, which is elastic and often self-servingly evasive, to the scientifically realistic, which is neither. In an age of extreme individuation, Monbiot pointed out, \u201ccollective activism is, in itself, empowering\u201d. Just how empowering was the subtext of the radio event of the week \u2013 Greta Thunberg\u2019s guest-editorship of the Today programme on Radio 4. If the teenage eco-icon is at risk of becoming what Morton called \u201cone of the media\u2019s perfect angelic beings\u201d, she came across as a perfectly reasonable citizen who is able to calmly articulate the bigger picture in a way that our elected leaders seem incapable of doing. At the risk of drawing the ire of both their dedicated followers, I did feel that her Skype conversation with the august David Attenborough sailed a bit close to a prolonged mutual appreciation-fest. The interview with her father, Svante, though, was revelatory. When asked if he and his wife had perhaps pushed her into the spotlight, he replied: \u201cOn the contrary\u2026 we thought it was a bad idea.\u201d He recalled his daughter\u2019s formative struggles with acute depression and the isolating effects of her autism, which, before she found her calling, were such that \u201cshe only spoke to me, my wife, her sister and one of her teachers\u201d. The turning point came on day three of her now famous school strike, when a supporter handed her a homemade vegan pad thai. \u201cShe ate it,\u201d he said, still sounding surprised and relieved. \u201cI cannot explain what a change that meant to her and to us\u2026 she changed\u2026 She could do things.\u201d Little did he know. Despite a surfeit of strong competition, my highlight of the week was Wild Music, an unadulterated paean to elemental nature as it thrives in remote, rainswept Orkney. A collaboration between the poet John Burnside and contemporary composer Erland Cooper, who grew up in the Orkney town of Stromness, it allowed us to listen in on their conversations as they meandered around the ancient landscape, their wanderings punctuated by the words and music they created there.

I am told by Whovian \u201cexperts\u201d, whom you tend to meet at parties at this time of year, effusively outside their comfort zones and proffering, drunkenly, mistletoe, that this is a Very Big Thing. Whatever. A few things to note (apart from \u201cwhatever\u201d being well and truly over, this being a clean new decade): the actors work increasingly well together, newly well, and Chibnall has a newly confident hand on the helm: those rocks, as in Dracula\u2019s Whitby, were getting perilous close.</p> <p>Talking of mistletoe: can it be true, as I was recently told, that it\u2019s known by young folk who spend more time glued to their phones rather than living real life (limping angrily through cold rain) as the \u201cperverts\u2019 garnish\u201d? Surely not\u2026 yet I was foully reminded of the capacity of some men to absolutely bloody queer it for the rest of us by the heftily strong, if arguably needlessly redramatised, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m000ct7b/the-trial-of-christine-keeler?seriesId=m000ct78\" title=\"\">The Trial of Christine Keeler</a></strong>.</p> <p>Christine\u2019s imagined voiceover at the start of the second bite of this six-parter \u2013 \u201cWe both gave in to the most natural human instinct of all\u2026 the love of a powerful middle-aged man for a penniless teenage girl\u201d \u2013 was about all the knowing archness we got from Miss Keeler. Not Ms. Miss. Those were those days. In truth, Christine, powerfully channelled by Sophie Cookson, came across as confused, utterly non-arch, both unworldly and scornfully knowing, rather daffy, rather dim, mercurial, dully beautiful. Exploitable. And 19. <em>19</em>. At which age many people are all those things.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsanPZvikII\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hsanPZvikII?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsanPZvikII\">Watch a trailer for The Trial of Christine Keeler.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I might have had more doubts about the production had it not been weighty on garlanded female credentials \u2013 adapted by Amanda Coe, directed by Andrea Harkin \u2013 which suggested it might dare to give the female lives their complex due. And so it befell: Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies have been given their young lives back, rather than existing as adjuncts only to historical geopolitics, and wisecracking nudge-nudgery, and as such this has been a marvellous endeavour, finely produced and shot. If only I could shed the prickled suspicion that the BBC had such a success this time last year with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/19/best-tv-shows-2018-a-very-english-scandal\" title=\"\">A Very British Scandal</a></em> that bean-counters wanted, with drear automaton minds, a repeat. Next Christmas: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/26/mellor-major-currie\" title=\"\">David Mellor?</a></p> <p>Yet this was daring and different too in these women\u2019s hands: James Norton, ever handsomely unafraid to play loathsome, made an entirely new Stephen Ward. His \u201clittle baby\u201d mantra parroted so patronisingly to Christine, which must by the end have made 80% of watchers\u2019 hackles rise, gave an utterly brave take on John Hurt\u2019s portrayal of victimhood. Will this story ever be over? Will the love of a powerful middle-aged man for a penniless teenage girl ever be over?</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m000crc2/wisting\" title=\"\">Wisting</a> </strong>(BBC Four) is the best Nord-noir ever. Since the last one. What did Scandinavian film-makers think they were ever doing, 80 years of existential angst and Death playing nihilist chess, before remembering: we have crime. Coal. Snow. Blood. Fire. Cheekbones. Let\u2019s do <em>that</em>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000crz9/frankie-boyles-new-world-order-2019\" title=\"\">Frankie Boyle\u2019s New World Order</a></strong> delivered, as always, with an end-of-year roundup featuring a full four fantastic guests and an audience (they\u2019d <em>presumably</em> known he wasn\u2019t Michael McIntyre) that at one stage was left jaws agape at a joke\u2019s wizard tastelessness. Don\u2019t do that: the flies will get in.</p> <p>Yet the BBC just had to crack out one last turkey in the shape of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000cszn/miranda-my-such-fun-celebration\" title=\"\">Miranda: My Such Fun Celebration</a></strong>. This faux-nodded to Ms Hart\u2019s rise to splendid deserved glory, the subtlety and the lovely co-stars and the winning plea for not everyone to be a 5ft 10in beauty, <em>without actually ever getting it</em>. In front of the London Palladium, poor pratfalls and squawking and \u201cgalloping\u201d and catchphrases and jokes about weight and class abounded, and it was sub-awful, and Miranda must be retching.</p> <p>Never mind.

I am told by Whovian \u201cexperts\u201d, whom you tend to meet at parties at this time of year, effusively outside their comfort zones and proffering, drunkenly, mistletoe, that this is a Very Big Thing. Whatever. A few things to note (apart from \u201cwhatever\u201d being well and truly over, this being a clean new decade): the actors work increasingly well together, newly well, and Chibnall has a newly confident hand on the helm: those rocks, as in Dracula\u2019s Whitby, were getting perilous close. Talking of mistletoe: can it be true, as I was recently told, that it\u2019s known by young folk who spend more time glued to their phones rather than living real life (limping angrily through cold rain) as the \u201cperverts\u2019 garnish\u201d? Surely not\u2026 yet I was foully reminded of the capacity of some men to absolutely bloody queer it for the rest of us by the heftily strong, if arguably needlessly redramatised, The Trial of Christine Keeler. Christine\u2019s imagined voiceover at the start of the second bite of this six-parter \u2013 \u201cWe both gave in to the most natural human instinct of all\u2026 the love of a powerful middle-aged man for a penniless teenage girl\u201d \u2013 was about all the knowing archness we got from Miss Keeler. Not Ms. Miss. Those were those days. In truth, Christine, powerfully channelled by Sophie Cookson, came across as confused, utterly non-arch, both unworldly and scornfully knowing, rather daffy, rather dim, mercurial, dully beautiful. Exploitable. And 19. 19. At which age many people are all those things. I might have had more doubts about the production had it not been weighty on garlanded female credentials \u2013 adapted by Amanda Coe, directed by Andrea Harkin \u2013 which suggested it might dare to give the female lives their complex due. And so it befell: Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies have been given their young lives back, rather than existing as adjuncts only to historical geopolitics, and wisecracking nudge-nudgery, and as such this has been a marvellous endeavour, finely produced and shot. If only I could shed the prickled suspicion that the BBC had such a success this time last year with A Very British Scandal that bean-counters wanted, with drear automaton minds, a repeat. Next Christmas: David Mellor? Yet this was daring and different too in these women\u2019s hands: James Norton, ever handsomely unafraid to play loathsome, made an entirely new Stephen Ward. His \u201clittle baby\u201d mantra parroted so patronisingly to Christine, which must by the end have made 80% of watchers\u2019 hackles rise, gave an utterly brave take on John Hurt\u2019s portrayal of victimhood. Will this story ever be over? Will the love of a powerful middle-aged man for a penniless teenage girl ever be over? Wisting (BBC Four) is the best Nord-noir ever. Since the last one. What did Scandinavian film-makers think they were ever doing, 80 years of existential angst and Death playing nihilist chess, before remembering: we have crime. Coal. Snow. Blood. Fire. Cheekbones. Let\u2019s do that. Frankie Boyle\u2019s New World Order delivered, as always, with an end-of-year roundup featuring a full four fantastic guests and an audience (they\u2019d presumably known he wasn\u2019t Michael McIntyre) that at one stage was left jaws agape at a joke\u2019s wizard tastelessness. Don\u2019t do that: the flies will get in. Yet the BBC just had to crack out one last turkey in the shape of Miranda: My Such Fun Celebration. This faux-nodded to Ms Hart\u2019s rise to splendid deserved glory, the subtlety and the lovely co-stars and the winning plea for not everyone to be a 5ft 10in beauty, without actually ever getting it. In front of the London Palladium, poor pratfalls and squawking and \u201cgalloping\u201d and catchphrases and jokes about weight and class abounded, and it was sub-awful, and Miranda must be retching. Never mind. Wipe your mouths. Roll on, clean brave 2020s!",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates also called for calm amid concerns that Suleimani\u2019s death may shift the foundations of Washington\u2019s relationships in the region.

      "bodyText": "Huge crowds joined funeral processions for Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad and Tehran on Saturday as calls to avenge the Iranian general\u2019s death mounted and the US case for ordering his assassination was increasingly called into question. As the coffins of Suleimani and his close associate Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were carried through the Iraqi capital, the ramifications of the killings were reverberating across a nervous region, where many believe the aftermath could spark a new era of bloodletting and instability. Two rockets crashed into Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone on Saturday night, near the sprawling US embassy compound, which was attacked by Shia militia members in the days before Suleimani\u2019s death. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to authorise the assassination also appeared to have driven a wedge between Washington and its allies, with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, telephoning Iraq\u2019s acting prime minister to express support for the country\u2019s sovereignty in an implicit rebuke of the strike, which was carried out without the knowledge of Iraqi leaders. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates also called for calm amid concerns that Suleimani\u2019s death may shift the foundations of Washington\u2019s relationships in the region. All three states are US allies and consider themselves to be possible arenas for Iranian retaliation. While Trump continued to revel in his decision, tweeting on Saturday night that if Iran retaliated the US had identified 52 Iranian sites that would be targeted \u201cvery fast and very hard\u201d, there were also fears in Europe and Britain that potential consequences for an already volatile global order had not been considered. The former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers described Suleimani\u2019s assassination as an \u201cact of war\u201d. The UK defence minister Ben Wallace said he had spoken to his US counterpart, Mark Esper, adding: \u201cWe urge all parties to engage to de-escalate the situation.\u201d He said US forces in Iraq, who are there at the invitation of the Iraqi government, had been repeatedly attacked by Iranian-backed militia and that Suleimani had been at the heart of the use of proxies to undermine neighbouring sovereign nations and target Iran\u2019s enemies. \u201cUnder international law the United States is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens,\u201d Wallace said. The White House transmitted on Saturday evening its formal notification to Congress of Friday\u2019s drone strike that killed Suleimani in Iraq, two senior congressional aides told Reuters. Many Democrats have criticised Trump for failing to seek advance approval or to notify Congress of the attack. The classified notification was sent under a US law requiring the administration to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action or imminent actions. Trump\u2019s administration was expected to explain the circumstances, the authority under which the action was taken and the expected scope and duration of the military involvement. The White House did not immediately comment. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, said in a statement that the White House notification about the attack \u201cprompts serious and urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification of the administration\u2019s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran\u201d. She said the \u201chighly unusual\u201d decision to classify the entire document compounded her concerns and \u201csuggests that the Congress and the American people are being left in the dark about our national security\u201d. On Saturday night, Boris Johnson had yet to respond to the strike. It is understood that Britain had no prior knowledge of it being authorised. There were also concerns about what the killing could mean for bilateral ties between Washington and Baghdad, which have struggled to find common ground in the years since US troops withdrew from Iraq. Iraqi officials attending Suleimani\u2019s funeral procession said they would now push for the exit of remaining US forces, who had returned to fight Islamic State \u2013 a move that would jeopardise global efforts to mop up the threat from the terror group. As he wept over the coffin of Muhandis, the new leader of the Popular Mobilisation Units, Hadi Al-Amiri, said: \u201cBe assured that the price for your pure blood is the exit of the American troops from Iraq to achieve full national sovereignty.\u201d Iraq\u2019s outgoing prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, also joined the procession. Suleimani\u2019s body was taken to the Kadhimiya shrine in the north of the city, followed by the Shia shrine city of Najaf.

Sweets were handed out in some towns. \u201cThis general was the devil himself,\u201d said Sobhih Mustafa, in the town of Maarat al-Numan. \u201cHis legacy will be written in blood.\u201d As the four-day burial ritual was getting under way, the US justification behind Suleimani\u2019s killing, which centred on there being an \u201cimminent attack\u201d which he had directed, was challenged in some quarters. The New York Times correspondent Rukmini Callimachi tweeted that two sources privy to the information, held by US intelligence officials, described the case as \u201crazor thin\u201d. Her tweets also detail a scramble to discover Suleimani\u2019s whereabouts once the decision to kill him was made. In May, the Guardian reported that Suleimani had instructed loyal forces in the region to \u201cprepare for proxy war\u201d. That order was intercepted by GCHQ and led to urgent messages being sent to Baghdad and Iran. Meanwhile, Iran claimed that the US had sent a note to Tehran through the Swiss embassy, which acts as an intermediary between the two foes, calling for a \u201cproportional response\u201d to the killing of Suleimani. \u201cThe Swiss, who represent US interests [in Iran], brought a very unwise message from the Americans, which received a firm response,\u201d the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on TV. \u201cThe Americans made a wrong move and are now worried about its consequences.\u201d The deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , Brigadier General Ali Fadavi, said the US \u201cresorted to such means as diplomacy this morning [Friday] and even told us \u2018if you want to take revenge, do it in a way that\u2019s proportional to what we did\u2019.\u201d \u201cBut they cannot decide anything [for us],\u201d Fadavi added, according to the Iranian English-language news site Iran Front Page. \u201cThat will take place at the most opportune time and in the best manner possible. \u201cSoon we will see that the Americans will not be there in the region,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis started much earlier than normal in August 2019, with thousands of fires in Queensland and New South Wales. Despite the evidence a claim persists that a major contributing factor of Australia\u2019s devastating fire season \u2013 and the deaths, loss of homes and environmental devastation they have caused \u2013 is not climate change but a conspiracy by environmentalists to \u201clock up\u201d national parks and prevent hazard reduction activities such as prescribed burning and clearing of the forest floor. On Saturday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said after visiting fire grounds: \u201cThe most constant issue that has been raised with me has been the issue of managing fuel loads in national parks.\u201d He claimed that people \u201cwho say they are seeking those actions on climate change\u201d could also be the same people who \u201cdon\u2019t share the same urgency of dealing with hazard reduction\u201d. Prof David Bowman, the director of the fire centre research hub at the University of Tasmania, said: \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. To frame this as an issue of hazard reduction in national parks is just lazy political rhetoric.\u201d On Sunday Morrison said he wanted to know \u201cwhat the contribution of issues\u201d around hazard reduction were, but repeated that it had been an issue raised often with him. He also said \u201cwithout the planning, without the preparations\u201d of state agencies, \u201cI fear what has really been a terrible tragedy would have been far worse.\u201d Are greenies stopping hazard reduction? Hazard reduction is the management of fuel and can be carried out through prescribed burning, also known as controlled burning, and removing trees and vegetation, both dead and alive. Hazard reduction is carried out by fire authorities, national park staff and individual property owners who can apply for permits to clear areas around their buildings. Coordination of activities happens through local bushfire management committees. There are 120 committees in NSW. The claim of a conspiracy by environmentalists to block hazard reduction activities has been roundly rejected by bushfire experts, and experts say it is betrayed by hard data on actual hazard reduction activities in national parks. Prof Ross Bradstock, the director of the centre for environmental risk management of bushfires at the University of Wollongong, has previously told Guardian Australia: \u201cThese are very tired and very old conspiracy theories that get a run after most major fires. They\u2019ve been extensively dealt with in many inquiries.\u201d Former fire chiefs who have been calling strongly for action on climate change, and who have been trying to meet Morrison for months, have also been calling for increased funding for hazard reduction. The Australian Greens say they want \u201can effective and sustainable strategy for fuel-reduction management that will protect biodiversity and moderate the effects of wildfire for the protection of people and assets, developed in consultation with experts, custodians and land managers\u201d. A federal government factsheet on bushfire management outlines how state agencies and people can carry out a range of hazard reduction activities that have been exempted from national environmental law, even if they \u201chave the potential to have a significant impact on nationally protected matters\u201d. How much hazard reduction has happened? In the last full fire season of 2018 and 2019, the National Parks and Wildlife Service in NSW told Guardian Australia it carried out hazard reduction activities across more than 139,000 hectares, slightly above its target. There are two major restricting factors for carrying out prescribed burning. One is the availability of funds and personnel, and the second is the availability of weather windows. The 2018-19 annual report of the NSW Rural Fire Service says: \u201cThe ability of the NSW RFS and partner agencies to complete hazard reduction activities is highly weather dependent, with limited windows of opportunity. Prolonged drought conditions in 2018-19 adversely affected the ability of agencies to complete hazard reduction works.\u201d The RFS said 113,130 properties had been subject to hazard reduction activities, which was 76% of its target. The 199,248ha covered was 106% of its target. Is climate change affecting hazard reduction? A former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, Greg Mullins, has written that the hotter and drier conditions, and the higher fire danger ratings, were preventing agencies from carrying out prescribed burning. But as well as climate change narrowing the window to carry out prescribed burning, Mullins said some fires have become so intense they have burned through areas that had been subject to hazard reduction. Mullins has been fighting fires in NSW for months. Speaking to the ABC on Friday, he said he witnessed a fire in Grafton in an area that had burned only two weeks previously, but \u201cthe burnt leaves were burning again\u201d. He said: \u201cThere has been lots of hazard reductions done over the years \u2013 more by national parks than previous years \u2013 but the fires have burned through those hazard reduction areas.\u201d Mullins dismissed suggestions that the bushfires were down to \u201cgreenies\u201d preventing hazard reduction activities.\u201cThis is the blame game. We\u2019ll blame arsonists, we\u2019ll blame greenies,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen will the penny drop with this government?\u201d The National Parks Association of NSW\u2019s president, Anne Dickson, has also responded to the attacks on environmentalists. In November 2019, she said: \u201cThe increasing intensity and frequency of fire is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity and natural landscapes. It may be politically expedient to pretend that conservationists exercise some mythical power over fire legislation and bushfire management committees, but it is not so. \u201cSuch wild and simplistic claims avoid the very real and complex challenges of protecting our communities and the healthy environments that support our quality of life.\u201d Bowman said that separate to the \u201clazy political rhetoric\u201d of blaming environmentalists, there should be an examination of the benefits and limitations of hazard reduction. But he said there was also a reality to consider: \u201cA lot of people are thinking that hazard reduction burning stops fire. It doesn\u2019t, but what it does do is to try and change its behaviour. \u201cBut let\u2019s say you embarked on the biggest fire reduction program the world has ever seen. What\u2019s the budget for that? Who will pay for it. Of course there is a place for hazard reduction but if you have massive increases, where does the money come from? The reality is that you can\u2019t treat everything.\u201d What is climate change doing to bushfire weather? The 2019-20 bushfire crisis coincided with Australia\u2019s hottest year on record. On a state level, NSW easily experienced its hottest year, with temperatures 1.95C above the long-term average, beating the previous record year, 2018, by 0.27C. Climate experts have said not all of that heat came from climate change, as two climate systems were also working to push up temperatures and fire danger. Fire authorities are guided on a daily basis on the risk of fires through the Forest Fire Danger Index, a combined measure of temperature, humidity, wind speed and the availability of dry fuel. Spring 2019 had been the worst year on a record going back to 1950 for bushfire risk. A 2017 study of 67 years of FFDI data found a \u201cclear trend toward more dangerous conditions during spring and summer in southern Australia, including increased frequency and magnitude of extremes, as well as indicating an earlier start to the fire season\u201d. A study of Queensland\u2019s historic 2018 bushfire season found the extreme temperatures that coincided with the fires were four time more likely because of human-caused climate. On Sunday Morrison claimed the government had \u201calways made this connection\u201d between climate change and impacts on Australia\u2019s weather. Advice shared with authorities around the country earlier this year from the National Environmental Science Program said: \u201cThese trends are very likely to increase into the future, with climate models showing more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires throughout Australia due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d There are also fears that large pulses of carbon dioxide emissions from Australia\u2019s bushfires may not be reabsorbed through regrowth of forests as they have in the past. The fire season has seen several reports of bushfire-generated thunderstorms. Guardian Australia has reported that 2019 would likely be a \u201cstand-out\u201d year for storms known as \u201cpyroCBs\u201d that generate their own lightning and influence the atmosphere at heights of up to 15km. A study in 2019 published in the journal Scientific Reports found that adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere would create more dangerous conditions favourable to pyroCB events in the future, particularly for the southern parts of Australia.",

<p></p>\n    <p>The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Morrison claimed there was \u201cno dispute in this country about the issue of climate change, globally, and its effect on global weather patterns, and that includes how that impacts in Australia\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government has always made this connection and that has never been in dispute,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>However, overnight the government backbencher Craig Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jan/05/nsw-fires-live-updates-victoria-bushfires-south-australia-fire-sa-bushfire-near-rfs-cfa-latest-news?page=with:block-5e1142b68f085eda5c1124b4#block-5e1142b68f085eda5c1124b4\">told the BBC</a> there was \u201cno link\u201d between climate change and the fires.</p> \n<p>In November, the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/11/dear-michael-mccormack-the-only-raving-lunatics-are-those-not-worrying-about-climate-change\">described</a> people who drew a link between the fires and global heating as \u201cinner-city raving lunatics\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has defended using a video on social media outlining the government\u2019s actions in response to the bushfire crisis, saying it was not a Liberal party advertisement and was used only to inform the community. A video posted on the prime minister\u2019s Twitter and Facebook pages on Saturday outlined the actions the Morrison government had taken in bringing in the Australian defence force, navy ships and other actions to help out the state agencies battling fires across the south-east coast of Australia. The end of the ad contained an authorisation from \u201cS. Morrison, Liberal Party, Canberra\u201d. The Liberal National party in Queensland also paid money to advertise a post linked to the press release for the announcement on Facebook, according to Facebook\u2019s page transparency information. The Australian Defence Association criticised the video, stating it was in breach of the non-partisan conventions restricting the use of the ADF in party political advertisements. The head of the ADA, Neil James, said it was \u201cplain wrong\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s simple: you don\u2019t use the defence force for party political advantage,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey put out a media release giving people all the information so you have to ask yourself what the purpose of the ad is, and the purpose is clearly party political advantage. And that is just plain wrong.\u201d On Sunday Morrison defended the use of the ad. \u201cIt\u2019s important that I communicate what we are doing with the Australian people,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as we\u2019d all like to only rely on the reporting of the media to get those informations out, I would also seek to carry that message directly to the Australian people to ensure they are aware of what we are doing.\u201d He claimed that this format of ad had been used for months with no objections. Most recently that format, including the authorisation and use of defence imagery, was used on 12 December, before the most recent flare-up of bushfires across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Morrison said Australian law required him to include the authorisation because it was a video posted to his personal Twitter account. \u201cAs you know, the opposition, the Labor party and other parties have similar authorisations on the back of very similar types of messages that they have been conveying on their commentary about these events,\u201d he said. Under the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s guidelines for social media posts, authorisations are recommended if that video, for example, contains information with the dominant purpose of influencing the way someone votes, as defined in the Electoral Act. Morrison said he would be open to reviewing the practice of the authorisations. \u201cWhere that can be improved, I\u2019m happy to take the helpful suggestions that have been made, that we\u2019ve been acting in accordance with the same procedure we\u2019ve had in place now for many, many months,\u201d he said. He denied the ad was sponsored by the Liberal party, although the Liberal party\u2019s Twitter account retweeted the PM\u2019s tweet and put out a separate tweet outlining the government\u2019s response on the Liberal party page that had, until it was pointed out, contained a donate link for donations to the party. Morrison said the video was made in his office and there were no real expenses of any significance attached to making the post.",

By mid afternoon on Sunday the tally had reached more than $22m, around 48 hours after Barber launched the fundraiser on Facebook. Barber, who has 6.4 million followers on Instagram, has used her huge social media following to draw donations from around the world. In regular updates on Instagram, she has spoken about family members caught up in the crisis in Eden, including her parents-in-law. She said her father-in-law was evacuated overnight. The women\u2019s world No 1 tennis player, Ashleigh Barty, pledged on Sunday to donate all of her Brisbane International prize money to the bushfire appeal. She is the top seed in the Brisbane event, which starts on Monday, with the winner taking home US$250,000 (A$360,000). After donating more than $30,000 late last year to the RSPCA to help wildlife affected by the national disaster, Barty said she wanted to dig deep again for families who have been left devastated by bushfires. Barty joined a growing list of sports stars and organisations to lend their support with the NRL, Football Federation Australia, Netball Australia and two-time Dakar Rally winner Toby Price among those coming on board on Sunday. Barty\u2019s offer follows the lead of her fellow Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios, who sparked the massive fundraising effort. Kyrgios\u2019s social media call for a fundraiser resulted in Tennis Australia announcing a Rally for Relief exhibition match on Rod Laver Arena on 15 January, which is set to feature some of the world\u2019s top players. On Saturday the American singer Pink pledged $500,000 to Australian fire services and called on her followers to help by making a donation. \u201cI am totally devastated watching what is happening in Australia right now with the horrific bushfires,\u201d she tweeted. On Sunday morning Nicole Kidman posted on Instagram that she was also donating $500,000 to the fires services. Barber\u2019s fundraiser has been shared by other celebrities, including the actor Natalie Portman and the singer Lizzo. Lizzo used her Instagram stories to encourage her followers to donate to environmental organisations working to save koala populations. The ABC reported on Sunday that its disaster relief and recovery appeal with the Australian Red Cross had raised more than $10m for bushfire-affected communities. Social media is full of stories of community members offering generosity and support to devastated communities. Guardian Australia came across a group of residents from western Sydney who brought a haul of food and drinks to Nowra on Sunday morning. Maddison Elabed said they received an enormous amount of donations, including the trucks and vans to bring everything down. \u201cEverything we got was 100% donated and is 100% for the fires,\u201d she said. The residents were inspired by stories of firefighters finishing a shift only to come back to base and find no food. \u201cWhen we saw the state of these two firies that were sitting in a car waiting for a food truck to come and it came and it was empty, we were like: \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u2019 \u201d says Melissa Nasr. \u201cGod sent us there,\u201d adds Elabed. \u201cThey were about to leave when we rocked up.

Others have set up pages for donations of food, water and other essential supplies. A separate fundraiser for the Wires wildlife rescue service in NSW has raised more than $773,000, surpassing a $500,000 target, in one day.

      "bodyText": "\u201cRight here we are the meat in the sandwich, so thanks for coming down.\u201d And so began Mark Coombes\u2019s briefing for a new shift of firefighters in Nowra. There were fires to the north, fires to the south, minimum 20-metre flame heights on one side of the Shoalhaven River, 40 metres on the other, and in areas that hadn\u2019t burned in decades. The dirty pyrocumulous cloud rumbled with its self-generated thunder outside. \u201cThe southerly is going to hit around nine, 9.30 and unfortunately you\u2019re the ones that deal with it,\u201d Coombes continued. \u201cWhat it\u2019s going to do I have no fucking idea.\u201d He was wrong. The southerly hit two hours earlier than expected, roaring through the forest with gusts up to 101km/h, whipping up dirt and dust and ash and filling the briefing room with smoke. Strike teams rushed to Milton and St Georges Basin where there were a few nursing homes which they weren\u2019t sure had been evacuated. A short time later a fire and rescue strike team was told it was going to Kangaroo Valley. There were intakes of breath. Kangaroo Valley was later reported to be under serious threat. Not everyone in those communities had left. At Nowra one firefighter explained the strategy: we can\u2019t stop the fire, so we\u2019re just trying to direct it as best we can. Strike teams were sent across the state on Saturday, moved around like chess pieces against an opponent that ignores all the rules. Earlier on Saturday was quiet. The predicted north-westerly winds weren\u2019t blowing. The fires were still at watch and act level. Until suddenly they weren\u2019t. Twenty fires had sparked between Nowra and Batemans Bay. It got worse the further south you travelled. \u201cIt\u2019s turned to shit everywhere,\u201d one senior RFS firefighter told Guardian Australia from a distant fireground. Well before it got really dire for the north side of the Shoalhaven River, Darin Sullivan, station officer for Shellharbour Fire and Rescue, noted that while it might look like the fire was relatively far away from communities, it was really just a matter of 15 to 25km, and we have seen fires in recent days regularly spotting 15km ahead of the firefront. \u201cI was at Batemans Bay on New Year\u2019s Eve and saw the devastation down there first hand,\u201d he said. \u201cI ended up evacuating my wife out on the firetruck. She was in Conjola when the firestorm run over that day. So everyone\u2019s got stories. \u201cTricky days.\u201d On the Princes Highway huge dark columns of smoke stood on the horizon in every direction. The highway closed south of Jervis Bay road, the only way south was to wind through the bushland between Jervis Bay and the highway, towards Bewong, only to be stopped again. Out on the firegrounds crews raced from street to street. Guardian Australia came across one from Queensland, another from Sydney\u2019s north shore. The fire spotted, and drove east, threatening the Jervis Bay communities before the southerly came through to drive it north with 80km/h gusts. At St Georges Basin residents who stayed behind were in gardens and on roofs, hosing down houses and trees as text messages come through warning everyone from Nowra to Kiola about 90km south to take shelter. The enormous flank of the Currowan fire, and related blazes, was moving east. At its northern end, near Nowra, the fire generated its own thunderstorm. The change wasn\u2019t even there yet. Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis is a gruelling long-running catastrophe which is taking its toll on everyone. Frustrations are showing, even among the relentlessly strong community spirit that has defined the emergency services and those they\u2019re protecting. Barely a day goes by now that someone doesn\u2019t abuse the prime minister, and there are inter-service grumbles about different tactics and management. In the room where Coombes, NSW Fire and Rescue divisional commander for the north, gave his briefing, there were firefighters sitting and waiting to be sent out, while simultaneously hearing of property losses, and knowing that another shift might come in to replace them before they could do anything. Longreach sits along the shore of the Shoalhaven River, the scattering of houses along the single road surrounded by towering trees. At a property a group of people stayed to defend. At one house, three of them are sat back watching the cricket. Taking comfort from it, just like Morrison said, it was wryly noted. They were all current and former firefighters, and between them Brent Edwards reckoned they\u2019ve got about 300 years of firefighting experience. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve all got every bit of equipment known to man,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cMy concern is, as always, we\u2019re for want of a better word experts. And we\u2019ve got everything. What about the poor punters with just a garden hose?\u201d Edwards is the former station commander of the Shoalhaven fire station, and was back from the Gold Coast visiting friends. This situation is \u201cincomparable\u201d to anything he saw in his 35 years as a professional firefighter and a lifetime being a \u201cstudent of the weather\u201d as a surfer, fisherman and diver. \u201cWhat\u2019s causing climate change is for another day,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just have to admit that it\u2019s changed dramatically and do something about it.\u201d",

Fitzsimmons was \u201cdisappointed and frustrated\u201d to learn of the plan through media reports on Saturday when fire crews were battling the most challenging conditions to date in terms of the number of concurrent fires in NSW. He said Morrison had not told him personally of the plan and commonwealth and ADF liaison officers embedded in the state control centre were also unaware. The government launched an ad about the plan on Saturday and announced it after weeks of pressure on the prime minister over his handling of the bushfire crisis.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a scene in the second episode of <em>The Morning Show </em>where Jennifer Aniston\u2019s character is riding in her car en route to an award show. Her stress levels are approaching a 10, and they\u2019re not helped by the fact that she can\u2019t fit everything she needs into her teeny-tiny silver clutch purse, which we see in shot: overstuffed and open like a baby bird\u2019s gullet, fed too many worms to eat. Eventually, she sighs and swears at the bag.</p> <p>A few weeks after this episode aired, singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/19/body-positive-rapper-lizzo-my-job-is-to-emote-and-communicate-and-bop\" title=\"\">Lizzo</a> was on the red carpet at the <a href=\"https://www.theamas.com/\" title=\"\">American Music Awards</a>, where she\u2019d decided to accessorise her peach-coloured Valentino ruffle dress with a bag roughly the size of a bottle of Tipp-Ex. \u201cThere are only three in the world,\u201d she explained. What could she possibly fit in there, asked the host. \u201cI\u2019ve got tampons in here, a flask of tequila, condoms,\u201d she lied, hilariously.</p> <p>In both cases, the joke is this: these Findus Crispy Pancake-sized bags are ridiculous, oh world of fashion! They can barely hold a broken lipstick, let alone a packet of tissues and half a Strepsil. In these cases, real-world concerns (practicality, durability) are unimportant next to the more pressing issue: WILL IT LOOK GOOD ON INSTAGRAM? So why the popularity?</p> <p>\u201cThey are <em>not</em> practical,\u201d agrees Dara Prant, market editor of <em>Fashionista</em>. \u201cBut they do elicit a year\u2019s worth of commentary and are great conversation starters,\u201d which is great currency online. \u201cIf you only go out with a mint (just one) or a piece of gum, lipgloss and a credit card, then a mini-bag is fine. But if you want your handbag to hold your phone, wallet, a snack, meds, first-aid supplies and a hand sanitiser, you should invest in something larger.\u201d In other words: exist outside 1080px by 1080px? See ya, sucker!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d60641d8fd2821aa0b97ff39582240765296087\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d60641d8fd2821aa0b97ff39582240765296087/14_74_2782_1669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzo at the American Music Awards, in an orange off-the shoulder ruffle, layered dress and holding a tiny Valentino bag between her fingers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve got tampons in here, a flask of tequila, condoms\u2019: Lizzo at the American Music Awards, with her Valentino bag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Baron/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Useless in an utterly lovely way, mini-bags are huge right now.

As in: Mrs Elton, the tragi-comic character in Jane Austen\u2019s <em>Emma</em>, has a \u201cpurple and gold ridicule\u201d.</p> <p>The attraction, according to Prant, is simple: it\u2019s sweet. \u201cTheir popularity has something to do with the psychology of loving tiny things,\u201d she explains. \u201cMini-bags are kind of like puppies \u2013 they\u2019re just very cute.\u201d Awwww\u2026 So we should carry our car keys in our underwear?</p> <p>The most high-profile designer who made the link to the online world was <a href=\"https://www.jacquemus.com/?v=79cba1185463\" title=\"\">Simon Porte Jacquem</a><a href=\"https://www.jacquemus.com/?v=79cba1185463\" title=\"\">us</a>.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a scene in the second episode of The Morning Show where Jennifer Aniston\u2019s character is riding in her car en route to an award show. Her stress levels are approaching a 10, and they\u2019re not helped by the fact that she can\u2019t fit everything she needs into her teeny-tiny silver clutch purse, which we see in shot: overstuffed and open like a baby bird\u2019s gullet, fed too many worms to eat. Eventually, she sighs and swears at the bag. A few weeks after this episode aired, singer Lizzo was on the red carpet at the American Music Awards, where she\u2019d decided to accessorise her peach-coloured Valentino ruffle dress with a bag roughly the size of a bottle of Tipp-Ex. \u201cThere are only three in the world,\u201d she explained. What could she possibly fit in there, asked the host. \u201cI\u2019ve got tampons in here, a flask of tequila, condoms,\u201d she lied, hilariously. In both cases, the joke is this: these Findus Crispy Pancake-sized bags are ridiculous, oh world of fashion! They can barely hold a broken lipstick, let alone a packet of tissues and half a Strepsil. In these cases, real-world concerns (practicality, durability) are unimportant next to the more pressing issue: WILL IT LOOK GOOD ON INSTAGRAM? So why the popularity? \u201cThey are not practical,\u201d agrees Dara Prant, market editor of Fashionista. \u201cBut they do elicit a year\u2019s worth of commentary and are great conversation starters,\u201d which is great currency online. \u201cIf you only go out with a mint (just one) or a piece of gum, lipgloss and a credit card, then a mini-bag is fine. But if you want your handbag to hold your phone, wallet, a snack, meds, first-aid supplies and a hand sanitiser, you should invest in something larger.\u201d In other words: exist outside 1080px by 1080px? See ya, sucker! Useless in an utterly lovely way, mini-bags are huge right now. (According to Grazia Middle East, the surface area of the average handbag has shrunk by 40% in reaction.) They\u2019ve been carried by everyone from the Kardashians to model of the moment Kaia \u201cdaughter of Cindy Crawford\u201d Gerber. The tiny bag has always walked the line between \u201cin fashion\u201d and \u201care you joking mate?\u201d In fact, in the 18th century it was nicknamed \u201cridicule\u201d, because of its lack of functionality. As in: Mrs Elton, the tragi-comic character in Jane Austen\u2019s Emma, has a \u201cpurple and gold ridicule\u201d. The attraction, according to Prant, is simple: it\u2019s sweet. \u201cTheir popularity has something to do with the psychology of loving tiny things,\u201d she explains. \u201cMini-bags are kind of like puppies \u2013 they\u2019re just very cute.\u201d Awwww\u2026 So we should carry our car keys in our underwear? The most high-profile designer who made the link to the online world was Simon Porte Jacquemus. He realised that values of proportion varied considerably IRL and online \u2013 and what looked good on your phone trumped anything else. Jacquemus was the auteur behind Le Grand Chapeau Bomba (a planet-sized straw hat that guarantees facial anonymity, as worn by Bella Hadid) and the supersize straw handbag. He delivered invites to his Paris AW19 show with micro-versions of his La Chiquito bag, which was about the size of a biscuit. The real Chiquito bag was not much larger: 12cm long, \u00a3400, as carried by Kim Kardashian and Rihanna. It became the No 3 hottest women\u2019s product, according to the Lyst index. It was about the size of a Christmas bauble. So, tiny bags have become objets d\u2019internet, and there\u2019s a knowingness in how they are used in public. \u201cI\u2019m not sure every star uses bag size to intentionally become a meme, but I certainly think celebrities like Lizzo know the power of bringing a microscopic Valentino bag on to a red carpet in terms of creating even more buzz around a look or an appearance,\u201d says Tyler McCall, editor-in-chief of Fashionista. \u201cMeme-able fashion has become increasingly popular with the rise of Instagram and other social media, because it makes an immediate visual impact.\u201d Sometimes, being extra small isn\u2019t enough. Sometimes you\u2019ve got to be extra large. In October, Diane Keaton Instagrammed a woman carrying an industrial-sized bag with the caption: \u201cNot big enough for me.

The look was popularised by celebrities such as the Olsens and the Hiltons; alongside large handbags were large sunglasses and tiny physical frames. Retrospectively, the vibe was very \u201cjust entering Promises treatment centre in Malibu, post Coachella\u201d, and was, alarmingly, labelled \u201cskinny-girl chic\u201d. \u201cZoe\u2019s influence was almost as big as the bags she got her clients to carry around,\u201d explains former Heat deputy editor Julian Linley. \u201cShe pioneered the artfully bohemian look that was all relaxed and creative, but screamed \u2018I\u2019m loaded!\u2019 Her followers even had their own name: the Zoebots.\u201d Linley says he remembers that her influence spilled over, like an extra-large frappuccino, to the high street. \u201cEvery shop window looked the same,\u201d he says. \u201cTiny mannequins holding enormous bags in the crook of their arm, heavily accessorised (most important: saucer-sized sunglasses) and Yeti-esque Ugg boots \u2013 it got so big that it quickly turned the corner into being naff.\u201d Despite fashion nods from Fendi, Bottega Veneta and Marni that the massive oversize bag will return next season, it has lost some of its stature over time. \u201cI\u2019m not sure celebrities have taken to it in a genuine way,\u201d says McCall. The mini-bag seems to fit this era of social media-led celebrity and shareable content. For a meme to be successful, it needs to work with a sophisticated ease and on multiple levels. Indeed, when something goes viral, a conversation begins between the photo or gif and the meme creator. For Lizzo and her tiny AMA Valentino bag, this was clear in the memes created in the aftermath. They were inevitably on-point: \u201cLizzo carried my bank account to the AMAs,\u201d read one. \u201cCan\u2019t believe Lizzo brought my patience with men to the AMAs,\u201d read another. Pre-Lizzo, perhaps the first mini bag that gained an upswing in popularity thanks to a pop culture shout-out was the Fendi Baguette. Beloved of Sex and The City\u2019s Carrie Bradshaw (who once claimed: \u201cI\u2019m homeless; I\u2019ll be a bag lady. A Fendi bag lady but a bag lady\u201d), the original iteration has sold around 1m copies since its 1997 launch. So perhaps it\u2019s the perfect mini-bag to launch in the famously cautious menswear market. It looks pretty inoffensive, but do men really want to give up their backpacks, man bags and holdalls for something that looks like it carries your epi pen? Alongside the mini-baguette, other big name designers have got on what the New York Times is calling the \u201cmurse\u201d (sorry) bandwagon \u2013 Balenciaga, Off-White and APC have produced tiny bags for men. \u201cI\u2019m not sure bags that aren\u2019t even big enough to hold a stick of gum will catch on,\u201d says Nick Carvell, former GQ news and features editor. \u201cThey\u2019re fun, but fun often doesn\u2019t result in longevity in how we dress \u2013 how many men wear codpieces these days?\u201d Prant is more optimistic. \u201cMen don\u2019t carry much anyway, so it actually makes more sense for them to wear them.\u201d George Banks, the designer behind Florist, who creates beautiful miniature embroidered bags, agrees. \u201cI think men\u2019s attitudes towards bag size are developing,\u201d he says. \u201cGuys are more open to unique-shaped bags.
