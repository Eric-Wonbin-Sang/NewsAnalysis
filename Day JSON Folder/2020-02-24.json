      "bodyText": "The US conducted a military exercise last week which simulated a \u201climited\u201d nuclear exchange with Russia, a senior Pentagon official has confirmed. The war game is notable because of the defence department\u2019s highly unusual decision to brief journalists about the details and because it embodied the controversial notion that it might be possible to fight, and win, a battle with nuclear weapons, without the exchange leading to an all-out world-ending conflict. The exercise comes just weeks after the US deployed a new low-yield submarine-launched warhead commissioned by Donald Trump, as a counter to Russian tactical weapons and intended to deter their use. According to a transcript of a background briefing by senior Pentagon officials, the defence secretary, Mark Esper, took part in what was described as a \u201cmini-exercise\u201d at US Strategic Command in Nebraska.

Barney Ronay was also a winner at Monday\u2019s ceremony, as he was named football journalist of the year, the fifth consecutive year a Guardian writer has won the honour. Hyde\u2019s historic accolades came for her work on the Women\u2019s World Cup, Tiger Woods\u2019 redemption at the Masters, Theresa May\u2019s decision to knight Geoffrey Boycott among her regular contributions to the Guardian\u2019s sport pages.

It tweeted later that day: \u201cNothing to do with us \u2013 people of all political stripes like our brew.\u201d</p> <p>However, that message seems not to have been enough to silence detractors, as on Monday the curator of Yorkshire Tea\u2019s Twitter account posted a thread saying they had faced a \u201crough weekend\u201d of angry comments, and calling for a degree of perspective and greater civility online.</p> <p>\u201cOn Friday, the chancellor shared a photo of our tea. Politicians do that sometimes (Jeremy Corbyn did it in 2017),\u201d it said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t asked or involved \u2013 and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.</p> <p>\u201cFor some, our tea just being drunk by someone they don\u2019t like means it\u2019s forever tainted, and they\u2019ve made sure we know it.\u201d</p> <p>The curator of the account said they had \u201cspent the last three days answering furious accusations and boycott calls\u201d while some people had tried to pull the brand into \u201ca political mudfight\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to be on the receiving end of this as a brand than as an individual,\u201d the thread continued. \u201cThere\u2019s more emotional distance and I\u2019ve had a team to support me when it got a bit much. But for anyone about to vent their rage online, even to a company \u2013 please remember there\u2019s a human on the other end of it, and try to be kind.\u201d</p> <p>The account also thanked those who \u201cspoke up\u201d for them and sent messages of support.</p> <p>Sharing the comments, comedian Mark Watson tweeted: \u201cThis thread, in which Yorkshire Tea politely ask people not to abuse them for a photo they had nothing to do with, made me gesture with vague despair into the void.\u201d</p> <p>The Tory MP for Bishop Auckland, Dehenna Davison, retweeted the thread, calling the whole incident \u201cmad\u201d and imploring people to \u201ccalm down\u201d.</p> <p>The plea for kindness online comes after many people reacted to the death of presenter Caroline Flack by sharing one of her Instagram posts from December in which she implored: \u201cIn a world where you can be anything, be kind.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5tO1tRFbEI/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Yorkshire Tea has issued a plea to people to \u201ctry to be kind\u201d after it received a deluge of online abuse because the chancellor was photographed with a large packet of its teabags. The brand had faced a weekend of calls to boycott it after Rishi Sunak, the Conservative MP for the North Yorkshire seat of Richmond, shared the image with the caption: \u201cQuick Budget prep break making tea for the team. Nothing like a good Yorkshire brew.\u201d Many Twitter users responded by condemning the brand, leading the company to stress that it had not endorsed the association. It tweeted later that day: \u201cNothing to do with us \u2013 people of all political stripes like our brew.\u201d However, that message seems not to have been enough to silence detractors, as on Monday the curator of Yorkshire Tea\u2019s Twitter account posted a thread saying they had faced a \u201crough weekend\u201d of angry comments, and calling for a degree of perspective and greater civility online. \u201cOn Friday, the chancellor shared a photo of our tea. Politicians do that sometimes (Jeremy Corbyn did it in 2017),\u201d it said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t asked or involved \u2013 and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same. \u201cFor some, our tea just being drunk by someone they don\u2019t like means it\u2019s forever tainted, and they\u2019ve made sure we know it.\u201d The curator of the account said they had \u201cspent the last three days answering furious accusations and boycott calls\u201d while some people had tried to pull the brand into \u201ca political mudfight\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to be on the receiving end of this as a brand than as an individual,\u201d the thread continued. \u201cThere\u2019s more emotional distance and I\u2019ve had a team to support me when it got a bit much. But for anyone about to vent their rage online, even to a company \u2013 please remember there\u2019s a human on the other end of it, and try to be kind.\u201d The account also thanked those who \u201cspoke up\u201d for them and sent messages of support. Sharing the comments, comedian Mark Watson tweeted: \u201cThis thread, in which Yorkshire Tea politely ask people not to abuse them for a photo they had nothing to do with, made me gesture with vague despair into the void.\u201d The Tory MP for Bishop Auckland, Dehenna Davison, retweeted the thread, calling the whole incident \u201cmad\u201d and imploring people to \u201ccalm down\u201d. The plea for kindness online comes after many people reacted to the death of presenter Caroline Flack by sharing one of her Instagram posts from December in which she implored: \u201cIn a world where you can be anything, be kind.\u201d Thousands took to social media with the hashtag #BeKind in a clamour for change following Flack\u2019s death, pleading with both media organisations and individuals to think more carefully about the impact of their words, especially online.",

David Moyes and West Ham certainly deserve some credit for how they approached this game. Even in the first half, with less than 30% possession, they carried an attacking threat. In the first 15 minutes of the second half, they were comfortably the better side, and deserved their 2-1 lead. But then, Moyes reverted to a defensive stance, withdrew Felipe Anderson and reverting to kicking long balls towards Sebastian Haller\u2019s forehead, and Liverpool made the resulting pressure count. Fabianski may have made two awful errors, but he remains an excellent keeper. He also made a couple of great saves here, although that will be overshadowed. </p> <p>Unless you are Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the best way to beat this Liverpool side is to attack them, and take your chances at the back. It seems as soon as you dry to simply get men behind the ball and defend with no attacking outlet, you are done for. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5446728f086a28115b1d1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T21:56:25.348Z\">9.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More magic from Mr Jolly</strong>, who is occasionally of this parish. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RichJolly/status/1232061233630777351\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Liverpool have got 79 points, just as they did when they were last champions in 1990.</p>&mdash; Richard Jolly (@RichJolly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichJolly/status/1232061233630777351?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5446218f0811db2fafdc6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T21:55:27.521Z\">9.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That was an excellent game of football. </strong>Liverpool just do enough \u2013 that\u2019s 13 times that J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side this season have won by the odd goal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3a61b72942a0bfa078d52d0fc3df711dd4e1699\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3a61b72942a0bfa078d52d0fc3df711dd4e1699/0_12_2164_1525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juergen Klopp and Alisson after the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juergen Klopp and Alisson after the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T22:01:42.131Z\">at 10.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5445d48f08e13324749705\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T21:54:21.465Z\">9.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Liverpool 3-2 West Ham</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The resulting corner is an awful one, not clearing the first man at the near post, and the final whistle sounds!

Nobody.\u201d </p> <p>Not my words, reader, but the words of Sam Allardyce, who was talking into a microphone this very morning. The former West Ham manager, who has an abysmal record at Anfield with the various teams he has managed there, also said he didn\u2019t \u201cthink there is any doubt\u201d that he could see some of himself in Diego Simeone, after the Argentinian masterminded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/18/disjointed-liverpool-fall-to-atletico-madrid-and-sauls-early-strike\">Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s backs-to-the-wall victory over Liverpool</a> last week in the Champions League.</p> <p>That might spell trouble for West Ham tonight, as Liverpool look to put the record straight. What do we reckon, then? 4-0? 5-0? Six? On paper, this looks like as big a home banker as it could possibly get for Liverpool. The Reds sit top of the Premier League form table, West Ham bottom of it, having taken just two points from the past six games. The London side haven\u2019t won away in the league since November, so you have to praise the Hammers fans that have made the long Monday night trip up to Anfield tonight.<br></p> <p>Team news with you imminently.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for me tonight. Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. And congratulations to Marina Hyde and Barney Ronay, who have both won some of the top honours at the SJAs tonight. Marina also won sports columnist of the year. Great stuff, and well deserved. Liverpool require 12 points from their final 11 games to win their first Premier League title. Trent Alexander Arnold speaks! He had two more assist tonight to take his tally to 24 since the start of last season. That is six more than any other player in the Premier League. We\u2019re happy with the win. But there\u2019s a lot of things we need to get right. The fans were massively with us [they weren\u2019t] when we went behind. We just tried to keep going. It paid off in the end. The manager gives me freedom. We\u2019re an attacking side. Sometimes I look for a specific man, sometimes I look for an area. I just want to get on the ball and make things happen. I practise those crosses and passes every day. Without my team-mates though, it would just be hopeful balls into the box. For West Ham, a must-win home game against Southampton is next on Saturday. But after that, they play Arsenal, Wolves, Tottenham, Chelsea in consecutive weeks. If they manage to stay in touch of their relegation rivals at the end of those matches, they have a relatively easy run-in: Newcastle, Burnley, Norwich, Watford, Manchester United and (a huge final game) Aston Villa. Good for Liverpool tonight: Alexander-Arnold, Robertson, Salah (in patches) and Oxlade Chamberlain (when he came on). Good for West Ham: Ogbonna, Diop, Ngakia, Antonio. A strange one to unpick. David Moyes and West Ham certainly deserve some credit for how they approached this game. Even in the first half, with less than 30% possession, they carried an attacking threat. In the first 15 minutes of the second half, they were comfortably the better side, and deserved their 2-1 lead. But then, Moyes reverted to a defensive stance, withdrew Felipe Anderson and reverting to kicking long balls towards Sebastian Haller\u2019s forehead, and Liverpool made the resulting pressure count. Fabianski may have made two awful errors, but he remains an excellent keeper. He also made a couple of great saves here, although that will be overshadowed. Unless you are Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the best way to beat this Liverpool side is to attack them, and take your chances at the back. It seems as soon as you dry to simply get men behind the ball and defend with no attacking outlet, you are done for. More magic from Mr Jolly, who is occasionally of this parish. That was an excellent game of football. Liverpool just do enough \u2013 that\u2019s 13 times that J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side this season have won by the odd goal. The resulting corner is an awful one, not clearing the first man at the near post, and the final whistle sounds! Liverpool\u2019s 18th consecutive win in the league! 90+5 min: Antonio does well to win a cheap free-kick from Matip on the left wing, and West Ham have one final chance to throw the ball into Liverpool\u2019s box. It\u2019s a good ball from Cresswell, cleared, and Noble\u2019s shot from the edge of the box, is deflected wide. It was probably going in! 90+4 min: Haller has been so poor, undercooking a simple five yard pass. A penny for Felipe Anderson\u2019s thoughts, on the West Ham bench. 90+2 min: That Alisson save from Bowen is the difference tonight. Whereas Fabianski made a second error to gift Liverpool a second goal, Alisson recovered from making his own early error to deny Bowen, and probably secure Liverpool\u2019s win. 90+1 min: Joel Matip is coming on for Man\u00e9. Klopp recognises that West Ham still carry a threat here. 90 min: Five minutes added on for injury time. This game is not dead yet! 88 min: West Ham have a golden chance to make it 3-3! Bowen is clean through on goal after a wonderful slide-rule pass from Antonio, but the former Hull City man takes it wide with his first touch, and sees Alisson spread himself to save his shot. Ooooooh! What a chance that was. Liverpool have looked very vulnerable at the back tonight. A more clinical side would have picked them apart. 87 min: And so it remains 3-2. Sadio Man\u00e9 thought he had given Liverpool a 4-2 lead with a tap in at the far post, but replays show that he was a yard offside after latching onto Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross. 83 min: Snodgrass\u2019s injury means he is going to have to be withdrawn. Bowen will come on for his second West Ham appearance. This change has probably come 20 minutes to late. For all their good tactical plan in the first half, Moyes\u2019s negativity has been as culpable as Fabianski\u2019s errors for West Ham surrendering their lead. 3-2! That was coming. It was perhaps a lucky goal for Liverpool, with Alexander-Arnold\u2019s pass deflected wonderfully into Salah\u2019s path, but the Egyptian showed good pace to beat Fabianski to the bouncing ball, and hooked the ball back from the byline for Man\u00e9 to tuck the ball into an open net from two yards out. Liverpool lead! 80 min: Noble is booked for holding back Oxlade-Chamberlain. 79 min: Van Dijk goes down in the area, claiming a penalty, after Haller had the temerity to out-jump him under a high ball. No penalty. 78 min: Ogbonna and Diop have been magnificent at the heart of West Ham\u2019s defence. The Italian does well to chase down Salah and make a tackle on the Liverpool forward before he can get into the West Ham box. 76 min: West Ham make a rare break forward \u2013 Antonio has been excellent in carrying the ball through midfield since Felipe Anderson went off \u2013 but Haller can only hit a powerful effort straight at Alisson. Haller has done next to nothing since coming on, it really was a very strange substitution from Moyes when West Ham were winning 2-1. 73 min: How have Liverpool not scored here?! A deep cross evades everybody but Salah, who steals in at the back post and stabs a low shot towards goal. Fabianski saves with his feet, but the ball pops up kindly for Firmino at the back post. The Brazilian looks like he must surely score, but the ball slightly goes past him, and Firmino can only hook it onto the post from an acute angle. With Liverpool shooting towards the Kop, this could be a matter of time. 71 min: Here come Liverpool again. They have 20 minutes to find a winner. 2-2! I was just about to praise Fabianski for his bravery in collecting some high balls, but this is an awful, awful mistake to gift Liverpool an equaliser. Robertson showed excellent pace to get around Snodgrass to the byline, cutting the ball back to Salah on the penalty spot. The Egyptian hit his shot first time, low and straight at Fabianski, but the Pole let the ball trickle through his legs, just over the line. Bring back Roberto! Another terrible error from Fabianski! 67 min: Diop is penalised for a perfectly good tackle in midfield. The Frenchman gets a yellow card but has been excellent tonight. 65 min: A very interesting substitution from Moyes: Felipe Anderson off, Sebastian Haller on. You could understand why West Ham have made the change \u2013 Haller holding up the ball, getting the Hammers up the pitch \u2013 but most of their pace has evaporated with that change. Weird one. 63 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has given Liverpool a renewed thrust in central midfield, as Liverpool pour forward in search of an equaliser. Alexander-Arnold tries his luck from distance, his shot swerving and dipping, but Fabianski does well to get two hands to the ball, pushing it behind for a corner, from which Firmino heads well over. 62 min: Brilliant tackle from Ngakia! Man\u00e9 was through on goal after a neat backheel from Robertson, but the teenager just got back to toe the ball away from the Sengalese. That is a challenge that Zabaleta simply wouldn\u2019t have been able to make, owing to his lack of pace. Ngakia is having quite the game at right back. 61 min: West Ham have been the better side here, but are in danger of reverting to type, dropping deep and inviting pressure onto them. 60 min: For the first time in a long time, there is a sense of disquiet among the home fans at Anfield. There is a nervousness in the air, and some jeers when errors are made. Interesting to see how J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side react. 58 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain tries his luck from range, his effort flying two yards wide. The Englishman scored an excellent goal last month at the London Stadium, remember. 57 min: Liverpool make an immediate change: Oxlade-Chamberlain comes on for Ke\u00efta, who has been pretty anonymous. What a move this is, some lovely touches in midfield from Noble, Snodgrass to build the play up methodically, before Rice whips in an early cross that leaves Liverpool\u2019s centre backs on their heels. Fornals makes a late run into the box and sweeps the ball into the corner with a first-time finish. Right in the corner, that was. Brilliant. West Ham deserve their lead! 53 min: \u201cI am impressed with the West Ham team performance today except for Felipe Anderson,\u201d emails Kevin Willis. \u201cIs this how he normally plays? He is constantly giving the ball away or making poor choices.\u201d I would beg to differ, Kevin. The Brazilian is being asked to do a lot more defensive work today, and he is mostly doing it effectively. He\u2019s probably West Ham\u2019s best player and has the pace to hurt Liverpool on the counter-attack. 51 min: Yellow card for Declan Rice, who was late in the challenge on (I think) Ke\u00efta. He\u2019ll have to be careful for the next 40 minutes. 50 min: Felipe Anderson skips past a couple of challenges, and suddenly the whole pitch opens up for West Ham. Liverpool look horribly exposed, but Fornals chooses the wrong option, passing left when Snodgrass was clean through on the right and the attack fizzles out. Liverpool looking a bit ropey without the ball, here! 49 min: Two excellent blocks from Ogbonna, who has been a real leader for West Ham tonight. 47 min: Bad news for West Ham, as Soucek collapses to the turf with some sort of injury. He\u2019s going to have to be replaced, which is a big blow to David Moyes. Pablo Fornals comes on in his place, but the Spaniard is a quite different footballer, and won\u2019t give West Ham\u2019s back four the same protection. 46 min: It took 30 seconds for Liverpool to carve out their first chance of the second half, and what a good one it was. Alexander-Arnold burst through a gaping hole in West Ham\u2019s central midfield, feeds Firmino on the left, but the Brazilian blazes over, taking the shot first time. It does seem like he is lacking a little bit of composure in front of goal. I\u2019m sure that comment will come back to haunt me. Peeeeeeeeeep! We\u2019re off again at Anfield. \u201cAs a West Ham fan this is pure torture,\u201d emails Tom Shaw. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they just get it over with and ship three or four goals and put us out of our misery? It\u2019s the bloody hope that kills.\u201d Half-time reading: And something for your commute tomorrow morning: Liverpool concede their first goal at home since 4 December, a 5-2 win over Everton. 45 min: One minute added on here for added time. West Ham are defending well. 43 min: Robertson and Snodgrass are having an intriguing battle down Liverpool\u2019s left flank. The two Scotsman, who both grew up in Glasgow, have both flown into challenges. Robertson has got the better of his compatriot in open play, but it was Snodgrass that provided the assist for West Ham\u2019s goal. 41 min: Corner to West Ham, who are running the channels effectively to get up the pitch. Well defended by Gomez this time. 39 min: From the corner, Liverpool hit the bar! Alexander-Arnold whips the ball in and an unmarked Van Dijk glances an effort onto the top of the bar and behind! There was some blocking going on to allow Van Dijk the space to run at the cross, but it\u2019s crazy that the Hammers aren\u2019t man-marking the Dutchman. 38 min: Dangerous free-kick for Liverpool, central and 25 yards out from goal. Alexander-Arnold is over the ball \u2026 the ball flies through the wall with a slight deflection and a few inches wide! There was a quick check with VAR for a handball but we continue with a corner for Liverpool. 35 min: Whisper it, but West Ham are \u2026 playing well? 33 min: Good work from Noble and Cresswell earns West Ham yet another corner. Here come the cavalry. A bit of head tennis later and Rice nods it towards Diop, who is unmarked at the back post \u2026 he taps it wide! That\u2019s a golden chance, although the Frenchman may well have been deemed offside if he had stuck it in. 31 min: Pleased to say that Ngakia has made a promising start to this match. Man\u00e9 is spending most of his side tucked slightly inside, but the young West Ham right back has nullified Robertson well so far. 29 min: Another couple of decent stats \u2026 27 min: Firmino sends a shot just over from range, a curling effort that ends up a couple of yards over the bar. It is apparently 11 months since the Brazilian last scored at Anfield in the Premier League. A remarkable stat. 25 min: Man\u00e9 nutmegs Snodgrass deliciously and sends a shot towards the top corner, but Diop does well to get across and block the shot. 24 min: West Ham so nearly take the lead! A slip allows Antonio to run clean through but a heavy touch allows Alisson to come out and claim the ball before the striker can get a shot off! 22 min: Liverpool have had 73% possession, exactly the figure they enjoyed last week against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. 20 min: Another corner to West Ham but this time Liverpool defend it well and spring on the counter. Declan Rice gets back well to intercept a pass, and allow his team-mates to recover. Liverpool are normally so dangerous in that position. 17 min: Some thoughts regarding Jamie Carragher\u2019s assertion that Liverpool only have six world-class players. \u201cCarra is wrong but maybe he has a different definition of world class,\u201d emails Mike MacKenzie. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be the best at your position just among the top 4-5 in my opinion. I agree with you that Robertson and Fabinho should be on the list.\u201d \u201cCarragher is nuts!\u201d writes Jim Dunker. \u201cRobertson &amp; Fabinho are definitely in the mix, and I\u2019d argue that Robertson more so than Alexander-Arnold, who can have a number of lapses in his concentration per game where the team covers him\u2026.\u201d \u201cNo love for Henderson?\u201d asks Joe Pearson. \u201cI know he is not in the squad tonight, but he could fit in the midfield of any of the best teams in Europe.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think TAA can yet be called world class, even if he did take the greatest corner in football history against Barcelona! I love Firmino and Salah, but for me Fun Bobby needs to add goals (yes I know what else he does) and Mo needs consistency. He can go missing in big games and sometimes throws his arms around like it\u2019s an affront when he\u2019s tackled. So I would say Alisson, VVD, and perhaps only Man\u00e9 of the front three. I think world class gets bandied about too easily these days. And besides I want all of them to stay at Anfield! Yours, expecting it in the neck from fellow LFC fans, Michael Gibson.\u201d 15 min: Fabianski now does make a save, and a good one at that! Salah cuts in from the right flank on his left foot, curling one of those classic efforts towards the far post, but Fabianski springs to his right and tips is over the bar. 13 min: Could Alisson have done better there? In truth the header was just six yards out, powerfully nodded down low. It wasn\u2019t right in the corner, but wasn\u2019t the same sort of mistake that Fabianski committed. 1-1! Set pieces were always going to be West Ham\u2019s best chance of a result tonight, and West Ham have indeed scored from a corner! Snodgrass\u2019s cross was brilliantly fired to the near post and Diop got up highest to head the ball low inside Alisson\u2019s near post. There was no player guarding the post, and although Alisson got a hand to it, it crept over the line. West Ham hit straight back! 1-0! David Martin in! A simple goal, as the ball bobbles off Aaron Creswell into a wide area. Alexander-Arnold wraps his foot around the ball the way only he knows how, a wonderfully-whipped cross, and Wijnaldum ghosts in, glancing his header towards the far post. Fabianski should get there, but can only palm the ball into the inside of the side netting! That\u2019s a shocking piece of goalkeeping! The Poland international slaps the crossbar in frustration. A poor error from Fabianski! 8 min: Antonio latches onto a ball down the left wing, runs the ball to the byline, upon which he is given an almighty shrug by Gomez. Antonio falls on the ball with his hands on the ball, expecting the free-kick, but referee Jon Moss gives the foul the other way, for handball. 6 min: Fabanski nearly has a howler! A heavy touch means his subsequent clearance is blocked by Man\u00e9, with the ball just flying two yards wide of the open goal! 4 min: Corner to Liverpool, after a skewed clearance from Diop. Well cleared by Rice. Back come Liverpool, with Van Dijk nearly releasing Salah with a beautiful cross-field ball. Creswell heads behind for another corner. The onslaught has begun. 2 min: It\u2019s a scrappy start. Have to say that this is the first time for me watching Tomas Soucek. West Ham fans, what has been your impression of him? David Moyes certainly likes him, not least because he runs A LOT. More than any West Ham player in six years during the defeat to Man City, if Moyes is to be believed. Peeeeeeeep! And we\u2019re off. Here we go then: Liverpool in their all-red kit, West Ham in their changed white away kit, with a sky blue trim. There is a minute\u2019s applause to remember Brian Jackson, a Liverpool winger in the 1950s, who passed away aged 86. On MNF, Jamie Carragher has suggested that Liverpool have (only) six world-class players: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Firmino, Salah and Man\u00e9. Would you not also have Robertson and maybe Fabinho in there? I can\u2019t think of too many left backs or defensive midfielders that are better \u2026 Any thoughts or predictions, do send them through. I\u2019m on michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18. Moyes has at least spared Pablo Zabaleta the indignity of facing Sadio Man\u00e9 tonight. Deptford-born Jeremy Ngakia starts tonight, just the second time he has done so in the Premier League. His only other appearance also came against Liverpool in January, a 2-0 defeat at the London Stadium. \u201cI am keen to give the young players the opportunity,\u201d Moyes said of Ngakia. \u201cIdeally it would not be in this situation and at Anfield away or in this situation where we are in the league. Ideally, you would try to bed them in but it does not always come perfectly. Zabaleta, as you know, has been incredibly reliable and has a great personality when he plays.\u201d Moyes speaks! We\u2019ve seen some crazy results. We have to hope that we get one of them tonight. We were well disciplined at City but we weren\u2019t good enough with the ball. We hope we can keep the same defensive organisation. \u201cEveryone is trying to figure out the way to play against Liverpool. Eventually somebody will find a way. We hope it is us.\u201d If you\u2019re here for the MBM, here\u2019s a Liverpool-West Ham flavoured Fiver. Meanwhile, in Frankfurt. Our first email, from Stephen Carr (the Stephen Carr?!). \u201cChomsky once said \u201cif you\u2019re not cynical, then you\u2019re not paying attention\u201d and after seeing Moyes\u2019 selection, the cynics amongst us might presume that he effectively just wants to keep the score down tonight.\u201d I would agree with that. The lack of pace in midfield is staggering: Noble, Snodgrass, Rice, Soucek. Even with Antonio and Felipe Anderson as the forwards, how are they going to counter-attack with that? I just don\u2019t understand the strategy, other than being happy with a 2-0 defeat. Liverpool are almost at full strength, with that fearsome front three out in force tonight. Jordan Henderson is the big absence, the midfielder out for a few weeks with a hamstring strain he suffered last week against Atl\u00e9tico. James Milner had been earmarked for a start, but Liverpool have admitted that he also misses out tonight \u201cdue to a slight muscle strain.\u201d Naby Ke\u00efta comes in. Re the team news, it is pretty damning of West Ham\u2019s transfer policy that Jarrod Bowen, Pablo Fornals and Sebastian Haller are all on the bench. That\u2019s \u00a391m of attacking talent, which has been deemed not suited to be fit/good enough, or well enough suited to the defensive system which Moyes intends to play tonight. I hope they have relegation wage clauses, because the club is in real trouble if they don\u2019t and they go down. West Ham are currently 18th, in the relegation zone, remember. A nice touch. Do you know who else has got an abysmal record at Anfield? David Moyes. The Scotsman has not won there in 15 attempts with Everton, Manchester United, Sunderland and West Ham. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson, Keita, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Man\u00e9. Subs: Lovren, Adrian, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Minamino, Lallana, Origi, Matip. West Ham: Fabianski, Ngakia, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Rice, Snodgrass, Soucek, Noble, Felipe Anderson, Antonio. Subs: Balbuena, Zabaleta, Lanzini, Bowen, Fornals, Haller, Randolph. Referee: Jonathan Moss (County Durham) \u201cWho do we think is going to beat Liverpool in the league this year? Nobody.\u201d Not my words, reader, but the words of Sam Allardyce, who was talking into a microphone this very morning. The former West Ham manager, who has an abysmal record at Anfield with the various teams he has managed there, also said he didn\u2019t \u201cthink there is any doubt\u201d that he could see some of himself in Diego Simeone, after the Argentinian masterminded Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s backs-to-the-wall victory over Liverpool last week in the Champions League. That might spell trouble for West Ham tonight, as Liverpool look to put the record straight. What do we reckon, then? 4-0? 5-0? Six? On paper, this looks like as big a home banker as it could possibly get for Liverpool. The Reds sit top of the Premier League form table, West Ham bottom of it, having taken just two points from the past six games. The London side haven\u2019t won away in the league since November, so you have to praise the Hammers fans that have made the long Monday night trip up to Anfield tonight. Team news with you imminently. And we should have the first goal of the evening before too long. Kick-off: 8pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Harvey Weinstein, the fallen titan of Hollywood whose sexual abuse of aspiring young female actors sparked the #MeToo movement, has finally been brought to justice after a New York jury found him guilty of two of the five charges he faced.</p> \n<p>The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court took five days to reach their verdict. They found the defendant guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006.</p> \n<p>The count carries a minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum of up to 25 years.</p> \n<p>The jury also convicted Weinstein of rape in the third degree. This relates to him raping a woman the Guardian is not naming, as her wishes for identification are not clear, in a New York hotel in 2013. This count carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison and no minimum, though it requires Weinstein to register as a sex offender.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/weinstein-accusers-what-they-said-accusations\">The six women who accused Harvey Weinstein at his trial, and what they said</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Weinstein was acquitted of three further charges, including the two most serious counts of predatory sexual assault which carried a possible life sentence and an alternative count of rape in the first degree.</p> \n<p>After the verdict Weinstein was handcuffed and remanded into custody ahead of sentencing on 11 March. He was taken from the courthouse in an ambulance and first taken to a locked unit at Bellevue hospital. The judge said he would ask that Weinstein would be held in the infirmary at the Rikers Island jail. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers had argued he needs medical attention following an unsuccessful back surgery.</p> \n<p>Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Donna Rotunno, said her client would appeal. \u201cHe took it like a man. He knows that we will continue to fight for him and knows that this is not over,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the New York district attorney, Cyrus Vance, hailed the courage of the victims who had spoken out. \u201cWeinstein with his manipulation, his resources, his attorneys, his publicists and his spies did everything he could to silence the survivors. But they wouldn\u2019t be silenced, spoke from their hearts, and were heard,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The movie mogul\u2019s epic fall from grace is now complete, toppled from the pinnacle of independent cinema where he helmed films such as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, amassing a total of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2017/10/13/here-are-all-of-harvey-weinsteins-oscar-wins/#3837bcc4d946\">81 Oscars</a>. The glamorous Manhattan and Los Angeles lifestyle he once enjoyed will soon be replaced by a New York state prison cell.</p> \n<p>The conviction marks the final comeuppance for a towering figure who wielded his power in the movie industry \u2013 as well as his commanding physical presence \u2013 over vulnerable young women seeking his help.</p> \n<p>Though Judge James Burke cautioned the jury not to see the case as a referendum on #MeToo, Weinstein\u2019s conviction is certain to have far-reaching consequences for gender relations in the workplace, in Hollywood and far beyond. The world of powerful men who deploy their seniority as tools of sexual control is much less secure in its wake.</p> \n<p>Michelle Simpson Tuegel, an attorney representing victims of sexual assault, said she expected to see a wave of women coming forward with complaints against other sexual abusers. \u201cNo matter how powerful a person is, no matter how much mud or dirt may be flung at those who have the courage to come forward, we are in a new time. The #MeToo era has thankfully started to unmask these systems of abuse of power, and now women can be heard and believed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The guilty verdict could also have a profound impact on the way sex crimes are prosecuted.

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein, the fallen titan of Hollywood whose sexual abuse of aspiring young female actors sparked the #MeToo movement, has finally been brought to justice after a New York jury found him guilty of two of the five charges he faced. The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court took five days to reach their verdict. They found the defendant guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The count carries a minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum of up to 25 years. The jury also convicted Weinstein of rape in the third degree. This relates to him raping a woman the Guardian is not naming, as her wishes for identification are not clear, in a New York hotel in 2013. This count carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison and no minimum, though it requires Weinstein to register as a sex offender. Weinstein was acquitted of three further charges, including the two most serious counts of predatory sexual assault which carried a possible life sentence and an alternative count of rape in the first degree. After the verdict Weinstein was handcuffed and remanded into custody ahead of sentencing on 11 March. He was taken from the courthouse in an ambulance and first taken to a locked unit at Bellevue hospital. The judge said he would ask that Weinstein would be held in the infirmary at the Rikers Island jail. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers had argued he needs medical attention following an unsuccessful back surgery. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Donna Rotunno, said her client would appeal. \u201cHe took it like a man. He knows that we will continue to fight for him and knows that this is not over,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, the New York district attorney, Cyrus Vance, hailed the courage of the victims who had spoken out. \u201cWeinstein with his manipulation, his resources, his attorneys, his publicists and his spies did everything he could to silence the survivors. But they wouldn\u2019t be silenced, spoke from their hearts, and were heard,\u201d he said. The movie mogul\u2019s epic fall from grace is now complete, toppled from the pinnacle of independent cinema where he helmed films such as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, amassing a total of 81 Oscars. The glamorous Manhattan and Los Angeles lifestyle he once enjoyed will soon be replaced by a New York state prison cell. The conviction marks the final comeuppance for a towering figure who wielded his power in the movie industry \u2013 as well as his commanding physical presence \u2013 over vulnerable young women seeking his help. Though Judge James Burke cautioned the jury not to see the case as a referendum on #MeToo, Weinstein\u2019s conviction is certain to have far-reaching consequences for gender relations in the workplace, in Hollywood and far beyond. The world of powerful men who deploy their seniority as tools of sexual control is much less secure in its wake. Michelle Simpson Tuegel, an attorney representing victims of sexual assault, said she expected to see a wave of women coming forward with complaints against other sexual abusers. \u201cNo matter how powerful a person is, no matter how much mud or dirt may be flung at those who have the courage to come forward, we are in a new time. The #MeToo era has thankfully started to unmask these systems of abuse of power, and now women can be heard and believed.\u201d The guilty verdict could also have a profound impact on the way sex crimes are prosecuted. The New York district attorney\u2019s office took an enormous gamble in how they set up the trial. Prosecutors chose as main accusers two women, both of whom continued to have close \u2013 and at times sexual \u2013 contact with Weinstein after they were attacked. In the past, prosecutors have almost always balked at such cases where coerced and consensual sex exists side-by-side, considering them too messy to secure guilty verdicts. The fact that the tactic succeeded with the jury is a sign of the shifting sands of #MeToo. It suggests that prosecutors might have far more leeway in the future to take on cases where victims continue to be in the thrall of their attackers after sexual assaults \u2013 a scenario which sex crimes experts say is all too common and yet up till now has been almost entirely neglected by the criminal courts. As psychiatrist Barbara Ziv told the jury in expert testimony, \u201cit is the norm to have contact with the assailant\u201d. Such a striking victory can be credited to the two intrepid prosecutors, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon and Meghan Hast, who meticulously laid out the defendant\u2019s culpability. They did so against the headwinds generated by Weinstein\u2019s lawyers led by the Chicago-based sex crimes defender Rotunno who was so aggressive towards witnesses that she induced in one of the two main accusers a fully fledged panic attack. The prosecutors called 27 witnesses over 12 days, building up a profile of the movie producer as a cold and calculating sexual predator that ultimately overwhelmed defense arguments. They emphasized the vast gulf in power \u2013 and girth \u2013 between Weinstein and his victims. He was a \u201cfamous and powerful Hollywood producer living a lavish lifestyle that most of us will never know\u201d, Hast said, pointing out that he counted among his friends not only the elite of Hollywood but also world leaders like Bill Clinton. By contrast, the unnamed rape victim was brought up on a Washington state dairy farm. Weinstein, 67, meticulously planned his attacks, carefully selecting his victims for their vulnerability and neediness. He set them loyalty tests that if they passed would then lead on to the next stage of his predatory grooming. He hooked Miriam Haley, now 42, his second main accuser, by helping her secure a production assistant job on Project Runway. Then on 10 July 2006 he lured Haley up to his SoHo apartment on the pretext of a business meeting. Once inside things were normal until the film producer suddenly lunged at her and tried to kiss her. She rejected him, but he kept on coming, pushing her backwards into a bedroom and on to the bed. She remembered the room being dimly lit and with children\u2019s toys in it. \u201cI tried to get up and he pushed me down. I just said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want this to happen.\u2019\u201d She kept protesting, telling him she was on her period, but \u201cit was as if he didn\u2019t believe me\u201d; he yanked the tampon out and carried on attacking her. Eventually she stopped resisting. \u201cI figured it was pointless,\u201d Haley told the jury as she cried. The rape victim described the defendant as a Jekyll and Hyde. \u201cIf he heard the word \u2018no\u2019, it was like a trigger for him,\u201d she said. As the evidence unfolded in courtroom 99, through the eerily similar accounts of all six women, it became clear that sex for Weinstein had nothing to do with seduction, romance and affection, let alone intimacy or love. As the rape victim testified, her attacker had to use a needle to inject himself in the penis with an erectile dysfunction medicine before he could carry out the assault. One of his friends, Paul Feldsher, who was called as a defense witness, said Weinstein had a \u201csex addiction\u201d. But a much more accurate analysis of his behavior was given by Illuzzi-Orbon, who told the jury that \u201cultimately this trial is about the defendant\u2019s desire for conquest\u201d. In the end, what will stick in the mind of many of those people who sat through the trial \u2013 witnesses, jurors, court officials, reporters and public alike \u2013 was the terrifying violence of the attacks. Haley related in court how Weinstein had ripped out her tampon before forcing oral sex on her. Tarale Wulff, a model 43, who was one of three witnesses called by the prosecution to show a pattern of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d by the defendant, recounted how she was attacked in his SoHo apartment in 2005. \u201cHe took me by the arms turned me around and threw me on the bed then got on top of me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe put himself inside me and raped me.\u201d Several of the witnesses told the jury that Weinstein appeared to think he was entitled to abuse women given his status within the movie industry.

Before he gets to lodge any appeal, Weinstein could face further legal jeopardy. Los Angeles authorities have charged him with raping and sexually assaulting two women over a two-day period in February 2013. It remains to be seen whether those prosecutions will proceed or whether they will be allowed to wither now that he is certain to face prison time in New York. One of the two women in the LA case was a \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witness in New York \u2013 Lauren Young, who told the jury how Weinstein had groped her in a hotel bathroom in Beverly Hills in 2013.

      "body": "<p>History was made at Anfield as Liverpool established a Premier League record of 21 consecutive home wins and equalled Manchester City\u2019s run of 18 successive top-flight victories. The landmark was created with great difficulty and greater belief. West Ham surpassed expectations in making J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s leaders look vulnerable but, like every other domestic visitor this season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/22/liverpool-finanacial-fair-play-manchester-city-uefa\" title=\"\">they departed Anfield</a> in the knowledge their best was not enough.</p> <p>Liverpool moved to within 12 points of the slice of history that matters most \u2013 their first league title for 30 years \u2013 thanks to many of the characteristics that have come to define their remarkable campaign.</p> <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold made the breakthrough for Georginio Wijnaldum and the late winner for Sadio Man\u00e9 as he moved to 12 assists for the second season running. Andy Robertson continued the theme of Liverpool\u2019s devastating full-backs by setting up Mohamed Salah for the second, converted thanks to a dreadful mistake by West Ham\u2019s goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.</p> <p>At that point the visitors led through the substitute Pablo Fornals and Liverpool, sluggish for long spells, were in trouble. But they were never subdued. Klopp\u2019s players rarely are these days. Roared on by an equally convinced Anfield crowd Liverpool found a way once more.</p> <p>David Moyes has never won in 16 visits to Anfield and, even after Fornals had swept West Ham into a merited lead early in the second half, he refused to get carried away with the celebrations of his staff on the bench. Experience has taught him not to, and so have West Ham\u2019s problems in goal this season.</p> <p>Fabianski made several fine stops but was at fault for the first and the crucial second goal, letting Salah\u2019s low shot squirm between his legs and over the line, as West Ham remained ensconced in the relegation zone without a win in seven league games.</p> <p>Their problems are not restricted to the field of play either, with kick-off the signal for a mass protest towards the club\u2019s board by the travelling supporters.</p> <p>The black balloons that formed part of the West Ham protest were still being popped when Liverpool took the lead.</p> <p>When Roberto Firmino saw a shot blocked inside the West Ham area the threat to Fabianski\u2019s goal appeared over. Or so the visitors thought. The ball spun towards the corner flag where Alexander-Arnold whipped over a trademark peach of a cross for Wijnaldum to head beyond Fabianski.</p> <p>Robert Snodgrass and Issa Diop reacted too late to the cross and the midfielder\u2019s darting run but the Poland keeper was also culpable. Wijnaldum\u2019s header was hardly bullet-like but found its target via Fabianski\u2019s weak forearm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"787d5ec248178f5121cda5ff36997724a5da7b92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787d5ec248178f5121cda5ff36997724a5da7b92/0_26_2276_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lukasz Fabianski lets Mohamed Salah\u2019s shot slip through his hands for Liverpool\u2019s equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lukasz Fabianski lets Mohamed Salah\u2019s shot slip through his hands for Liverpool\u2019s equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the worst possible start to what had always threatened to be a long night for Moyes\u2019s team but West Ham\u2019s response could not be faulted. They were level within three minutes through the first of several dangerous set pieces, a fine header from Diop on the end of a Snodgrass corner with Alisson being caught by surprise at his near post. It was the first Premier League goal Liverpool had conceded on home soil since 4 December and prompted an outbreak of \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win the league\u201d from the visiting fans. Laughter emerged from the rest of the stadium.</p> <p>Fabianski produced a fine save to deny Salah, Virgil van Dijk struck the crossbar with a header from an Alexander-Arnold corner and the right-back went close with a low drive from Firmino\u2019s lay-off.

      "bodyText": "History was made at Anfield as Liverpool established a Premier League record of 21 consecutive home wins and equalled Manchester City\u2019s run of 18 successive top-flight victories. The landmark was created with great difficulty and greater belief. West Ham surpassed expectations in making J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s leaders look vulnerable but, like every other domestic visitor this season, they departed Anfield in the knowledge their best was not enough. Liverpool moved to within 12 points of the slice of history that matters most \u2013 their first league title for 30 years \u2013 thanks to many of the characteristics that have come to define their remarkable campaign. Trent Alexander-Arnold made the breakthrough for Georginio Wijnaldum and the late winner for Sadio Man\u00e9 as he moved to 12 assists for the second season running. Andy Robertson continued the theme of Liverpool\u2019s devastating full-backs by setting up Mohamed Salah for the second, converted thanks to a dreadful mistake by West Ham\u2019s goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. At that point the visitors led through the substitute Pablo Fornals and Liverpool, sluggish for long spells, were in trouble. But they were never subdued. Klopp\u2019s players rarely are these days. Roared on by an equally convinced Anfield crowd Liverpool found a way once more. David Moyes has never won in 16 visits to Anfield and, even after Fornals had swept West Ham into a merited lead early in the second half, he refused to get carried away with the celebrations of his staff on the bench. Experience has taught him not to, and so have West Ham\u2019s problems in goal this season. Fabianski made several fine stops but was at fault for the first and the crucial second goal, letting Salah\u2019s low shot squirm between his legs and over the line, as West Ham remained ensconced in the relegation zone without a win in seven league games. Their problems are not restricted to the field of play either, with kick-off the signal for a mass protest towards the club\u2019s board by the travelling supporters. The black balloons that formed part of the West Ham protest were still being popped when Liverpool took the lead. When Roberto Firmino saw a shot blocked inside the West Ham area the threat to Fabianski\u2019s goal appeared over. Or so the visitors thought. The ball spun towards the corner flag where Alexander-Arnold whipped over a trademark peach of a cross for Wijnaldum to head beyond Fabianski. Robert Snodgrass and Issa Diop reacted too late to the cross and the midfielder\u2019s darting run but the Poland keeper was also culpable. Wijnaldum\u2019s header was hardly bullet-like but found its target via Fabianski\u2019s weak forearm. It was the worst possible start to what had always threatened to be a long night for Moyes\u2019s team but West Ham\u2019s response could not be faulted. They were level within three minutes through the first of several dangerous set pieces, a fine header from Diop on the end of a Snodgrass corner with Alisson being caught by surprise at his near post. It was the first Premier League goal Liverpool had conceded on home soil since 4 December and prompted an outbreak of \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win the league\u201d from the visiting fans. Laughter emerged from the rest of the stadium. Fabianski produced a fine save to deny Salah, Virgil van Dijk struck the crossbar with a header from an Alexander-Arnold corner and the right-back went close with a low drive from Firmino\u2019s lay-off. Despite the chances Liverpool struggled to find their rhythm and Jordan Henderson\u2019s absence was sorely felt in central midfield. The departure of Tomas Soucek early in the second half through injury was significant, as the January recruit had been highly effective in the West Ham midfield, but his replacement made a greater impression. Fornals had been on the pitch eight minutes when he stunned Anfield by sweeping the visitors ahead. Declan Rice delivered a low cross from the right, Joe Gomez was slow to react and the Spanish midfielder steered a first-time shot wide of Alisson\u2019s despairing dive, into the Brazilian\u2019s bottom right-hand corner. As always, Klopp\u2019s players refused to be derailed by a deficit or a jaded display. Alexander-Arnold stung Fabianski\u2019s fingers with a soaring drive before Liverpool levelled courtesy of a shocking error from the West Ham keeper. It followed a fine move, started by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s crossfield ball to Robertson and his darting run inside Snodgrass to set up Salah. The forward\u2019s shot was low and straight at Fabianski but squeezed through the keeper\u2019s hands and trickled over the line. Cue despair for West Ham and greater relief for the champions-elect. Liverpool pressed on for the record-breaking win and, somewhat inevitably, it arrived late in the day. Alexander-Arnold was quickest to react when Gomez\u2019s shot deflected off Noble and sailed into the West Ham area. As Fabianski advanced the full-back had the presence of mind to lift the ball over his head and there was Man\u00e9, unmarked, to tap home the winner. There was still time for another West Ham substitute, Jarrod Bowen, to race through on Liverpool\u2019s goal \u2013 he tried to chip the advancing goalkeeper \u2013 but Alisson made a vital, telling save to secure another three points. Only 12 more, at the very most, to go.",

We\u2019ve got good movers but power is a very important part of the game and when we don\u2019t have him it\u2019s difficult.\u201d In his post-match press conference after England\u2019s win over Ireland, Jones claimed that his side were so dominant they could have \u201cdeclared at half-time\u201d. Seemingly in reference to having to make an apology for a bizarre remark to a reporter last week, he later said: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a throwaway line, probably need to apologise for it again. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know you\u2019re not allowed to say anything that\u2019s a little bit different here, so I\u2019ll apologise.\u201d Jones also praised Owen Farrell\u2019s captaincy against Ireland, picking up on what he perceived to be criticism of the player\u2019s leadership. \u201cOwen is not even two years into the job,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery game he captains, he gets a little bit better. It wasn\u2019t about what he did on the field [against Ireland], it was about what he did in the lead-up to the game. \u201cHe\u2019s learning to be a better captain. Captaincy is hard. You have a room of all different sorts of people and you have to try to find the same page for them and that takes experience. He\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d",

The effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the Italian economy could be \u201cvery strong, the country\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte warns. The economic impact could be very strong. At this moment, we can calculate that there will be a negative economic impact, we are not yet in a position to forecast what will happen. Italy is struggling to contain the Europe\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak, whose epicentre is in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the industrial and financial heartlands of the country. The US department of homeland security\u2019s top official on the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force has sought help on social media accessing a map about the virus. Ken Cuccinelli, the DHS acting deputy secretary, first asked on Twitter if a link to the map stopped working for other people (it worked for the Guardian). In a second post, he said it looked like he couldn\u2019t access it because it was behind a paywall. \u201cSeems like bad timing to stop helping the world with this (previously) useful resource,\u201d tweeted the senior member of the Trump administration. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping it goes back up soon.\u201d The death toll in Europe\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreak has risen to seven on Monday and new cases climbed above 220 as Italy shut down much of its wealthy north to curb the disease\u2019s spread. Italian shares tumbled more than 5%, the biggest daily drop in almost four years, on worries the flare-up could cause a recession, while worried residents emptied supermarket shelves to stock up on essentials. Authorities in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the industrial and financial heartlands of Italy, shut schools, universities, museums and cinemas for at least a week, and banned public gatherings including the famed Venice carnival. In Lombardy, close to Italy\u2019s business capital Milan, nearly 50,000 people have been placed under effective quarantine, as measures were adopted for 10 towns, as well as a further one in neighbouring Veneto. \u201cTo be honest, nobody thought the spread would be so aggressive,\u201d Lombardy regional governor Attilio Fontana told 102.5 RTL radio, predicting, however that the virus would regress in days due to the emergency measures. Local authorities announced four new deaths on Monday \u2013 three men in their 80s and a 62-year-old. Three previous fatalities recorded since Friday were also elderly people. All those who have died had underlying health problems. Lombardy remained the worst hit region with 172 confirmed cases, while neighbouring Veneto had 33 infections, including four in Venice, which had been packed with tourists before its carnival was curtailed two days ahead of schedule. At national level, 27 people were in intensive care, 101 hospitalised and 94 being monitored at home, officials said. Earlier reports from Ansa incorrectly put the death toll at seven and were corrected to six later on Monday. Local authorities have now clarified that the toll has since risen to seven people. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said there were 14 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the country, Reuters reported. These did not include the 39 cases who were among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and the city of Wuhan. The agency said the 14 confirmed cases included two new cases reported from Humboldt and Sacramento counties, in California. On Friday, the CDC reported 13 cases among those within the country and 21 cases from among the repatriated Americans and said they were preparing for the possibility of the spread of the virus through US communities that would force the closure of schools and businesses. American public health officials have also warned that cases among the repatriated citizens will likely increase. All nations must work together to fight the spread of the coronavirus and prevent a crisis with \u201cdramatic consequences\u201d for global health and the world economy, the UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said. Guterres, speaking to reporters during a visit to the World Health Organisation (WHO) centre for managing emergencies, called for full funding of the body\u2019s appeal for $675m (\u00a3522m) to cover its overall response for three months. Following a briefing with the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and other senior officials, Guterres said: All countries \u2013 and this is now a problem that is affecting many countries in the world \u2013 all countries must do everything to be prepared. The disease it\u2019s still possible to contain but if some fail, if some do not do everything that is needed, this can still become out of control with dramatic consequences in global health and the global economy. He said the decline in new cases of coronavirus in China was a good trend which he hoped could be maintained. The World Health Organization has played down fears of a coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world, despite sudden serious outbreaks in Italy and Iran, but some experts said they believed it was now inevitable. \u201cUsing the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, at a briefing. We are not there yet, said Tedros. \u201cWhat we see are epidemics in different parts of the world affecting different countries in different ways.\u201d Other experts said it was hard to believe that COVID-19 would not now spread worldwide. \u201cWe now consider this to be a pandemic in all but name, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the World Health Organization starts to use the term in its communications,\u201d said Dr Bharat Pankhania, from the University of Exeter Medical School. Austria has said it will stop people suspected of carrying the coronavirus from crossing its border, after parts of northern Italy were put into lockdown over the weekend following a surge in cases. The Austrian government released a travel warning for affected areas of Lombardy and Veneto, following a meeting of the government\u2019s coronavirus taskforce that included the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. \u201cAs far as the borders and cross-border traffic are concerned, we will proceed as follows: we will further tighten warning systems with our neighbours, we will immediately order a stop in the event of suspected cases, as happened last night,\u201d Kurz said on Monday. The Trump administration is considering asking Congress for emergency funding to ramp up the US response to coronavirus, Reuters reports. \u201cWe need some funding here to make sure that we ... protect all Americans, that we keep us safe,\u201d White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said on Fox News. Asked how much funding the administration might ask Congress to approve, Gidley later said that there was no announcement yet on the amount. Politico and the Washington Post, citing unnamed individuals familiar with the planning, had reported the administration may request $1bn funding from Congress. An administration official told Reuters the amount was still being finalised, and the request could go to lawmakers this week. There have been 13 cases of people diagnosed with the virus in the US and 21 cases among Americans repatriated on evacuation flights from Wuhan Here\u2019s a summary of Monday\u2019s events: Six people are now confirmed to have died from coronavirus in Italy, which has had the worst outbreak in Europe with 219 confirmed cases. The Italian government has introduced stringent internal travel restrictions, closing off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Several European countries including Croatia, Hungary, Ireland and Serbia have advised their citizens against travelling to the affected areas in Italy. Austria is considering reintroducing border controls with Italy. Stock markets in Europe closed the day more than 3.5% down amid virus fears. Iran has denied trying to cover up the full extent of the outbreak after a reformist website reported 50 deaths from the virus. The deputy health minister said 12 people had died from the virus. South Korean cases spiked to over 760, as several countries imposed travel bans, and some airlines cancelled routes to Seoul. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq reported their first cases \u2013 all involving people who had come from Iran. A team from the World Health Organization was due to visit Iran on Tuesday. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. China reported 150 new deaths from the virus, with one outside Hubei province. Infections rose by 409 (398 in Hubei) to 77,150. Four Chinese provinces lowered their alert levels on the virus, including Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanxi and Guizhou. The WHO said it was encouraged by the decline in new cases in China. The death toll for the coronavirus in Italy stands at six, rather than seven as was initially reported. The Lombardy regional government has denied reports that a person with the coronavirus had died at Brescia\u2019s Civili hospital. Austria is considering reintroducing border controls with Italy, in an attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has led to a dozen northern Italian towns being put into lockdown. Italian authorities have said they will impose fines on anyone entering or leaving restricted areas. More than 200 people have contracted the virus and six people have died. The European commission announced on Monday that it would send experts to Italy from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, in a joint mission with the World Health Organization. The EU executive also announced a \u20ac232m (\u00a3195m) package to deal with the virus, although some of the funds have yet to be signed off. European markets have closed for trading, with all major indices having lost 3.5% or more amid fears about coronavirus spreading to Europe. Our business blog has more. Officials are now saying there have been six coronavirus deaths in Italy, not seven. We\u2019ll have more details soon. Japanese health officials and experts on a government panel have acknowledged that the quarantine of the virus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess was not perfect, AP reports. The officials said Japanese health authorities faced tough challenges in dealing with a foreign-operated ship that required international negotiations, in the absence of established rules to deal with such a crisis. \u201cThe ship was not designed to be a hospital. The ship was a ship,\u201d said Shigeru Omi, a former regional director for the World Health Organization. He added: \u201cOf course isolation was not ideal as would be expected from a hospital, so in my view although the isolation was somehow effective, to a large extent it was not perfect.\u201d The UK remains \u201cprepared for all eventualities\u201d over coronavirus, Downing Street has said, PA reports. Thirteen people in the UK have so far been diagnosed with Covid-19, including four over the weekend who had been on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was held in quarantine in Japan. On Monday, Downing Street insisted the UK was \u201cwell-prepared\u201d and said the risk to individuals in the UK remained low. Asked whether the UK could put in place restrictive measures such as those seen in Italy to combat the spread of the disease, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cWe will be led by the advice from public health and medical experts and will take steps which they feel are required to best protect the British public. \u201cWe are well prepared for UK cases, we are using tried and tested procedures to prevent further spread and the NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections. \u201cWe continue to work closely with the World Health Organization and international partners as the situation develops and we remain prepared for all eventualities.\u201d The Foreign Office has not advised Britons against travel to Italy, but has updated its website with factual information about the situation there. There are no figures as yet as to whether any Britons are stuck in Italy and affected by the lockdown. Four Britons rescued from the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship are being treated at specialist centres in the north of England after testing positive for the illness. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital, in Merseyside, on Saturday. Two of the patients are in the Royal Hallamshire hospital, in Sheffield, one is in the Royal Liverpool University hospital and a fourth was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. British couple David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who were on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary, are still in a Japanese hospital after being diagnosed with coronavirus and pneumonia. China has delayed its annual parliamentary meeting as authorities struggle to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which has spread to more countries and prompted fears of a global pandemic. For the first time in decades, the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), where hundreds of delegates gather in Beijing every March, was postponed on Monday. The standing committee for the NPC said a new date for the meeting would be announced separately, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. People in northern Italy have been in touch with the Guardian to say they have noticed empty shelves in local supermarkets. Francesco Sole, a trade union regional secretary from Milan, said prices for face masks and antibacterial gel had skyrocketed. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a shock for us in northern Italy. My wife and I rushed to do some grocery shopping in fear of being stuck at home. \u201cEmpty shelves for basic products such as flour, oil and bottled water were easily noticeable,\u201d he said. \u201cFinding a mask or antibacterial gel has become as challenging as finding water on the moon. \u201cSome companies have organised their workers to switch to smart working while many others are still seeking to find solutions to manage the situation. People in Milan are trying to figure out what life will be like in the days to come. For a city that is always on the move, this is an eerie pause.\u201d Francesca, 26, from Lodi, said though the city was not under quarantine the rest of the region had closed schools, universities, theatres, and libraries. Francesca, a student at the Brera Academy of Fine Art, in Milan, said: \u201cA lot of people in towns that are on lockdown work in Lodi, so everyone here has probably had contact with an infected person. \u201cPanic is spreading everywhere. Many hospitals\u2019 emergency rooms (where not closed as a precautionary measure) are stormed unnecessarily. It has led people to literally empty supermarkets of long conservation products. Everyone here is constantly looking for updates about the situation and you never know if tomorrow you will be still allowed to go outside your house. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m waiting to know if a colleague of my father and brother is positive or not. He is now hospitalised and is suspected of having it. If so, my family will probably have to be tested too.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of what we know about the coronavirus outbreak so far on Monday: Seven people are now confirmed to have died from coronavirus in Italy which has seen the worst outbreak in Europe with 219 confirmed cases. The Italian government has introduced stringent internal travel restrictions, closing off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Iran has denied trying to cover up the full extent of the outbreak after a reformist website reported 50 deaths from the virus. The deputy health minister said 12 people had died from the virus. South Korean cases spiked to over 760, as several countries imposed travel bans, and some airlines cancelled routes to Seoul. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq reported their first cases \u2013 all involving people who had come from Iran. A team from the World Health Organization is due to visit Iran on Tuesday. The WHO director general described the sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. China reported 150 new deaths from the virus, with one outside Hubei province. Infections rose by 409 (398 in Hubei) to 77,150. Four Chinese provinces lowered their alert levels on the virus, including Yunnanm Guangdong, Shznxi and Guizhou. The WHO said it was encouraged by the decline in new cases in China. Serbia\u2019s foreign ministry has advised Serbs against travelling to the parts of Italy hit by the virus. Spain currently has no plans to close its borders in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the country\u2019s health minister has said. Salvador Illa said the authorities were focusing on reinforcing existing precautions throughout the health system and on raising awareness at ports and airports. He said: \u201cFor the moment, experts are advising us not to take other measures that may not be effective - although we\u2019re ready if they need to be taken,\u201d the minister said. \u201cPeople can trust the national health system and its professionals. \u201cThus far, everything has been handled with the utmost competence but people should also be assured that we\u2019re constantly monitoring the situation to adapt measures to the reality of the situation.\u201d Spain currently has two confirmed cases of the coronavirus: one on the Balearic island of Mallorca and another on the remote Canary island of La Gomera. Nine people have tested negative for the virus in recent hours and the authorities are waiting on test results from a further three. Italy\u2019s former far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has attempted to politicise the coronavirus outbreak in the country, attacking the Italian government for not defending the country\u2019s borders. On Sunday, Salvini, who is also the leader of the League party, called on prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, to resign \u201cif he isn\u2019t able to defend Italy and Italians.\u201d In particular, Salvini cited the docking, on Sunday, of the NGO Ocean Viking rescue ship with 276 African migrants onboard in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo, to say Italy needs \u201cto make our borders armour-plated.\u201d On the bright side, the WHO team in China has concluded the virus can be contained. It peaked between the end of January and the beginning of February. Dr Ghebreyesus said he was encouraged by the continued decline of new cases in China. Dr Ghebreyesus defended the WHO\u2019s decision not to declare the outbreak a pandemic. \u201cUsing the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,\u201d he said. A team from the World Health Organization is due to arrive in Tehran on Tuesday after the sharp rise in cases in Iran. Speaking at a news conference, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, said the sudden increase in cases Iran, Italy and South Korea was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. A seventh person has died in the coronavirus outbreak in Italy, the Ansa news agency has reported. Ansa said the latest person to die was an 80-year-old man who had been taken to hospital last week in Lodi after having a heart attack, Reuters reports. Doctors believe he caught the virus there from another patient. Italy reported its first death from the coronavirus outbreak on Friday. The UK remains \u201cprepared for all eventualities\u201d and the risk to individuals remains low, Downing Street said on Monday. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: We will be led by the advice from public health and medical experts and will take steps which they feel are required to best protect the British public. We are well prepared for UK cases, we are using tried and tested procedures to prevent further spread and the NHS is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections. We continue to work closely with the World Health Organization and international partners as the situation develops and we remain prepared for all eventualities.\u201d A sixth person has died in the coronavirus outbreak in Italy, the state broadcaster RAI reported on Monday. The person was a cancer patient in the northern town of Brescia. The World Health Organization confirmed \u201csteep declines\u201d in coronavirus cases in China even after taking into account statistical issues. China caused confusion last week about the figures after twice changing how it counted confirmed cases. At a joint briefing in Beijing between the WHO and China\u2019s national health commission, Bruce Aylward, the head of a team of WHO experts visiting China, acknowledged the confusion. He said: \u201cI know people look at the numbers and say what\u2019s really happening.\u201d But he added that \u201cmultiple sources of data\u201d pointed to declines. \u201cThis is falling and it is falling because of the actions that are being taken,\u201d Aylward said. While he applauded the dramatic measures taken by Beijing to quarantine entire cities, he said anything that went beyond WHO recommendations in terms of travel and trade restrictions should be reassessed. Liang Wannian, of the health commission, also said at the briefing that more than 3,000 medical staff in China had been infected by the coronavirus, mostly because of lack of protective gear and fatigue. Ireland has said its citizens should not travel to parts of Italy affected by an outbreak of coronavirus. Italy\u2019s government has moved to close off the worst-hit areas, in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, as the death toll in the country from the disease rose to five on Monday. \u201cThere has been an increase in the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy ... Citizens are advised not to travel to affected areas,\u201d the foreign ministry said in updated travel advice. Coronavirus deaths in Italy have risen to five people, with 209 confirmed cases. An 84-year-old woman died overnight in Bergamo, in the Lombardy region, and an 88-year-old from Caselle Landi, also in Lombardy, died on Monday. Hong Kong, home to at least 79 confirmed coronavirus cases, has issued a travel alert for South Korea, advising resident to avoid non-essential travel to the country and cautioning those already there to avoid crowded places and healthcare facilities. Secretary for security John Lee said that starting from 6am on Tuesday, the city will bar all non-Hong Kong residents coming from South Korea. Hong Kong citizens returning from South Korea will have to be in quarantine for 14 days. A government spokesman said: \u201cIn view of the persistent and rapid increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in Korea and the close contacts between Hong Kong and Korea, the government has decided to issue the Red Outbound Travel Alert (OTA) on Korea based on public health considerations. Red OTA urges the public planning to travel to Korea to adjust travel plans and avoid non-essential travel.\u201d The catering staff onboard the previously quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship have recorded a dance video to celebrate them being allowed home to the Philippines. A translator from northern Italy has told the Guardian that the closure of schools and universities has left an eerie silence. \u201cIt\u2019s nice not having to deal with the morning traffic when I walk my dogs but the silence from the local primary school is eerie,\u201d said Susanna, from Treviso. \u201cI did a spot of shopping for my elderly mum last night and the supermarket was busy, but the shelves were not as empty as others in the region.\u201d She is studying to become a nature guide but her classes have been cancelled until at least 1 March. \u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t seem to pose more of a threat than seasonal flu, but it is forbidden to attend meetings and sports or cultural events. Defying the government\u2019s lockdown measures might mean facing arrest or a hefty fine. \u201cI\u2019m a member of the local cycling association and we were supposed to hold our monthly critical mass [when cyclists meet to ride through their local area] but this has been cancelled. This is especially upsetting as Treviso has a serious problem with air pollution and we had managed to involve school principals in our ride through town.\u201d In France, the government urged anyone who has visited Lombardy or Veneto \u2013 the two most affected regions in Italy \u2013 to wear face masks if they go outside, limit non-essential activities and take their temperatures twice a day. The French health ministry issued the same advice for anyone who had traveled to China, South Korea, Singapore or Macao. France has had 12 cases of the virus overall, and one death. The national health agency said officials were \u201cevaluating the situation\u201d of a bus of Italians, blocked in Lyon, which originated in Milan and stopped in Turin, but wouldn\u2019t give details, or say whether anyone on the bus was suspected of having the virus. Slovenia and Croatia, on the Italian border, which are popular destinations for Italian tourists and whose own citizens often travel to Italy, were holding crisis meetings Monday. Croatia announced it would monitor any travellers coming from Italy, including Croatian children returning from school trips. The Romanian prime minister, Ludovic Orban, said anyone entering Romania from any region where the virus had been reported would be quarantined for 14 days, but local media reported that arriving passengers were only being asked to fill out a form. In Albania, about 5,000 passengers arriving by plane, ferry and land were being monitored, with border crossing points targeting travellers from Italy in particular. Fears spread to as far away as Mauritius, which blocked an Alitalia airplane that had landed. The Italian foreign ministry said it was working to provide maximum assistance to Italians on board. Many Italians are travelling this week for the mid-winter school holiday, and Mauritius is a popular destination. The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of the coronavirus outbreak after reports suggested the death toll from the disease was more than four times higher than official figures claim. Sam Jones has more: On Monday, a lawmaker from Qom \u2013 a Shia holy city 75 miles (120 km) south of the capital, Tehran, accused Iran\u2019s health minister of lying about the scale of the outbreak. According to the semi-official Ilna news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. \u201cThe rest of the media have not published this figure, but we prefer not to censor what concerns the coronavirus because people\u2019s lives are in danger,\u201d the Ilna editor Fatemeh Madiani told Agence France-Presse. But the country\u2019s deputy health minister rejected the report. In a news conference broadcast live on state television, Iraj Harirchi said 12 people had died from the coronavirus and 66 had been infected. \u201cI categorically deny this information,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis is not the time for political confrontations. The coronavirus is a national problem.\u201d A fifth person infected with the coronavirus has died in Italy, the chief of the civil protection agency has announced, according to Reuters. Italian media reported that the dead patient was 88 and came from the region of Lombardy. The four other people who have died of the illness were also elderly and at least three of them had been suffering serious underlying health problems Germany will not be closing the country\u2019s borders due to the coronavirus outbreak, a spokesman for the interior ministry said on Monday. A spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said Germany was not issuing a travel warning for Italy but said it had updated its advice on travelling there, Reuters reports. A health ministry spokesman said the danger to the German population from coronavirus remained low but warned the assessment could change at short notice. Austria suspended train services over the Alps to Italy for about four hours late on Sunday before restarting them after two travellers tested negative for coronavirus. A train carrying about 300 passengers from Venice, Italy, to Munich in Germany was halted on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass before being allowed to continue its journey after the two tested negative, authorities said. Iraq has detected its first case of coronavirus, the health ministry said on Monday. Local health officials in the Iraqi Shia city of Najaf said an Iranian theology student was the first positive case of the virus, Reuters reports. The patient had entered Iraq before the government shut border crossings and banned the entry of any non-Iraqis coming from Iran, the ministry said in a statement. \u201cIt has become clear to the ministry that the results of lab tests conducted on a theology student, an Iranian citizen, who had entered the country before \u2026 the decision to stop travel have revealed he is ill with the coronavirus,\u201d it said. The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of the coronavirus outbreak after reports suggested the death toll from the disease was more than four times higher than official figures claim. On Monday, a lawmaker from Qom \u2013 a Shia holy city 75 miles (120km) south of the capital, Tehran, which has had a cluster of cases \u2013 accused Iran\u2019s health minister of \u201clying\u201d about the scale of the outbreak. According to the semi-official ILNA news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. \u201cThe rest of the media have not published this figure, but we prefer not to censor what concerns the coronavirus because people\u2019s lives are in danger,\u201d Fatemeh Madiani, the ILNA editor, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). But the country\u2019s deputy health minister rejected the report. In a news conference broadcast live on state television, Iraj Harirchi said that 12 people had died from the coronavirus and 66 had been infected. \u201cI categorically deny this information,\u201d said Iraj Harirchi. \u201cThis is not the time for political confrontations. The coronavirus is a national problem.\u201d Iran\u2019s government pledged to be transparent about the outbreak. In the Middle East, concerns are mounting that Iran is now a major hub of the coronavirus, and that the virus may have taken hold on pilgrimage routes before its existence was known. Authorities said 50 people have died in the Shia shrine city of Qom this month alone, up sharply from the 12 deaths reported among 47 cases nationwide. Deaths per reported infections were much higher in Iran compared with other countries, and that data reflected concerns that the extent of the virus had been significantly under-reported. Those fears appear to have been realised, and officials are rushing to contain a cluster \u2013 the spread of which would have serious implications for regional health. A Shia seminary in Qom containing 250 people was quarantined on Monday, and the director of one of the city\u2019s main hospitals was reported to have contracted the virus. Schools were closed across the country for a second day. While Qom appears to be the focal point of the cluster, there are also fears that nationwide polling for parliamentary elections over the weekend could have been another conduit to spread the virus. WHO said on Monday it had serious concerns about the situation in Iran. One Lebanese pilgrim who tested positive for coronavirus after returning from Iran is in hospital in Beirut. Turkey has closed its borders to Iranian travellers. Overriding these concerns though is the fate of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and refugees in Iraq and Syria, many of whom have already impaired immunities, less access to state healthcare and live in highly concentrated population groups. Small rooms containing infected people are thought to sharply increase mortality. Tents would likely have the same effect Mongolia has halted all flights from South Korea and will block entry through its borders until 2 March as it steps up its efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s national emergency commission announced the efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on Monday. It has also already closed its schools until the end of March. Mongolia had previously suspended all entries through its borders from China. A suspension of coal deliveries into China is scheduled to come to an end on 2 March. Mongolia has not yet reported any confirmed cases of infection. In aan attempt to slow the worst flare-up of the disease outside of Asia, Italian authorities across the north have shut schools, universities, museums and cinemas for at least a week, and banned public gatherings including the famed Venice carnival, Reuters reports. \u201cTo be honest, nobody thought the spread (of coronavirus) would be so aggressive. The illness is not serious, but it must not be underestimated,\u201d Attilio Fontana, the regional governor of Lombardy, told 102.5 RTL radio. Almost a dozen towns in Lombardy, with a combined population of nearly 50,000, have been placed under effective quarantine, with similar measures in place for a small town in neighbouring Veneto. Fontana added that emergency measures imposed at the weekend would be effective and that \u201cin a matter of days, the spread of the virus will regress\u201d. We\u2019d like to hear from people in northern Italy who are affected by the quarantine restrictions in the area. What has your experience been like and how concerned are you about the outbreak?

At least 50 people have died in the Iranian city of Qom from the new coronavirus this month, Iran\u2019s semiofficial ILNA news agency reported on Monday. The Associated Press reported that the new death toll was significantly higher than the latest number of confirmed cases of infections that Iranian officials had reported just a few hours earlier and which stood at just 12 deaths out of 47 cases, according to state TV. An official from Qom, Ahmad Amiriabadi Farahani, was quoted in ILNA saying more than 250 people are quarantined in the city. He said the 50 deaths date as far back as 13 February. Iran, however, first officially reported cases of the virus and its first deaths on 19 February. Renewed fears over the coronavirus outbreak have prompted steep falls on European stock markets \u2013 most notably in Italy, which has suffered the most serious outbreak outside Asia. The FTSE MIB stock market index in Italy has dropped by 4%. Shares on London\u2019s FTSE 100 have fallen by 2.8%, more than 200 points. In Germany, the Dax index is down by 3.4%. France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 3.5%. Budget airline easyJet and holiday provider Tui are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, both down by 9%, and British Airways owner IAG has lost 7%. Carnival, the cruise ship operator, has lost another 5%. The company has fallen steeply during 2020 after an outbreak of the virus on its Diamond Princess cruise ship. The flight to safety for investors fearful of the economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak has pushed gold prices to their highest since February 2013. Spot gold prices rose by 2.1% on Monday to hit highs above $1,679 per troy ounce. Investors traditionally buy gold as a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty. Chinese political leaders including President Xi Jinping are normally expected to attend the annual parliament session in March, but it has been postponed as a result of the virus outbreak. It is the first time the meeting has been postponed since the Cultural Revolution. Kuwait, Bahrain, and Afghanistan recorded their first new coronavirus cases on Monday. The cases in Kuwait and Bahrain involve people who had visited Iran, which has reported 43 cases of the disease, Reuters reports. Kuwait detected the virus in three people among 700 who had been evacuated on Saturday from the north-eastern Iranian city of Mashhad, the state news agency KUNA said. The health ministry identified them as a 53-year-old Kuwaiti man, a 61-year-old Saudi man and a 21-year-old whose nationality was unclear. It said the Kuwaiti and Saudi had been asymptomatic while the third person showed initial symptoms. In Bahrain, the health ministry said a Bahraini national who arrived from Iran had been diagnosed with the disease and that \u201call necessary measures have been taken with individuals in contact with the patient\u201d. Afghanistan\u2019s minister of public health said on Monday the country had identified its first case of coronavirus, following dozens of cases of the disease and eight deaths in neighbouring Iran. Reuters reports that Ferozuddin Feroz, the minister of public health, told a press conference in Kabul one of three suspected cases had been confirmed in the western province of Herat. He announced a state of emergency in the province, which borders Iran, where dozens of cases of the disease have been confirmed and eight people have died. Qatar Airways announced it will quarantine passengers arriving from Iran and South Korea who show symptoms for the virus. Passengers who show symptoms will be transferred to the communicable disease centre at the Hamad Medical Corporation. All incoming passengers from Iran and South Korea whose final destination is Doha and are showing no symptoms will be asked to stay in home isolation or a quarantine facility for 14 days. China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday Beijing was not considering issuing travel advisories for countries such as South Korea and Japan that are reporting an increase in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. But the Vietnamese carrier Bamboo Airways announced it would be suspending all flights to and from South Korea over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Authorities have so far confirmed 763 cases of novel coronavirus in South Korea. South Korea\u2019s K-league on Monday postponed the start of the new football season, which had been due to kick off this weekend. \u201cThe K-league has decided to temporarily postpone the start of the 2020 K-league season until the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak eases,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis is a measure to protect the health and safety of the citizens and our players with the highest priority against the outbreak of the Covid-19 which has entered a serious phase.\u201d Matches featuring Daegu FC, based in the city that is the epicentre of the South Korean outbreak, and nearby Pohang Steelers, had already been delayed. Italy is rushing to contain Europe\u2019s first major coronavirus outbreak after a fourth person in the country died, Reuters reports. The Italian government introduced draconian measures such as imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas as the number of cases and deaths spiked over the weekend. The number of cases of the virus in the country rose to 152 on Saturday, prompting the government to close off the worst-hit areas in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Police are patrolling 11 towns that have been in lockdown since Friday night. The latest victim died in the Lombardy city of Cremona. French junior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said on Monday morning that there was no need to close down transport borders between France and Italy, despite the spread of coronavirus. \u201cClosing down the borders would make no sense, as the circulation of the virus is not just limited to administrative borders,\u201d Djebbari told BFM Business. Austria suspended train services over the Alps to Italy for about four hours late on Sunday before restarting them after two travellers tested negative for coronavirus. A train carrying about 300 passengers from Venice, Italy, to Munich in Germany was halted on the Italian side of the Brenner Pass before being allowed to continue its journey after the two tested negative, authorities said. An announcement that the Chinese city of Wuhan would relax some of its travel restrictions and allow some people to leave was made without authorisation and has been revoked, the local government said on Monday, according to a report by Reuters. The city at the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak that has already killed more than 2,500 people said it would continue to impose strict controls over its borders in order to prevent the virus from spreading further. The people responsible for the earlier announcement, which stated healthy people would be allowed to leave if they had vital business, have been reprimanded. Here\u2019s the latest round up of the number of cases the coronavirus and deaths from AP. Mainland China: 2,592 deaths among 77,150 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei.

Four British nationals rescued from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship are being treated at specialist centres in the north of England after testing positive for the illness, PA Media reports. The four had been on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had been moored off the coast of Japan for more than two weeks amid the outbreak. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital in Merseyside on Saturday, but on Sunday NHS England confirmed the positive diagnoses. Two of the patients are in the Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield, one is in the Royal Liverpool University hospital and a fourth was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. The new confirmed cases brings the total number of people to be diagnosed with the Covid-19 strain in the UK to 13. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know about the coronavirus outbreak so far on Monday: Wuhan \u2013 the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 has eased some lockdown restrictions, including allowing uninfected residents to leave the city for \u201curgent medical operations\u201d. China reported 150 new deaths from the virus, with one outside Hubei province. Infections rose by 409 (398 in Hubei) to 77,150. The Chinese health commission said 24 out of China\u2019s 31 provinces had reported no new cases of the virus. Four Chinese provinces lowered their alert levels on the virus, including Yunnanm Guangdong, Shznxi and Guizhou. South Korean cases spiked to over 760, as several countries imposed travel bans, and some airlines cancelled routes to Seoul. Australia raised its travel advice to South Korea and Japan to \u201creconsider your need to travel\u201d. North Korea is reported to have quarantined 380 foreigners over virus fears. Asian financial markets have fallen amid fears about the global economy. More information is being reported out about Wuhan\u2019s easing of lockdown conditions. Earlier Chinese state media said the changes would allow \u201cstranded personnel\u201d to leave the city if they are not under quarantine or medical observation. The Global Times has just tweeted that the decision would allow residents not infected with Covid-19 to leave for \u201curgent medical operations in other cities\u201d. I\u2019m not clear if that\u2019s in addition to Earlier we reported that 24 out of 31 provincial-level regions across China had no new cases of Covid-19 on Monday. This includes Beijing and Shanghai. We\u2019re getting some more details on the changed conditions in Wuhan \u2013 here\u2019s a report from China Global Television Network: China\u2019s Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), will allow non-residents of the city to leave if they show no symptoms and have never had contact with patients, local authorities said in a statement on Monday. Meanwhile, people who are not quarantined and seeking treatment for special diseases can also leave in batches. Wuhan, home to over 11 million people and capital city of central China\u2019s Hubei Province, suspended buses, subways, ferries, flights and trains for outbound passengers on January 23 to halt the coronavirus spread, which so far has sickened over 77,000 people and killed at least 2,595. We have reported a lot today on the virus crisis facing South Korea, but in North Korea state media says Pyongyang has quarantined about 380 foreigners as part of efforts to prevent the new coronavirus from breaking out in the country. The Korean Central Broadcasting Station said: \u201c(We) have quarantined some 380 foreigners so far across the country, while intensifying isolation, medical monitoring and testing measures on those who have returned from overseas travel, those who have contacted them and those showing abnormal symptoms.\u201d The identity of those quarantined was not clear but South Korean media reports say they appear to be diplomats stationed in Pyongyang and people involved in overseas trading. North Korea has not reported any cases of Covid-19 infection, but has doubling the quarantine period to 30 days against those coming from foreign countries. The vice governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, has said the virus\u2019s impact on the economy \u201cwill be short-lived and will not change the country\u2019s sound economic fundamentals\u201d. Here\u2019s an excerpt of CGTN\u2019s take on it: Liu said in the short term, the novel coronavirus outbreak will rattle certain aspects of the economy such as loan growth, consumer prices and debt ratio. For instance, fewer outdoor activities and work resumption delay would discourage the borrowing demand of consumers and certain industries. But the impact is temporary and will fade with progress being made in epidemic control and factories gradually returning to work, he said. Liu said the central bank would continue to keep liquidity at a reasonable and ample level, push for reform of loan prime rate (LPR), China\u2019s new market-oriented benchmark lending rate, and lower borrowing costs to ease the financing strain for smaller companies. South Korean airlines have suspended or plan to halt flights to South Korea\u2019s southeastern city of Daegu, where hundreds of new coronavirus infections were reported over the weekend. Yonhap news agency says Korean Air Lines Co, the country\u2019s biggest airline, canceled its flights to Daegu from the southern resort island of Jeju and Incheon on Sunday. Meanwhile, 30 South Koreans who recently visited Israel have tested positive for Covid-19, according to Yonhap: Of 39 Catholic pilgrims from North Gyeongsang Province who visited Israel between February 8 and 16, 12 were diagnosed with COVID-19 on Monday, while the other 18 were confirmed positive and quarantined last week, according to municipal health authorities. One Beijing resident has tweeted that things are still quiet in the Chinese capital today, with regards to people going back to work. The scale of the crisis in Wuhan is plain to see with the mass effort in the city to provide hospital beds, as pointed out in the tweet below by CGTN. Chinese state media is reporting that the lockdown in Wuhan is being eased to allow \u201cstranded personnel\u201d to leave the city if they are not under quarantine or medical observation. The Global Times has also reported that six cities in Hubei province, including Huanggang and Jingzhou, reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday. Huanggang has had 2,904 confirmed cases and 103 deaths (the third highest number of deaths in China). Jingzhou has had 1,574 and 42 deaths (fourth highest number of deaths in China). By comparison, Wuhan has had 46,607 cases and 1,987 deaths. The Global Times also says 24 out of 31 provincial-level regions across China report zero new cases of Covid-19 on Monday. Of all the new cases announced today, only 11 were outside Hubei province. South Korea\u2019s National Assembly has cancelled its plenary session scheduled for Monday afternoon after it emerged a coronavirus patient attended a parliamentary forum last week. Australia is sending a flight to Wuhan with donated goods, the first since the travel ban from China was imposed. Let\u2019s put those Chinese figures into context. The figure of 150 deaths is the highest recorded number of deaths in China in 11 days. Monday 24 February: 150 deaths, 409 new cases Sunday 23 February: 97 deaths, 648 new cases Saturday 22 February: 109 deaths, 397 new cases Friday 21 February: 118 deaths, 889 new cases Thursday 20 February: 114 deaths, 394 cases (China stopped counting clinically diagnosed cases this day as confirmed cases and instead counted only cases that had tested positive) Wednesday 19 February: 136 deaths, 1,749 new cases Tuesday 18 February: 98 deaths, 1097 new cases Monday 17 February: 105 deaths, 2,048 new cases Sunday 16 February: 142 deaths, 2,009 new cases Saturday 15 February: 143 deaths, 2,641 new cases Friday 14 February: 121 deaths, 5,090 new cases Thursday 13 February: 254 deaths, 15,152 new cases (On this day China began including cases diagnosed by doctors and scans in addition to patients who had tested positive to virus). China\u2019s, secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Cong Liang, has told a press conference that China is confident in overcoming the coronavirus and maintaining stable economic growth. He said China had launched tax and fee cuts for small businesses and that the impact on China\u2019s economy would be limited and short term. It follows President Xi\u2019s speech on Sunday in which he warned of the economic impact of the virus, while at the same time saying he though it was temporary and containable. We\u2019re now getting today\u2019s figures from China\u2019s National Health Commission. There have been 150 deaths in the past 24 hours, and 409 new cases of infections. Of the deaths, 149 were in Hubei province, as were 398 confirmed new cases, of those (348 were in Wuhan). It brings the total number of confirmed cases in China to 77,150, with 2,592 deaths. As I mentioned earlier in the blog, we are still waiting for Monday\u2019s announcement of cases of the virus from both the Hubei health commission and the National Health Commission. Both have almost always reported by this time (in fact by a few hours ago). There is no explanation for the delay that I can find. South Korea\u2019s stock market has plunged more than 3% as investors take fright at the worsening outbreak in the country. Not only is one of its largest cities, Daegu, in semi-lockdown, and large gatherings of people cancelled around the country, but airlines are beginning to cancel flights into South Korea, threatening its export-oriented economy. In Shanghai the Composite index is off 0.93% and its worth noting that the yuan has weakened again to 7.0246 per US dollar. In Hong Kong, shares were off 1.63%. Brent crude has slumped 3%, or $1.77, to $56.72 a barrel while U.S. crude dropped 2.7%, or $1.48, to $51.9 a barrel. Stocks have also fallen 2.26% in Sydney. The Australian dollar has fallen 0.3% to US66.09 and is now close to its lowest point for 11 years. New Zealand has extended a ban on arrivals from mainland China into a fourth week to contain the risk of exposure to the coronavirus, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday. The ban has been extended by a further eight days and would be reviewed after that, Ardern told a news conference. New Zealand so far has no confirmed cases of the virus in the country. We\u2019re hearing from Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. He confirms that seven passengers from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship have contracted Covid-19 and are being treated (they have been returned to their home states). No Australians who were evacuated from Wuhan earlier this month were diagnosed with the illness. They have returned to their homes. He confirms Australia has lifted its travel advice to Level 2 to Japan and South Korea (as we reported earlier). We\u2019re now hearing from Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, who says the rising cases in South Korea, Japan and Italy are a \u201ccause for concern\u201d. He says he has \u201ccautious optimism\u201d for Chinese provinces outside of Hubei, in terms of the virus spread. There is no community transmission of the virus in Australia at the moment, he says. But Australia is preparing \u201cfor every eventuality\u201d with regards to a potential spread of the virus. The Reuters news agency is reporting that the four Chinese provinces Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanxi and Guizhou on Monday lowered their coronavirus emergency response measures. Yunnan and Guizhou cut their emergency response measures from level I to level III, according to local authorities, while Guangdong and Shanxi lowered their measures to level II. China has a four-tier response system for public health emergencies that determines what measures it will implement, with level I the most serious. Gansu province was the first to lower its measures on Friday, followed by Liaoning on Saturday. Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post, has President Xi\u2019s speech on the front page, with the headline: \u201cVirus the nation\u2019s most serious health crisis, Xi warns\u201d. We are still waiting for the update on today\u2019s virus figures out of China, but the Hubei province\u2019s report on test kits for the virus gives a sense of the scale of what the epicentre of Wuhan is dealing with. The Xinhua news agency says Wuhan has conducted nucleic acid tests for all backlog of patients, including those confirmed or suspected to be infected with the virus, close contacts of confirmed cases, and patients with fever. It says they carry out an average of 14,000 tests per day, taking 10 hours to deliver results, which patients can now check online. New Zealand media is reporting that the country\u2019s national carrier, Air New Zealand, has suspended flights to Seoul until April. No sooner had I typed in those South Korean infection figures, and they are out of date. We have just heard from the health authorities there that infections have jumped to 763, up from 602. Yonhap news agency says there has also been a 7th death. Over 110 people including nine medical staff, at the Daenam Hospital have been confirmed to be infected with Covid-19, with five victims of the potentially fatal illness reported or linked to the hospital, which has been in cohort isolation to stem further spread. With six deaths and 602 infections, Seoul has raised the virus alert to \u201cred\u201d its highest level in the four-tier system. It\u2019s the first time it has been at red in more than a decade, the Yonhap news agency reports. The country\u2019s health minister said the next seven to 10 days would be crucial in fighting the virus. The country\u2019s new school year, set to begin in March, has been postponed by a week (March 9). This applies from kindergartens up to high schools. It\u2019s the first time the school term has been postponed nationally. More than half of the country\u2019s cases are linked to the religious group Shincheonji Church of Jesus, Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. More than 9,000 members of the group are in self-quarantine. Yonhap says 1,248 have shown Covid-19-related symptoms. Still in Australia, and the government has updated its official travel advice for Japan and South Korea due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Travellers are being told to \u201cexercise a high degree of caution due to a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19)\u201d. \u201cMonitor your health closely and follow the advice of local authorities,\u201d the Department of Foreign Affairs said for both countries. In South Korea, it advises Australians to \u201creconsider your need to travel in Daegu and Cheongdo\u201d, the centre of Covid-19 infections. \u201cWe advise you to reconsider your need to travel to Daegu and Cheongdo due to significant outbreaks of Covid-19 in those cities,\u201d the advice said. South Korea has reported 602 infections and six deaths. The Australian stock exchange has plummeted after offshore markets fell on fears the virus is spreading across Asia and may affect global economic stability. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index fell was a 116.7 points in the first half hour of trade, or 1.63%, to 7,022.3. The broader All Ordinaries index was down 117.1 points, or 1.62%, at 7,113.3 as all indices fell. Australian Associated Press reports that after half an hour of trading, the biggest drags were the energy, materials and consumer discretionary indices. Energy was 2.82% lower, industrials were down 2.42% and the consumer discretionary index had tumbled 3.39%. US and European markets fell on Friday on the back of increasing concerns over COVID-19 as more companies face disruptions and issue profit warnings. Oil prices also fell but gold jumped to its highest level in seven years as investors rushed to the save-haven metal. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea\u2019s Kospi index plunged more than 2% on Monday morning (the country has more than 600 coronavirus infections). The Hong Kong and mainland China markets open shortly with the focus on what is expected to be very weak factory output data from China later. You can read our full story on the deepening economic impact of the virus below: In an important speech on the virus on China, President Xi Jinping has warned that \u201cat present, the epidemic situation is still severe and complex, and prevention and control work is in the most difficult and critical stage\u201d. \u201cThe outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,\u201d Xi said, adding that the impact would be short-term and controllable. The outbreak, which has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,400 in China, is one of the most serious public health crises to confront Chinese leaders in decades. \u201cFor us, this is a crisis and is also a big test,\u201d Xi said. Xi said the virus had caused the most extensive infection and is the most difficult to contain in the country since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. We are waiting for the daily update of figures from the Chinese health commission. As of Sunday there were nearly 77,000 infections and more than 2,400 deaths But here are the main points you need to know before we get underway: The world is approaching a tipping point in containing the spread of the coronavirus, experts say, warning that the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it. China\u2019s president Xi has acknowledged the \u201crelatively big\u201d impact the virus will have on the country\u2019s economy and society, but also said the results of prevention and control work have \u201conce again demonstrated the notable advantages of the leadership of the CPC (Chinese communist party) and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d. South Korea\u2019s president has placed the country on red alert, responding to a rapidly growing number of cases (six deaths, 602 infections). Italy has imposed strong measures in a number of towns in the northern Lombardy region to stop the spread of the virus (including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas), after a third person died on Sunday. Iran (eight deaths, 43 infections) has closed schools and in 14 provinces as \u201ca preventative measure\u201d. Japan still has the most cases outside China (838), the vast majority of which were onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. You can get up to date on our latest stories below: World is approaching coronavirus tipping point, experts say Italy imposes draconian rules to stop spread of coronavirus Four more Britons evacuated from cruise ship test positive for coronavirus Economic impact of coronavirus outbreak deepens",

He also spoke about the importance of making sure the tie is still alive before the second leg in Munich on 18 March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/chelsea-bayern-munich-champions-league-final-2012\">'I didn't know where to run': Chelsea's Champions League win over Bayern revisited</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bayern have far more experience at this level than a youthful Chelsea side and they enjoyed their last trip to London, smashing Spurs 7-2. Spurs chased the game after falling behind and Lampard does not want his defence to become exposed against a finisher of Robert Lewandowski\u2019s class.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got players with Champions League experience in this group, as well as younger players in the early stages of their careers, particularly in the Champions League,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThey have to understand why I keep talking about the levels going up, and what the mindset levels are. A big part of my job is to explain to the players that over two legs we need to be at our maximum.</p> <p>\u201cGoing into the game we must make sure every box is ticked in both games. We can\u2019t get caught up in game moments. After the game, we will probably suffer. Bayern Munich are an incredible side with the ball. They\u2019ve got some really talented players who keep the ball and use the ball well. If we have to suffer, we have to suffer. That\u2019s our job over the next two games.\u201d</p> <p>Chelsea had gone four league games without a win before facing Spurs and Lampard, who could bring Willian and Tammy Abraham in for Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud respectively, spoke to his players about developing a more ruthless mindset before they faced their London rivals.</p> <p>\u201cI felt if you look at our recent form in the league, we were playing well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to keep saying that. A lot of parts of our game are good but the important parts of the game, which is in the final third, scoring goals, finishing off what you\u2019ve created and then making sure we don\u2019t concede with absolute focus, were slightly short. It was clear we were slightly short.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have 20 shots in a game and don\u2019t score, and the other team have two and score, and that\u2019s recurring, then that\u2019s an issue. When I wrote that down, it felt like a mindset thing. If you\u2019re not scoring, it can be a mixture of many things. It can be confidence. It could also maybe be something that\u2019s slack, slightly, or how you prepare through the week.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just about being honest. The beauty of the meeting was everyone felt the same. I\u2019ve been in meetings where people can\u2019t find the reason \u2013 even if the managers says what it is and players disagree. But I\u2019ve got a really good group. The reaction to the meeting, and the reaction against Tottenham, was spot on. What we can\u2019t do now is forget what made us beat Spurs. That was a start for us on Saturday. We need to keep going.\u201d</p> <p>Lampard captained the side when Chelsea upset the odds by beating Bayern on penalties in the 2012 Champions League final. He is not concerned if they are the underdogs again. \u201cMy job is just to prepare for the game and look at the opponent, see their strengths, see our strengths and ask can we find weaknesses there?\u201d he said. \u201cI understand if people do call us the underdogs because Bayern Munich are so strong. Maybe we don\u2019t have that experience but these things are there to change. It\u2019s there to turn to turn it around, to overcome being the underdog. Those are the best stories in sport.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Chelsea_FL/status/1231968764150845440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lampard definitely did not see this Azpilicueta slide tackle coming \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude02 <a href=\"https://t.co/t743fD8ZFh\">pic.twitter.com/t743fD8ZFh</a></p>&mdash; Chelsea FC News (@Chelsea_FL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chelsea_FL/status/1231968764150845440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Lampard is expected to play three at the back again and he said his team were up in front when C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Chelsea\u2019s captain, caught him with a heavy challenge during a keep-ball session in training. \u201cThank God it was Azpi, because he\u2019s in the team regularly,\u201d the manager joked. \u201cI\u2019d be worried if it was someone who wasn\u2019t playing a lot, going in with two feet.\u201d</p> <p>Bayern top the Bundesliga by a point and have improved since replacing Niko Kovac with Hans-Dieter Flick in November. Flick noted that Chelsea make mistakes at the back and said Lewandowski, who has scored 40 goals in all competitions this season, is in the form of his life.</p> <p>Joshua Kimmich explained how Bayern have become more dangerous in attack since Flick was placed in caretaker charge. \u201cThe way we play football has changed a bit,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cWe try to attack higher up the pitch and try to force mistakes and take more risks when we attack.

      "bodyText": "Frank Lampard has warned that Chelsea have to be prepared to suffer when they play Bayern Munich on Tuesday and urged his players not to let their standards drop after halting a worrying run by beating Tottenham. While Chelsea\u2019s manager said greater focus was key to his inconsistent side\u2019s 2-1 home win over Spurs on Saturday, he knows they are likely to come under severe pressure in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie against Bayern. Lampard believes it will take a performance of immense tactical discipline to progress against the German champions, who reached the knockout stages by winning all six of their group games. He also spoke about the importance of making sure the tie is still alive before the second leg in Munich on 18 March. Bayern have far more experience at this level than a youthful Chelsea side and they enjoyed their last trip to London, smashing Spurs 7-2. Spurs chased the game after falling behind and Lampard does not want his defence to become exposed against a finisher of Robert Lewandowski\u2019s class. \u201cWe\u2019ve got players with Champions League experience in this group, as well as younger players in the early stages of their careers, particularly in the Champions League,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThey have to understand why I keep talking about the levels going up, and what the mindset levels are. A big part of my job is to explain to the players that over two legs we need to be at our maximum. \u201cGoing into the game we must make sure every box is ticked in both games. We can\u2019t get caught up in game moments. After the game, we will probably suffer. Bayern Munich are an incredible side with the ball. They\u2019ve got some really talented players who keep the ball and use the ball well. If we have to suffer, we have to suffer. That\u2019s our job over the next two games.\u201d Chelsea had gone four league games without a win before facing Spurs and Lampard, who could bring Willian and Tammy Abraham in for Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud respectively, spoke to his players about developing a more ruthless mindset before they faced their London rivals. \u201cI felt if you look at our recent form in the league, we were playing well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to keep saying that. A lot of parts of our game are good but the important parts of the game, which is in the final third, scoring goals, finishing off what you\u2019ve created and then making sure we don\u2019t concede with absolute focus, were slightly short. It was clear we were slightly short. \u201cIf you have 20 shots in a game and don\u2019t score, and the other team have two and score, and that\u2019s recurring, then that\u2019s an issue. When I wrote that down, it felt like a mindset thing. If you\u2019re not scoring, it can be a mixture of many things. It can be confidence. It could also maybe be something that\u2019s slack, slightly, or how you prepare through the week. \u201cIt was just about being honest. The beauty of the meeting was everyone felt the same. I\u2019ve been in meetings where people can\u2019t find the reason \u2013 even if the managers says what it is and players disagree. But I\u2019ve got a really good group. The reaction to the meeting, and the reaction against Tottenham, was spot on. What we can\u2019t do now is forget what made us beat Spurs. That was a start for us on Saturday. We need to keep going.\u201d Lampard captained the side when Chelsea upset the odds by beating Bayern on penalties in the 2012 Champions League final. He is not concerned if they are the underdogs again. \u201cMy job is just to prepare for the game and look at the opponent, see their strengths, see our strengths and ask can we find weaknesses there?\u201d he said. \u201cI understand if people do call us the underdogs because Bayern Munich are so strong. Maybe we don\u2019t have that experience but these things are there to change. It\u2019s there to turn to turn it around, to overcome being the underdog. Those are the best stories in sport.\u201d Lampard is expected to play three at the back again and he said his team were up in front when C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Chelsea\u2019s captain, caught him with a heavy challenge during a keep-ball session in training. \u201cThank God it was Azpi, because he\u2019s in the team regularly,\u201d the manager joked. \u201cI\u2019d be worried if it was someone who wasn\u2019t playing a lot, going in with two feet.\u201d Bayern top the Bundesliga by a point and have improved since replacing Niko Kovac with Hans-Dieter Flick in November. Flick noted that Chelsea make mistakes at the back and said Lewandowski, who has scored 40 goals in all competitions this season, is in the form of his life. Joshua Kimmich explained how Bayern have become more dangerous in attack since Flick was placed in caretaker charge. \u201cThe way we play football has changed a bit,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cWe try to attack higher up the pitch and try to force mistakes and take more risks when we attack. I\u2019d be very happy with the result we got against Tottenham.\u201d",

I normally am here to cover something rather more fun. Typically, a sporting event featuring athletic feats, dramatic scoring, officiating miscues and all that. Wins, losses and the occasional tie. Fun, mostly trivial stuff. This is a rather different sort of set of circumstances today.</p> \n  <p>Instead, we\u2019re here covering the live memorial for Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California on January 26. This memorial service is being held at Staples Center, the Lakers\u2019 home arena. Bryant brought five championship banners to Staples Center during his NBA career which lasted from 1996 to 2016. The ceremony is set to start at 1pm EST and will be airing live on ESPN. It\u2019s certain to be an emotional affair, a celebration of both Bryant\u2019s basketball achievements and his life off the court.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19fc5e224fd38249c17bd7cdb9355b6ff52e6219\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19fc5e224fd38249c17bd7cdb9355b6ff52e6219/0_0_3000_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans carry posters of Kobe Bryant near the Staples Center before a public memorial for the NBA star and his daughter Gianna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans carry posters of Kobe Bryant near the Staples Center before a public memorial for the NBA star and his daughter Gianna.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T19:07:51.689Z\">at 7.07pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e53fba38f08e133247493e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T16:44:26.047Z\">4.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s a tribute to Kobe Bryant, the player:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s impossible to sum up Kobe Bryant\u2019s dedication to basketball in just one anecdote, but there\u2019s one small incident that comes close to doing it justice . No, it wasn\u2019t one of the countless famous achievements from his 20-season long NBA career. Instead, it was within a picture he posted on his Instagram just a few months before his untimely death in a helicopter accident on Sunday.</p> \n   <p>Bryant posted a picture of himself standing aside his Mamba Sports Academy youth basketball team. The girls, all roughly middle school age, look uniformly glum while holding trophies that marked what was, for them, a disappointing fourth-place finish. When Bryant first posted the image, which dated back from two years prior, his caption included the following statement: \u201cThe 7th player (not in pic) missed this game for a dance recital so that should tell you where her focus was at this time.\u201d As Deadspin\u2019s <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/kobe-bryant-finds-outlet-for-passive-aggression-in-yout-1838048960\">Giri Nathan noted</a>, Bryant felt the need to edit his comments to explain himself slightly better and added the following: \u201cmeaning she enjoyed dance more than ball which is fine. Now? She eat sleeps and breaths the game.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Knowing what we know now, that both Bryant and his daughter would lose their lives en route to the Mamba Sports Academy, there\u2019s a sad postscript to the image. At the time Bryant posted it, however, it made the social media rounds as a humorous reminder of his single-minded passion for the sport. With any other famous athlete, this would have been an opportunity to earn some easy goodwill: here was this living legend, who had won five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals and was the all-time scorer for the Los Angeles Lakers, in his new rule as a youth coach. Instead, it was a sign that he was bringing the exact same mentality he had winning titles with the Lakers to his new position. it didn\u2019t matter if you were a Hall of Fame teammate or a young dance enthusiast, Bryant was going to demand the most from you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You can read the full article below:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/29/kobe-bryant-mamba-mentality\">Say hello to the bad guy: How Kobe Bryant crafted the Mamba mentality</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div>",

We\u2019re back up. \u201cI promise I will not teach them my free throw techniques\u201d \u2013 Shaq gets a big laugh here, when describing how he\u2019ll help share his basketball knowledge. And Kobe\u2019s long-time basketball partner, and one time nemesis, Shaquille O\u2019Neal comes to the stage. And there\u2019s some technical difficulties at ESPN. \u201cWhen Kobe Bryant died, a piece of me died.\u201d \u2013 Michael Jordan. \u201cI\u2019ll have to look at another Crying Meme now \u2026\u201d a tearful Michael Jordan says to a huge laugh. I am relieved because I was trying very, very, very, very hard not to make a reference to it and it was pretty much impossible. It\u2019s hard to exaggerate what Jordan meant to Bryant. Bryant modeled everything about his game on Jordan\u2019s. \u201cWe were very close friends,\u201d Jordan insists. He describes Kobe as an initial \u201cnuisance,\u201d and describes their relationship as being one between brothers. And here we have Michael Jordan to speak about Kobe. And we\u2019re leaning back towards Kobe\u2019s feats with the Lakers with an audio montage of some of his iconic basketball moments (plus his Oscar win for \u201cDear Basketball\u201d). After Pelinka tells an anecodte about Kobe learning to play Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata, he introduces Alicia Keys to perform a version of it. Pelinka talks about being Gianna\u2019s godfather. \u201cGigi was a combination of dignity and grace with a sense of humor.\u201d Pelinka tells a story of Bryant\u2019s last text messages, which were to help secure an internship for his friend\u2019s daughter. Rob Pelinka, Bryant\u2019s agent and closest friend is up next. Auriemma talks about his conversations with Bryant about coaching his daughter, remarking on the idea of the \u201cuncoachable\u201d Bryant suddenly joining their ranks. He ends with a statement about how Kobe could inspire men to be better fathers while Gianna could inspire girls to become basketball players. University of Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma is up next, continuing with the day\u2019s emphasis on the importance of women\u2019s basketball. Auriemma says he\u2019s not here to talk about basketball however, but about being a father. \u201cHe was giving me the blueprint. He was giving Gigi the same blueprint\u201d \u2013 Sabrina Ionescu on how Kobe Bryant was trying to influence women\u2019s basketball. Ionescu notes that she still texts his number, as if expecting him to reply at some point. Taurasi delivers a powerful eulogy for Gianna Bryant and gets a desperately needed laugh from the crowd with a joke about LeBron James barley having a fadeaway jumper. It\u2019s been a heavy afternoon and the levity is appreciated. Next up is Oregon basketball player Sabrina Ionescu. Breaking news came out during the ceremony, Vanessa Bryant is suing the owner of the helicopter involved in the fatal crash. WNBA legend Diana Taurasi is up next. Kimmel notes that Kobe dubbed her The White Mamba. \u201cGod knew they couldn\u2019t be on this Earth without each other. He had to bring them home to have them together.\u201d \u2013 Vanessa Bryant Vanessa talks about her relationship with Kobe, describing him as the \u201cperfect husband.\u201d She goes on to describe how he loved taking care of their daughters. It gets incredibly heartbreaking when Vanessa goes over the things that Kobe would never get a chance to do with his family. \u201cNow for my soulmate.\u201d Vanessa is moving on towards Kobe. \u201cGigi would have most likely become the best player in the WNBA.\u201d Vanessa moves on to talk about her passion about women\u2019s basketball. That\u2019s a major theme of today\u2019s celebration. \u201cFirst I want to thank everybody for coming,\u201d Vanessa starts. \u201cI want to talk about Kobe and Gigi, but I want to start with my baby girl first\u2026\u201d And she chokes up because, what else can you do at this moment. The crowd wills her to continue as she starts with her memories of Gigi. The camera pans to all the celebrities in the crowd, NBA legends, musicians and Hollywood heavy hitters and everybody is basically just bawling. \u201cGianna never tried to conform. She was always herself.\u201d Kimmel implores the audience to \u201cbe grateful for life and for the fact that we are all here together.\u201d There\u2019s a moment of silence and then there\u2019s an \u201cI Love You Kobe.\u201d Then come a series of \u201cKobe!\u201d chants which feel like they should be breaking the spell, but actually end up being a fitting tribute. Kimmel then introduces Vanessa Bryant who gets a tremendous outpouring of love. Next up is Jimmy Kimmel. \u201cYou picked the wrong person to guide you through,\u201d he says, his voice cracking. There\u2019s no real room for humor here. He reads through the entire list of the victims of the helicopter crash. He announces that all the proceeds from the tickets go to the Bryant\u2019s Mamba &amp; Mambacita Sports Foundation. His voice continues to break\u2026 There\u2019s finally a laugh when Kimmel points out that there were even tributes in Boston. There\u2019s a reference to Boston Celtics great Bill Russell, who wore Lakers gear in memory of Bryant. \u201cYou guys will always be in my heart\u2026\u201d Kobe Bryant\u2019s final statement to his fans. \u201cMamba Out.\u201d And we have a montage of Kobe Bryant\u2019s basketball moments on the Staples Center Jumbotron, there\u2019s something moving about the basketball arena taking place of a church. This is a place of worship, too, after all. I am not going to be able to do this justice. This is just a really profoundly beautiful and she segues right into \u201cHalo\u201d which is essentially reworked into a show-stopping straightforward gospel number. Beyonce kicks off the event. \u201cI\u2019m here because I love Kobe and this is one of his favorite songs.\u201d She goes into \u201cXO.\u201d It appears the actual event is about to start now. ESPN are highlighting all of the celebrities tweeting out 2 / 24. 2 was Gianna\u2019s number. 24 was Kobe\u2019s. And we get the first of what will certainly be a number of montages of basketball players talking about what Kobe meant to them. It leads to Stephen A. Smith trying to breakdown the idea of Mamba Mentality, which is also something we\u2019ll hear more about throughout this Celebration of Life. A disquietingly somber Stephen A. Smith is up now talking about Bryant in the foreground. In the background, fans continue to file into Staples Center for today\u2019s ceremony. Among them, was Guardian contributor David Schilling who talked about his reasons for purchasing a ticket to the event in a very moving piece for NBC News. ESPN starts with a story about the flight where the current Lakers learned about Kobe\u2019s passing. They published an extended story about the details about that flight earlier this morning. SportsCenter ends with highlights from Kobe Bryant\u2019s final game with the Lakers, where he scored 60 points. A look at how Los Angeles reacted to the initial news of Kobe Bryant\u2019s death, by the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin: \u201cHe was like a family member in our household,\u201d said Jerson Castillo, 41, in tears as he talked about the basketball star. \u201cI kept praying it was all fake news. I\u2019m not going to be able to accept this for a long time.\u201d Castillo said he was painting his house when he saw the news, dropping everything and immediately rushing to the arena. He still had white paint on his hands when he spoke to the Guardian: \u201cI needed to be here. This will always be his home.\u201d If you want to contribute your thoughts, memories and stories about Kobe Bryant please feel free to send them here and we will share them as part of this liveblog. You can email them (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweet them (to @HunterFelt). Hello everyone, and welcome to this blog. I normally am here to cover something rather more fun. Typically, a sporting event featuring athletic feats, dramatic scoring, officiating miscues and all that. Wins, losses and the occasional tie. Fun, mostly trivial stuff. This is a rather different sort of set of circumstances today. Instead, we\u2019re here covering the live memorial for Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California on January 26. This memorial service is being held at Staples Center, the Lakers\u2019 home arena. Bryant brought five championship banners to Staples Center during his NBA career which lasted from 1996 to 2016. The ceremony is set to start at 1pm EST and will be airing live on ESPN. It\u2019s certain to be an emotional affair, a celebration of both Bryant\u2019s basketball achievements and his life off the court. Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s a tribute to Kobe Bryant, the player: It\u2019s impossible to sum up Kobe Bryant\u2019s dedication to basketball in just one anecdote, but there\u2019s one small incident that comes close to doing it justice . No, it wasn\u2019t one of the countless famous achievements from his 20-season long NBA career. Instead, it was within a picture he posted on his Instagram just a few months before his untimely death in a helicopter accident on Sunday. Bryant posted a picture of himself standing aside his Mamba Sports Academy youth basketball team. The girls, all roughly middle school age, look uniformly glum while holding trophies that marked what was, for them, a disappointing fourth-place finish. When Bryant first posted the image, which dated back from two years prior, his caption included the following statement: \u201cThe 7th player (not in pic) missed this game for a dance recital so that should tell you where her focus was at this time.\u201d As Deadspin\u2019s Giri Nathan noted, Bryant felt the need to edit his comments to explain himself slightly better and added the following: \u201cmeaning she enjoyed dance more than ball which is fine. Now? She eat sleeps and breaths the game.\u201d Knowing what we know now, that both Bryant and his daughter would lose their lives en route to the Mamba Sports Academy, there\u2019s a sad postscript to the image. At the time Bryant posted it, however, it made the social media rounds as a humorous reminder of his single-minded passion for the sport. With any other famous athlete, this would have been an opportunity to earn some easy goodwill: here was this living legend, who had won five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals and was the all-time scorer for the Los Angeles Lakers, in his new rule as a youth coach. Instead, it was a sign that he was bringing the exact same mentality he had winning titles with the Lakers to his new position. it didn\u2019t matter if you were a Hall of Fame teammate or a young dance enthusiast, Bryant was going to demand the most from you.

      "bodyText": "The billionaire Sir Frederick Barclay, whose businesses include the Daily Telegraph and the Ritz hotel, was secretly recorded for several months after his nephew bugged the hotel\u2019s conservatory, the high court has heard. The 85-year-old businessman and his daughter Amanda claim that his twin brother Sir David\u2019s three sons \u2013 Alistair, Aidan and Howard \u2013 as well as Aidan\u2019s son Andrew were parties to the recording of their private conversations over several months. Barclay and his daughter are bringing a legal action alleging misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breach of data protection laws against their four relatives, and Philip Peters, who \u201cholds a board position\u201d in the Barclay group of businesses. According to PA Media a high court judge sitting in London was told on Monday that the \u201celaborate system of covert recording\u201d only came to light last month when Alistair was filmed \u201chandling the bug placed in the conservatory at the Ritz\u201d. Desmond Browne QC, representing Frederick and Amanda Barclay, said: \u201cWe all remember Tolstoy saying \u2018each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\u2019. \u201cHere, the children of Sir Frederick and Sir David have been at odds ... concerning the family trusts, and cousin, sadly, has been pitched against cousin.\u201d He told Mr Justice Warby: \u201cIt is alleged that the defendants have surreptitiously recorded the conversations of Sir Frederick and his daughter Amanda, both between themselves and with others, over a period of months.\u201d Browne said it was not clear how long the recordings were made for, but they \u201ccould go back as far as September last year\u201d. He continued: \u201cThe defendants knew the conversations were private and confidential, but they nevertheless recorded them, commissioned transcripts and then conducted discussions about them.\u201d He argued there was a strong case that there had been \u201cillegal activity over a long period of time\u201d, which he said had produced recordings of \u201ctremendous value\u201d to the defendants. Browne added: \u201cThe matter came to light when the first defendant, initially the only defendant, Alistair Barclay, was filmed late on the night of 13 January handling the bug placed in the conservatory at the Ritz, which was known to be often used by Sir Frederick. I gather it was somewhere he could go to smoke a cigar.\u201d Browne asked the court to make an interim non-disclosure order, preventing the defendants from disclosing the recordings. Heather Rogers QC, representing all five defendants, submitted that there was \u201ca lot of information that would have been in the possession of my clients ... which they have got completely free of the recordings\u201d. She added that her clients had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to \u201cspread it about before an injunction\u201d was granted, but there was \u201cno evidence of dissemination\u201d. Rogers argued that there was therefore no need to make an interim non-disclosure order. Giving a short ruling dismissing the application for a non-disclosure order, Warby said the claim \u201cstems from the falling-out between elements of the families of Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay\u201d. He said that \u201csubstantial parts of the business enterprises\u201d the twins had built up \u201care now owned by trusts, beneficiaries of which include\u201d Amanda, Alistair, Aidan and Howard Barclay. The judge added that the \u201cvexed litigation\u201d arose \u201cover the governance and direction of the group businesses\u201d. He said the information Frederick and Amanda Barclay were seeking to protect included \u201cdiscussions about potential acquisitions and disposals of business assets\u201d, and \u201cpersonal financial matters including matters relating to the family trusts\u201d. Warby declined to make the order sought, ruling that \u201cthere was no intention and no evidence of any intention\u201d to disclose the recordings. The Barclay Brothers who, have owned the Telegraph newspaper group since 2004, are reportedly conducting a review of their many businesses, which also include the Ritz in London. Profits at Telegraph Media Group slumped to \u00a3900,000 last year, in the middle of a turnaround plan led by the chief executive Nick Hugh.",

      "body": "<p>There goes \u00a31bn from easyJet\u2019s stock market value. At the close of trading last Friday, the airline was valued at roughly \u00a36bn. After Monday\u2019s 16.7% fall amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/24/stock-markets-coronavirus-italy-airlines\">investors\u2019 alarm about coronavirus</a> \u2013 and, in particular, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/italy-draconian-measures-effort-halt-coronavirus-outbreak-spread\">Italy\u2019s extreme measures</a> to contain the spread \u2013 easyJet is now worth \u00a35bn.</p> <p>EasyJet\u2019s tumble is just an illustration of how, until Monday, investors had been extraordinarily unconcerned about the potential economic impact of coronavirus. At the start of this month, City analysts were proclaiming confidently that, since world stock markets recovered quickly from the Sars crisis of 2002-03, there was little need to adjust portfolios. The disruption, the theory ran, would be temporary and economic activity would merely be deferred.</p> <p>That thesis felt woefully superficial for several reasons. First, stock market pundits tend to have no expertise in epidemiology. Second, unlike in 2003, stock market valuations are already high by traditional yardsticks. Third, China, where the effect on economic activity will clearly be severe in the first quarter of this year, now accounts for almost a fifth of global GDP, versus about 6% at the time of Sars.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s market wobble, then, marks the moment when investors collided with reality and had to start to price specific risks. While it is possible to believe that Apple, for example, will recover from the \u201ciPhone supply shortages\u201d in its Chinese factories that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/17/apple-warns-of-coronavirus-causing-iphone-shortages\">warned about last week</a>, a drop-off in travel within Europe would clearly hurt almost every tourism-related venture. Journeys wouldn\u2019t be deferred; some just wouldn\u2019t happen. And the effect on profits could be exaggerated since ticket prices tend to be set by the level of marginal demand.</p> <p>We have yet to see hard evidence of that impact, but the City is now braced for profit warnings from European travel firms unless the news on containment improves rapidly. The unknowns are piling up; what matters is not simply the rate of infection, it\u2019s also the behaviour of fearful consumers, which is even harder to predict.

      "bodyText": "There goes \u00a31bn from easyJet\u2019s stock market value. At the close of trading last Friday, the airline was valued at roughly \u00a36bn. After Monday\u2019s 16.7% fall amid investors\u2019 alarm about coronavirus \u2013 and, in particular, Italy\u2019s extreme measures to contain the spread \u2013 easyJet is now worth \u00a35bn. EasyJet\u2019s tumble is just an illustration of how, until Monday, investors had been extraordinarily unconcerned about the potential economic impact of coronavirus. At the start of this month, City analysts were proclaiming confidently that, since world stock markets recovered quickly from the Sars crisis of 2002-03, there was little need to adjust portfolios. The disruption, the theory ran, would be temporary and economic activity would merely be deferred. That thesis felt woefully superficial for several reasons. First, stock market pundits tend to have no expertise in epidemiology. Second, unlike in 2003, stock market valuations are already high by traditional yardsticks. Third, China, where the effect on economic activity will clearly be severe in the first quarter of this year, now accounts for almost a fifth of global GDP, versus about 6% at the time of Sars. Monday\u2019s market wobble, then, marks the moment when investors collided with reality and had to start to price specific risks. While it is possible to believe that Apple, for example, will recover from the \u201ciPhone supply shortages\u201d in its Chinese factories that it warned about last week, a drop-off in travel within Europe would clearly hurt almost every tourism-related venture. Journeys wouldn\u2019t be deferred; some just wouldn\u2019t happen. And the effect on profits could be exaggerated since ticket prices tend to be set by the level of marginal demand. We have yet to see hard evidence of that impact, but the City is now braced for profit warnings from European travel firms unless the news on containment improves rapidly. The unknowns are piling up; what matters is not simply the rate of infection, it\u2019s also the behaviour of fearful consumers, which is even harder to predict. Stock markets were too complacent. Countrywide fightback comes a decade too late Reinvigorating Countrywide, the debt-laden estate agency group that owns Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves, would take three years, declared executive chairman Peter Long in 2018. After completing half the allotted span, Long seems to have decided the task is near impossible, at least in standalone form. That\u2019s the message implied by the decision to enter merger talks with LSL Property Services. Countrywide, which in its heyday used to be described as the UK\u2019s biggest estate agent, will be the junior partner if the \u00a3460m-ish tie-up proceeds. The move will feel desperate to those investors who backed a \u00a3140m rescue refinancing in August 2018. They paid the equivalent (after a share consolidation) of 500p a pop, but the share price is still a miserable 340p. Maybe Long can discover some deal-making magic during the talks, but his negotiating hand looks weak. Countrywide was carrying \u00a390m of debt at last count, or more than three times top-line earnings \u2013 too much for an estate agency. One can blame a sluggish property market or the rise of online-only rivals, but the basic problem is simple: there are too many estate agents in the UK and most are obliged to pass vast chunks of their marketing budgets to Rightmove and its imitators. A Countrywide/LSL merger would allow hefty cost-cutting within a combined entity with 14,000 employees and 1,000 branches, but the Rightmove obstacle looks large and immovable. The FTSE 100 website is worth \u00a36bn these days and has transformed the house-hunting game. If Countrywide et al wanted to mount a serious fightback, their best opportunity was a decade ago. That\u2019s the problem with demergers: once you\u2019ve done one, the activist brigade will want another Prudential, having spun off UK-based fund manager M&amp;G last year, probably suspected this moment would arrive, and now it has: Third Point, an aggressive US hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb, wants a full break-up, meaning a split between the fast-growing PruAsia business and the plodding Jackson National Life operation in the US. Loeb\u2019s crew has bought a 5%, or $2bn stake, to lobby its case. Pru will need to provide a full answer, but one defence of the current set-up is obvious: if nobody wants to buy Jackson for a fat price, which is probably the case, there isn\u2019t much hidden value to be released. Still, it will be fun to hear Pru\u2019s top brass explain why they still deserve to earn their big bucks in pleasant surroundings in London to run operations on two different continents.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 25 February.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>A New York jury has found Harvey Weinstein guilty. </strong>The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court found Weinstein guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The count <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-guilty-trial-charges-verdict\">carries a minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum of up to 25 years</a>. The jury also convicted Weinstein of rape in the third degree. This relates to him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/weinstein-accusers-what-they-said-accusations\">raping a woman in a New York hotel in 2013</a>. Weinstein was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-charges-what-were-they-criminal-trial\">acquitted of three further charges</a>, including the count of predatory sexual assault, which carried a possible life sentence. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-rape-trial-brought-down\">guilty verdict</a> could have a profound impact on the way sex crimes are prosecuted. The New York district attorney\u2019s office took an enormous gamble in how they set up the trial. Prosecutors chose as main accusers two women, both of whom continued to have close \u2013 and at times sexual \u2013 contact with Weinstein after they were attacked. \u2019</p> \n<p><strong>Evangelical churches with strong links to Western Australian Liberals have won almost $40,000 in grants</strong> in the past four months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/wa-churches-with-liberal-links-win-grants-of-almost-40000-in-four-months\">through a federal scheme</a>. The churches won funding through the Stronger Communities program, which allocates grants only to organisations that have been formally invited by the local federal MP. The True North church in Perth\u2019s northern suburbs was awarded $11,000 in November to upgrade its kitchen. The church sits in the federal division of Moore, held for the Liberals by Ian Goodenough. A grant for $5,500 went to the evangelical One church, also in Perth\u2019s outer northern suburbs, for new carpets. One of the church\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.perthnow.com.au/opinion/gareth-parker/gareth-parker-fragility-of-wa-liberal-party-exposed-ng-b88861117z\">founding pastors</a> is Trish Botha, who worked in Goodenough\u2019s office until she left to run as a Senate candidate for the Liberals at last year\u2019s federal election.</p> \n<p><strong>The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of an outbreak of the coronavirus,</strong> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/italians-struggle-with-surreal-lockdown-as-coronavirus-cases-rise\">Italy reported six deaths</a> and officials across the Middle East and Europe scrambled to limit its spread. On Monday, an Iranian lawmaker from Qom \u2013 a Shia holy city 120km south of the capital, Tehran \u2013 accused the health minister of lying about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/world-is-approaching-coronavirus-tipping-point-experts-say\">the scale of the outbreak</a>. According to the semi-official Ilna news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. The country\u2019s deputy health minister rejected the report.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d71da8d6e0f6ff0165282af214a1a28c502f17b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d71da8d6e0f6ff0165282af214a1a28c502f17b/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charred trees in a patch of forest burnt during the recent bushfires near Batemans Bay, New South Wales, Australia, January 22, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charred trees in a patch of forest burnt during the recent bushfires near Batemans Bay, NSW.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loren Elliott/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>More than 20% of Australia\u2019s forests burned during the summer\u2019s bushfire catastrophe,</strong> a proportion scientists believe is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/unprecedented-globally-more-than-20-of-australias-forests-burnt-in-bushfires\">unprecedented globally</a>, according to new research.</p> \n<p><strong>China\u2019s number two diplomat in Australia made an appearance on last night\u2019s Q&amp;A program on the ABC,</strong> where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/qa-chinese-diplomat-grilled-over-uighurs-and-coronavirus-response\">he described China\u2019s Uighur detention camps as \u201ctraining centres\u201d whose residents are \u201cmostly\u201d there voluntarily</a>, and defended footage showing people suspected of having coronavirus being forcibly pushed into vans as justified.</p> \n<p><strong>A growing majority of Coalition voters support the Morrison government adopting a net zero target for 2050,</strong> with support for that proposition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/essential-poll-a-majority-of-coalition-voters-support-a-net-zero-emissions-target-for-2050\">climbing 12 points in a month</a>, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll.</p> \n<p><strong>Being Aboriginal with a disability is a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/24/being-aboriginal-with-a-disability-a-double-whammy-royal-commission-told\">the royal disability commission has heard</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 25 February. Top stories A New York jury has found Harvey Weinstein guilty. The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court found Weinstein guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The count carries a minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum of up to 25 years. The jury also convicted Weinstein of rape in the third degree. This relates to him raping a woman in a New York hotel in 2013. Weinstein was acquitted of three further charges, including the count of predatory sexual assault, which carried a possible life sentence. The guilty verdict could have a profound impact on the way sex crimes are prosecuted. The New York district attorney\u2019s office took an enormous gamble in how they set up the trial. Prosecutors chose as main accusers two women, both of whom continued to have close \u2013 and at times sexual \u2013 contact with Weinstein after they were attacked. \u2019 Evangelical churches with strong links to Western Australian Liberals have won almost $40,000 in grants in the past four months through a federal scheme. The churches won funding through the Stronger Communities program, which allocates grants only to organisations that have been formally invited by the local federal MP. The True North church in Perth\u2019s northern suburbs was awarded $11,000 in November to upgrade its kitchen. The church sits in the federal division of Moore, held for the Liberals by Ian Goodenough. A grant for $5,500 went to the evangelical One church, also in Perth\u2019s outer northern suburbs, for new carpets. One of the church\u2019s founding pastors is Trish Botha, who worked in Goodenough\u2019s office until she left to run as a Senate candidate for the Liberals at last year\u2019s federal election. The Iranian government has denied trying to cover up the full extent of an outbreak of the coronavirus, as Italy reported six deaths and officials across the Middle East and Europe scrambled to limit its spread. On Monday, an Iranian lawmaker from Qom \u2013 a Shia holy city 120km south of the capital, Tehran \u2013 accused the health minister of lying about the scale of the outbreak. According to the semi-official Ilna news agency, which is close to reformists, the lawmaker, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, said there had been 50 deaths from the coronavirus in Qom alone. The country\u2019s deputy health minister rejected the report. Australia More than 20% of Australia\u2019s forests burned during the summer\u2019s bushfire catastrophe, a proportion scientists believe is unprecedented globally, according to new research. China\u2019s number two diplomat in Australia made an appearance on last night\u2019s Q&amp;A program on the ABC, where he described China\u2019s Uighur detention camps as \u201ctraining centres\u201d whose residents are \u201cmostly\u201d there voluntarily, and defended footage showing people suspected of having coronavirus being forcibly pushed into vans as justified. A growing majority of Coalition voters support the Morrison government adopting a net zero target for 2050, with support for that proposition climbing 12 points in a month, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Being Aboriginal with a disability is a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d, the royal disability commission has heard. One witness said the system should be accountable for institutional prejudice \u201cin which highly qualified healthcare practitioners can just pass people off with need as being drunk or faking it\u201d. Online flight booking company Fly365 has left travellers thousands of dollars out of pocket after it entered voluntary administration just days after customers say they handed over money to the firm. Fly365 has links to collapsed budget airfare company Bestjet. The world Dozens of people have been injured in Germany, some of them children, after a local man appeared to deliberately drive a car into a carnival parade procession in the central German town of Volkmarsen, police have said. The driver was arrested but police could not immediately provide details about the man\u2019s motives. The US Democratic party is grappling with Bernie Sanders being its likely nominee for president. In the aftermath of Sanders\u2019 victory in Nevada, and as the South Carolina primary looms, the party establishment continues to contend with the increasing possibility that the Vermont senator, a self-proclaimed socialist, will win the nomination. Informants named in WikiLeaks files disappeared, the Julian Assange hearing has heard. Secret sources who had supplied information to the US government allegedly \u201cdisappeared\u201d after they were put at risk of death or torture by WikiLeaks\u2019s release of classified documents. Lesotho\u2019s prime minister has requested immunity from the charge of murdering his wife. Thomas Thabane made a surprise appearance in court, where his lawyer argued that his office grant him immunity from prosecution for allegedly murdering his estranged wife shortly before he took power. Recommended reads How will Australia respond if the coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic? As cases of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus rise outside of China, health experts in Australia argue a global coronavirus pandemic \u201cis very likely, if not inevitable\u201d. The \u201cinitial action\u201d response, when cases are first identified in Australia, is focused on \u201cminimising transmission\u201d and \u201cmanaging initial cases\u201d. It involves border measures such as health screenings at airports and ports, escalating to travel bans, which are currently in place for travellers from mainland China. If it escalates, next comes surge staffing and \u201cfever clinics\u201d. In the past year underemployment has risen, destroying any hope of improved wages growth, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cBut while the overall rate of underemployment remains a major concern, the experience for older workers highlights how the problem has changed and has gone from one mostly applied to younger workers to one that those nearing retirement are dealing with more than ever before \u2026 Workers entering the final stage of their employment life are not only having to deal with a higher retirement age than they assumed they would have when they began work, they are now much more likely to be struggling to get as much work as they desire.\u201d Listen Manchester City\u2019s fortunes changed dramatically with the takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi.

      "bodyText": "Third Point, the US hedge fund and activist investor, has taken a near-$2bn (\u00a31.5bn) stake in the London-based insurer Prudential and is calling for it to separate into two companies. Led by the US billionaire Daniel Loeb, Third Point has written to Prudential\u2019s board of directors to explain that it has become the insurer\u2019s second biggest shareholder, with a stake of almost 5%. The New York-based asset management firm argues Prudential should split its Asian and US businesses \u2013 only months after the group spun off its fund management and European divisions. Those UK and European operations began trading as M&amp;G on the London Stock Exchange in October. Third Point, which specialises in shareholder activism, praises the 172-year-old insurance group for demerging M&amp;G but calls on it to divide Prudential Corporation Asia and Jackson National Life \u201cto increase investment in both businesses, optimise growth and drive higher valuation\u201d. The separately managed franchises PruAsia and Jackson \u201chave distinct strengths but share no discernable benefit from being operated under the same corporate umbrella\u201d, Loeb said. Third Point, which has $14bn of assets under management, said PruAsia and Jackson could have been spun off at the same time as M&amp;G. The investment firm lists several reasons why it believes Prudential would benefit from separating the businesses, such as eliminating group head-office costs and recruiting local executives, and asserts this would \u201cclose the yawning gap between the current share price and intrinsic value\u201d. Third Point said it hoped to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with Prudential over its proposals and that it was \u201cconfident the majority of Prudential\u2019s shareholders will share our view\u201d. Prudential could not immediately be reached for comment. Third Point is well known for taking stakes in large international companies and publicly calling for strategic changes. In recent years, activist investors have tried to alter direction at a range of companies, notably Barclays. The bank won its battle against US-based Edward Bramson, when its shareholders voted down his proposal at the last AGM to win a seat on the lender\u2019s board.

      "bodyText": "Jos Buttler is determined to repay the faith shown in him as a Test cricketer after admitting he is past the age where he can be picked on potential alone. Aged 30, with 41 caps and having been England\u2019s first-choice wicketkeeper since the end of last summer, Buttler was retained by the selectors for next month\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka during a winter averaging 17 with the bat. Ed Smith, the national selector, and Chris Silverwood, the coach, have hinted Buttler will continue behind the stumps for the two-Test tour despite Ben Foakes \u2013 the man of the series in Sri Lanka just over a year ago and considered the superior wicketkeeper \u2013 getting a squad berth ahead of Jonny Bairstow. Buttler stresses that he still views himself as wicketkeeper first and, speaking at a promotional event for his Indian Premier League team, Rajasthan Royals, restated his desire to crack what he considers the most rewarding format. He said: \u201cI haven\u2019t quite played as well as I would have liked [this winter], but you don\u2019t become a bad player overnight so I\u2019m looking to repay some faith and get back to playing my best cricket. \u201cI\u2019m very committed to Test cricket. It\u2019s the best form of the game; it\u2019s the hardest form of the game. That\u2019s what makes it \u2013 when you have good moments they are the most rewarding. \u201cI\u2019ve got massive self-belief and a lot of it is about fulfilling potential. But I\u2019m too old now to get picked on potential. I feel I have a lot of potential in my game; I haven\u2019t got to the level I know I can get to. That\u2019s a big driver for me.\u201d There have been a couple of theories as to why, bar 117 runs across two innings in the summer\u2019s Ashes finale and a recent T20 half-century in South Africa, Buttler has struggled since his key role in last July\u2019s World Cup final. After all he had averaged 40 from 13 Tests since Smith recalled him from the IPL in 2018. Getting over the emotional stress of that super-over finale at Lord\u2019s is one, while the mentally draining aspect of being an all-format internationalis another. Buttler, perhaps mindful the Sri Lanka tour is followed by seven weeks picking up \u00a3490,000 in the IPL, is keen to downplay these.

Released in October, the book is as much about Farrow and the spy film-esque challenges he faced throughout his investigation, as it is about Weinstein. Late last year, Farrow also launched <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pineapple-street-media/the-catch-and-kill-podcast/e/66056071\">a podcast</a> that expands on Catch and Kill.

Her film, Green says, was an effort to highlight the impacts of a system designed to keep a predator in power and a course-correction from many news reports that tend to focus on the predator, rather than the victims. Green told the Guardian she considers the growing number of #MeToo films as a positive development \u2013 one that forces audiences to interrogate their own behaviors and consider how they can make their workspaces safe and fair.</p> <p>Last year, the Oscar-nominated, star-studded film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/09/bombshell-review-margot-robbie-charlize-theron-nicole-kidman\">Bombshell</a> touched on the #MeToo troubles of Fox News and Roger Ailes. The former chairman and CEO, who died in 2017, was accused by more than 23 women of sexual harassment, including the prominent hosts Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the streaming platform Hulu released the documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/01/untouchable-rise-fall-harvey-weinstein-review-films-like-this-change-the-world\">Untouchable</a>, which weaves together the stories of Weinstein\u2019s survivors and eyewitnesses to provide a compelling, comprehensive look at his crimes.</p> <p>Even when he is not directly mentioned, journalism on Weinstein and his survivors has become the source text from which many other #MeToo narratives spiral out. Weinstein\u2019s presence looms large in #MeToo-themed episodes of shows like Tuca &amp; Bertie, Law and Order: SVU, Murphy Brown, and Grey\u2019s Anatomy.</p> <p>In Tuca &amp; Bertie\u2019s #MeToo narrative, Tuca, a parakeet with baking aspirations, faces harassment and lewd comments from the celebrity head chef she interns for. Tuca\u2019s dilemma is that speaking out against the powerful chef feels like potential career suicide. Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, and many other Weinstein survivors faced the same concern, illuminating why it took so long for the allegations to break.</p> <p>TV also has widened its focus to other prominent, Weinstein-esque men abusing their power.</p> <p>There were the hyped documentary specials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/06/leaving-neverland-review-michael-jackson-documentary\">Leaving Neverland</a>, which focused on allegations of child abuse by Michael Jackson, and the dream hampton-produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/07/surviving-r-kelly-part-ii-the-reckoning\">Surviving R</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/07/surviving-r-kelly-part-ii-the-reckoning\"> Kelly</a>.</p> <p>The Apple TV+ series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/29/the-morning-show-tv-so-excellent-it-will-make-you-totally-resent-friends-jennifer-aniston\">The Morning Show</a>, starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, tackles sexual politics at a TV network with frank dialogue, drawing much of its material from the story of Matt Lauer, the ousted NBC anchor who faced rape and harassment allegations from several women.</p> <p>A host of works have confronted consent and sexual harassment: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/21/what-happens-when-we-dont-believe-women\">Believe Me</a> by Jessica Valenti and Jaclyn Friedman, which includes essays from writers about trusting women who speak out about abuse; Whisper Network, a compelling novel about a group of women banding together to take down a CEO with a history of sexual harassment; #MeToo in the Corporate World, which sees the economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett use datasets to illustrate the effect of the #MeToo movement on corporate America.

      "bodyText": "In the two and a half years since numerous women came forward accusing Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse, the disgraced media mogul has come to represent the ills of gender imbalances in Hollywood, unchecked male ego, cultures of sexism and the silencing of sexual assault survivors. A slew of new films, books and TV projects explores the unfolding of the Weinstein scandal, what it says about the culture of Hollywood and the impact of #MeToo movement that followed. Breaking the Weinstein saga has led to book deals for several high-profile journalists, including the New York Times\u2019 Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, and Ronan Farrow at the New Yorker. Farrow turned his reporting on Weinstein into a bestselling book, Catch and Kill. Released in October, the book is as much about Farrow and the spy film-esque challenges he faced throughout his investigation, as it is about Weinstein. Late last year, Farrow also launched a podcast that expands on Catch and Kill. And in interviews for the book, Farrow teased, like a cliffhanger season finale, that \u201cthere\u2019s absolutely more to be disclosed\u201d, suggesting his contributions to the #MeToo movement are not over. Kantor and Twohey\u2019s book She Said, released last year, re-examined the duo\u2019s investigative reporting on Weinstein, which included interviews with 80 women. It was an instant bestseller and is being turned into a Brad Pitt-backed movie adaptation. The Assistant, a fictional drama released earlier this year, revolves around a junior worker who is confronted with a pattern of sexism and sexual abuse from a celebrated film executive, and explicitly draws on the Weinstein story. Kitty Green, The Assistant\u2019s director and writer, interviewed dozens of women in the film industry following the revelations of Weinstein\u2019s abuses. Her film, Green says, was an effort to highlight the impacts of a system designed to keep a predator in power and a course-correction from many news reports that tend to focus on the predator, rather than the victims. Green told the Guardian she considers the growing number of #MeToo films as a positive development \u2013 one that forces audiences to interrogate their own behaviors and consider how they can make their workspaces safe and fair. Last year, the Oscar-nominated, star-studded film Bombshell touched on the #MeToo troubles of Fox News and Roger Ailes. The former chairman and CEO, who died in 2017, was accused by more than 23 women of sexual harassment, including the prominent hosts Megyn Kelly and Gretchen Carlson. Elsewhere, the streaming platform Hulu released the documentary Untouchable, which weaves together the stories of Weinstein\u2019s survivors and eyewitnesses to provide a compelling, comprehensive look at his crimes. Even when he is not directly mentioned, journalism on Weinstein and his survivors has become the source text from which many other #MeToo narratives spiral out. Weinstein\u2019s presence looms large in #MeToo-themed episodes of shows like Tuca &amp; Bertie, Law and Order: SVU, Murphy Brown, and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. In Tuca &amp; Bertie\u2019s #MeToo narrative, Tuca, a parakeet with baking aspirations, faces harassment and lewd comments from the celebrity head chef she interns for. Tuca\u2019s dilemma is that speaking out against the powerful chef feels like potential career suicide. Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, and many other Weinstein survivors faced the same concern, illuminating why it took so long for the allegations to break. TV also has widened its focus to other prominent, Weinstein-esque men abusing their power. There were the hyped documentary specials Leaving Neverland, which focused on allegations of child abuse by Michael Jackson, and the dream hampton-produced Surviving R Kelly. The Apple TV+ series The Morning Show, starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, tackles sexual politics at a TV network with frank dialogue, drawing much of its material from the story of Matt Lauer, the ousted NBC anchor who faced rape and harassment allegations from several women. A host of works have confronted consent and sexual harassment: Believe Me by Jessica Valenti and Jaclyn Friedman, which includes essays from writers about trusting women who speak out about abuse; Whisper Network, a compelling novel about a group of women banding together to take down a CEO with a history of sexual harassment; #MeToo in the Corporate World, which sees the economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett use datasets to illustrate the effect of the #MeToo movement on corporate America. Moira Donegan, the creator of the Shitty Media Men list and Guardian columnist, announced she would be writing a \u201cprimer on dealing with sexual harassment\u201d. In addition, a crop of works focused on intersectional, underrepresented voices in the #MeToo movement appears to be on the horizon. One of the most anticipated novels of 2020 is the already hotly debated My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell. The Stephen King-approved book has a #MeToo premise: an English teacher discovers a professor she had an affair with as a 15-year-old is now romantically involved with another student. There is the forthcoming HBO documentary On the Record, which focuses on the survivors of color who allege the rap mogul Russell Simmons sexually assaulted them (Oprah Winfrey was previously attached to the project as an executive producer). The producers of Surviving R Kelly returned to television last month, with a follow-up entitled Surviving R Kelly Part II: The Reckoning. The two-night special examined another part of the #MeToo experience: the harassment and attacks survivors face after their stories are told. And the Los Angeles Times is running a podcast about the accusations against Bill Cosby that includes interviews with his survivors, some of whom are women of color.",

      "bodyText": "The EU will demand the right to punish Britain if the government fails to shadow the Brussels rulebook in the future, member states have agreed, as Boris Johnson was warned that the bloc would not be hurried into a deal on the future relationship. A final draft of the EU\u2019s negotiating position agreed by ambassadors on Monday, ready for ministerial sign off on Tuesday, establishes the bloc\u2019s developing environmental, social and workers\u2019 standards as the baseline for a trade deal. EU laws would not need to be adopted line-by-line by Westminster as they develop. But Brussels would retain the right to apply tariffs or other sanctions if any divergence between the two sides over time led to \u201cdisruptions of the equal condition of competition\u201d. \u201cIt is about equality of outcomes,\u201d one senior EU source said. France was alone in holding out for the guarantees that go beyond mere \u201cnon-regression\u201d from the current shared regulations. The bloc will demand that the British government apply EU state aid rules in their entirety as they evolve, in the one instance where Brussels is demanding complete alignment over time. The EU\u2019s state aid regime limits the levels of subsidies that can be given to industry. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has admitted that such a policy is a \u201cred rag\u201d to the UK. The leaked agreement, obtained by the Guardian, states that \u201cthe envisaged agreement should uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with union standards as a reference point\u201d. The EU also wants to establish a \u201cgoverning body\u201d to oversee a deal that \u201cshould be empowered to modify the level playing field commitments in order to include additional areas or to lay down higher standards over time\u201d. The hardening of the EU position came as Johnson was warned that the French government would not be \u201cblackmailed\u201d into a trade deal that risk its long-term economic interests. The prime minister\u2019s decision to rule out an extension of the transition period after 31 December 2020 has put pressure on both parties to work swiftly on a deal or face huge extra costs on trade when the UK leaves the single market and customs union. But speaking before a meeting of EU ministers on Tuesday, France\u2019s EU affairs minister, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, used a TV interview to say her country would not \u201csacrifice\u201d the future of French industry, farming and fisheries to secure a swift deal. \u201cJust because Boris Johnson wants an agreement at all costs on 12/31 does not mean that we will sign a bad agreement for the French under the pressure of blackmail or time pressure,\u201d De Montchalin later tweeted. Johnson has said he will not take up the option of extending the transition period for \u201cup to one or two years\u201d, as envisaged in the withdrawal agreement. He has said he will accept tariffs and quotas on goods if a deal is not agreed in time. The UK is likely to publish its plans on Thursday after the EU\u2019s adoption of its negotiating mandate for the European commission. The talks on the future relationship are expected to start next week. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government has been outspoken in internal EU discussions on the need to keep the UK \u201cdynamically aligned\u201d. \u201cIt is not that they think the British government will lower their standards but that EU policymakers will forever be looking over their shoulder, and we will hold back on the advances we want to make for fear of the competition on our doorstep,\u201d said one diplomatic source. The UK has so far rejected any deal that involves alignment on policy or Britain remaining under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, saying that a Canada-style trade deal, with looser provisions on ensuring a competitive level playing field, is the most appropriate option. EU diplomats were keen to agree Barnier\u2019s mandate by their self-imposed 25 February deadline to avoid potential British accusations of being unprepared or wasting time.",

Grange Park Opera\u2019s founder, Wasfi Kani, suggested she was able to take quicker decisions because of her company\u2019s size. \u201cYou can always think of a reason not to do something,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these larger organisations every decision is made by multiples of people who the state is paying for and one of them will think of a reason not to do things, whereas all I have to do is talk to my trustees.\u201d Litvinenko said she had seen an orchestral run-through of the opera and that she cried at the end. Both she and her son, now 25, think they will get justice one day. \u201cIf I was not optimistic I would not have been able to [do] everything I\u2019ve done in the past 10 years,\u201d she said. \u2022 The Life &amp; Death of Alexander Litvinenko is at Grange Park Opera, Surrey, on 16 and 18 July",

But Shetterly\u2019s book, and the ensuing film, with Taraji P Henson in a starring role as Johnson, helped change that. Johnson was one of a group of remarkable women who fought every obstacle an entrenched deeply racist society could throw at them and, eventually, they won.</p> <p>It was in 1943 that Langley, then part of Nasa\u2019s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), hired its first five black female mathematicians. By 1949 Dorothy Vaughan had become the first African-American section head within the NACA, of the female-only, segregated West Area computing unit at Langley, which Johnson joined as a \u201ccomputer\u201d four years later. The West Area computers were subject to the racist Jim Crow laws, required in theory \u2013 but not always, for Johnson, in practice \u2013 to use separate offices, toilets and cafeterias from their white counterparts, until the birth of Nasa in 1958. </p> <p>The youngest of four children, with an older sister and two older brothers, Katherine was born in White Sulphur Springs, a small town in Greenbrier County, 120 miles south of the West Virginian capital, Charleston. Her father, Joshua Coleman, had farmed and worked as a lumberman, and, in the 1930s, was employed at the local upmarket resort, the Greenbrier. He was also a self-taught mathematician. Her mother, Joylette, was a teacher.</p> <p>Education for African-Americans in Greenbrier County ended at the age of 12. The Colemans\u2019 response was to rent a house near an African-American high school run by the West Virginia State College on the outskirts of Charleston. Katherine entered that school as a 10-year-old. During holidays she worked at the Greenbrier, where she perfected her French, aided by a Parisian chef working at the resort.</p> <p>In 1933, aged 15, she graduated to the West Virginia State College, where her teachers included <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Schieffelin_Claytor\" title=\"\">William Schieffelin Claytor</a>, an outstanding African-American mathematician, who was himself the subject of sustained discrimination during his career.

In 1939 she moved back to West Virginia, to a school in Morgantown, and married James. The following year, partly as a consequence of a plan by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to bring about the desegregation of the hitherto all-white West Virginia University in Morgantown, she was one of three black students, and the first black woman, to enrol on a master\u2019s course there. But then, after a single term, she became pregnant and forsook academia.</p> <p>As her three daughters grew up, she returned to teaching. However, in 1952, the family, encouraged by James\u2019s brother-in-law, moved to the Virginia peninsula.

In the weeks before the end of arguments, many feminists had expected a not guilty verdict. Perhaps the cynicism was warranted: of all sexual violence perpetrators, <a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\">only 0.05% are convicted, and even fewer ever serve time</a>. This is in part because the reporting rates for sexual violence crimes are dramatically lower than for other violent crimes. But it is also because cultural biases that depict women as dishonest and sexual harm as less severe than other kinds of harm. Even when the low reporting rate is taken into account, sexual violence crimes have a lower rate of conviction than other violent crimes, such as <a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\">robberies or assaults</a>.</p> \n<p>The women in question, too, were not perfect victims. Like most victims of sexual violence, they had known their attacker before the assaults, and they maintained a relationship with him after. Their experiences were typical but complicated, flying in the face of popular but false myths about rape that posit that consent was probably present if a victim was on cordial terms with her attacker after the assault. The Weinstein conviction depended on a jury achieving something that many people fail to do in sexual violence cases: hearing women\u2019s complicated stories, and choosing to recognize the harm done to them anyway.</p> \n<p>The sense of certainty that Weinstein would walk was heightened on Friday, when the jury delivered a note to the judge indicating that they could not reach a consensus on all the charges \u2013 a development that many interpreted, in the end correctly, as meaning that Weinstein would be acquitted on the most serious of the charges. For now, the producer has been sent to jail to await the sentencing phase of the trial, which will begin in March.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If it were not for everything that Weinstein had come to symbolize, it is not clear that charges would have been brought against him at all</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>If it were not for everything that Weinstein had come to symbolize, it is not clear that charges would have been brought against him at all. That Weinstein was indicted and ultimately convicted is less a testament to the district attorney\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s safety than it is a signal of the emotional and political power that was brought to bear by the #MeToo movement. Weinstein had been untouchable, but then, because of the power brought to bear by women who refused to tolerate or ignore men\u2019s sexual violence against women, he was finally brought to justice. The conviction is less a signal that the criminal justice system can work for victims than a signal that women\u2019s grassroots organizing can accomplish things that would never have otherwise been possible. The symbolic significance of his conviction can\u2019t be overstated: for women, this is a very good day.</p> \n<p>Still, I wonder what it really means for Weinstein to be convicted, on only two out of five counts, while so many other abusive men go free. For all the controversy it created, the #MeToo movement has claimed relatively few high-profile arrests, even in cases where evidence is abundant and the number of public accusers reaches into the dozens. In cases of sexual abuse, women\u2019s suffering and men\u2019s misdeeds are still rarely given institutional acknowledgment, rarely treated as important enough to warrant institutional intervention.</p> \n<p>You can see his conviction as a victory for these women, a testament to how powerful they can be, taking down an abuser with uncommon influence and wealth. Or you can see his conviction as too small a victory, won after too long and great a fight, a symbol not of how far we have come in taking sexual abuse seriously but of how far we still have to go. After all, more than 100 women accused Weinstein himself, and thousands of others came forward with their stories of sexual abuse by other men in the wake of the revelations against him.

Perhaps the cynicism was warranted: of all sexual violence perpetrators, only 0.05% are convicted, and even fewer ever serve time. This is in part because the reporting rates for sexual violence crimes are dramatically lower than for other violent crimes. But it is also because cultural biases that depict women as dishonest and sexual harm as less severe than other kinds of harm. Even when the low reporting rate is taken into account, sexual violence crimes have a lower rate of conviction than other violent crimes, such as robberies or assaults. The women in question, too, were not perfect victims. Like most victims of sexual violence, they had known their attacker before the assaults, and they maintained a relationship with him after. Their experiences were typical but complicated, flying in the face of popular but false myths about rape that posit that consent was probably present if a victim was on cordial terms with her attacker after the assault. The Weinstein conviction depended on a jury achieving something that many people fail to do in sexual violence cases: hearing women\u2019s complicated stories, and choosing to recognize the harm done to them anyway. The sense of certainty that Weinstein would walk was heightened on Friday, when the jury delivered a note to the judge indicating that they could not reach a consensus on all the charges \u2013 a development that many interpreted, in the end correctly, as meaning that Weinstein would be acquitted on the most serious of the charges. For now, the producer has been sent to jail to await the sentencing phase of the trial, which will begin in March. If it were not for everything that Weinstein had come to symbolize, it is not clear that charges would have been brought against him at all. That Weinstein was indicted and ultimately convicted is less a testament to the district attorney\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s safety than it is a signal of the emotional and political power that was brought to bear by the #MeToo movement. Weinstein had been untouchable, but then, because of the power brought to bear by women who refused to tolerate or ignore men\u2019s sexual violence against women, he was finally brought to justice. The conviction is less a signal that the criminal justice system can work for victims than a signal that women\u2019s grassroots organizing can accomplish things that would never have otherwise been possible. The symbolic significance of his conviction can\u2019t be overstated: for women, this is a very good day. Still, I wonder what it really means for Weinstein to be convicted, on only two out of five counts, while so many other abusive men go free. For all the controversy it created, the #MeToo movement has claimed relatively few high-profile arrests, even in cases where evidence is abundant and the number of public accusers reaches into the dozens. In cases of sexual abuse, women\u2019s suffering and men\u2019s misdeeds are still rarely given institutional acknowledgment, rarely treated as important enough to warrant institutional intervention. You can see his conviction as a victory for these women, a testament to how powerful they can be, taking down an abuser with uncommon influence and wealth. Or you can see his conviction as too small a victory, won after too long and great a fight, a symbol not of how far we have come in taking sexual abuse seriously but of how far we still have to go. After all, more than 100 women accused Weinstein himself, and thousands of others came forward with their stories of sexual abuse by other men in the wake of the revelations against him.

This involved the replacement of a society that operated mainly through a devolved branch structure run by around 25,000 local volunteers with one run by a centralised management-driven system \u2013 regardless of the views of the thousands of volunteers who were devoting their time and energy to the provision of practical care and support in their local communities.</p> <p>More recently, the constitutional role whereby volunteers could become members of the society and have a say in policy and the appointment of trustees has also been abolished. The impression is that any form of threat \u2013 actual or potential \u2013 to the authority of the senior management has been eliminated, and this appears to have included refuting the views of staff.</p> <p>All this has had a major effect on the nature of the society\u2019s activities, which in the branch era were focused on the provision of direct practical support to people with dementia and their hard-pressed carers. The 2019 spend of around \u00a38.6m on direct care \u2013 listed in the society\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/media/23571\" title=\"\">annual accounts</a> as consisting of support groups, day care, befriending and home care \u2013 amounted to only 7.5% of its annual expenditure.</p> <p>Whether many donors realise that such a small proportion of their gifts are going towards these greatly needed services, as distinct from the expenditure (about \u00a34m) on the salaries of the growing number of senior managers and the cost of fundraising (almost \u00a332m) is an open question.</p> <p>It seems probable, too, that the NDAs are related, at least in some cases, to senior managers\u2019 adverse and possibly bullying reaction to frontline staff\u2019s concerns about the direction of the society\u2019s activities.<br><strong>Dr Alan Fowler</strong><br><em>Former chair</em><em> of the </em><em>disbanded </em><em>Winchester branch of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Alzheimer\u2019s Society\u2019s reliance on NDAs is misguided and illustrates how employers should not deal with concerns about alleged wrongdoing. It is misguided because NDAs cannot legally prevent staff disclosing information about breaches of contract that have a public interest, and serious bullying or harassment could constitute such a breach. In relation to the society\u2019s assertion that it has a whistleblowing policy, who would invoke it when there is a culture of fear in the organisation? External reporting seems to be appropriate in these circumstances, but the Charity Commission\u2019s failure to respond to a complaint in a timely fashion can only be a further disincentive for staff to speak up.<br><strong>Prof</strong><strong> David Lewis</strong><br><em>Head, </em><em>Whistleblowing Research Unit, Middlesex University</em></p> <p>\u2022 It was instructive to read Simon Jenkins\u2019 excellent piece on the drawbacks of societal reliance on philanthropy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/21/billionaires-bloomberg-bezos-government-mega-rich\" title=\"\">Billionaires are not the ones to save the world</a>, Journal, 22 February) \u2013 namely that (1) rich people do not necessarily share their riches and, if they do, they largely do so to feed their own self-interest, and (2) charities through which much philanthropic spending is organised are often wasteful and inefficient.</p> <p>For readers to then come across reports on other pages of alleged managerial and financial failures in one of our major charities, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, made his remarks all the more telling. Charities may have much to be praised for, but they are too often vehicles for unscrutinised poor practice.</p> <p>As Jenkins goes on to say, the search for fairness and the common good is best achieved through a system of just taxation, established and continued on the basis of democratic consent, and, I would argue, regulated scrutiny.<br><strong>Gillian Dalley</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

This involved the replacement of a society that operated mainly through a devolved branch structure run by around 25,000 local volunteers with one run by a centralised management-driven system \u2013 regardless of the views of the thousands of volunteers who were devoting their time and energy to the provision of practical care and support in their local communities. More recently, the constitutional role whereby volunteers could become members of the society and have a say in policy and the appointment of trustees has also been abolished. The impression is that any form of threat \u2013 actual or potential \u2013 to the authority of the senior management has been eliminated, and this appears to have included refuting the views of staff. All this has had a major effect on the nature of the society\u2019s activities, which in the branch era were focused on the provision of direct practical support to people with dementia and their hard-pressed carers. The 2019 spend of around \u00a38.6m on direct care \u2013 listed in the society\u2019s annual accounts as consisting of support groups, day care, befriending and home care \u2013 amounted to only 7.5% of its annual expenditure. Whether many donors realise that such a small proportion of their gifts are going towards these greatly needed services, as distinct from the expenditure (about \u00a34m) on the salaries of the growing number of senior managers and the cost of fundraising (almost \u00a332m) is an open question. It seems probable, too, that the NDAs are related, at least in some cases, to senior managers\u2019 adverse and possibly bullying reaction to frontline staff\u2019s concerns about the direction of the society\u2019s activities. Dr Alan Fowler Former chair of the disbanded Winchester branch of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society \u2022 The Alzheimer\u2019s Society\u2019s reliance on NDAs is misguided and illustrates how employers should not deal with concerns about alleged wrongdoing. It is misguided because NDAs cannot legally prevent staff disclosing information about breaches of contract that have a public interest, and serious bullying or harassment could constitute such a breach. In relation to the society\u2019s assertion that it has a whistleblowing policy, who would invoke it when there is a culture of fear in the organisation? External reporting seems to be appropriate in these circumstances, but the Charity Commission\u2019s failure to respond to a complaint in a timely fashion can only be a further disincentive for staff to speak up. Prof David Lewis Head, Whistleblowing Research Unit, Middlesex University \u2022 It was instructive to read Simon Jenkins\u2019 excellent piece on the drawbacks of societal reliance on philanthropy (Billionaires are not the ones to save the world, Journal, 22 February) \u2013 namely that (1) rich people do not necessarily share their riches and, if they do, they largely do so to feed their own self-interest, and (2) charities through which much philanthropic spending is organised are often wasteful and inefficient. For readers to then come across reports on other pages of alleged managerial and financial failures in one of our major charities, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, made his remarks all the more telling. Charities may have much to be praised for, but they are too often vehicles for unscrutinised poor practice. As Jenkins goes on to say, the search for fairness and the common good is best achieved through a system of just taxation, established and continued on the basis of democratic consent, and, I would argue, regulated scrutiny.

      "bodyText": "As medical practitioners increasingly recognise the importance of autonomy and include the public in the planning and delivery of healthcare, it has become vital to listen to and engage with patients\u2019 wishes. Yet, when it comes to assisted dying, we have become out of step. In 2006, the British Medical Association moved to oppose assisted dying. Even back then, polls indicated considerable public support for assisted dying, and people rarely travelled abroad to end their life. But in the years since, public support for a change in the law has risen to around 90%. Despite the best efforts of palliative care, at least one UK citizen a week is forced to leave their home and travel to Switzerland to have an assisted death \u2013 which at best is a decision fraught with emotional and financial cost, and at worst involves someone ending their life before they would otherwise wish. It is time for change. Over 150 million people worldwide have gained the option of a safeguarded assisted death, as more countries, including Canada, have changed their laws. If other countries can achieve this in a safe and legal manner, why can\u2019t we? The BMA\u2019s survey on assisted dying closes this Thursday. We urge members to vote in support of reform.

      "body": "<p>Councils in flood-stricken areas have demanded ministers urgently ease their access to emergency recovery funds as more than 100 flood warnings remained in place across England in the wake of Storm Dennis.</p> <p>Local leaders in Worcestershire, where the River Severn burst its banks and flooded homes, said the system that funds urgent recovery efforts is not working properly and have called on the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, to loosen rules to allow more money to flow to councils.</p> <p>The county council leader in Derbyshire, where floods are expected to worsen in the coming 24 hours, said the government is refusing to pay anything towards the \u00a320m costs caused by flooding in November.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not very happy,\u201d said Barry Lewis. \u201cYou can\u2019t give local authorities the clear message you are going to support them and then turn your back on them.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, the government made some emergency funds available under its Bellwin scheme to councils in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, Worcestershire and Herefordshire where the latest floods hit hardest.</p> <p>But the cash is only available once a council spends a certain amount of its own money. Because councils often work together on emergency recovery efforts some do not meet the threshold. About 1,400 homes have been flooded as a result of Storm Dennis.</p> <p>\u201cNeither the flooding nor our response is bound by artificial boundaries,\u201d the leaders of seven Worcestershire councils have told Jenrick. \u201cOur response was across Worcestershire and our residents want and need equality of treatment.\u201d</p> <p>As householders, businesses and council workers consider the scale of damage caused by the latest heavy rains, which saw 15 rivers reach their highest level on record, Downing Street defended Boris Johnson\u2019s absence from flooded areas and rejected the suggestion he had visited flooded areas during December\u2019s election simply to win votes.</p> <p>\u201cThe PM was receiving regular updates and working with ministers across government to ensure that people received the help that they need,\u201d a No 10 spokesperson said.</p> <p>The environment minister, George Eustice, told parliament \u00a32.6bn was being invested in flood defences to protect homes. \u201cClimate change is making the UK warmer and wetter with more frequent extreme weather events,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u00a3500 hardship grants will be available for flood-hit households, 100% council tax and business rates relief for at least three months and \u00a32,500 business recovery grants for affected firms.

      "bodyText": "Councils in flood-stricken areas have demanded ministers urgently ease their access to emergency recovery funds as more than 100 flood warnings remained in place across England in the wake of Storm Dennis. Local leaders in Worcestershire, where the River Severn burst its banks and flooded homes, said the system that funds urgent recovery efforts is not working properly and have called on the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, to loosen rules to allow more money to flow to councils. The county council leader in Derbyshire, where floods are expected to worsen in the coming 24 hours, said the government is refusing to pay anything towards the \u00a320m costs caused by flooding in November. \u201cWe are not very happy,\u201d said Barry Lewis. \u201cYou can\u2019t give local authorities the clear message you are going to support them and then turn your back on them.\u201d Last week, the government made some emergency funds available under its Bellwin scheme to councils in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, Worcestershire and Herefordshire where the latest floods hit hardest. But the cash is only available once a council spends a certain amount of its own money. Because councils often work together on emergency recovery efforts some do not meet the threshold. About 1,400 homes have been flooded as a result of Storm Dennis. \u201cNeither the flooding nor our response is bound by artificial boundaries,\u201d the leaders of seven Worcestershire councils have told Jenrick. \u201cOur response was across Worcestershire and our residents want and need equality of treatment.\u201d As householders, businesses and council workers consider the scale of damage caused by the latest heavy rains, which saw 15 rivers reach their highest level on record, Downing Street defended Boris Johnson\u2019s absence from flooded areas and rejected the suggestion he had visited flooded areas during December\u2019s election simply to win votes. \u201cThe PM was receiving regular updates and working with ministers across government to ensure that people received the help that they need,\u201d a No 10 spokesperson said. The environment minister, George Eustice, told parliament \u00a32.6bn was being invested in flood defences to protect homes. \u201cClimate change is making the UK warmer and wetter with more frequent extreme weather events,\u201d he said. \u00a3500 hardship grants will be available for flood-hit households, 100% council tax and business rates relief for at least three months and \u00a32,500 business recovery grants for affected firms. Householders and businesses will also be able to apply for up to \u00a35,000 to help make them more resilient to future flooding. But the leader of Herefordshire county council, where the River Wye rose to its highest level in 200 years, warned that a lack of funds meant roads badly damaged by the flooding are likely to remain unfixed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the money to pay for it,\u201d said David Hitchiner. \u201cThey are going to have to be left. Eighty per cent of our spending goes on statutory functions. People in central government need to get their heads on and work this out.\u201d In Shropshire, where temporary flood barriers in the Ironbridge gorge were placed under severe threat, Shaun Davies, leader of Telford and Wrekin council, said: \u201cIt is time the government came forward with a permanent solution looking at the gorge in its entirety. We will absolutely be lobbying the government for that investment.\u201d In parliament on Monday, Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, where two danger to life flood warnings were in place on Monday and roads, schools and colleges were closed, told Jenrick: \u201cWe need more money for our local councils.\u201d There were also fresh questions on Monday about building on flood plains when a council leader in Durham described a plan by her own council to build a new \u00a350m headquarters on land that flooded last week besides the river Wear as \u201cludicrous\u201d. \u201cIt is madness to want to build anything there,\u201d said Elizabeth Scott, a councillor and chairwoman of the city of Durham parish council, which has opposed the project. \u201cThe council will argue it is putting in flood defences, but at what cost to the public purse?

She would say things like \u2018Dad, I don\u2019t think you understand the sentence, it\u2019s like a death sentence\u2019 and \u2018I could be in here for the rest of my life\u2019. \u201cAt times when I spoke to her or visited her she was in a dark place because she had lost all hope of being released. She said she couldn\u2019t see herself being released from prison ever.\u201d The assistant coroner, Simon Milburn, told the jury it was not necessary to explain why Nokes, from Hayling Island in Hampshire, was imprisoned. Nokes was a successful artist and her work had been exhibited by the Koestler Trust at the Southbank Centre in London, the inquest in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard. She had previously completed a foundation course and hoped to study art at university. Nokes was subject to ACCT (assessment, care in custody and teamwork), a care planning process for prisoners identified as being at risk of suicide or self-harm, the inquest heard. In the months leading up to her death, Nokes was prescribed a broad range of medication to treat both mental and physical conditions and she often presented as drowsy, sleepy and sedated to staff and family, the inquest heard. The jury was told a postmortem was unable to establish her cause of death. The assistant coroner told the jury that issues to consider during the seven-day hearing were Nokes\u2019s management within the prison, particularly regarding her mental health, the medication she was prescribed and cell checks. The inquest continues.",

Sanders\u2019 latest victory showcased his popularity among a more representative chunk of the Democratic base \u2013 Latinos, African-Americans and union members \u2013 than voted in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the primary. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition that is not only going to win Nevada, it\u2019s going to sweep this country,\u201d Sanders said in San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday. In the next eight days, 15 crucial elections will take place. Centrists in the party having failed to coalesce around a moderate candidate, the nomination could be there for Sanders\u2019 taking after South Carolina votes on Saturday or after Super Tuesday, 3 March, when 14 states follow suit. Only 2.5% of the delegates needed to win the nomination at the convention in July were on offer in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Sanders began his crucial week planning extra rallies in Super Tuesday states but also under fire for comments made in an interview with CBS News broadcast on Sunday night. Sanders told 60 Minutes he opposed the \u201cauthoritarian nature\u201d of Cuba under the Castro regime, but said Fidel Castro did some good things. \u201cHe had a massive literacy program,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that a bad thing?

Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has spent more than $460m of his own money in an attempt to establish himself as the Democrat best placed to beat Donald Trump, indicated on Monday that he would also target Sanders on gun control. The Bloomberg campaign released a video attacking the senator for his mixed record on the subject. Before Sanders was elected to Congress in 1990, for example, he received support from the National Rifle Association because his Republican opponent had supported banning assault weapons. The Bloomberg video also highlighted Sanders\u2019 support for a law that helps stop mass shooting victims suing gun manufacturers and the five times he voted against a bill which called for waiting periods before acquiring guns and instant background checks on gun purchases.

We end the gun show loophole. We end the so-called strawman provision. We make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country.\u201d Bloomberg has poured money into the gun control movement but it is unclear if his cash can overcome the damage wrought by other candidates\u2019 focus on his own record regarding women and people of color. At the last debate, in Nevada, the former mayor failed to craft a convincing response to criticism of his controversial policing policy, stop-and-frisk, which disproportionately impacted minorities. The favored centrist candidate in South Carolina is Joe Biden, who remains popular with African American voters, a dominant presence in Democratic contests in the state, after serving for eight years as vice-president to Barack Obama. A CBS News poll taken before Nevada, where Biden placed second, showed him in the lead in South Carolina with 28% support. Sanders was second with 23%, followed by the second billionaire in the race, Tom Steyer, with 18%. In 2016, Hillary Clinton dominated South Carolina, winning with 73% of the vote to 26% for Sanders.

As Trump tweeted gleefully about supposed establishment attempts to block Sanders, some Democrats called on candidates including the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg to exit the race in order to consolidate the moderate vote. All the remaining candidates, however, have said they plan to stick around for Super Tuesday.

Official figures published by the government\u2019s school admissions watchdog revealed that more than 60,000 pupils were home-schooled in 2018/19, up from around 52,000 the previous year. A similar survey in 2015-16 estimated that 37,000 school-aged children were registered as home-educated. Because there is currently no requirement for parents to register with local authorities if they elect to home-school their child, the report notes that the official figure is likely to be lower than the actual total. The latest figures, published in the Office of the Schools Adjudicator\u2019s (OSA) annual report and based on information provided by 152 local authorities, will fuel concerns about \u201coff-rolling\u201d, whereby schools remove difficult or low-achieving pupils so that they are not included in their GCSE results. Shan Scott, the chief schools adjudicator, said more than 100 local authorities raised concerns that some parents who opted to educate their child at home will \u201cnot actually be able to provide education which fully meets the child\u2019s needs\u201d, echoing similar concerns aired last year.

Last year the government outlined proposals to introduce a register for home-educated children to enable local authorities to see where children are if they are not in school and intervene more effectively if required. Announcing the plans, the then education secretary Damian Hinds said: \u201cAs a government, we have a duty to protect our young people and do our utmost to make sure they are prepared for life in modern Britain. \u201cThat\u2019s why this register of children not in school is so important \u2013 not to crack down on those dedicated parents doing an admirable job of educating their children in their own homes, but to prevent vulnerable young people from vanishing under the radar.\u201d Responding to the OSA report, a Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe are looking into ways to make it easier for vulnerable pupils to access a school place when they need one and will use the findings of this report to ensure the school admissions system continues to help deliver good school places for even more pupils and parents.\u201d The OSA annual report also highlights an increase in primary schools seeking to change admissions arrangements because of falling pupil numbers, as a baby boom from the early 2000s moves from primary up to secondary level education.

Peter Hunter and David Smith, trading as Ticket Wiz and BZZ, used multiple identifies and bots to harvest thousands of tickets to gigs and West End shows such as Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The pair, who conducted their business via secondary ticketing websites including Viagogo and StubHub, were found guilty of fraud earlier this month. Hunter was jailed for four years at Leeds crown court on Monday while Smith, his husband, was given a 30-month custodial sentence. Hunter was first exposed by a Guardian investigation into touts and their relationship with so-called \u201csecondary ticketing\u201d websites, which allow people to resell tickets and take a commission on the price, which is often vastly inflated. National Trading Standards, which brought the prosecution, began investigating the pair several months later. The verdict could have major implications for the practice of touting and secondary ticketing websites. Hunter and Smith were found guilty of three counts of fraud, for using techniques that previous reporting by the Guardian has shown are common among professional ticket touts. These include the use of multiple identities and credit cards to bypass restrictions on the number of tickets that one person can buy, reducing the number of tickets on sale to the general public. They sold tickets for events at which resale was banned, putting buyers at risk of being refused entry at the turnstile. The pair also listed tickets that they did not yet own, a practice known as \u201cspeculative selling\u201d. A jury concluded that these methods were fraudulent, while it also found them guilty of possessing articles for fraud, namely software used for harvesting tickets. Lord Toby Harris, the chair of National Trading Standards, said: \u201cToday\u2019s sentences send a strong message to similar online ticket touts: these are criminal offences that can lead to prison sentences. \u201cI hope this leads to a step change in the secondary ticketing market, making it easier and safer for consumers buying tickets in the future.\u201d The music industry campaign group FanFair Alliance lauded a \u201cfantastic\u201d result for National Trading Standards and called for further investigation into secondary ticketing. \u201cBy facilitating the activities of online touts, there must be concerns that the platforms themselves are profiting from the sale of tickets unlawfully acquired by their biggest suppliers. \u201cThis should be investigated as a matter of urgency and lead to action against those platforms if they have benefited from the proceeds of criminality.\u201d",

Kimonos have long been revered for their exquisite craftsmanship, but not everyone finds embroidery riveting. With an eye on the bumper audiences fashion exhibitions such as last year\u2019s Christian Dior show have brought to the museum, the V&amp;A curator Anna Jackson has worked hard to make the story of the kimono compelling to a wider audience. The traditional museum format in which robes are draped like curtains from a horizontal pole, ideal for showcasing intricate artistry, can have the unfortunate effect of rendering the kimono lifeless. To address this, antique kimono are displayed for the first time on bespoke mannequins, showing off the rich fashion history of the garment in all its three-dimensional glory. From the first room of the exhibition, a view is framed through the type of circular windows found in Japanese teahouses of a mannequin with the elaborate updo of a 19th-century Kyoto courtesan, teetering high above the floor on her geta platform shoes, her satin-silk kimono elaborately embroidered with kabuki actors, ornamental bridges and a lion depicted in threads wrapped in gold leaf. The very first case in the exhibition presents a triptych of an antique kimono loaned from a collection in Japan, a catwalk piece designed by Galliano for Christian Dior, which has kimono-influenced sleeves and fabric with a sculpted \u201cbar\u201d jacket in the Dior tradition, and a contemporary kimono by the designer Jotaro Saito currently on sale in Tokyo\u2019s fashionable Ginza Six mall. \u201cThe fact that its shape remains constant has meant that people tend to see the kimono as unchanging and traditional,\u201d said Jackson, during the exhibition\u2019s final installation. \u201cWe want to show it as fluid and fashionable.\u201d A kimono, which is created in Kyoto in the late 18th century, is emblazoned with large calligraphy spelling out the first few words of a poem, making it a very early precursor of the slogan T-shirt.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Schools and universities have been closed across the regions and people have been advised to work from home. Museums have also been closed, and festivities, concerts and sporting events cancelled, along with Church masses.</p> \n<p>More than 3,000 tests for coronavirus have been carried out over the last few days, although authorities are still trying to identity \u201cpatient zero\u201d \u2013 the person who brought the virus to the region. The first man infected, a researcher at Unilever, came down with symptoms after attending a dinner at which there was a colleague who had recently returned from China, who tested negative for the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe peak in Italy is partly due to all the tests being done,\u201d said Roberta Siliquini, a former president of Italy\u2019s higher health council. \u201cWe have found positive cases in people who probably had few or no symptoms and who may have overcome the virus without even knowing it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Italian government has been criticised for hastily cancelling flights to and from China as, without coherence across Europe, people have been able to fly to other European cities and enter Italy from there.</p>",

Museums have also been closed, and festivities, concerts and sporting events cancelled, along with Church masses. More than 3,000 tests for coronavirus have been carried out over the last few days, although authorities are still trying to identity \u201cpatient zero\u201d \u2013 the person who brought the virus to the region. The first man infected, a researcher at Unilever, came down with symptoms after attending a dinner at which there was a colleague who had recently returned from China, who tested negative for the virus. \u201cThe peak in Italy is partly due to all the tests being done,\u201d said Roberta Siliquini, a former president of Italy\u2019s higher health council. \u201cWe have found positive cases in people who probably had few or no symptoms and who may have overcome the virus without even knowing it.\u201d The Italian government has been criticised for hastily cancelling flights to and from China as, without coherence across Europe, people have been able to fly to other European cities and enter Italy from there.",

He emphasised that the UK will not extend the transition period or accept any arrangements which subordinate us to EU rules. </p> </blockquote> <p>During the 2016, and afterwards, Brexiters used to argue that the UK would get a special trade deal with the EU. \u201cThe day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want,\u201d Michael Gove, who is now Cabinet Office minister, said during the campaign.

Here are the main points from all three interviews.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer refused to commit to offering Jeremy Corbyn a post in the shadow cabinet if he won.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/24/labour-leadership-starmer-refuses-to-commit-to-offering-corbyn-shadow-cabinet-post-live-news?page=with:block-5e538ac68f08e13324748f5b#block-5e538ac68f08e13324748f5b\">9.21am.) </a>He insisted that he had not had any discussions about possible shadow cabinet appointments, and he refused to comment on claims that there might be jobs for people like Ed Miliband or Yvette Cooper.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was opposed to the government\u2019s plan to use salary thresholds to determine if migrants should be allowed to come to the UK to work.</strong> Asked about the Home Office proposals announced last week, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The position the government has just taken is completely wrong - where they are equating the worth of an individual coming to this country by how much money they earn. I think that\u2019s profoundly the wrong approach ... I think the idea that if you don\u2019t earn a certain salary you\u2019re not bringing anything of any worth to this country is offensive.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if that meant he would do away with salary thresholds, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would - I do not think they are the right measure for the worth of an individual coming to this country.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He did not rule out campaigning for the UK to move towards a Norway-style relationship with the EU at the next general election. </strong>He said he expected the next election to be in 2024. Asked if at that point he might be advocating a closer relationship with the EU, akin to Norway\u2019s, he said: \u201cWe will have to see what the situation is in 2024.\u201d But he also said that it was in the UK\u2019s interests to be economically close to the EU.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he disagreed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/20/tony-blair-only-a-complete-renewal-of-labour-will-do\">what Tony Blair said last week </a>about how Labour should not let its support for trans rights lead to it getting involved in a culture war with conservatives.</strong> Blair said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You\u2019ve got to distinguish between the advocacy of certain things that are right, whether it\u2019s about gay rights, transgender rights, whatever it is - you\u2019ve got to distinguish between that and launching yourself politically into a kind of culture war with the right. If you go: \u2018Transgender rights is our big thing\u2019, and the right goes: \u2018Immigration control is our big thing\u2019, you\u2019re going to lose that war.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about this, Starmer said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I actually think that the way that a potential leader of the Labour party deals with the LGBT community matters hugely, and it is about the values we bring to this. So I disagree with Tony Blair about that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But Starmer also praised the record of the last Labour government, saying \u201ca lot of good stuff\u201d happened when it was in power. </strong>He said that it was wrong to \u201ctrash\u201d the record of previous Labour governments, but that it was also wrong to \u201ctrash\u201d the record of what had done in opposition over the last five years. He praised Jeremy Corbyn for turning the party into an anti-austerity party.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer claimed that \u201coutriders\u201d from other campaigns were floating allegations that his campaign was funded by wealthy donors.</strong> He said that he had received contributions from trade unions, from crowdfunding and from individuals, as other candidates had, and he said that donations would all be declared. He implied the accusations were unfair.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think this is one of those things that is swirling around. So far the candidates themselves have avoided taking lumps out of each other. I think some of the outriders are trying to stir things up a bit now.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that it had been a mistake for him to abstain on the second reading of the welfare reform bill in 2015.</strong> He said that he was a new MP at the time and he was abstaining in line with the party whip.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He struggled to refute a suggestion that he was boring.</strong> On LBC Ferrari said a Financial Times profile of him today is headlined: \u2018Boring\u2019 Starmer seeks to heal wounded party.\u2019 Asked to name the most exciting thing he had done, to prove he was not boring, Starmer replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve done lots of exciting things. You know, well, with playing football, going to football with my kids. </p> </blockquote> <p>He eventually came up with a story about how, when he got stranded in Newcastle one day during the campaign, on Valentine\u2019s night, he checked into a hotel and went to his room to find someone sleeping in the bed. Asked if it was a man or a woman, Starmer said he did not stay long enough to find out.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer rejected claims that he tried to bring down Corbyn in 2016. </strong>Asked about a Twitter video released by the leftwing Fire Brigades Union, and whether he had tried to bring down Corbyn at the time, Starmer denied this. But he confirmed that he did resign from the shadow cabinet. Starmer said that, when Corbyn won the subsequent leadership election, he agreed to serve again in shadow cabinet. He said that he viewed Corbyn as a friend and that, when he disagreed with him, he kept that private.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fbunational/status/1231667607889207298\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The 2016 coup was a carefully coordinated attack on the democratic decision of Labour Party members - and it&#39;s right to look at the record of Labour Leadership contenders at the time<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RLB4Leader?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RLB4Leader</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/3riVvaLU1y\">pic.twitter.com/3riVvaLU1y</a></p>&mdash; Fire Brigades Union (@fbunational) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fbunational/status/1231667607889207298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"476f463a657ac949202f44b094e046cbc8b4fa06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476f463a657ac949202f44b094e046cbc8b4fa06/0_0_3154_1893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Keir Starmer at the Labour hustings in Durham yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Keir Starmer at the Labour hustings in Durham yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T11:29:20.047Z\">at 11.29am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5399a08f08e13324748fc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:39:26.782Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of Priti Patel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office\">Home Office</a> ministerial colleagues has dismissed claims that she is bullying officials, as the home secretary pushed for an inquiry into a series of damaging leaks about her approach in the department, my colleague <strong>Peter Walker</strong> reports.

      "bodyText": "Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has said that unattributable briefings are damaging to government in a message to civil servants that will be seen as a rebuke to Tories who have been denouncing the work of officials anonymously to the media. (See 4.51pm.) Boris Johnson has been warned that the French government will not be blackmailed into a trade deal that risks its long-term economic interests, as the EU prepared to further harden its negotiating position. Britain\u2019s main goal in trade talks with the EU will be to \u201crestore economic and political independence from 1 January\u201d, No 10 has said, as the government prepares to publish its negotiating aims on Thursday Johnson has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the ability of Priti Patel, the home secretary, his official spokesman has said. Patel has told MPs that the new post-Brexit immigration rules announced last week, introducing income thresholds for people coming to the UK to work, could be revised over time. In a statement to MPs she said: We will continue to refine our immigration system and build on flexibility where it is needed. Over time more attributes for which points can be earned may be added, such as previous experience and additional qualifications, allowing us to respond effectively to the needs of the labour market and the economy. But to be effective it must be simple so there will not be the endless exemptions for low paid, lower-skilled workers. And we are not going to end free movement only to recreate through other routes in name only. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. According to the Financial Times\u2019 Mehreen Khan, EU ambassadors have approved the text of the EU\u2019s negotiating mandate for the trade talks with the UK. It is due to be approved by ministers at the general affairs council tomorrow. Here is the draft version (pdf) published at the start of February. According to Khan, a key change is in what was paragraph 89 in the draft, but what is now paragraph 92. This may be the most important sentence. To that end, the envisaged agreement should uphold the common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with union standards as a reference point, in the areas of State aid, competition, state-owned enterprises, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, and relevant tax matters and other regulatory measures and practices in these areas. As you can see from the changes (new material in bold, omitted material crossed out ), the changes tighten the level playing field provisions a bit in the direction of dynamic alignment (ie, the principle that standards must remain aligned over time) and away from non-regression (ie, the principle that standards just have to avoid getting weaker than they are now.) But they are quite subtle changes. \u201cOver time\u201d strengthens \u201cuphold\u201d, but arguably that is what uphold meant anyway. And having EU standards \u201cas a reference point\u201d implies some sort of alignment, while allowing an element of divergence. The addition of \u201cother regulatory measures and practices\u201d also reads like a catch-all addition designed to close any possible loopholes. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has written a message for civil servants deprecating \u201cunattributable briefings and leaks to the media\u201d. This practice \u201cbesmirches this country\u2019s hard-won reputation for good governance\u201d, he says. It has been posted on a civil service website. In it Sedwill says: Candour, confidentiality and courtesy between ministers, special advisers and civil servants are crucial to the trust and confidence on which good governance depends. Civil servants should at all times be confident that they can give the honest, impartial and objective advice on which ministers can rely. Both should be confident that this advice, and any debate that surrounds it, will remain private. Ministers may read this as a reprimand to officials briefing against them, such as those who appeared to be responsible for the Sunday Times story yesterday claiming that MI5 don\u2019t rate Priti Patel, the home secretary. But it also reads like a rebuke to those Tory sources who have been briefing against civil servants, such as those who told the Sunday Telegraph yesterday that three permanent secretaries were on a government hitlist of officials destined for the chop. No doubt Sedwill has given some thought as to where these hostile anti-civil service briefings are coming from. That might make for an awkward conversation with some of the advisers he will bump into in the corridors of No 10 ... Here is another picture from the D\u00fcsseldorf carnival. At a street carnival in D\u00fcsseldorf Germans have been joking about the way Boris Johnson has divided the UK. These carnivals are an annual tradition, and today, Rosenmontag (Rose Monday - the Monday before Lent), is the highlight, apparently. Boris Johnson met Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, prime minister of Croatia, in Downing Street earlier today and No 10 has just sent out the read-out of their conversation. Croatia currently holds the rotating six-month presidency of the EU. Normally these Downing Street read-outs are epically uninformative - \u201cthe prime minister and President Trump spoke this evening and discussed a range of bilateral and international issues,\u201d they told us last week \u2013 but this one contains some fresh words on the forthcoming UK-EU trade talks that are interesting, because they reaffirm Johnson\u2019s determination for the UK not to be \u201csubordinate\u201d to EU rules. A No 10 spokesperson said: The leaders spoke about the future relationship between the EU and the UK. The prime minister set out the UK\u2019s vision based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade. The prime minister highlighted that we are not seeking a special or bespoke agreement, but rather one like those the EU has already struck with other friendly countries like Canada. He emphasised that the UK will not extend the transition period or accept any arrangements which subordinate us to EU rules. During the 2016, and afterwards, Brexiters used to argue that the UK would get a special trade deal with the EU. \u201cThe day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want,\u201d Michael Gove, who is now Cabinet Office minister, said during the campaign. And when Theresa May (not a Brexiter) was PM, she said she wanted an ambitious, bespoke deal with the EU. Now the goal is quite different - not a special deal, but an off-the-shelf Canada-style one. Voting in the Labour leadership and deputy leadership contest opens today. But the party is advising members that they may not receive their ballot paper, or ballot email, immediately. It has circulated this note to journalists. Ballot papers are being issued to hundreds of thousands of Labour members and supporters \u2013 by email, or post if we don\u2019t hold an email address. Members and supporters are being advised that they should not be concerned if they don\u2019t receive their ballot papers today, or even on Tuesday. Emails are being issued in batches due to the size of the electorate, and we expect it will take most of this week to send them all. Requests for ballot papers to be reissued will only be processed from Monday 2 March. We are asking members and supporters not to request a reissue before this date. We are naturally expecting a high volume of enquiries by phone and email from members and supporters in the coming days. We are asking the media to help limit this to genuine enquiries, by not publishing scare stories about the process or giving credence to exaggerated or misleading claims. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, has been campaigning in Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd today. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. The government has moved to ban membership of more rightwing terrorism groups, the Press Association reports. A proscription order has been put before parliament which would make joining the organisation Sonnenkrieg Division illegal in the UK, the Home Office said. The proposal has to be debated and is subject to parliament backing it. Laws coming into force on Tuesday will also recognise System Resistance Network as an alias of the already-proscribed group National Action. Anyone found to be a member of, or offering support to, the groups could now face up to 10 years in jail. On a visit to Derry, Brandon Lewis, the new Northern Ireland secretary, has said that the government will not impose a customs border down the Irish Sea. Asked about the issue, he said: I think it\u2019s safest not to get too caught up in rumours and stuff in the press over the weekends. We are focusing on our main job. We have always said we want to make sure there is unfettered access between GB and Northern Ireland, we\u2019ve always as a government obviously gone by the rule of law and we will continue to do that. We want to make sure that the United Kingdom is one whole union, and one that is good for business across the United Kingdom. We\u2019ve always said there will not be a border down the Irish Sea, there will be unfettered access for business. There were cases last year of people threatening to leave the country if Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister. But David Graeber, the anthropologist, radical author and anarchism advocate, may be the first person to threaten to leave the country if Keir Starmer becomes leader of the opposition. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been advised to avoid becoming a \u201ccreature of No 10\u201d at next month\u2019s budget by steering clear of raising government spending to satisfy Boris Johnson\u2019s demands. David Gauke, the former justice secretary and Treasury minister who was expelled from the Conservatives for defying Johnson over Brexit, said Sunak was in danger of putting the public finances on an unsustainable path should he pump up government borrowing by too much to meet the prime minister\u2019s spending demands. Gauke said: You have got a new chancellor who will want to establish that he is not a creature of No 10. [Sunak], I would imagine, would want to assert that independence, if not necessarily on 11 March, sooner rather than later. Speaking at an event at the Resolution Foundation thinktank in London, Gauke said that the government\u2019s plans to increase spending could result in the national debt as a proportion of GDP increasing, which could be dangerous before a potential economic downturn. Now that is a very strange position to find ourselves in. It\u2019s a very strange position for a Conservative government to find itself in in particular. [There are] fundamental constraints here. The Treasury is going to have to continue to do the job the Treasury has done in the last 10 years, of being pretty tight with public spending, and making sure we do prioritise. Gauke also said that the Ministry of Justice had faced a funding settlement that was \u201cessentially unsustainable\u201d. He said prisoner numbers would increase as Boris Johnson\u2019s government toughened up sentencing criteria, meaning more prison officers would be needed. \u201cThose pressures are going to increase yet further,\u201d he added. The European Union has warned Boris Johnson against trying to water down the new customs rules for Northern Ireland that will apply under the withdrawal agreement from 2021. Speaking at the European commission\u2019s regular briefing, Dana Spinant, deputy chief spokeswoman of the commission, said this issue was \u201cvery important\u201d in maintaining trust between the two sides. She said: The withdrawal agreement has been signed and ratified by both sides and as such it must be effectively implemented. That includes, of course, the protocol on Northern Ireland and all its constituent parts. Of course, in this context as in all others, we would expect our partners to respect their international obligations under their national law and under international law - that includes, of course, the withdrawal agreement which has legal force. Obviously, with respect to the future and how this plays in the negotiation, of course respecting our legal obligations is very important for establishing trust between two partners in a negotiation. Spinant was responding to reports claiming Johnson does want to \u201cget around\u201d the rules he has promised to apply. (See 12.08pm.) Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, has also said there must be no \u201cbacksliding\u201d from the UK. (See 12.08pm.) Downing Street this morning rejected claims that the PM is planning to ignore the commitments he had made relating to the Northern Ireland border. But the spokesman also said that British ports had not been asked to prepare for any new checks or controls on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland \u2013 even though these would be required under the EU\u2019s interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol. (See 1.07pm.) Here are the main points from the No 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street rejected a suggestion from the French Europe minister (see 10.39am) that the UK is trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d the EU into agreeing a trade deal by the end of 2020. When this notion was put to the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, he rejected it firmly. But he confirmed that the government remained determined not to extend the post-Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020. The spokesman said that restoring independence would be the main goal for the UK in the trade talks with the EU. He said: The UK\u2019s primary objective in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on 1 January 2021. This firms up the message given by David Frost, the PM\u2019s Brexit negotiator, in his speech in Brussels last week. But it will also be seen as fresh evidence that a \u201cno-deal\u201d outcome at the end of 2020 is a real possibility. The spokesman dismissed claims that the government was exploring ways of evading the commitments it has made for a customs border down the Irish Sea. (See 12.08pm.) Asked about this, the spokesman said: The [Northern Ireland] protocol specifically allows the UK to ensure unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to GB. The UK signed the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol, last month. We will comply with our obligations. The spokesman said British ports have not been asked to prepare for any new checks or controls on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland. Asked for details of the UK\u2019s obligations under the protocol, the spokesman said: The prime minister set out during the election campaign what he understood to be the obligations of the protocol ... He has been clear that beyond the limited changes that are introduced by the protocol, there will be no changes to GB/NI trade, and we have not asked any ports to prepare for new checks or controls between GB/NI. As Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, explained in a Twitter thread yesterday, the EU believes that the protocol does oblige the UK to impose checks and controls. Here are two of his tweets. And here are two slides from a European commission document (pdf) explaining how the withdrawal agreement works setting out the checks that will apply for GB/NI and NI/GB trade. The spokesman said the government will publish its negotiating mandate for the trade talks with the EU on Thursday. The mandate for trade talks with the US will then be published next week. The spokesman defended the PM\u2019s decision to stay away from flooded areas last week, saying any such visits would have been a distraction. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to distract from that ongoing effort,\u201d the spokesman said. The spokesman did not have a clear explanation as to why the PM took a different approach when flooding happened during the election campaign. The spokesman said there will be no inquiry into the leak of a claim that MI5 is withholding information from Priti Patel, the home secretary. But the claim was \u201cbaseless\u201d, the spokesman said. The spokesman declined to say the PM had full confidence in Sir Philip Rutnam, permanent secretary at the Home Office. Asked if he did, the spokesman replied: The prime minister has full confidence in the civil service which is working very hard to deliver on the government\u2019s priorities. Yesterday it was reported that Rutnam is one of three permanent secretaries on a Downing Street hitlist of officials whom the PM wants to remove. The spokesman rejected claims that the PM was on holiday last week. The suggestion that Boris Johnson was on holiday was prompted by the fact that he was staying at Chevening, and that he was not doing public engagements. The spokesman revealed that the UK has sent medical supplies to China to help it deal with the coronavirus. The UK has supplied 1,800 goggles, 43,000 disposable gloves, 194,000 sanitising wipes, 37,500 medical gowns and 2,500 face masks, the spokesman said. There are two government statements in the Commons this afternoon. This morning Leo Varadkar, who remains Ireland\u2019s caretaker prime minister after the inconclusive general election, said there must be no \u201cbacksliding\u201d from the UK on the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, the deal that will keep Northern Ireland in the single market after Brexit, effectively putting a customs border down the Irish Sea. Responding to a report in the Sunday Times (paywall) saying Boris Johnson intends to \u201cget round\u201d those requirements, Varadkar said: We totally understand why they may want to minimise any checks at the ports and airports in Northern Ireland, we want to do that too, but the agreement clearly says if there have to be checks anywhere, they would happen at the ports and airports in Northern Ireland rather than on the land border between north and south. So I am saying to the British government, there can be no backsliding on the withdrawal agreement, let\u2019s not even go there and let\u2019s focus instead on what should be the next phase, which is negotiating a free trade agreement between the European Union and Ireland and the UK so we can protect jobs and our economy. According to Tim Shipman\u2019s report in the Sunday Times, No 10 is determined to interpret the protocol differently. Shipman said: Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit team has been ordered to draw up plans to \u201cget around\u201d the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement so the prime minister can play hardball with Brussels over trade. Officials in Taskforce Europe, run by Johnson\u2019s EU negotiator David Frost, are working in secret on proposals to ensure that there do not need to be checks on goods passing from Britain to Northern Ireland. They believe the new attorney-general, Suella Braverman, might have to give new legal advice to justify the move. Insiders say she was appointed because her predecessor Geoffrey Cox was not willing to countenance action that will be seen in Brussels as a breach of the exit agreement. Q: Is the UK trying to blackmail France into accepting a trade deal, as the French Europe minister implied this morning? (See 10.39am.) No, says the spokesman. Q: Is the PM concerned about suggestions that the UK is trying to wriggle out of the commitments it made in the Northern Ireland protocol on checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland. The spokesman says there will be unfettered access from Northern Ireland to Britain. He says the UK will comply with its obligations. Q: Can people trust the UK to keep its word? The spokesman says the UK will comply with its obligations. Q: Can the UK comply with its obligations without having to impose checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland? The spokesman says the PM set out during the election campaign his understanding of the terms of the protocol. He says the government has not asked ports to impose new checks or controls on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland. And that\u2019s it. The briefing is over. I will post a full summary soon. Q: If the threat is low, why is the government buying millions of face masks? The spokesman says the UK government has been sending supplies to China, including 43,000 gloves, 37,000 medical gowns and 2,500 face masks. Q: How many Britons are affected by the coronavirus quarantine in Italy? The spokesman says he has no updates on this. He says there was a ministerial meeting of the Cobra emergency committee last week, and an officials\u2019 meeting too. Q: Has the UK contingency plans for sealing off areas, in the way the Italians have done? The spokesman says the government will follow the advice of public health experts. The chief medical officer says the risks to people in the UK are low, the spokesman says. And he says the NHS is extremely well prepared. Q: Will travel advice to Italy be changed? The spokesman says the advice on the Foreign Office\u2019s website was changed at the weekend to reflect the situation in some parts of Italy. Q: Can you explain the background to the appointment of someone to review the conditions of work for special advisers? The spokesman says the government decided to review this at the end of last year. This appointment is part of that process, he says. On Priti Patel, the spokesman says the home secretary and her permanent secretary issued a statement last night. He says the PM has full confidence in Patel. Q: Does the PM have confidence in Philip Rutnam, permanent secretary at the Home Office? The spokesman says the PM has confidence in the whole of the civil service. Q: Does he think MI5 have been withholding information from Patel? No, says the spokesman. Q: Does the PM want to move Rutnam? The spokesman says the PM has confidence in the whole of the civil service. He says permanent secretary appointments are for the cabinet secretary. Q: Is there an inquiry going on into the leak of information critical of Patel? No, says the spokesman. And he says no inquiry was requested. The PM\u2019s spokesman is here. He starts by announcing what is happening today. He says the PM is working from Downing Street. Later he is meeting the Croatian PM. James Brokenshire, the Home Office minister, has announced plans for a \u201cprotect duty\u201d on people who own open spaces. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the DWP secretary, is publishing a report on auto-enrolment in pensions schemes. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is attending a climate change conference. Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, is doing a visit in Northern Ireland. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, is announcing the final local government settlement. MPs will vote on it later today. The spokesman is now taking questions. Q: Does the PM intend to make a statement on plans for new Trident warheads? The spokesman says he does not have anything to announce on this. Q: Was the PM annoyed that this news came out in the US? The spokesman does not have anything to add. Q: Was the PM on holiday last week? The spokesman says the PM was working last week. He had calls with the Chinese and US presidents. He was kept updated on the flooding. And he was working on his domestic agenda and on the budget. Q: Why did the PM not visit any of the flooded areas? The spokesman says the government is very grateful to all the emergency services who were called out. He says the environment secretary has been in the lead on this. It is important not to distract from the relief effort. Q: He was happy to do that last year, when there was an election on. The spokesman repeats the point about being grateful to the emergency services. No 10 defends PM\u2019s decision to stay away from flooded areas, saying such visits would be a distraction. I\u2019m at 9 Downing Street for the morning lobby briefing. It will be the first we\u2019ve had for a week (No 10 don\u2019t hold daily briefings during recess) and so there is quite a lot to cover. The embargo arrangements for these briefings are a bit hit and miss, but I\u2019m expecting the embargo to be lifted, and so I should be able to cover the proceedings live. We\u2019re waiting for the prime minister\u2019s spokesman to arrive. This is from Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, the French Europe minister. She is saying that France will not sign up to a bad trade deal with the UK just to meet Boris Johnson\u2019s December 2020 deadline. (Johnson has set this deadline by ruling out an extension to the post-Brexit transition.) And here is a translation from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. Jennifer says EU diplomats are meeting again this afternoon to have another go at finalising the EU\u2019s mandate for the trade negotiation with the UK. On the subject of who might get appointed to Keir Starmer\u2019s shadow cabinet, if he wins the Labour leadership, the Economist\u2019s Duncan Weldon has a Twitter thread on who might be appointed shadow chancellor. It starts here. And here is his conclusion. He thinks Jonathan Reynolds or Anneliese Dodds, both shadow Treasury ministers, could get the job. Sir Keir Starmer was interviewed this morning by Kay Burley on Sky News, by Mishal Husain on Today and by Nick Ferrari on LBC. Here are the main points from all three interviews. Starmer refused to commit to offering Jeremy Corbyn a post in the shadow cabinet if he won. (See 9.21am.) He insisted that he had not had any discussions about possible shadow cabinet appointments, and he refused to comment on claims that there might be jobs for people like Ed Miliband or Yvette Cooper. He said he was opposed to the government\u2019s plan to use salary thresholds to determine if migrants should be allowed to come to the UK to work. Asked about the Home Office proposals announced last week, he said: The position the government has just taken is completely wrong - where they are equating the worth of an individual coming to this country by how much money they earn. I think that\u2019s profoundly the wrong approach ... I think the idea that if you don\u2019t earn a certain salary you\u2019re not bringing anything of any worth to this country is offensive. When asked if that meant he would do away with salary thresholds, he replied: I would - I do not think they are the right measure for the worth of an individual coming to this country. He did not rule out campaigning for the UK to move towards a Norway-style relationship with the EU at the next general election. He said he expected the next election to be in 2024. Asked if at that point he might be advocating a closer relationship with the EU, akin to Norway\u2019s, he said: \u201cWe will have to see what the situation is in 2024.\u201d But he also said that it was in the UK\u2019s interests to be economically close to the EU. He said he disagreed with what Tony Blair said last week about how Labour should not let its support for trans rights lead to it getting involved in a culture war with conservatives. Blair said: You\u2019ve got to distinguish between the advocacy of certain things that are right, whether it\u2019s about gay rights, transgender rights, whatever it is - you\u2019ve got to distinguish between that and launching yourself politically into a kind of culture war with the right. If you go: \u2018Transgender rights is our big thing\u2019, and the right goes: \u2018Immigration control is our big thing\u2019, you\u2019re going to lose that war. Asked about this, Starmer said: I actually think that the way that a potential leader of the Labour party deals with the LGBT community matters hugely, and it is about the values we bring to this. So I disagree with Tony Blair about that. But Starmer also praised the record of the last Labour government, saying \u201ca lot of good stuff\u201d happened when it was in power. He said that it was wrong to \u201ctrash\u201d the record of previous Labour governments, but that it was also wrong to \u201ctrash\u201d the record of what had done in opposition over the last five years. He praised Jeremy Corbyn for turning the party into an anti-austerity party. Starmer claimed that \u201coutriders\u201d from other campaigns were floating allegations that his campaign was funded by wealthy donors. He said that he had received contributions from trade unions, from crowdfunding and from individuals, as other candidates had, and he said that donations would all be declared. He implied the accusations were unfair. I think this is one of those things that is swirling around. So far the candidates themselves have avoided taking lumps out of each other. I think some of the outriders are trying to stir things up a bit now. He said that it had been a mistake for him to abstain on the second reading of the welfare reform bill in 2015. He said that he was a new MP at the time and he was abstaining in line with the party whip. He struggled to refute a suggestion that he was boring. On LBC Ferrari said a Financial Times profile of him today is headlined: \u2018Boring\u2019 Starmer seeks to heal wounded party.\u2019 Asked to name the most exciting thing he had done, to prove he was not boring, Starmer replied: I\u2019ve done lots of exciting things. You know, well, with playing football, going to football with my kids. He eventually came up with a story about how, when he got stranded in Newcastle one day during the campaign, on Valentine\u2019s night, he checked into a hotel and went to his room to find someone sleeping in the bed. Asked if it was a man or a woman, Starmer said he did not stay long enough to find out. Starmer rejected claims that he tried to bring down Corbyn in 2016. Asked about a Twitter video released by the leftwing Fire Brigades Union, and whether he had tried to bring down Corbyn at the time, Starmer denied this. But he confirmed that he did resign from the shadow cabinet. Starmer said that, when Corbyn won the subsequent leadership election, he agreed to serve again in shadow cabinet. He said that he viewed Corbyn as a friend and that, when he disagreed with him, he kept that private. One of Priti Patel\u2019s Home Office ministerial colleagues has dismissed claims that she is bullying officials, as the home secretary pushed for an inquiry into a series of damaging leaks about her approach in the department, my colleague Peter Walker reports. After the Home Office released a statement denying a rift between Patel and her most senior civil servant, and MI5 rejected reports it is witholding intelligence from her, James Brokenshire called the reports \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d. Today ballot papers start going out in the Labour leadership contest (or, in most cases, emails - people are generally expected to vote electronically) and this morning Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and the clear favourite in the contest, has doing a round of interviews. On the Today programme he was asked if there would be space for Jeremy Corbyn in his shadow cabinet if he won and, although he dodged the question, listeners might have concluded that the answer was no. When Mishal Husain asked Starmer if he would give Corbyn a job, Starmer replied: Look, there\u2019s been so much speculation. I have not discussed that team with anybody. I\u2019m totally focused ... Husain then pressed him again, saying he must have a view on this. But Starmer stuck to the same line. If you can believe it, given that we have been at this for weeks, the ballot is only dropping today, no votes have been cast yet, I\u2019m focused on winning this race and getting as many votes as I possibly can through my argument about unity, effective opposition and focusing on winning the next general election. I have not discussed the shadow cabinet with anybody. And therefore whatever is swirling around, because there are names everywhere, it is all rumour, I can tell you. Although Starmer may not have discussed specific shadow cabinet jobs with anybody, at a Labour hustings yesterday he did say that there would be top jobs for both Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy if he won. Previously he had declined to make that commitment. In truth, most Labour members would probably expect Corbyn to leave the frontbench whoever wins \u2013 not least because that is normally what outgoing leaders do (although some do later return to cabinet or shadow cabinet roles, like William Hague). Long-Bailey herself said less than two weeks ago that Corbyn had done his bit and that it was time for a new generation. But she has also said separately that she would offer Corbyn a job because she likes him so much, and the leftwing deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon has said the \u201cideal\u201d outcome would be for Corbyn to stay on as shadow foreign secretary. Last week Corbyn did not rule out taking a shadow cabinet post if offered one. I will post more from the Starmer interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Prof Sir Michael Marmot publishes a report on health inequalities across England. 9.30am: David Gauke, the former Tory cabinet minister, speaks at the launch of a Resolution Foundation report on the outlook for next month\u2019s budget. As Richard Partington reports, it says the government is set to increase borrowing to spend more than \u00a31tn a year, increasing the size of the British state to make it bigger than at any point under the 10-year premiership of Labour\u2019s Tony Blair. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: The Commons starts sitting again after the half-term recess. After housing questions, there are likely to be urgent questions or government statements. After 3pm: Peers start debating the emergency terrorist offenders (restriction of early release) bill. It is due to clear all its Lords stages by the end of the day. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

      "bodyText": "Police in Canada have removed Indigenous activists from a railway line in Ontario, where a two-week protest against a contentious natural gas pipeline has blocked train traffic and fueled a growing political crisis for prime minister Justin Trudeau. Ten members of the Tyendinaga Mohawk nation were arrested on Monday when officers moved in to lift the blockade which had been erected in support of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en First Nation in British Columbia who are fighting a 416-mile pipeline through their traditional territory. Ontario provincial police had warned the activists that they had until midnight Sunday to leave the area, or face arrest and charges. Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en activists opposing the C$6.6bn (US$4.98bn) Coastal GasLink pipeline were forced to leave a remote camp which had been blocking construction on 10 February. But secondary protests sprang up across the country as demonstrators blocked railways, government buildings and ports. Canadian National, which owns the rail line, won an injunction to clear the blockade near the city of Belleville, Ontario, in early February. But police, wary of violent standoffs in the 1990s with Indigenous groups, had so far been unwilling to forcefully remove the demonstrators. Shortly after sunrise on Monday morning, however, dozens of officers descended on the blockade. Police barred media from the operation, but the confrontation was broadcast on a Facebook live broadcast. Tyendinaga Mohawk activists heckled a phalanx of police officers, telling them they were standing on Indigenous land and had no authority. ADD Officers warned that people standing near the rail line were in violation of the injunction and faced imminent arrest. Moments later, dozens of officers tackled a number of protestors, forcing them to the ground and cuffing their hands with zip-ties. \u201cStay back,\u201d police shouted to the remaining demonstrators. The two sides remained in a tense standoff until members of the Tyendinaga Mohawk nation received orders from community leaders to back away. The blockade of rail lines through Tyendinaga Mohawk territory has crippled much of Canada\u2019s freight and commuter rail traffic, and the string of protests have been blamed for 1,400 layoffs at Canada\u2019s main rail companies, propane shortages in eastern Canada and economic hardship for farmers. The protests have piled pressure on Trudeau, who came to power promising reconciliation with Canada\u2019s First Nations, but has supported the country\u2019s fossil fuels industry. Trudeau at first called for \u201cdialogue and mutual respect\u201d but by Friday, his patience had worn thin, and he bluntly told the protestors: \u201cthe barricades need to come down now.\u201d Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary Chief Woos has said he expects blockades and protests will continue throughout the country until the RCMP and pipeline workers leave Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory. Only once these conditions are met, the chiefs will be willing to meet with federal and provincial leaders. Over the weekend, two new rail blockades were established in Saskatoon and Vancouver.",

That is why I have called for a Climate Justice Fund, which would make fossil fuel companies pay damage costs incurred by flooding and wildfires, as well as contributing to losses suffered by countries in the global south. Soon, all politics will be climate politics. Labour needs a leader who recognises this, and has a strategy to build a winning coalition around a plan for rapid decarbonisation and economic renewal, working with trade unions, community groups and the climate movement. This is the basis on which we will win in 2024, transform Britain \u2013 and help save the planet. \u2022 Rebecca Long-Bailey is the Labour MP for Salford and Eccles and a candidate for the Labour party leadership",

This means the economic forecasts of the impact, such as they are, will need to be revised, with a greater impact now to be expected.\u201d Stock markets had fallen sharply at the end of January as news of the coronavirus outbreak first emerged, prompting fears over the global economy because of slowing growth on the back of the US-China trade war. Steps by the People\u2019s Bank of China to inject billions into the world\u2019s second largest economy then led to a rally. However, fresh concerns over the rising impact from the virus have returned to dent optimism. Oil prices have fallen as global demand is likely to decline because of the virus outbreak and China is the world\u2019s biggest importer of oil. Brent crude tumbled by $2.66 a barrel to $55.69, a 4.6% fall. Warren Patterson, head of commodity strategy at ING, said: \u201cWe believe the virus\u2019s effect on oil demand will shave some 400,000 barrels a day from global consumption growth, taking us to the lowest level in nearly a decade.\u201d As the virus spreads, the Beijing motor show in late April has been postponed. The owner of Primark, Associated British Foods, warned on Monday that there could be shortages of some clothing lines later this year if factory shutdowns in China are prolonged. ABF sources more than 40% of Primark\u2019s products from China.",

      "bodyText": "Greenpeace faces a heavy fine after admitting that its climate activists boarded a North Sea oil rig in defiance of a court order last year. Transocean, the US-based drilling contractor, has asked the court of session in Edinburgh to impose unlimited fines on Greenpeace UK and consider jailing its executive director, John Sauven, for contempt of court. The legal action is the latest challenge by an oil major following Greenpeace\u2019s decision to switch the focus of its climate campaign to the North Sea oil industry in protest at its role in the climate crisis. In December, Shell won a court ruling banning Greenpeace from occupying four of its rigs in the Brent field after Lady Carmichael, a judge in Edinburgh, ruled that the protest group was breaching Shell\u2019s property rights and risking its activists\u2019 safety. The Transocean case came after Greenpeace activists climbed on to the Paul B Loyd rig while it was at anchor in the Cromarty Firth north of Inverness in June last year. Greenpeace was protesting at its contract to drill new oil wells in the Vorlich field for BP. The day after the first group of activists boarded the rig on 9 June, Transocean and BP won an interim interdict, or emergency injunction, banning Greenpeace from occupying it or coming within 500 metres of it while at sea. That first group was removed by police on 13 June. The following day, two more activists occupied the rig for less than 24 hours. After the rig left the Cromarty Firth under tow to the Vorlich field, speedboats from the Greenpeace International protest ship Arctic Sunrise briefly breached the 500-metre exclusion zone around it. Lawyers for Greenpeace UK admitted in the court on Monday that they knew both incidents put the organisation in contempt of court. James Mure QC, for Greenpeace, told Lady Wolffe, the judge, they were justified in defying the court order to raise public awareness of the significant impact that North Sea oil production was having on the climate. With Sauven sitting behind him, Mure said there was scientific consensus that drilling for new oil reserves would breach the Paris agreement on capping carbon emissions, and would accelerate climate heating. Before pleading for leniency and an acceptance that Greenpeace was acting in the public interest, Mure cited statements from BP executives including Bob Dudley, the company\u2019s chairman, admitting that the world faced a climate crisis. Greenpeace was upholding a long tradition of civil disobedience, Mure added. \u201cThere are few amongst us who are willing to bear witness [to the climate crisis] in a more challenging way,\u201d he told the court. Wolffe confirmed she had read Greenpeace\u2019s submissions on the climate science and the Paris agreement, and said: \u201cOne just has to have regard to the extraordinary weather events on the continent in the last month or two.\u201d Despite supporting the first emergency injunction, BP has not joined in with Transocean\u2019s decision to sue Greenpeace for contempt \u2013 the environmental campaign group believes that shows BP is anxious to avoid unfavourable publicity. Jonathan Barne QC, acting for Transocean, said his client \u201cdoes not call into question the sincerity of the beliefs or the motives which led to this action, and the pursuer doesn\u2019t call into question Greenpeace\u2019s right to protest\u201d. But by the time the second group of activists had climbed on the rig, Greenpeace \u201chad made their point and made their point well\u201d. Greenpeace \u201cbreached the interdict in the full knowledge it was doing so and Greenpeace wore that breach as a badge of honour\u201d, he added. That was a direct challenge to the authority of the court and a restriction of Transocean\u2019s rights to go about its business, and was inherently dangerous, Barne said. Wolffe said she would announce her decision in court on 23 March.",

Philippe [geddit?] was born on 29 February 2016. His parents decided to celebrate his first birthday 365 days later.</p> <p><em>On what date did they celebrate his first birthday? </em></p> <p><strong>Solution </strong>28 February 2017.</p> <p>My guess is that most of you got this question wrong. Certainly, my intuition when I first saw this problem was that the answer was March 1. If Feb 29 is the day after Feb 28 in leap years, it seems right that March 1 is the day after Feb 28 in non-leap years. This reasoning is erroneous. </p> <p>Think about it like this. In normal years, one day after Feb 28 is March 1, two days after Feb 28 is March 2, three days after Feb 28 is March 3, and so on until 365 days after Feb 28 is Feb 28.</p> <p>In leap years, one day after Feb 29 is March 1, two days after Feb 29 is March 2, three days after Feb 29 is March 3, and so on.

Her seventh birthday was also on a Sunday.</p> <p><em>In which year was my great grandmother born?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution </strong>The hint here was that in the set up to the question I said that leap years come around \u2018about\u2019 once every four years. A more accurate description is that the come around exactly every four years apart from years divisible by 100 (but not 400). So, 2000 was a leap year, but 1900 wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>In a normal year, if a date falls on a Sunday one year, the following year that date falls on a Monday. So, for a date to fall on a Sunday one year, and a Sunday seven years later, we need a run of seven years with zero leap years. The last time this happened with the first Sunday of the year (i.e. one in January) was 1897-1904. So my great grandmother was born in 1897.</p> <p>3. The mother is 21 years older than her daughter. In six years she will be five times older than her daughter.</p> <p><em>Where is the father?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution </strong>With the mother!</p> <p>Let\u2019s rewrite the statement of the question algebraically. Let M = age of mother now, and D = age of daughter now.

In other words the daughter is aged -9 months. She is being conceived!</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s problems.

The recent people survey highlighted that we have more to do. \u201cIf you do have any concerns about bullying, harassment or discrimination from anyone you worth with, please do not stay silent.\u201d Rycroft tells staff that if they have \u201cparticular concerns in relation to a minister, there are procedures in place\u201d, adding: \u201cBe assured that concerns of this nature will be taken seriously.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman said he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Patel\u2019s ability. Earlier, James Brokenshire, one of Patel\u2019s Home Office ministerial colleagues, dismissed claims that she had been bullying officials, as the home secretary pushed for an inquiry into a series of damaging leaks about her approach in the department. However, the PM\u2019s spokesman said there would be no leak inquiry into the source of reports that revealed an alleged spat between Patel and the permanent secretary at the Home Office, Philip Rutnam. In his note to civil servants, Sedwill alludes to \u201crecent stories of tensions within Whitehall, sparked by unattributable briefings and leaks to the media\u201d. \u201cThis besmirches this country\u2019s hard-won reputation for good governance and is a distraction from the vital work of the thousands of civil servants delivering the government\u2019s agenda and the public services on which our citizens rely.\u201d He adds: \u201cCandour, confidentiality and courtesy between ministers, special advisers and civil servants are crucial to the trust and confidence on which good governance depends. \u201cCivil servants should at all times be confident they can give honest, impartial and objective advice on which ministers can rely. \u201cBoth should be confident that this advice, and any debate that surrounds it, will remain private and that everyone will at all times adhere to the high standards set out in the civil service, special adviser and ministerial codes.\u201d",

He could make careers, and he could break them.</p> \n<p>But Pulitzer prize-winning reporting from the New York Times and the New Yorker that exposed decades of sexual harassment and assault allegations against him, and culminated this year in a criminal trial in New York, saw Weinstein become a virtual untouchable \u2013 toxic to most of those who formerly feted him with a surname that has become a byword for abuse, not Oscars.</p> \n<p>Weinstein is unlikely to ever return to the top. That\u2019s according even to people whose job it is to redeem the reputation of the seemingly irredeemable. \u201cHis reputation will never recover,\u201d said Shannon Wilkinson, a New York-based <a href=\"https://reputation-communications.com/\">reputation management consultant.</a></p> \n<p>Ken Auletta, an early profiler of Weinstein now at work on a biography of the mogul that is due out in 2021, agreed. \u201cWho\u2019s going to want to act in a Harvey movie?

They went to see foreign films, dramas, everything \u2013 and though his father would sometimes fall asleep, the boys relished the outings and promptly became cinephiles.</p> \n<p>Weinstein took readily to the role of movie historian, incorporating things he learned in his weekend movie sojourns to what he was learning in school. An old classmate, Jeff Malek <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/young-harvey-weinstein-making-a-monster-1089069\">told the Hollywood Reporter</a> that Weinstein \u201cknew the entire cast of every movie\u201d and that when he tested him with questions about The Wizard of Oz, Weinstein \u201cproceeded to list the cast and crew, including gaffers, wardrobe, etc, by memory\u201d.</p> \n<p>Not everything the Weinsteins learned at home was so helpful. In a 2011 tribute piece to his dad, Bob Weinstein recalled how once after his mom received an unflattering haircut at the beauty salon, she demanded her husband seek revenge. \u201c\u2018Have the hairstylist fired and sue the beauty parlor for everything they\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d Bob recalled his mother saying in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/04/max-weinstein-200304\">the piece he penned in Vanity Fair</a>.</p> \n<p>Bob meant to relay it as a playful anecdote, writing: \u201cMax and his sons learned a valuable lesson that day. No matter what, the hair always looks great.\u201d But looking back at Weinstein\u2019s career, and the long list of claims that he was explosive and abusive to underlings, it\u2019s hard not to wonder if he didn\u2019t have a different takeaway.</p> \n<p>Weinstein first started to leverage his bold personality into a career while attending school at the Buffalo branch of the State University of New York, where he founded a concert promotion business, Harvey &amp; Corky Presents, with his friend Corky Burger, and quickly made a name for himself by bringing big names like the Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra and Bob Dylan up to Buffalo.</p> \n<p>By 1973 he had dropped out of school, and was running a local theater where he showed three movies for the price of one on Saturday nights, according to Auletta\u2019s New Yorker profile in 2002.</p> \n<p>He and Bob wanted to get into the movie business though, so in 1979 he used the proceeds made from Harvey &amp; Corky Presents to, along with his brother, found Miramax, an independent film distribution and production company named for their parents, Miriam and Max.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t very expensive to do that,\u201d Auletta said. \u201cDistribution was really cheap to do, and they had a good eye and they spotted movies like Sex, Lies and Videotape, which was their first major hit.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other successes followed and in June of 1993, Miramax was bought by The Walt Disney Company for $80m in a deal that allowed the brothers to stay on creatively.

      "bodyText": "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s career in the movie business has risen and fallen as markedly as his famous temper. Long before he faced harassment and assault charges from scores of women he worked with over the years, and before he was the symbolic villain of the #MeToo movement paying top-dollar to fend off rape charges, Weinstein was busy defending himself from something much more ordinarily Hollywood: the notion he was a gigantic jerk. Matt Damon once compared him to a scorpion, saying \u201cit\u2019s his nature\u201d to sting people. Meryl Streep, accepting an award for best actress in 2012, thanked, \u201cGod, Harvey Weinstein, the punisher, Old Testament, I guess.\u201d Streep\u2019s metaphor was apt. At the time he was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood as co-founder of Miramax and the Weinstein Company, and as producer of some of the previous decade\u2019s top movies. He was a kingmaker helping to shape the careers of top directors like Quentin Tarantino and A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow. He could make careers, and he could break them. But Pulitzer prize-winning reporting from the New York Times and the New Yorker that exposed decades of sexual harassment and assault allegations against him, and culminated this year in a criminal trial in New York, saw Weinstein become a virtual untouchable \u2013 toxic to most of those who formerly feted him with a surname that has become a byword for abuse, not Oscars. Weinstein is unlikely to ever return to the top. That\u2019s according even to people whose job it is to redeem the reputation of the seemingly irredeemable. \u201cHis reputation will never recover,\u201d said Shannon Wilkinson, a New York-based reputation management consultant. Ken Auletta, an early profiler of Weinstein now at work on a biography of the mogul that is due out in 2021, agreed. \u201cWho\u2019s going to want to act in a Harvey movie? What studio is going to recruit him?\u201d The early years Weinstein grew up in Queens and from a young age his father Max would take him and his brother Bob to the movies every Saturday. They went to see foreign films, dramas, everything \u2013 and though his father would sometimes fall asleep, the boys relished the outings and promptly became cinephiles. Weinstein took readily to the role of movie historian, incorporating things he learned in his weekend movie sojourns to what he was learning in school. An old classmate, Jeff Malek told the Hollywood Reporter that Weinstein \u201cknew the entire cast of every movie\u201d and that when he tested him with questions about The Wizard of Oz, Weinstein \u201cproceeded to list the cast and crew, including gaffers, wardrobe, etc, by memory\u201d. Not everything the Weinsteins learned at home was so helpful. In a 2011 tribute piece to his dad, Bob Weinstein recalled how once after his mom received an unflattering haircut at the beauty salon, she demanded her husband seek revenge. \u201c\u2018Have the hairstylist fired and sue the beauty parlor for everything they\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d Bob recalled his mother saying in the piece he penned in Vanity Fair. Bob meant to relay it as a playful anecdote, writing: \u201cMax and his sons learned a valuable lesson that day. No matter what, the hair always looks great.\u201d But looking back at Weinstein\u2019s career, and the long list of claims that he was explosive and abusive to underlings, it\u2019s hard not to wonder if he didn\u2019t have a different takeaway. Weinstein first started to leverage his bold personality into a career while attending school at the Buffalo branch of the State University of New York, where he founded a concert promotion business, Harvey &amp; Corky Presents, with his friend Corky Burger, and quickly made a name for himself by bringing big names like the Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra and Bob Dylan up to Buffalo. By 1973 he had dropped out of school, and was running a local theater where he showed three movies for the price of one on Saturday nights, according to Auletta\u2019s New Yorker profile in 2002. He and Bob wanted to get into the movie business though, so in 1979 he used the proceeds made from Harvey &amp; Corky Presents to, along with his brother, found Miramax, an independent film distribution and production company named for their parents, Miriam and Max. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very expensive to do that,\u201d Auletta said. \u201cDistribution was really cheap to do, and they had a good eye and they spotted movies like Sex, Lies and Videotape, which was their first major hit.\u201d Other successes followed and in June of 1993, Miramax was bought by The Walt Disney Company for $80m in a deal that allowed the brothers to stay on creatively. Director Quentin Tarantino\u2019s cult classic movie Pulp Fiction, which was backed by Miramax, came out a year later and was awarded the Palme d\u2019Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1997, The English Patient landed Miramax its first Academy Award for best picture. And in 1999, Shakespeare in Love won seven Oscars, including a best actress award for Gwyneth Paltrow. The setback But even in his heyday, Weinstein was developing a reputation as difficult to work with, even against the high bar of Hollywood where dictatorial directors and arrogant studio heads are the norm. After a string of successes, he hit a rough patch in 2005. Disney divorced the Weinstein brothers that year following disputes about budget and creative control. The brothers launched their own independent studio, the Weinstein Company, the same year. But they struggled initially to repeat earlier successes. Films released in the first few years included a number of duds, and rumors about his temper were starting to catch up with him in the insular circles in which he moved. As early as the 1990s, the New York Times was reporting settlements he had made with various women \u2013 among them Rose McGowan in 1997 and numerous assistants. \u201cIt\u2019s a recurring theme with him,\u201d said Auletta, who wrote the groundbreaking New Yorker profile of Weinstein in 2002 highlighting his abusive behavior and hinting at his sexual misconduct, though Auletta was not able to confirm it with women going on the record at the time. \u201cHe apologizes and says, I want to change,\u201d Auletta continued. \u201cHe\u2019s done that all through his adult life. But in my experience, he hasn\u2019t changed. He couldn\u2019t control his temper.\u201d The comeback and the fall But by 2011, Weinstein was back on top again, as changing audience tastes caught up with his aesthetic. That year The King\u2019s Speech was nominated for a dozen Oscars and awarded best picture. The following year he racked up a pile of Golden Globe awards for films including My Week with Marilyn, Iron Lady, and The Artist \u2013 an ode to the golden era of silent films which would go on to win best picture at the Academy Awards. A spate of glowing profiles portrayed Weinstein as the quintessential \u201ccomeback kid\u201d of Hollywood, including one by the New York Times media writer David Carr entitled A Mistake to Write Off the Weinsteins. Another piece in Gawker described him as rising from the grave to \u201cfeast on the bones of his enemies\u201d. Weinstein was back near the height of his powers when he heard that reporters were snooping around allegations of rape and sexual assault that had long been simmering. In response he used the full breadth of his connections, money and ruthless self-interest, to try to quash them. He hired lawyers, private investigators and even an intelligence firm founded by ex-Israeli spies called Black Cube, which counter-investigated the reporters who were investigating him. He also leaned on longstanding relationships at NBC News and tapped relationships at other media outlets, including David Pecker, the now notorious head of the National Enquirer who also kept secrets and killed stories for Donald Trump. But Weinstein couldn\u2019t hold back the tide. In the fall of 2017, the New York Times and the New Yorker published stories documenting years of alleged abuse and kicking off what would become the #MeToo movement, a worldwide reckoning around sexual harassment and assault by powerful men in countless industries. Weinstein ended up in court, a powerful symbol for women worldwide of powerful men abusing their position for sex. Civil attorney Ari Wilkenfeld, a partner at the DC-based firm Wilkenfeld, Herendeen &amp; Atkinson, who specializes in discrimination, said Weinstein\u2019s trial has triggered important changes. For one thing, Wilkenfeld \u2013 who has represented female clients in a number of high-profile #MeToo cases, including Brooke Nevils when she accused Matt Lauer of rape and Linda Vester when she accused Tom Brokaw of sexual harassment \u2013 has seen a renaissance in people caring about sexual harassment law. \u201cWe\u2019re finally getting somewhere,\u201d he said. He also noted the Weinstein trial has been important in highlighting the defense\u2019s line of argument that if women had really been raped or assaulted they wouldn\u2019t continue to have any kind of relationship with their abuser. Wilkenfeld said that\u2019s not the case. \u201cPeople behave in ways that seem antithetical to members of the jury. They might delay in reporting; they might deny that the rape occurred. They might have a romantic relationship with the person after the assault or rape; they might do any number of things that, to an ordinary person, don\u2019t make sense. And the challenge is to explain the psychology of what a victim and survivor goes through and how there\u2019s no straight line and no one way a person reacts,\u201d he said. Similar legal defenses were mounted on behalf of rapist college football coach Jerry Sandusky, Wilkenfeld noted, and the prosecution was ultimately able to overcome predictable skepticism.

      "body": "<p>When James Burke, the New York judge presiding over the sexual assault case against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/16/harvey-weinstein-trial-metoo-referendum-judge\">spoke to potential jurors</a> about the upcoming trial he tried to make one thing clear.</p> <p>\u201cThis trial is not a referendum on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo movement</a>,\u201d he told them \u201cIt is not a referendum on sexual harassment. It is not a referendum on women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p> <p>But the way the case unfolded says differently.</p> <p>No matter what Burke told the jurors, Weinstein, 67, is seen as a symbol of the at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/23/us/metoo-replacements.html\">201 men</a> who have been stripped of their power and influence after allegations of sexual assault and harassment that have poured out since 2017. Even though the #MeToo movement was rarely referenced in court, the issues it raised were front and center of Weinstein\u2019s trial.</p> <p>The Weinstein trial put before a jury the two polarized sides that have emerged from the #MeToo movement. One hopes to prove that women could be sexually assaulted regardless of what they consider extenuating circumstances, such as carrying out and developing relationships with an alleged perpetrator.</p> <p>The other argues such interactions only show the sex was consensual \u2013 it was the women\u2019s choice to interact with Weinstein. They did not have to go up to the hotel rooms. The women are going after Weinstein today because they want his money or they regret the relationships they had with him.</p> <p>\u201cWe have created a society of celebrity victimhood status,\u201d said Donna Rotunno, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/09/donna-rotunno-lawyer-leading-harvey-weinsteins-defense\">Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney </a>and known <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/nyregion/weinstein-woman-metoo.html\">critic</a> of the #MeToo movement, in an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/podcasts/the-daily/weinstein-trial.html?showTranscript=1\">interview</a> with the New York Times. \u201cWe have created a society where women don\u2019t have to take any responsibility for their actions. And we have created a society where if we say believe all women, that means we\u2019re not supposed to question anyone at all.\u201d</p> <p>Weinstein\u2019s trial focused on the accusations of three women on five counts \u2013 two of rape, one of forcible sexual assault and two of predatory sexual assault. Weinstein has denied all charges. The judge allowed three other women to testify as \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses to the predatory sexual assault counts, which means the perpetrator assaulted more than one woman.</p> <p>But the powerful stories told by witnesses in the courtroom acted as a counter-balance to Rotunno\u2019s point of view. From its origins, the #MeToo movement has always been about power and those who use it to commit sexual violence. While there have been other trials after the #MeToo movement emerged, such as the trial of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/25/bill-cosby-sentence-sexual-assault-judge\">actor Bill Cosby</a>, gymnastic coach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/30/usa-gymnastics-settlement-larry-nassar-survivors\">Larry Nasser</a> and the high-profile hearing of US supreme court justice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/27/with-his-fiery-testimony-kavanaugh-appears-more-trump-like-than-ever\">Brett Kavanaugh</a>, Weinstein\u2019s trial brought to court #MeToo in its purest form.</p> <p>Through their line of questioning, the prosecution encouraged the women to explain why they developed relationships with Weinstein despite having no romantic or sexual feelings toward him. The women painted a picture of how Weinstein promised opportunities to read scripts that could lead to big movie roles or the chance to help him produce his work behind the scenes.</p> <p>One of the two main witnesses, who the Guardian is not naming because she has not indicated publicly whether she is happy to be identified, said she believed meeting Weinstein was so advantageous to her career that it was actually a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/31/harvey-weinstein-trial-sexual-assault-witness-testimony\">message from God</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI had given up a lot to be in Hollywood,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought God was blessing me for having met him and committing myself to my dream. I thought it was a blessing.\u201d</p> <p>The jurors witnessed dramatic recollections of what trusting a powerful man like Weinstein led to. Annabella Sciorra, an actor who testified on behalf of one of the predatory sexual charges, demonstrated how Weinstein <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/23/sopranos-actor-annabella-sciorra-re-enacts-alleged-rape-weinstein-trial\">pinned her hands above her head</a> when he raped her after he barged through her apartment in the early 90s.</p> <p>Miriam Haley, a former production assistant on Project Runway, broke down in tears when she described how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/27/harvey-weinstein-trial-mimi-haleyi\">Weinstein pushed her down on to a bed</a>, took out her tampon and performed oral sex on her, despite her protests.</p> <p>Though they never mentioned the #MeToo movement by name, Weinstein\u2019s defense team took on a strategy of flipping the narrative of #MeToo on its head. His lawyers emphasized to the jury that the former producer does not deny any sexual interactions with the accusers happened, rather they were consensual engagements. It is not Weinstein who influenced the women who accuse him of abuse, they argued, rather the women wrongly manipulated Weinstein because of the power he held to further their careers. Any sexual interaction was consensual, even if transactional.</p> <p>As evidence, Weinstein\u2019s team brought forth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/04/harvey-weinstein-trial-accuser-cross-examination\">multiple emails</a> from each of the two main witnesses that showed they kept in touch with Weinstein after their alleged incidents and had agreed to meet him again. Haley, one of the key witnesses, continued to email Weinstein about potential job opportunities in the years after he allegedly assaulted her in 2006.</p> <p>The second key witness ended up in a complex relationship with the former producer for years after he allegedly raped her in 2013, saying Weinstein had a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/31/harvey-weinstein-trial-sexual-assault-witness-testimony\">Jekyll and Hyde</a>\u201d personality.</p> <p>\u201cHe could be the most charming, informative person, he could lift you up to anyone he introduced you, behind closed doors it would be dependent on if I gave him what he wanted,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The witness would take him up on invitations to exclusive parties around awards season.

      "bodyText": "When James Burke, the New York judge presiding over the sexual assault case against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, spoke to potential jurors about the upcoming trial he tried to make one thing clear. \u201cThis trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement,\u201d he told them \u201cIt is not a referendum on sexual harassment. It is not a referendum on women\u2019s rights.\u201d But the way the case unfolded says differently. No matter what Burke told the jurors, Weinstein, 67, is seen as a symbol of the at least 201 men who have been stripped of their power and influence after allegations of sexual assault and harassment that have poured out since 2017. Even though the #MeToo movement was rarely referenced in court, the issues it raised were front and center of Weinstein\u2019s trial. The Weinstein trial put before a jury the two polarized sides that have emerged from the #MeToo movement. One hopes to prove that women could be sexually assaulted regardless of what they consider extenuating circumstances, such as carrying out and developing relationships with an alleged perpetrator. The other argues such interactions only show the sex was consensual \u2013 it was the women\u2019s choice to interact with Weinstein. They did not have to go up to the hotel rooms. The women are going after Weinstein today because they want his money or they regret the relationships they had with him. \u201cWe have created a society of celebrity victimhood status,\u201d said Donna Rotunno, Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney and known critic of the #MeToo movement, in an interview with the New York Times. \u201cWe have created a society where women don\u2019t have to take any responsibility for their actions. And we have created a society where if we say believe all women, that means we\u2019re not supposed to question anyone at all.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s trial focused on the accusations of three women on five counts \u2013 two of rape, one of forcible sexual assault and two of predatory sexual assault. Weinstein has denied all charges. The judge allowed three other women to testify as \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses to the predatory sexual assault counts, which means the perpetrator assaulted more than one woman. But the powerful stories told by witnesses in the courtroom acted as a counter-balance to Rotunno\u2019s point of view. From its origins, the #MeToo movement has always been about power and those who use it to commit sexual violence. While there have been other trials after the #MeToo movement emerged, such as the trial of actor Bill Cosby, gymnastic coach Larry Nasser and the high-profile hearing of US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh, Weinstein\u2019s trial brought to court #MeToo in its purest form. Through their line of questioning, the prosecution encouraged the women to explain why they developed relationships with Weinstein despite having no romantic or sexual feelings toward him. The women painted a picture of how Weinstein promised opportunities to read scripts that could lead to big movie roles or the chance to help him produce his work behind the scenes. One of the two main witnesses, who the Guardian is not naming because she has not indicated publicly whether she is happy to be identified, said she believed meeting Weinstein was so advantageous to her career that it was actually a message from God. \u201cI had given up a lot to be in Hollywood,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought God was blessing me for having met him and committing myself to my dream. I thought it was a blessing.\u201d The jurors witnessed dramatic recollections of what trusting a powerful man like Weinstein led to. Annabella Sciorra, an actor who testified on behalf of one of the predatory sexual charges, demonstrated how Weinstein pinned her hands above her head when he raped her after he barged through her apartment in the early 90s. Miriam Haley, a former production assistant on Project Runway, broke down in tears when she described how Weinstein pushed her down on to a bed, took out her tampon and performed oral sex on her, despite her protests. Though they never mentioned the #MeToo movement by name, Weinstein\u2019s defense team took on a strategy of flipping the narrative of #MeToo on its head. His lawyers emphasized to the jury that the former producer does not deny any sexual interactions with the accusers happened, rather they were consensual engagements. It is not Weinstein who influenced the women who accuse him of abuse, they argued, rather the women wrongly manipulated Weinstein because of the power he held to further their careers. Any sexual interaction was consensual, even if transactional. As evidence, Weinstein\u2019s team brought forth multiple emails from each of the two main witnesses that showed they kept in touch with Weinstein after their alleged incidents and had agreed to meet him again. Haley, one of the key witnesses, continued to email Weinstein about potential job opportunities in the years after he allegedly assaulted her in 2006. The second key witness ended up in a complex relationship with the former producer for years after he allegedly raped her in 2013, saying Weinstein had a \u201cJekyll and Hyde\u201d personality. \u201cHe could be the most charming, informative person, he could lift you up to anyone he introduced you, behind closed doors it would be dependent on if I gave him what he wanted,\u201d she said. The witness would take him up on invitations to exclusive parties around awards season. After visiting Weinstein in his hotel room in 2016, the accuser sent him an email that said, \u201cThanks for everything. I feel so fabulous and beautiful.\u201d She said during cross examination that the email was likely triggered by Weinstein saying something nice to her. Sexual assault cases are notoriously difficult to prosecute because of the complex dynamics that can exist in a relationship between abusers and victims. Members of a jury may be reluctant to prosecute a person if they doubt the honesty of their victim. There are \u201call these kinds of issues that have absolutely nothing to do sexual assault yet continuously rear themselves into the issue because they remain underlying within society\u2019s issues,\u201d said Dalia Racine, a former prosecutor and attorney adviser at Aequitas, a not-for-profit organization that focuses on gender-based violence and human trafficking cases. \u201cThere is some basis in sexism, in traditional roles, that maybe are still steeped within our society.\u201d In attempt to dispel commonly held myths about sexual assault victims, prosecutors representing Weinstein\u2019s accusers brought in to testify Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist who specializes in victims of sexual assault and has testified in more than 200 cases, including the trial of actor Bill Cosby. Ziv showed the jury a powerpoint presentation titled \u201crape myths\u201d and said it is common for victims to not report their assault to the police, to refrain from physically fighting back during their assault and to keep in contact with their abusers after their assault. \u201cIt is common \u2013 it is, in fact, the norm \u2013 to have contact with [the assailant],\u201d Ziv told the jury. \u201cThat contact can range from text messages to email exchanges, to continuing to have a relationship with them or developing a relationship with them.\u201d While Ziv also did not mention the #MeToo movement, her testimony echoed the lesson the movement\u2019s advocates have been trying to preach: how survivors end up in situations that lead to an assault, or how they respond to their assaults, and how that adds up to complex dynamics that do not change the fact the assaults happened.

Some hope it will pave the way for more cases against powerful offenders and encourage victims to come forward in the notoriously difficult arena of sexual assault claims. \u201cThe system, although not perfect, I think is the best option out there.

      "bodyText": "That means \u00a362bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 during today\u2019s session, representing a heavy loss for the first trading day of the week. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow from 8am. -KM European markets have closed for trading, with all major indices having lost 3.5% or more: STOXX 600 fell 3.8% FTSE 100 fell 3.5% Germany\u2019s Dax fell 4% France\u2019s Cac 40 fell 4.1% Spain\u2019s IBEX fell 4.2% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 5.5% It\u2019s a sea of red across global markets. But European stocks are the biggest losers, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB still the worst performer. The Italian index is down more than 5.3% following news that the local death toll due to coronavirus rose to seven this afternoon. More than \u00a363bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 so far today, though we still have about 20 minutes of trading to go. Oil prices have taken another tumble, with Brent crude now down 4.8% or $2.86 per barrel at $55.64. The FTSE 100 continues to lose ground and is now at its lowest level since early October 2019. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, explains that London\u2019s blue chip index is suffering due in part to the slump in oil and mining stocks, which rely on Chinese demand for a good chunk of their growth. He says: For the UK, the FTSE100 has been a particular target for investors and stands down over 5% in the year to date, given its particular exposure to oil and mining as well as the obviously affected areas of tourism and travel. By the same token, and perhaps of some consolation to longer-term investors looking for an entry point, is the reminder that mark downs such as this can be indiscriminate as sentiment deteriorates, and that there will be certain sectors which will be less affected by the outbreak. Even so, the fact that the gold price is hitting multi-year highs is reflective of the current penchant of investors towards havens. Until there is some clarity on whether the virus has been sufficiently contained, the market will likely remain on tenterhooks. This is the biggest slump in European shares since the middle of 2016, according to Reuters. But in what looks like an attempt to avoid panic, the World Health Organisation has issued fresh statements clarifying that they\u2019re still not categorising the coronavirus outbreak as a \u201cpandemic\u201d just yet. According to Reuters news wire, the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said that at the moment we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of the virus and we are not witnessing large-scale deaths. He adds: Using the word pandemic does not fit the facts We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic Shares on Wall Street have plummeted at the opening bell and European markets are also a sea of red, with the Italian market the worst hit, amid reports of rising deaths from the coronavirus in the country. Dow Jones down 848 points, or 2.93%, at 28,143 S&amp;P 500 down 91 points, or 2.75%, at 3,245 Nasdaq down 334 points, or 3.49%, at 9,242 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 262 points, or 3.56%, at 7,140 Germany\u2019s Dax down 544 points, or 4%, at 13,035 France\u2019s CAC down 243 points, or 4%, at 5,786 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 1,407, or 5.68%, at 23,368 Crude oil has also sold off, and is now trading $2.71 a barrel lower at $55.79, a 4.63% drop. The turmoil in financial markets comes as there are reports of more deaths in Italy, which is at the centre of the coronavirus crisis in Europe. A seventh person has died in the country, according to the Ansa news agency. The falls on Wall Street have dragged the MSCI world stock index into negative territory for the year so far. It\u2019s down 2.7% on the day. Wall Street has opened sharply lower \u2013 even worse than expected. The declines come after US indices hit record highs last week. Dow Jones down 988 points, or 3.41%, at 28,004 S&amp;P 500 down 104 points, or 3.14%, at 3232 Nasdaq down 407 points, or 4.25%, at 9169 A quick look at the markets before Wall Street opens. Stocks and oil have tumbled further. FTSE 100 in London down 280 points, or 3.78%, at 7123 Germany\u2019s Dax in Frankfurt down 556 points, or 4.1%, at 13022 France\u2019s CAC 40 in Paris down 248 points, or 4.1%, at 5781 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 1,454 points, or 5.81%, at 23,328 Crude oil has also plunged, by 4.85%, or $2.61 a barrel, to $50.77 a barrel. As the virus spreads in Europe, investors are dumping stocks and rushing into safe-haven assets such as gold (at a seven-year high today). Futures are pointing to sharp declines on Wall Street when it opens for trading in less than half an hour. The Dow Jones is expected to open 800 points lower. Last week, Wall Street\u2019s main indices rose to record highs as optimism spread among investors that the global economy would bounce back from the coronavirus hit. There has been a sixth death from the coronavirus in northern Italy, according to the state broadcaster RAI. Economists at ING have looked at the impact of the virus outbreak on economies in Asia, in a note entitled: \u201cHolidays in hell: slumping tourism will cost Asia $105bn-$115bn in 2020\u201d. Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific, at ING says: The impact of the coronavirus on economies in Asia is potentially huge, as tourism in the region takes a beating... If we assume that tourism to and from China basically grinds to a halt in 2020, and extra- regional tourism also diminishes, then the cost to the region from lost tourism revenues alone is approximately US$105bn-$115bn. The World Health Organization has praised China for the measures it\u2019s taken to stop the coronavirus spreading. Bruce Aylward, the head of a visiting WHO delegation, said the \u201cincredibly difficult measures\u201d probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases in the country. He also said several data sources suggested there is a general downward trend in the number of of infections being reported by China\u2019s National Health Commission, despite some statistical problems. The commission reported 409 new coronavirus cases today, down from 648 the day before. Chinese authorities have begun to unwind some of the transport and travel restrictions that were put in place last month. The virus has killed nearly 2,600 people in mainland China and infected nearly 80,000. However, a spike in cases in Italy and south Korea has caused alarm \u2013 and world stock markets have tumbled as a result. A fifth person infected with the coronavirus has died in Italy. The German business association BDI says several manufacturing sectors are expecting a shortage of supplies from the Far East in coming weeks due to the coronavirus. Affected sectors include engineering, cars, pharmaceuticals and paper. BDI says: The more than 5,000 German companies in China are currently severely restricted in procurement, production and sales. HSBC\u2019s search for a permanent chief executive may have suffered a setback today, after one of the reported candidates pulled out. Jean Pierre Mustier, boss of Italy\u2019s Unicredit, will stay there, Unicredit said. Unicredit said it \u201cnormally never comments on rumours and speculations\u201d \u2013 a rule it will apparently break if the story is strong enough: [T]he Group would like to state that Jean Pierre Mustier confirms he will remain with the bank. UniCredit would also like to remind everyone that it has just launched a new strategic plan, Team 23, and that the whole management team, including Jean Pierre Mustier, is fully focused on its successful execution. HSBC is currently being led by Noel Quinn on an interim basis. He could still get the nod permanently, to carry out his plan to cut 35,000 jobs across the world, including significant cuts in the UK. An interesting point from influential economist Mohamed El-Erian, who serves as chief economic adviser at Allianz, the insurer. Stock markets have been on a tear in recent months even as economic fundamentals have appeared weaker. The coronavirus outbreak could test that divergence \u2013 particularly given central banks\u2019 limited arsenal. Interest rates are still at historically low levels, suggesting that any further support can only be limited relative to the response after the financial crisis a decade ago. A quick Brexit update via the politics live blog: don\u2019t bet on everything being finished by the new year. Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, the French Europe minister, on Monday said that France will not sign up to a bad trade deal with the UK just to meet Boris Johnson\u2019s December 2020 deadline. Johnson has set this deadline by ruling out an extension to the post-Brexit transition. The Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, translates: \u201cJust because Boris Johnson wants an agreement at any cost doesn\u2019t mean we will sign a bad deal for the French, under pressure of blackmail or the timetable.\u201d You can follow today\u2019s Brexit developments with Andrew Sparrow on the politics live blog: Investors are pricing in an increased chance of the European Central Bank cutting interest rates in the coming months. A rate cut would aim to support growth at a time when the coronavirus outbreak adds to risks to the eurozone economy. Reuters reported: Eonia money market futures dated to the ECB\u2019s July 2020 meeting show about 5 basis points [0.05 percentage points] of rate cuts are now priced in, up from 3.5 bps a week ago. That equates to roughly a 50% chance of a 10-bps cut versus 35% last week. It marks a turnaround from the start of 2020, when a stabilisation in data had led to a view that the ECB might be encouraged to start raising rates from next year. The ECB\u2019s next interest rate decision is due on 12 March. Bird of prey update: reader Michael Nelson suggests Christine Lagarde was holding a peregrine falcon, the world\u2019s fastest animal when it dives for prey. The picture was \u201cmaybe a subtle reference to aggressive bird brains needing to be held in check\u201d, he said. The Encyclopedia Britannica suggests that hawks are members of a different genus to falcons \u2013 although the terms are often used interchangeably. And just to complicate matters, the peregrine falcon is sometimes known as the duck hawk. The implications on monetary policy remain unclear. What does the most successful investor in modern history think about the coronavirus outbreak, amid market turmoil? Ignore the headlines. Warren Buffett, known as the sage of Omaha, has made billions of dollars from buying shares in companies and holding them for years \u2013 a strategy that seems remarkably unpopular in light of markets\u2019 response to news. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett said: If you\u2019re buying a business you\u2019re going to own it for 10 years, or 20 years, or 30 years. The real question is has the 10-year or 20-year outlook for American businesses changed in the last 24 hours or 48 hours? You don\u2019t buy or sell your business based on today\u2019s headlines. If it gives you a chance to buy something that you like and you can buy it even cheaper it\u2019s your good luck, basically. Coronavirus fears are pushing European shares on the Stoxx 600 towards their worst day since 2016 \u2013 the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. The falls suggest that investors are starting to price in a direct hit to European economic growth that could hurt company profits. Central banks are already watching carefully. Fitting with that theme, here\u2019s a picture that central bank watchers will see again and again: European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde holding a bird of prey at the meeting of central bankers and finance ministers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Asked about her monetary policy stance in December, Lagarde said she would aim to be a \u201cwise owl\u201d, rather than fitting in the classic dichotomy of hawk (tighter monetary policy to stop inflation)/dove (looser monetary policy to support growth). Nevertheless, the coronavirus outbreak could tip the ECB back towards the dovish end of the scale. (We are hesitating to say it\u2019s a hawk definitively \u2013 please do tag me on Twitter/comment below if you can identify it.) The renewed concerns on the spread of the coronavirus have pushed oil prices back down \u2013 ending a relief rally over the middle of February. The price of futures for Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, have fallen by $2 per barrel to $56.40 \u2013 a steep 3.6% decline. Futures prices for its North American counterpart, West Texas Intermediate, also declined by 3.5%. Warren Patterson, head of commodity strategy at ING, an investment bank, said: Travel restrictions and factory shutdowns caused by Covid-19 are already leading to big problems for oil-producing countries. We believe the virus\u2019 effect on oil demand will shave some 400,000 barrels a day from global consumption growth, taking us to the lowest level in nearly a decade. Another aspect of the flight to safe havens is visible on currency markets, with the demand ascent of the US dollar. Sterling has lost 0.5% against the dollar on Monday. One pound bought $1.2909 at the time of writing. The euro lost 0.26%, trading at 1.082 against the greenback at the time of writing. The relative strength of the US economy, and its distance from the coronavirus outbreak\u2019s epicentre in China, had helped it become a haven for investors (although it fell back slightly on Friday). Smoking kills half of all people who take it up, but Philip Morris International (PMI) wants to be seen as part of the solution even though the company continues to make and market cigarettes around the world. PMI, one of the world\u2019s biggest tobacco companies, drew up plans for a \u00a31bn tobacco transition fund in the UK to be spent by local authorities and Public Health England on persuading smokers to give up cigarettes in favour of alternatives such as its \u201cheat not burn\u201d smokeless tobacco product, IQOS, leaked documents reveal, writes the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley. The documents, obtained by the Guardian and Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches programme, show PMI had discussions with a leading anti-tobacco MP about presenting a smoke-free bill proposing the fund to the House of Commons. If passed, the bill would have ended an advertising and marketing ban on IQOS and e-cigarettes. You can read the full story here: A large dose of scepticism on that fairly positive reading from Germany on the business climate: economists are essentially saying that the worst is yet to come. Better expectations from industry are usually bullish sign, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, but it\u2019s difficult to interpret these data at the moment. As we type, global\u2014and in particular EZ\u2014equities finally have woken up to the fact that what has been very draconian measure in China to curb the spread of the virus\u2014at least from the point of view of the economy\u2014are now spreading to the rest of the world. News over the weekend that several towns in Northern Italy have been effectively shut down \u2013 and air and rail traffic suspended between Italy and Austria \u2013 seems to have been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. In short, financial markets are now starting to price in an increasingly nasty economic shock at the start of 2020. Daniela Ordonez, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics, agreed. The data are positive, but given recent events they illustrate that the economic effects will take longer to really hit home. With the virus now at the gates of Europe, with the the spate of new cases reported in Italy, survey data are very likely to deteriorate rapidly in coming months. A worsening of hard eurozone data is likely to follow since the fragility of global supply chains means even small disruptions in China\u2019s output could still have large repercussions for Europe down the line. For now, we continue to believe that the epidemic will be contained to the first half of 2020, so the German and eurozone industrial recovery will not be derailed but only delayed until the second half of the year. Of course, this outlook could deteriorate rapidly should the virus, now spreading to developed countries, fails to be contained. It\u2019s now a 3.3% fall for the FTSE 100. It is down by 244 points, to 7,158 points. As you can see from the following chart of daily performances over the past year, it\u2019s quite a striking fall. But it also helps to put the fall in context: shares on London\u2019s blue-chip index have only been knocked back to their levels ahead of the general election in December. We mentioned earlier that investors were seeking safe-haven assets. It appears to be a full-on pivot away from riskier assets this morning, with money flowing to bonds. The yield on the UK\u2019s 10-year gilt has fallen by 7 basis points (0.07 percentage points) to hit three-week lows of 0.508%. Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen as more investors look for less risky assets like government debt. The US 10-year Treasury yield has dropped by 8 basis points, and the yield on the longest US government bond, the 30-year, has fallen to a record low. An interesting reading from the Ifo Institute in Germany: its widely followed business climate indicator has actually beaten expectations \u2013 a reminder, perhaps, that the much of the coronavirus\u2019s financial effects so far are down to fear, uncertainty and doubt. The Ifo\u2019s business climate reading came in at 96.1 points, compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for a fall to 95.3. The institute is sticking to its first-quarter growth forecast of 0.2%. Ifo president Clemens Fuest said in a statement: The German economy seems unaffected by developments surrounding the coronavirus. That FTSE 100 selloff has deepened: it\u2019s now down by 2.8%, more than 200 points. Germany\u2019s Dax is down by 3.4%, France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 3.5%, and the FTSE MIB in Italy has dropped by 4%. Here\u2019s a handy heat map from Hargreaves Lansdown showing which stocks have fallen: it\u2019s almost all of them. Some 96 of the FTSE 100 were down at the time of writing. Those tourism stocks are the worst performers, but some of the miners are also in the crosshairs (likely amid expectations of slumping demand) and it\u2019s also worth noting the 5.4% fall from Barclays, which is reportedly searching for a new chief executive. Here\u2019s what the FT said in its report (\u00a3) from this morning: Mr Staley, 63, who has led the bank since December 2015, has told colleagues he expects to leave the group by the end of next year, according to two people briefed on the bank\u2019s plans. He could stand down at the annual meeting in May 2021, they added. A rough timetable for Mr Staley\u2019s departure was in place before Britain\u2019s top financial regulators recently launched an investigation into his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile financier. But one of the people said the probe had \u201cfocused minds\u201d on the bank\u2019s board of directors and injected a sense of urgency into the process. Of those few that eked out a gain, packaging company Bunzl beat expectations on annual profits and announced new acquisitions. Take a look at the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100: it\u2019s companies exposed to European tourism that are most affected. Budget airline Easyjet is the biggest faller, down by 11%. Package holiday provider Tui has lost 9% and British Airways owner IAG has lost 7.8%. And Carnival, the cruise ship operator, has lost another 5%. The company (the only one which is a member of both the S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100 indices) has fallen steeply during 2020 after an outbreak of the virus on its Diamond Princess cruise ship. The flight to safety for investors fearful of the economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak has pushed gold prices to their highest since February 2013. Spot gold prices rose by 2.1% on Monday to hit highs above $1,679 per troy ounce. Investors traditionally buy gold as a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty. Slower growth usually translates to lower interest rates, making the yellow metal more attractive. A quick diversion from coronavirus: a shakeup in the UK\u2019s struggling estate agency sector. Two of Britain\u2019s biggest estate agency groups are in talks over a possible \u00a3470m merger that will bring together well-known brands such as Hamptons International and Your Move and could also mean job losses, writes the Guardian\u2019s Julia Kollewe. In a brief statement to the stock market, Countrywide said that \u201cit is in discussions with LSL Property Services regarding a possible all-share combination\u201d. Countrywide is the UK\u2019s largest listed property services group and owns about 60 high street brands including Hamptons International, Bairstow Eves and Gascoigne-Pees. It has more than 850 branches across the country and employs more than 10,000 people.

Early calculations suggest the outbreak could knock by 0.1 percentage point off global growth this year, Visco said yesterday, according to a report (\u00a3) by Bloomberg at the G20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Riyadh. Here\u2019s more from the report: \u201cI\u2019m already worried now but if we don\u2019t see a material improvement by September, I\u2019d be really worried,\u201d Visco said. \u201cYou need two quarters to realize and understand.\u201d Visco lent weight to his argument by warning there\u2019s a risk of a \u201cmini de-globalization\u201d if pessimism and fears about further supply-chain interruptions leave the economy suffering for a protracted period. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\u201d Renewed fears over the coronavirus outbreak have prompted steep falls on European stock markets \u2013 most notably in Italy, which has suffered the most serious outbreak outside Asia. In Milan the FTSE MIB fell by 3.4% in early trading. The FTSE 100 fell by 1.8% at the time of writing, or 131 points, to about 7,267 points \u2013 a two-month low. The FTSE 250 fell by 1.5%. France\u2019s Cac 40 lost 2.7%, while Germany\u2019s Dax lost 2.5%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of economics, business, the eurozone and international markets. The coronavirus outbreak has gained pace outside of China, and stock markets in Europe are expected to react heavily. The World Health Organisation on Sunday reported 78,811 confirmed cases, but 367 new cases came outside China, a larger proportion than previously. Italy has imposed strict travel conditions, including fines for people leaving certain areas in the north of the country. Health experts have suggested that the pace of the outbreak outside of China is concerning \u2013 although in China some restrictions have been eased. European stock market futures prices indicate that heavy losses are expected at the opening bell as efforts to contain the virus spread. In London the FTSE 100 is likely to fall by 1.3%. The blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 is pegged to fall by 1.8%, as are Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40. That followed heavy falls during Asian trading hours. South Korea has suffered a spike in cases, with the knock-on effect of plunging stocks: the country\u2019s Kospi index slumped by 3.9%. Losses were more contained in China, where the outbreak has already taken its toll. Primark owner AB Foods indicated that its factories have been affected by the outbreak, with reduced capacity at its Ovaltine plant \u2013 baked goods and animal feed have also been affected. It does not expect Primark to be affected in the short term, but warned that could change if there is prolonged disruption. We typically build inventories in advance of Chinese New Year and, as a consequence, are well stocked with cover for several months and do not expect any short-term impact If delays to factory production are prolonged, the risk of supply shortages on some lines later this financial year increases. We are assessing mitigating strategies, including a step up in production from existing suppliers in other regions.

Both the cyclist, Robert Hazeldean, a garden designer, and the pedestrian, Gemma Brushett, who works in finance and also ran yoga retreats, were left unconscious after the rush-hour collision in July 2015.

The churches won funding through the Stronger Communities program, which allocates grants only to organisations that have been formally invited by the local federal MP. The True North church, in Perth\u2019s northern suburbs, was awarded $11,000 in November to upgrade its kitchen. The church sits in the federal division of Moore, held for the Liberals by Ian Goodenough. Goodenough has separate ties to the church, and has posted about attending its Sunday services and his decade-long associations with its pastors. He has previously confirmed that the church\u2019s members had joined the Liberal party and were helping to \u201csupport me and the Liberal party\u201d. Goodenough told the Guardian he did not take part in deliberations about the grant. \u201cAll of the applications received were assessed by an independent committee of community members, at a meeting which I did not attend,\u201d he said. \u201cThe department then formally assesses eligibility and approves grants.\u201d A grant for $5,500 went to the evangelical One church, also in Perth\u2019s outer northern suburbs, for new carpets. One of the church\u2019s founding pastors is Trish Botha, who worked in Goodenough\u2019s office until she left to run as a Senate candidate for the Liberals at last year\u2019s federal election. Members of One church were reportedly told during a Sunday service last year that Botha would represent \u201cthe desires of the church\u201d at \u201cthe highest levels of government\u201d if she were to be elected.

The church is linked to the West Australian senator Matt O\u2019Sullivan, who lists Nations Church Inc on his register of interests. A spokesman said the senator had no knowledge of the grant either being applied for or awarded. He said O\u2019Sullivan did not hold any position or office within the church. \u201cNations church is the Senator\u2019s local church, he attends with his family and makes financial contributions from time to time \u2013 which have been appropriately declared,\u201d the spokesman said. The Guardian approached True North, One church and Nations church for comment, but none responded. The power of evangelical Christian groups in the WA Liberal party has been a matter of growing internal concern in recent years, prompting warnings from the former premier Colin Barnett, state MPs, former party presidents, federal MPs and the former head of the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Deidre Willmott, a Liberal party member. In 2016 the former state Liberal MP Rob Johnson used parliament to accuse elements of the party of having \u201cfallen under the spell of the religious cult Globalheart church\u201d, a reference to a popular Perth evangelical church. The Stronger Communities program has been the subject of much criticism in the wake of the Bridget McKenzie sports rorts affair. The program gives significant power to local MPs to shape where money goes. Only those organisations invited by politicians are eligible, and the MP can also establish the community consultation committee that considers applications. The department is only able to consider applications put forward by MPs and the committees.

But while the overall rate of underemployment remains a major concern, the experience for older workers highlights how the problem has changed and has gone from one mostly applied to younger workers to one that those nearing retirement are dealing with more than ever before. One of the troubling things about writing an economics column is that you become very conscious of the passing of the years. As a rule I try to show data over at least a five-year period to give some context, and now that means going back to 2015 \u2013 a year that feels far closer than that. One of the other troubling aspects is I spend a lot of time looking at data with age categories and the final age category gets ever closer to my own age. The monthly unemployment data, for example, gives a breakdown for seasonally adjusted and trend data for every 10-year age bracket from 15 to 55, where there is just a 55-and-over category. Yes, Generation X, you are about to enter the last category. The passing of years and the examination of economics data also reminds me of how greatly things have changed in my lifetime. When I turned 15, there were nearly three times as many 15- to 24-year-olds working as there were 55- to 64-year-olds. By the time I turn 55 it\u2019s likely there will be more of the latter than the former: The change in the demographics is not just some interesting quirk; it means we need to approach the issues of the economy rather differently than in the past. As the Labor leader Anthony Albanese said in his speech last week on respecting and valuing older Australians: \u201cFor too many Australians over the age of 45, if they become unemployed they will struggle to get another job and instead spiral down towards a pretty lean retirement.\u201d The generation who listened to the Smiths sing \u201cThere is a light that never goes out\u201d are about to discover that the light of employment can go out very quickly. When most of the labour force is under 35, your policies can assume most workers have time on their side, something that is less the case when \u2013 as is now \u2013 40% of those in the labour force are over 45: But while the talk is often of unemployment, underemployment is too often sidelined. Over the past year underemployment has once again drifted up after falling during 2017 and 2018. In January the underemployment rate was 8.5%, and the gap between it and the unemployment rate was the largest recorded: We treat underemployment with too much indifference. It gets nary a mention in the budget papers. The treasury and Reserve Bank will predict unemployment, wages growth and various other economic indicators, but underemployment misses out, and with that absence comes an absence of focus. Underemployment has always been a sharp aspect for the youngest workers because they are more likely to work part-time. But of late it has been a very strong rise in underemployment of older workers: And reflecting the overall change, the underemployment of older workers is moving in an opposite direction to unemployment \u2013 over the past year, the unemployment rate for over-55 workers has remained relatively flat while underemployment rose 1%pt: While all age groups now have a much larger gap between underemployment and unemployment rates than a decade ago, unlike other age groups the gap has broadened considerably for over-55s in the past year: For older workers, the inability to get the hours of work has become a more heightened issue, and one that seems less able to be solved by merely reducing unemployment. In the past, policymakers didn\u2019t worry too much about underemployment because, first, it was not a major issue and, second, it rose and fell with unemployment. Now not only is underemployment a much bigger problem, no longer does it move in line with unemployment. It means we need separate policy to tackle the two issues. All the momentum of the labour market is towards more \u201cflexibility\u201d with a greater emphasis on part-time work. It has seen the hours of part-time workers increase, but the overall percentage of people working full-time decrease. And it means that workers entering the final stage of their employment life are not only having to deal with a higher retirement age than they assumed they would have when they began work, they are now much more likely to be struggling to get as much work as they desire. The old days of unemployment only being an issue for young workers and not something we need to worry about is now long past, and with this change not only comes the need for different policies, but also a greater focus. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "Australian primary school students have registered slow but statistically significant improvement in Naplan test scores over a decade, with the best gains made by Indigenous children and those with a language background other than English. The results, to be released by the Australian curriculum assessment and reporting authority on Tuesday, show that since the national tests were introduced in 2008 average scores have gone up \u201csignificantly\u201d in year 5 numeracy, years 3 and 5 reading and spelling, and year 3 grammar. The authority\u2019s chief executive, David de Carvalho, said it was \u201cnot the case, as some claim, that Naplan results show no improvement since the test was introduced\u201d. \u201cIt is more complex than that.\u201d But despite the improvement since tests began there were no statistically significant increases in average scores or the proportion of students above national minimum standards in any core competency in the past year. Students in years 7 and 9 registered no improvement in reading since 2008 but there was an improvement in the proportion of year 9s above the national minimum standard in numeracy. Since 2008 Indigenous students have improved in reading (years 3, 5 and 7), spelling (years 3 and 5), grammar and punctuation (years 3 and 7), numeracy (years 5 and 9), and writing (year 3). In the past year, Indigenous students also improved in years 3 and 9 writing. De Carvalho said the cumulative gains made by Indigenous students since 2008 \u2013 at almost twice the rate of improvement for the general population \u2013 are \u201cespecially pleasing\u201d. Since 2008 there have also been significant cumulative gains in some domains and year levels for students with language background other than English, including reading (years 3, 5 and 7), grammar and punctuation (years 3 and 7), spelling (years 3 and 5), and numeracy (year 5). When analysed by gender, females have improved in reading (years 3 and 5), spelling (year 5), grammar and punctuation (year 3), and numeracy (year 5) since 2008. Males improved in those areas and year 3 spelling. The shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, accused the Coalition of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d to improve education results, citing low marks for university students to get into teaching degrees and \u201cschools \u2026 starved of the support they need\u201d. The education minister, Dan Tehan, said the government \u201ccontinues to back Naplan because our community deserves to know how our students and schools are performing\u201d. He said the results shows the need for more work on the fundamentals of literacy and numeracy, pointing to government reforms including a review of the curriculum, making phonics mandatory for teachers and setting up a national evidence institute on best teaching practice. The Naplan testing regime has been criticised by the Australian Education Union and several state and territory education ministers, who initiated a review in 2018 after complaints it encouraged teachers to \u201cteach to the test\u201d. The botched rollout of online testing in 2019 added to concerns, with Western Australia suggesting it may refuse to shift to online. In November the interim report of the Naplan review identified deficiencies including that questions were either too easy or too difficult to give meaningful data, the stakes were too high and that the test had the potential to narrow the curriculum to expected test content. The final report is due by June. In December, state and territory education ministers agreed that the focus of Naplan reporting would move from school averages to reporting on the gains made by students at the school. The head of the New South Wales education department, Mark Scott, has suggested Naplan testing would be made \u201cobsolete\u201d with the shift to smaller, more individualised testing regimes, as proposed by the second Gonski review.",

      "bodyText": "As cases of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus rise outside of China health experts in Australia argue a global coronavirus pandemic \u201cis very likely, if not inevitable\u201d. Some say the world is already in the early stages of a pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as a disease spreading across two continents. Clusters of Covid-19 \u2013 the illness caused by the novel coronavirus (officially known as Sars-CoV-2) \u2013 are emerging all over the world, with some showing no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started and how they have spread. Globally, there have been 78,973 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 2,466 deaths. The vast majority of infections and deaths have been in mainland China, centred around central Hubei province. How does a country like Australia, geographically remote and with a limited number of mild cases \u2013 all of which have been traced back to their origin \u2013 counter a pandemic? Early stages: health screenings and travel bans Under the Australian government\u2019s Emergency Response Plan for Covid-19, the \u201cinitial action\u201d response when cases are first identified in Australia is focused on \u201cminimising transmission\u201d and \u201cmanaging initial cases\u201d. It involves border measures such as health screenings at airports and ports, escalating to travel bans, which are currently in place for travellers from mainland China. Confirmed cases are tracked backwards to find points of infection, and potential contacts \u2013 such as fellow passengers on flights \u2013 alerted to the potential that they have been exposed to the disease. Those who have been exposed to suspected cases are asked to self-isolate at home. Citizens and permanent residents returning from known hotspots face periods of enforced quarantine. Escalation: surge staffing and \u2018fever clinics\u2019 If, and as, cases escalate, hospitals can be advised to consider bringing in additional \u201csurge staff\u201d and state governments asked to consider establishing \u201cfever clinics\u201d or other alternative models of care \u201cto minimise the burden on the health system\u201d. Places where outbreaks could spread especially rapidly, or could impact upon vulnerable populations \u2013 residential aged care facilities, schools and prisons \u2013 can be given extra support and staff to investigate and manage outbreaks. Australia\u2019s Covid-19 plan draws from the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, which contemplates a novel coronavirus from which the Australian population would have little immunity. \u201cCurrently, there are no effective anti-virals available and there is no vaccine. Availability of a customised novel coronavirus vaccine would be the greatest tool in reducing the impact. It is still not known if or when this might be available,\u201d the emergency response plan reads, noting that there is still no vaccine available for the other major coronaviruses Sars and Mers. Increasing \u2018social distancing\u2019 measures Government-directed social distancing measures may increase from reactively \u2013 or, if necessary, preemptively \u2013 closing schools if it appears children are particularly susceptible; encouraging, or potentially mandating, workplace closures and working from home; and cancelling large public events. And Australia will also attempt to insulate itself from any growing pandemic with increasing travel advisories for countries that are experiencing significant outbreaks. Already, the Department of Foreign Affairs has raised the travel advisory for China to the highest level: \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d, and told its citizens already in the country they should leave the country as soon as they are able. On Monday, the Australian government raised its travel advice for both South Korea and Japan. \u201cBased on advice from Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, we now recommend you \u2018exercise a high degree of caution\u2019... due to a heightened risk of sustained local transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19),\u201d Dfat said of both countries. What individuals can do Risk communication experts Jody Lanard and Peter Sandman have argued that with the rise in cases globally, \u201cit\u2019s a good time to think about how to use the \u2018P-word\u2019 (pandemic) in talking about Covid-19\u201d. \u201cThe most crucial (and overdue) risk communication task for the next few days is to help people visualise their communities when \u2018keeping it out\u2019 \u2013 containment \u2013 is no longer relevant. The P word is a good way to launch this message.\u201d Lanard and Sandman say there are measures individuals can take to prepare for and deal with a potential global outbreak. They advise people with medical conditions to \u201cget ahead\u201d on prescriptions if possible \u201cin case of very predictable supply chain disruptions, and so they won\u2019t have to go out to the pharmacy at a time when there may be long lines of sick people\u201d. Lanard and Sandman also recommend people slowly starting to stock up on non-perishable food \u201cto last their households through several weeks of social distancing at home during an intense wave of transmission in their community\u201d. \u201cAnd the example we like the best, because it gives every single person an immediate action that they can take over and over: right now, today, start practicing not touching your face when you are out and about! \u201cYou probably won\u2019t be able to do it perfectly, but you can greatly reduce the frequency of potential self-inoculation.

      "bodyText": "A clear and growing majority of Coalition voters support the Morrison government adopting a net zero target for 2050, with support for that proposition climbing 12 points in a month, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest fortnightly survey shows a majority of Australian voters support net zero either strongly or somewhat (75%, up four points in a month), and 68% of Coalition voters in the sample hold that positive view. Last month, the proportion of supportive Coalition voters was 56%. The decisive shift in positive sentiment from Coalition voters follows calls from within the government to consider the 2050 target, and Labor\u2019s decision late last week to sign on to net zero \u2013 confirmation that has reignited the climate wars in Canberra. While the Morrison government is leaving its options open on a 2050 target, its current messaging is suggestive of substituting a technology roadmap for a target. The debate about net zero dominated parliament on Monday. The Coalition is blasting Labor for adopting the target in the absence of a fleshed-out plan to get there, while Labor and the Sydney independent MP Zali Steggall are pressuring the government to detail the impact of failing to act to prevent dangerous global heating. More than 70 countries and 398 cities say they have adopted a net zero position. Every Australian state has signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are expressed either as targets or aspirational goals. Net zero is also supported by large companies and by their lobby group, the Business Council of Australia. Given the resumption of partisan brawling about climate policy and tensions within both of the major parties about the future of coal, voters in the Guardian Essential survey were asked a number of questions about their attitudes to a transition to low emissions. A majority of voters in the survey (75%) believe improvements in renewable energy means it will become less necessary to burn coal for electricity, and 65% say both advances in technology and global agreements on emissions reduction will result in coal becoming uneconomical to extract in the future. A majority (64%) says if Australia is serious about climate action, we will need to get out of coal as soon as possible. All of those propositions attract majority support amongst Coalition voters (70%, 60%, 54%). But a majority in the sample (61%, and 72% of Coalition voters) also say Australia should continue to export coal for steel production, even if we stop exporting coal for use in power plants. The survey also points to divided sentiment between the city and regional areas. For example, city dwellers are more likely to agree with a statement that if Australia is serious about the climate emergency we need to exit coal (67%) than people in the regions (56%). Voters were also asked about the future of coal-fired power plants, given the Morrison government has allocated $4m for a feasibility study examining a new facility at Collinsville. Also in prospect is taxpayer underwriting of coal \u2013 a development championed by Nationals but criticised by some moderate Liberals. Just under half the sample (47%) say coal plants should continue to operate as long as they are profitable, but the industry should not be subsidised or expanded. Coalition voters are more comfortable than other voting cohorts with subsidies. Greens voters are the most supportive of moves to shut down the coal industry (62%) with that position endorsed by 36% of Labor voters and 21% of Coalition voters in the sample. As well as the climate questions, voters were asked about the coronavirus, with experts saying the world is fast approaching a tipping point in the spread of the illness. Just under one-third of survey respondents have changed their behaviour in some way to try to avoid contracting the virus \u2013 either avoiding restaurants and shopping centres, or cancelling an overseas trip. While 70% of people in the survey say their personal behaviour has been business as usual, four out of five respondents agree that because of global movements in people, humanity is more vulnerable to the spread of viruses (81%). There is also strong support (80%) for the travel ban that prevents Chinese visitors entering Australia, and only 20% say the border with China should remain open to protect revenue from tourism and overseas students. Both the Morrison government and the media get the thumbs up from the sample for managing the risks and reporting the latest developments. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory last May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%. The sample size this fortnight is 1,090 respondents.",

Research published in a special edition of Nature Climate Change focused on the bushfire crisis finds that 21% of the total area covered by Australian forests \u2013 excluding Tasmania - has burnt so far in the 2019-20 bushfire season. The analysis examined the area of forest burnt on each continent as a proportion of total forest cover in every fire season for the past 20 years. The 21% figure contrasts dramatically with the proportion of forest burnt in any season on any other continent in that timeframe, which for most continents and forest types was 4-5%. The one exception was for tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests in Asia and Africa, for which the analysis found medians of 8\u20139% had been recorded in that 20-year period. The paper adds that the 21% is likely to be an underestimate because the data has not included fires in Tasmania and Australia\u2019s fire season is still going. \u201cThe data point for this year\u2019s fires show it stands out completely from all other years for Australia or other countries,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Matthias Boer, said. \u201cThere is just nothing like it out there and we felt confident to call it unprecedented. \u201cThe word unprecedented has been used a lot the last two months.

For regions that rely on the tourism and hospitality industries, the aftermath of the bushfires has been catastrophic, but now they\u2019re ready for visitors to return. Adelaide Hills Spooning the long narrow plain on which the city is built, the Adelaide Hills have long been a popular getaway for residents. Early settlers escaped the heat of the city at lavish summer estates or worked the land from humble stone cottages. Today those historic buildings are integrated into growing suburbs surrounded by a charming patchwork of orchards, vineyards and mixed farmland that supplies a thriving community of artisanal food producers. Many of them were severely impacted by the bushfires. When the smoke cleared, the farmhouse where David Bowley\u2019s family lived was gone, along with this year\u2019s entire crop; 90% of his vines will need to be replanted and won\u2019t produce a viable crop for four to five years. On top of that, he returned to bills from contractors who had been working on the vineyard right up until the day of the fires. Fortunately most of his stock was stored at Vinteloper\u2019s shared cellar door. It took a few weeks for customers to return, but when they did they came with offers of support and left with newly purchased bottles. \u201cThe wine that\u2019s been sold allows us to sleep at night and know that we can pay our employees and pay our suppliers,\u201d Bowley says. And the emotional support encouraged him to think about the long rebuild. All but a few businesses in the region are open again, but the impact will be felt for years to come. It\u2019s why Bowley implores tourists to continue visiting after the news cycle moves on, and to spread the love across the region: \u201cIt\u2019s important that people support not only us but also other Adelaide Hills wineries or cherry growers or apple growers, because we\u2019re not in this alone. Everyone\u2019s hurting.\u201d Kangaroo Island \u201cThere\u2019s not one business or family who is not directly affected by the fires,\u201d Kylie Bamfield says. And yet when I meet the executive officer of the Kangaroo Island Tourism, Food, Wine and Beverage Association by the ferry terminal in Penneshaw, it looks much as it always has. It takes about an hour of driving to see evidence of the fires. Then it\u2019s everywhere. Defence force trucks drive past melted road signs. Trees on either side of the highway are reduced to charred stumps; 96% of Flinders Chase national park and the adjacent Ravin des Casoars wilderness protection area have been burnt and the smell of ash lingers. The park won\u2019t open to independent visitors until the end of the year, although the environment and water department\u2019s manager of tourism and visitor services, Chris Thomas, hopes it will be open to commercial tour operators within a month. More than 200,000ha burned, but locals are keen to stress that is less than half the island. The remaining area would still be Australia\u2019s third-largest island, and Thomas says \u201csome of the best visitor experiences are completely unaffected\u201d. Despite suffering no fire damage, visitation at Seal Bay is down 70% on the same time last year. Other attractions are struggling even more. Kangaroo Island Outdoor Action runs activities including sandboarding, kayaking and quad-bike tours, and its owner, Brenton Davis, says business between Christmas and the end of January reduced by 90% compared with last year. Because he relies so heavily on the holiday period (visitor numbers to the island in December 2018 was 29,000, compared with 9,000 in June), even a significant bounce won\u2019t make up for the lost business: \u201cYou can\u2019t fix a missing January with an awesome February so I\u2019m now in a loss position for the whole year.\u201d Ironically, Davis says, it\u2019s an excellent time to visit. Ferry fares have been slashed, accommodation is easy to find and he\u2019s now running quad-bike tours through fire-affected areas. \u201cBecause it\u2019s much more open, you can see much further and notice the contours of the land,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing plants we\u2019ve never seen before and we\u2019re actually seeing more animals than we\u2019ve ever seen because there\u2019s less cover. We just need people to come and visit.\u201d",

David Gauke, the former justice secretary who was expelled from the Conservatives for defying Boris Johnson over Brexit, said that Sunak risked putting the public finances on an unsustainable path, given the headwinds facing the British economy. Acknowledging that spending needed to rise to end a decade of austerity that he helped to instigate as a Treasury minister between 2010 to 2017, Gauke said: \u201cYou have got a new chancellor who will want to establish that he is not a creature of No 10; who is independent.\u201d However, he said that Sunak might raise borrowing at the budget on 11 March. \u201cHe, I would imagine, would want to assert that independence.

The 39-year-old replaced Sajid Javid when the former chancellor dramatically resigned earlier this month after a confrontation with No 10. Javid had been labelled in Westminster circles as \u201cchino\u201d \u2013 chancellor in name only \u2013 while commentators warned that Sunak could become known as \u201cbaby chino\u201d, given his rapid rise to become one of the youngest chancellors in history. Sunak is believed to be under pressure from No 10 to relax public borrowing rules set by Javid before the election that force day-to-day spending to be matched with tax receipts by 2023. Investment spending on long-term infrastructure projects must not exceed 3% of GDP. Gauke, who ran as an independent at the election but lost to the Tories in his former seat of South West Hertfordshire, said the government\u2019s plans to raise spending could result in the UK\u2019s national debt rising as a proportion of GDP. Saying this was a \u201cvery strange position to find ourselves in\u201d, particularly for a Tory government, he added that there were fundamental constraints for the government and risks that debt could be rising as the economy falters.

For <a href=\"https://freespeechunion.org/product/full-member/\" title=\"\">\u00a349.95 a year</a> (\u00a324.95 for retirees and students, though I would pay a sizeable amount of money to observe the day-to-day workings of any student who wants to pay Young to defend them on the internet) Young\u2019s union will protect you if you want to start shit online. \u201cAll members will be defended by the FSU if they are penalised for exercising their legal right to free speech,\u201d the silver-member tier promises. \u201cIf you\u2019re targeted by an outrage mob on social media, we\u2019ll mobilise an army of supporters.\u201d</p> <p>In the opening video, Young paints a vision of an all-nations union of people who are just furious that online discourse demands a degree of empathy these days, saying: \u201cNobody is safe from these witchfinder generals, which is why mavericks and dissenters of all stripes will be welcome in the Free Speech Union.\u201d The protection level offered to you is known as \u201cSword &amp; Shield\u201d, which \u2013 and if you\u2019ll allow me a moment to exercise my free speech by pointing this out \u2013 isn\u2019t a million miles away from the 2018 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostritz\" title=\"\">Shield and Sword</a> far-right festival in Ostritz, Germany, that celebrated Hitler\u2019s birthday. I mean I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a coincidence \u2013 as free speech advocates will point out, lots of things have associations with swords and shields, <a href=\"https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-gb/\" title=\"\">even Pok\u00e9mon</a> \u2013 maybe Toby Young just thinks that Pikachu had some legitimate ideas among the loathsome \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aweOBuH-DCA\" title=\"\">pika, pika</a>\u201d rhetoric. Still, come on, guys. Let\u2019s please not attack Young\u2019s right to coincidence. I just bought Twitter insurance off this man.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My real fear, though, is: what if this isn\u2019t a grift?

In many ways, I do think this is brilliant by Young. He\u2019s taken the sheer trauma of the trial-by-Twitter blockbuster cancellation he suffered in January 2018 and turned it alchemy-like into gold. In arguably one of the biggest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/09/toby-young-resigns-office-for-students\" title=\"\">most crippling Twitter cancels I\u2019ve ever seen</a>, Young took a position on the board of the new Office for Students university regulator and ended up resigning from five of his jobs and stopping all charity work just because some vile trolls went online and found every one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/03/toby-young-quotes-on-breasts-eugenics-and-working-class-people\" title=\"\">hundreds of tweets</a> he\u2019d made about women on Newsnight having breasts and yeah, maybe eugenics isn\u2019t that bad after all. As a result he\u2019s licked his finger and held it to the air and realised there\u2019s a groundswell of sub-100 follower Twitter accounts who are mad they can\u2019t drop the N-word online and still keep their jobs about it, and he\u2019s figured out a way to make them pay him protection money to let them keep doing exactly what they are already and were keep going to do. If you pay \u00a350 a year, Young will wade into your next 12 Twitter fights and reply \u201cwell said\u201d when you defend your right to call your dog an outdatedly racist name. What a stunning, stunning scheme.</p> <p>My real fear, though, is: what if this isn\u2019t a grift? What if \u2026 Young is being serious?

This subversion makes fashion exciting. \u201cYou make your own fashion and style,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cThe Fendi headband was a bit wrong, but it\u2019s also very practical: who doesn\u2019t want to hide the baby hairs growing out of the back of their head?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fears are growing over an increasingly febrile security situation in Haiti after police and soldiers fought a deadly gun battle which lasted for hours outside the country\u2019s presidential palace. The exchange of gunfire on Sunday shattered the opening of Haiti\u2019s annual carnival as police and soldiers exchanged volleys of gunfire sending bystanders diving for cover. One soldier died of his wounds on Monday and at least three police officers were wounded. Shooting continued into the night, and in the immediate aftermath, authorities in the impoverished Caribbean country announced the cancellation of the carnival warning of the risk of a \u201cbloodbath\u201d. The violence broke out when protesting police officers, some in plainclothes and wearing masks, used the opening of the carnival to stage the latest in a series of demonstrations against poor work conditions and demanding to be allowed to unionize. As the protesters were stopped by soldiers near the imposing white building of the presidential palace the two sides began firing at each other. Caraibes, a local radio and television station also came under attack. Some reports suggested that the gun battle began when demonstrating police officers shot into the air. As the exchanges became more serious it appears that fire was directed into the square from a prominent tower nearby. The clash between police and military comes in the middle of a long-running political crisis that has seen intermittent mass protests against the government of Jovenel Mo\u00efse over a corruption scandal and 2017\u2019s contested elections, which the opposition has never accepted. Video footage from the square showed dozens of people trying to take cover behind kerb stones while helmeted police, some of them in body armour, fired pistols and rifles across the city\u2019s Champ de Mars park. The Haitian government issued a statement late on Sunday strongly condemning the violence, calling it an attack against freedom and democracy, noting that it was difficult to assess the scope of the violence. \u201cTerror reigned in certain areas,\u201d the statement said. \u201cStreets were obstructed and there was a warlike situation at the Champ de Mars, where heavy weapons fire was heard almost all day.\u201d A stage built by the ministry of defence and guarded by the army was also set on fire. \u201cNo money for police officers but enough money for carnival,\u201d protesters shouted.

Addressing some of the specific concerns raised, she said: It does not store biometric data. Human officers will always make the decision about whether to intervene. The Met\u2019s technology has been proved not to have an ethnic bias. The force has been open and transparent in its deployment. She said the only people on the facial recognition watchlist were those wanted for serious crimes and the only bias in the technology used by the Met was that it was slightly harder to identify a wanted woman than a wanted man. Dick said trials of the technology had led to the arrests of eight criminals who would probably not have been caught otherwise and that it was not for the Met to decide the boundary between privacy and security.

      "body": "<p>Gerald Corrigan and Marie Bailey were creatures of habit. As usual, on the night of Thursday 18 April 2019, Bailey went to bed early while her partner, Corrigan, a retired photography lecturer, stayed up late surfing the internet and watching satellite television.</p> <p>Shortly after midnight, Corrigan\u2019s television went on the blink and he traipsed outside the couple\u2019s home on the island of Anglesey in north Wales to fiddle with the satellite dish.</p> <p>Whilst he examined the dish in his front garden, Corrigan, 74, felt a searing pain in his body and thought he must have been electrocuted. He staggered back inside. \u201cHe was bleeding heavily,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cHe was crying \u2026 he was shouting he was in pain.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey tried to stem the bleeding by pressing a towel to the wound. Paramedics arrived and he was rushed to hospital. Doctors did all they could for Corrigan but gangrene set in and he died almost a month later of multiple organ failure.</p> <p>It turned out that Corrigan had not been electrocuted but \u2013 extraordinarily \u2013 was fatally injured with a bolt fired by a powerful crossbow.</p> <p>The bolt passed completely through his body, causing terrible internal damage including bruising the heart. After exiting his body, it still had enough force in it to smack into the wall of the house. The crossbow bolt was found by a paramedic and removed by police for forensic examination.</p> <p>It was a crime that shocked Anglesey and initially mystified police. An early thought was that it must have been a freak accident. Could it be, for instance, that Corrigan been hit by a lamper \u2013 a night-time hunter who uses bright lights to target animals?</p> <p>Close examination of the scene ruled this out. A ballistics expert and pathologist concluded the shooter must only have been 10 metres away from Corrigan, probably in the field in front of the house, hidden behind a wall. A hunter could have no reason to be firing towards the house and the more the police dug into Corrigan\u2019s death, the more it looked as if he had been deliberately targeted.</p> <p>There was little in Corrigan\u2019s past that helped. He worked in Lancashire before retiring to Anglesey more than 20 years ago in search of the quiet life. The house he and Bailey shared \u2013 Gof Du \u2013 is near the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/south-stack-cliffs/\">South Stack Cliffs</a> on the north-west coast. Corrigan was drawn there partly because he was a keen amateur naturalist and the remote, rugged spot is rich in bird life.</p> <p>Family and friends saw him as kind and gentle \u2013 not the sort to make enemies. Bailey had multiple sclerosis and as her condition worsened, Corrigan was her main carer.</p> <p>Police began tracing owners of crossbows on Anglesey. A leading supplier, Outdoorhobbies Ltd, provided a list of 17 customers on the island.</p> <p>Among them was a sports therapist and martial arts expert called Terence Whall, who had bought an Excalibur Micro 355 crossbow shortly before Corrigan was killed.</p> <p>Officers went to visit Whall, who lived with partner Emma Roberts and her two children. At first the lead appeared to peter out \u2013 the Excalibur had not arrived until 23 April \u2013 after Corrigan was shot, so could not have been the murder weapon.</p> <p>Whall conceded he had previously owned a crossbow (he said it was to get the children interested in the outdoors) but claimed he had sold it in January or February. His Amazon account suggested this could be a lie \u2013 he had bought crossbow bolts from the online retailer just over a week before Corrigan was shot.</p> <p>The net was closing in. On 3 June, two weeks after police quizzed Whall about crossbows, a Land Rover was set on fire at a disused quarry. It belonged to Whall\u2019s partner, Roberts.</p> <p>Though it had been severely damaged, police were able to access the car\u2019s telematics system \u2013 effectively its black box \u2013 which keeps a detailed record of the vehicle\u2019s movements and even when the doors and boot are opened and closed.</p> <p>On 17 April \u2013 just over 24 hours before the killing \u2013 the Land Rover spent 23 minutes parked on the drive of Gof Du. It was then driven to a nearby sandy beach called Porth Dafarch. The vehicle remained there for about an hour and a half before heading back to Whall\u2019s home.</p> <p>On the night of the killing the Land Rover was back at Porth Dafarch. The boot was opened at about 11.10pm. The police believe this was when the crossbow was being taken out.</p> <p>At 12.42am \u2013 12 or 13 minutes after Corrigan was shot \u2013 the telematics system recorded the boot boot being re-opened. The crossbow was being stored away, police think.</p> <p>Whall was arrested in connection with Corrigan\u2019s death on 25 June. When it became clear that the telematics system was pinning him to the murder scene, he came up with a bizarre story, claiming he went to the beach to have sex with a man. Unfortunately for him, the man denied this and Whall\u2019s story collapsed.</p> <p>Despite his conviction there is still one central puzzle: why was Corrigan killed? Detectives found no firm links between Whall and Corrigan. They could not establish that Whall bore a grudge against the man he targeted.</p> <p>Peter Rouch QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Mold crown court the motive may never be known.

      "bodyText": "Gerald Corrigan and Marie Bailey were creatures of habit. As usual, on the night of Thursday 18 April 2019, Bailey went to bed early while her partner, Corrigan, a retired photography lecturer, stayed up late surfing the internet and watching satellite television. Shortly after midnight, Corrigan\u2019s television went on the blink and he traipsed outside the couple\u2019s home on the island of Anglesey in north Wales to fiddle with the satellite dish. Whilst he examined the dish in his front garden, Corrigan, 74, felt a searing pain in his body and thought he must have been electrocuted. He staggered back inside. \u201cHe was bleeding heavily,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cHe was crying \u2026 he was shouting he was in pain.\u201d Bailey tried to stem the bleeding by pressing a towel to the wound. Paramedics arrived and he was rushed to hospital. Doctors did all they could for Corrigan but gangrene set in and he died almost a month later of multiple organ failure. It turned out that Corrigan had not been electrocuted but \u2013 extraordinarily \u2013 was fatally injured with a bolt fired by a powerful crossbow. The bolt passed completely through his body, causing terrible internal damage including bruising the heart. After exiting his body, it still had enough force in it to smack into the wall of the house. The crossbow bolt was found by a paramedic and removed by police for forensic examination. It was a crime that shocked Anglesey and initially mystified police. An early thought was that it must have been a freak accident. Could it be, for instance, that Corrigan been hit by a lamper \u2013 a night-time hunter who uses bright lights to target animals? Close examination of the scene ruled this out. A ballistics expert and pathologist concluded the shooter must only have been 10 metres away from Corrigan, probably in the field in front of the house, hidden behind a wall. A hunter could have no reason to be firing towards the house and the more the police dug into Corrigan\u2019s death, the more it looked as if he had been deliberately targeted. There was little in Corrigan\u2019s past that helped. He worked in Lancashire before retiring to Anglesey more than 20 years ago in search of the quiet life. The house he and Bailey shared \u2013 Gof Du \u2013 is near the South Stack Cliffs on the north-west coast. Corrigan was drawn there partly because he was a keen amateur naturalist and the remote, rugged spot is rich in bird life. Family and friends saw him as kind and gentle \u2013 not the sort to make enemies. Bailey had multiple sclerosis and as her condition worsened, Corrigan was her main carer. Police began tracing owners of crossbows on Anglesey. A leading supplier, Outdoorhobbies Ltd, provided a list of 17 customers on the island. Among them was a sports therapist and martial arts expert called Terence Whall, who had bought an Excalibur Micro 355 crossbow shortly before Corrigan was killed. Officers went to visit Whall, who lived with partner Emma Roberts and her two children. At first the lead appeared to peter out \u2013 the Excalibur had not arrived until 23 April \u2013 after Corrigan was shot, so could not have been the murder weapon. Whall conceded he had previously owned a crossbow (he said it was to get the children interested in the outdoors) but claimed he had sold it in January or February. His Amazon account suggested this could be a lie \u2013 he had bought crossbow bolts from the online retailer just over a week before Corrigan was shot. The net was closing in. On 3 June, two weeks after police quizzed Whall about crossbows, a Land Rover was set on fire at a disused quarry. It belonged to Whall\u2019s partner, Roberts. Though it had been severely damaged, police were able to access the car\u2019s telematics system \u2013 effectively its black box \u2013 which keeps a detailed record of the vehicle\u2019s movements and even when the doors and boot are opened and closed. On 17 April \u2013 just over 24 hours before the killing \u2013 the Land Rover spent 23 minutes parked on the drive of Gof Du. It was then driven to a nearby sandy beach called Porth Dafarch. The vehicle remained there for about an hour and a half before heading back to Whall\u2019s home. On the night of the killing the Land Rover was back at Porth Dafarch. The boot was opened at about 11.10pm. The police believe this was when the crossbow was being taken out. At 12.42am \u2013 12 or 13 minutes after Corrigan was shot \u2013 the telematics system recorded the boot boot being re-opened. The crossbow was being stored away, police think. Whall was arrested in connection with Corrigan\u2019s death on 25 June. When it became clear that the telematics system was pinning him to the murder scene, he came up with a bizarre story, claiming he went to the beach to have sex with a man. Unfortunately for him, the man denied this and Whall\u2019s story collapsed. Despite his conviction there is still one central puzzle: why was Corrigan killed? Detectives found no firm links between Whall and Corrigan. They could not establish that Whall bore a grudge against the man he targeted. Peter Rouch QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Mold crown court the motive may never be known. But he said Whall\u2019s association with a man called Richard Wyn Lewis \u201cmay be of significance\u201d. Corrigan\u2019s partner alleged in court that the couple had been the victims of a \u00a3250,000 fraud by Lewis. She said they gave money to Lewis for three development projects but they \u201cnever got any benefit at all\u201d. She claimed she had also paid Lewis \u00a37,000 to buy a horse from Ireland \u2013 and again saw no return on that investment. Bailey also said in court that Lewis had grown cannabis plants in their outbuildings two years before the shooting. The plants were allegedly removed after Corrigan found out Lewis was growing more than they thought he was. Rouch told the court that, following the shooting, Whall travelled to Lewis\u2019s home on Anglesey a number of times, sometimes \u201cin the dead of night\u201d. Whall was arrested at Lewis\u2019s house on 31 May following some sort of incident over money, the jury was told. The jury heard Lewis was under investigation over alleged offences of fraud in relation to Corrigan and Bailey. It may be that the full story behind the Anglesey crossbow murder is yet to emerge. After Corrigan\u2019s funeral, Bailey said it was impossible to express her sadness and shock at what had happened. \u201cHe was my best friend and my soulmate,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the time we have been together I have been proud to walk at his side and he stood beside me, always.\u201d Family and police expressed sorrow that a dream of a quiet retirement had been shattered in such a violent way. DCI Brian Kearney of North Wales police, said: \u201cGerald was a decent retired pensioner who ought to have been able to enjoy his retirement in one of the safest parts of the United Kingdom.\u201d",

I bought my piano 20 years ago, when I arrived in the Netherlands. Choosing it was conversational: it spoke to me, or sang for me, and I knew it was the one. However, it is extremely temperamental, and the tuning slips dramatically and frequently as if it is bad-tempered. My tuner refers to it as his \u2018problem child\u2019; he has a relationship with it too. </p> <p>We have tried everything we can think of to stabilise its crankiness: air moisturising machines, no variations in temperature, different temperatures, various kinds of covers \u2013 but no. There are clearly bad days, and bad music, for it. But I love the act of playing it, I love its silvery tone, I love the way my sense of what music is has been shaped by it, and selling it \u2013 proposed once in exasperation by said \u2013 is not an option. So the tuning is frequent, the sighs are frequent, and so are the complaints of my son, who has perfect pitch. My piano is sulky. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/20/it-feels-like-an-extra-limb-musicians-on-the-bond-with-their-instruments#comment-138357551\">NotGlenGould</a></strong></p>",

To state the obvious: it\u2019s a means of expression. It\u2019s easy to have an attachment to something that allows you to enjoy what you do to the fullest. Getting used to new equipment is a bit of a bind \u2013 it can also be fun despite being a bit limiting temporarily. Bluecamels \u2018Choosing my piano was conversational: it spoke to me\u2019 I am an amateur classical pianist, but at a fairly advanced level. I bought my piano 20 years ago, when I arrived in the Netherlands. Choosing it was conversational: it spoke to me, or sang for me, and I knew it was the one. However, it is extremely temperamental, and the tuning slips dramatically and frequently as if it is bad-tempered. My tuner refers to it as his \u2018problem child\u2019; he has a relationship with it too. We have tried everything we can think of to stabilise its crankiness: air moisturising machines, no variations in temperature, different temperatures, various kinds of covers \u2013 but no. There are clearly bad days, and bad music, for it. But I love the act of playing it, I love its silvery tone, I love the way my sense of what music is has been shaped by it, and selling it \u2013 proposed once in exasperation by said \u2013 is not an option. So the tuning is frequent, the sighs are frequent, and so are the complaints of my son, who has perfect pitch. My piano is sulky. NotGlenGould",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000.

It was quarter past 10 and they had to be up early the next morning. Not long after 7.30am they were back, boarding the bus heading north, a four-hour journey ahead. One of the buses, that is. They had a game, but this time it wasn\u2019t theirs. Instead, they were going to San Sebasti\u00e1n, singing songs all the way there, and the whole town was going with them. For once that\u2019s not much of an exaggeration, either: there are 754 people in Becerril de Campos, a tiny, previously unremarkable town in the province of Palencia; on Saturday, 502 of them set off and didn\u2019t come back until after dark, happy as they had ever been.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/european-football-roundup-lazio-hold-off-genoa-to-keep-pace-in-serie-a\">European football roundup: Neymar sent off in PSG win; Lazio hold off Genoa</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It had been the perfect day.

They ate. <em>Well</em>. And they swam in the sea. Some did, anyway. They were invited into pe\u00f1as, supporters\u2019 clubs, and given gifts.

Then they went \u2013 all of them, two-thirds of an entire town \u2013 to watch a football match in the place that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/21/real-sociedad-la-liga\">might just be the best place to do so in the whole of Spain</a> right now.

Becerril, who came up from <em>regional preferente</em> in the summer, are not far off relegation in Group 8. This year for the first time ever, they also played in the Copa del Rey \u2013 new, improved and at last open to almost everyone \u2013 becoming the team from the smallest town ever to appear in the competition. They were beaten 8-0 by Real Sociedad and afterwards, la Real\u2019s president Jokin Aperribay invited them to Anoeta \u2013 the Reale Arena it\u2019s called now now \u2013 to watch a game.</p> \n<p>All of them.</p> \n<p>It took a little while to get sorted, but the promise was for real. Which is why on Saturday morning there were eight buses and a load of cars leaving the town virtually empty. \u201cThere are going to be so few people left that we\u2019ve asked the Guardia Civil to send patrols to watch over the houses,\u201d said the club\u2019s president, Juan Antonio Redondo, \u201cthere\u2019s pretty much only some old folk left behind.\u201d They\u2019d been going on about this excitedly for weeks \u2013 \u201cno one\u2019s talking about anything else; there\u2019s a WhatsApp group, which is basically the whole town,\u201d said the mayor, Fran P\u00e9rez \u2013 while walls there were getting regaled with Real Sociedad stuff, a new team for the town to support. The president\u2019s daughter asked for a Real Sociedad tracksuit for Christmas, and she wasn\u2019t alone. When they departed, some already wore blue and white; by the time they returned, more did.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RealSociedad/status/1231905495373537280\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Para siempre.<br><br>\ud83d\udc99 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cd_becerril?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CD_Becerril</a> \ud83d\udc9c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AurreraReala?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AurreraReala</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZdacM4jWlb\">pic.twitter.com/ZdacM4jWlb</a></p>\u2014 Real Sociedad F\u00fatbol (@RealSociedad) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealSociedad/status/1231905495373537280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>P\u00e9rez had gone ahead the night before, received by the mayor of San Sebasti\u00e1n. Becerril\u2019s staff and directors were invited to the formal pre-match lunch attended by directors of la Real and opponents Valencia, meeting past and present. Fans were welcomed in by Real Sociedad supporters, which they were becoming too. The hosts paid for everything: the buses, the tickets, many of the meals \u2013 58 went to that directors\u2019 lunch, 30 of them free. \u201cReal set no limits but we didn\u2019t want to abuse their generosity,\u201d Redondo explained. The food they ate was \u201clike being at a wedding,\u201d said David Gonz\u00e1lez, the club captain. Kids from Becerril accompanied the team on to the pitch. In the stands, they sang.

Just before half-time it was two, Nacho Monreal scoring; and just after half-time, it was three, Adnan Januzaj completing a hat-trick from former Premier League players with a belting shot. It was done, 40 minutes still to go, time to enjoy it.</p> \n<p>La Real are the youngest side in <em>primera</em>, prone to occasionally drift from games, occasionally vulnerable against the tougher teams, but there may be no one as much fun to watch. And, running track gone, noise raised, there may be no more fun place to go, either. Put the two together and it\u2019s the perfect day. La Real dominated Valencia, firing off 19 shots, \u201churricane real\u201d as one headline put it, Alguacil insisting: \u201cWe did a lot well.\u201d And yet they blow their opponents away without even being at their very best. This is the team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/real-madrid-sociedad-copa-del-rey-match-report\">that battered Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u</a>: skilful and swift, every pass forward, playing like they\u2019re determined not to waste a moment, like they\u2019re enjoying this as much as the rest of us. A lot has been said about Martin \u00d8degaard, and rightly, but Merino has been outstanding too and Alexander Isak has left mouths open lately.</p> \n<p>They all have.</p> \n<p>It was la Real\u2019s sixth consecutive win at home in all competitions\u2013 their best run in 24 years. They have won 10 of their last 13 matches. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re really conscious of the moment we\u2019re living through at the moment,\u201d wrote Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez. His paper, El Diario Vasco, which had joyfully followed their visitors around town, called the Reale Arena a \u201cfootballing paradise\u201d and it was hard for them to disagree. Alguacil was happy, too. \u201cThis is a moment to be enjoyed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe euphoria is normal. The passion for this team belongs to everyone.\u201d </p> \n<p>Everyone in one particular small town in Palencia, especially. The population of Becerril boarded their buses home around nine, promising that next time Real Sociedad could come to their place, although how they\u2019ll accommodate 34,199 members in the Mariano Haro is another matter.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just hope we can be friends for ever,\u201d one fan said. \u201cThis is football, the way it should be,\u201d insisted the vice-president Jos\u00e9 Esteban. \u201cThere are no words to describe the way they treated us, from Aperribay to the very last citizen. They hung on our every need, from arrival and throughout our stay. On the streets people said hello, they cheered us on. It\u2019s been unforgettable,\u201d said the mayor, but now it was time to go. Club Deportivo Becerril had a game the next day.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cd_becerril/status/1231670216377147393\">They won 1-0</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cd_becerril/status/1231670216377147393\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">El Gol\ud83d\udcfd || del encuentro ....<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cd_becerril?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@cd_becerril</a> 1 - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cdlavirgen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@cdlavirgen</a> 0<br>V\u00eda ... <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/becetv?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#becetv</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FaPubwj41O\">pic.twitter.com/FaPubwj41O</a></p>\u2014 CD.Becerril (@cd_becerril) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cd_becerril/status/1231670216377147393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m not going to wash the shirt after Messi hugged me,\u201d Martin Braithwaite grinned after he made his debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/18/leganes-the-unlucky-victims-of-barcelonas-slapdash-recruitment\">following his emergency signing for Barcelona</a>.

He\u2019s the top scorer and he top assist provider in Spain \u2013 by five in each case \u2013 despite having missed almost a quarter of the season. And Barcelona are back on top. \u201cWhen the No 10 is inspired it\u2019s difficult to get a point here; all that work is undone,\u201d Pape Diop said. \u201cMessi scores four; without him, maybe it\u2019s 1-0,\u201d Jose \u00c1ngel said.

      "bodyText": "At the end of training on Friday night, the players from Club Deportivo Becerril packed everything away and headed straight home. It was quarter past 10 and they had to be up early the next morning. Not long after 7.30am they were back, boarding the bus heading north, a four-hour journey ahead. One of the buses, that is. They had a game, but this time it wasn\u2019t theirs. Instead, they were going to San Sebasti\u00e1n, singing songs all the way there, and the whole town was going with them. For once that\u2019s not much of an exaggeration, either: there are 754 people in Becerril de Campos, a tiny, previously unremarkable town in the province of Palencia; on Saturday, 502 of them set off and didn\u2019t come back until after dark, happy as they had ever been. It had been the perfect day. No sangria in the park but plenty of patxar\u00e1n. Cider too, and txakoli. They walked the prettiest city there is, down old, narrow streets where every doorway is a bar and every bar is crowded with pintxos, a thousand things nailed to a thousand pieces of bread. They ate. Well. And they swam in the sea. Some did, anyway. They were invited into pe\u00f1as, supporters\u2019 clubs, and given gifts. They took a hundred photos and made dozens of friends, learned a little Euskera. Then they went \u2013 all of them, two-thirds of an entire town \u2013 to watch a football match in the place that might just be the best place to do so in the whole of Spain right now. For free. Becerril play in the third division, which makes it sound much better than it is. There\u2019s a First Division, a Second Division and a Second Division B \u2013 80 teams split across four divisions, roughly by region. Then there\u2019s tercera, 361 teams in 18 provincial groups of 20 or more. Becerril, who came up from regional preferente in the summer, are not far off relegation in Group 8. This year for the first time ever, they also played in the Copa del Rey \u2013 new, improved and at last open to almost everyone \u2013 becoming the team from the smallest town ever to appear in the competition. They were beaten 8-0 by Real Sociedad and afterwards, la Real\u2019s president Jokin Aperribay invited them to Anoeta \u2013 the Reale Arena it\u2019s called now now \u2013 to watch a game. All of them. It took a little while to get sorted, but the promise was for real. Which is why on Saturday morning there were eight buses and a load of cars leaving the town virtually empty. \u201cThere are going to be so few people left that we\u2019ve asked the Guardia Civil to send patrols to watch over the houses,\u201d said the club\u2019s president, Juan Antonio Redondo, \u201cthere\u2019s pretty much only some old folk left behind.\u201d They\u2019d been going on about this excitedly for weeks \u2013 \u201cno one\u2019s talking about anything else; there\u2019s a WhatsApp group, which is basically the whole town,\u201d said the mayor, Fran P\u00e9rez \u2013 while walls there were getting regaled with Real Sociedad stuff, a new team for the town to support. The president\u2019s daughter asked for a Real Sociedad tracksuit for Christmas, and she wasn\u2019t alone. When they departed, some already wore blue and white; by the time they returned, more did. P\u00e9rez had gone ahead the night before, received by the mayor of San Sebasti\u00e1n. Becerril\u2019s staff and directors were invited to the formal pre-match lunch attended by directors of la Real and opponents Valencia, meeting past and present. Fans were welcomed in by Real Sociedad supporters, which they were becoming too. The hosts paid for everything: the buses, the tickets, many of the meals \u2013 58 went to that directors\u2019 lunch, 30 of them free. \u201cReal set no limits but we didn\u2019t want to abuse their generosity,\u201d Redondo explained. The food they ate was \u201clike being at a wedding,\u201d said David Gonz\u00e1lez, the club captain. Kids from Becerril accompanied the team on to the pitch. In the stands, they sang. Becerril\u2019s name rang round, their songs adapted for la Real while they learned the rest, ready. And then, when they thought it couldn\u2019t get better, it got better. Turns out, they haven\u2019t just encountered a great club, they\u2019ve encountered a great team too: Copa del Rey semi-finalists, a goal up from the first leg against Second Division Mirand\u00e9s, and now looking beyond that. The next trip may be even further afield. \u201cWe\u2019re competing for the same thing,\u201d the Real Sociedad manager Imanol Alguacil had said before Saturday\u2019s game, but it didn\u2019t look that way for long \u2013 and not just because over the last few weeks Valencia, left without a decent defender, are barely able to compete at all. \u201cWe have to be men [but] in the first half we played like kids,\u201d Dani Parejo said afterwards. Valencia started the day a point above Real Sociedad, two teams chasing the final Champions League place, but within 11 minutes Mikel Merino put la Real ahead. Just before half-time it was two, Nacho Monreal scoring; and just after half-time, it was three, Adnan Januzaj completing a hat-trick from former Premier League players with a belting shot. It was done, 40 minutes still to go, time to enjoy it. La Real are the youngest side in primera, prone to occasionally drift from games, occasionally vulnerable against the tougher teams, but there may be no one as much fun to watch. And, running track gone, noise raised, there may be no more fun place to go, either. Put the two together and it\u2019s the perfect day. La Real dominated Valencia, firing off 19 shots, \u201churricane real\u201d as one headline put it, Alguacil insisting: \u201cWe did a lot well.\u201d And yet they blow their opponents away without even being at their very best. This is the team that battered Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u: skilful and swift, every pass forward, playing like they\u2019re determined not to waste a moment, like they\u2019re enjoying this as much as the rest of us. A lot has been said about Martin \u00d8degaard, and rightly, but Merino has been outstanding too and Alexander Isak has left mouths open lately. They all have. It was la Real\u2019s sixth consecutive win at home in all competitions\u2013 their best run in 24 years. They have won 10 of their last 13 matches. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re really conscious of the moment we\u2019re living through at the moment,\u201d wrote Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez. His paper, El Diario Vasco, which had joyfully followed their visitors around town, called the Reale Arena a \u201cfootballing paradise\u201d and it was hard for them to disagree. Alguacil was happy, too. \u201cThis is a moment to be enjoyed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe euphoria is normal. The passion for this team belongs to everyone.\u201d Everyone in one particular small town in Palencia, especially. The population of Becerril boarded their buses home around nine, promising that next time Real Sociedad could come to their place, although how they\u2019ll accommodate 34,199 members in the Mariano Haro is another matter. \u201cI just hope we can be friends for ever,\u201d one fan said. \u201cThis is football, the way it should be,\u201d insisted the vice-president Jos\u00e9 Esteban. \u201cThere are no words to describe the way they treated us, from Aperribay to the very last citizen. They hung on our every need, from arrival and throughout our stay. On the streets people said hello, they cheered us on. It\u2019s been unforgettable,\u201d said the mayor, but now it was time to go. Club Deportivo Becerril had a game the next day. They won 1-0. Talking points \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m not going to wash the shirt after Messi hugged me,\u201d Martin Braithwaite grinned after he made his debut following his emergency signing for Barcelona. Braithwaite might have been an unexpected choice but, strong, fast and intelligent, offering something different to the rest, there were signs that he could be useful on Saturday: in 20 minutes, the Dane was directly involved in two Barcelona goals as they defeated Eibar 5-0. As for Messi, he ended his worst goalless run in six years by scoring four. He\u2019s the top scorer and he top assist provider in Spain \u2013 by five in each case \u2013 despite having missed almost a quarter of the season. And Barcelona are back on top. \u201cWhen the No 10 is inspired it\u2019s difficult to get a point here; all that work is undone,\u201d Pape Diop said. \u201cMessi scores four; without him, maybe it\u2019s 1-0,\u201d Jose \u00c1ngel said. Without him, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu might have been more exposed too: the hankies were out pre-game, along with chants of \u201cBartomeu, resign!\u201d but the victory just about kept that under control. Sort of. Ish. For now. \u2022 The second best thing about Jos\u00e9 Luis Morales\u2019s belting shot that tore through the air and into the net from a daft angle and a long way out to defeat Real Madrid is the sense that he only did it because there was nothing else he could do. Second only to him confirming exactly that. Watching it bounce up on the left side, all alone, it was like Morales thought: \u201cSod it, I\u2019ll just absolutely mash this into the net.\u201d He was withdrawn immediately afterwards, exhausted, his work here done. \u201cI knew I was running out of petrol and I just wanted to finish to move,\u201d he admitted after.",

Instead, at the back of court 2 sat a cleancut Assange in a crisp white shirt under a grey sweater, impassive and with reading glasses on his head.</p> <p>After a morning spent straining to hear the US case against him being read out, Assange rose shortly before the lunchtime break to thank those protesting outside in support of him, but adding that it was making it hard for him to concentrate.</p> <p>\u201cI am having difficulty concentrating and this noise is not helpful. I understand and am very appreciative of the public support. I do understand they must be disgusted by these proceedings,\u201d he told the judge.</p> <p>Above him and to his left were those who gathered in the public gallery. They included his father, John Shipton, and figures from WikiLeaks, the site Assange co-founded in 2006.</p> <p>Others at court \u2013 though not all inside the courtroom \u2013 included 33 parliamentarians from 12 different European countries. They formed a monitoring group organised by the freedom of expression project Bridges for Media Freedom and came from Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the UK.</p> <p>It was outside Woolwich crown court, however, that the full mosaic of the following that has rowed in behind Assange could be found. They included a dozen gilet jaune protesters who had travelled from Paris overnight.</p> <p>\u201cI am a yellow vest here to support because he did the best for all the world, for his courage,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste Voltuan, 64.</p> <p>The ranks of those keeping up a steady stream of chants included the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, wearing a headband reading \u201cangel\u201d, who told the Press Association: \u201cI am Vivienne. I\u2019m the angel of democracy. Nobody knows more about democracies than Julian Assange.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not a crime to publish American war crimes. It\u2019s in the public interest, it is democracy, that he is allowed to do this. I feel really worried and frightened actually, really frightened.\u201d</p> <p>Inside court 2 meanwhile, there was silence as the extradition case was laid out in slow, meticulous detail by Lewis as he took Baraitser and those listening through a US depiction of WikiLeaks, visiting the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts along the way.</p> <p>The sombre delivery of Lewis gave way eventually to the equally sombre opening statement of Assange\u2019s defence councils, Edward Fitzgerald QC, lightened only briefly by the latter\u2019s channeling Mandy Rice-Davies\u2019 Profumo-era retort to Lord Astor\u2019s claims not to have met her.</p> <p>In this case, the famous quote was deployed as a response to Donald Trump\u2019s absolute denial of anything in relation to claims that a Republican Congressman had offered Assange a pardon on the President\u2019s behalf</p> <p>\u201cWe say: \u2018well, he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d said Fitzgerald.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There was no room inside for the hundreds who had turned up to support Julian Assange, but the the sound of their chants in support of the WikiLeaks founder could be heard throughout the long-awaited extradition hearing at Woolwich crown court. At an early stage, perhaps as much in hope as anything else, the presiding judge, Vanessa Baraitser, had sent court staff outside to speak Assange\u2019s supporters, adding that the noise could interfere with her ability to hear the case properly. It was to no avail, but James Lewis QC nevertheless pressed on, outlining the US case for why the Australian should be extradited to America to face trial on 18 charges of attempted hacking and breaches of the country\u2019s espionage laws. It has been about 10 months since Assange was dragged from the Ecuadorian embassy, where he had spent seven years inside as he faced allegations in Sweden of sex crimes, which he has always denied. The bedraggled-looking figure pulled from the embassy last April was nowhere to be seen on Monday. Instead, at the back of court 2 sat a cleancut Assange in a crisp white shirt under a grey sweater, impassive and with reading glasses on his head. After a morning spent straining to hear the US case against him being read out, Assange rose shortly before the lunchtime break to thank those protesting outside in support of him, but adding that it was making it hard for him to concentrate. \u201cI am having difficulty concentrating and this noise is not helpful. I understand and am very appreciative of the public support. I do understand they must be disgusted by these proceedings,\u201d he told the judge. Above him and to his left were those who gathered in the public gallery. They included his father, John Shipton, and figures from WikiLeaks, the site Assange co-founded in 2006. Others at court \u2013 though not all inside the courtroom \u2013 included 33 parliamentarians from 12 different European countries. They formed a monitoring group organised by the freedom of expression project Bridges for Media Freedom and came from Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the UK. It was outside Woolwich crown court, however, that the full mosaic of the following that has rowed in behind Assange could be found. They included a dozen gilet jaune protesters who had travelled from Paris overnight. \u201cI am a yellow vest here to support because he did the best for all the world, for his courage,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste Voltuan, 64. The ranks of those keeping up a steady stream of chants included the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, wearing a headband reading \u201cangel\u201d, who told the Press Association: \u201cI am Vivienne. I\u2019m the angel of democracy. Nobody knows more about democracies than Julian Assange. \u201cIt is not a crime to publish American war crimes. It\u2019s in the public interest, it is democracy, that he is allowed to do this. I feel really worried and frightened actually, really frightened.\u201d Inside court 2 meanwhile, there was silence as the extradition case was laid out in slow, meticulous detail by Lewis as he took Baraitser and those listening through a US depiction of WikiLeaks, visiting the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts along the way. The sombre delivery of Lewis gave way eventually to the equally sombre opening statement of Assange\u2019s defence councils, Edward Fitzgerald QC, lightened only briefly by the latter\u2019s channeling Mandy Rice-Davies\u2019 Profumo-era retort to Lord Astor\u2019s claims not to have met her. In this case, the famous quote was deployed as a response to Donald Trump\u2019s absolute denial of anything in relation to claims that a Republican Congressman had offered Assange a pardon on the President\u2019s behalf \u201cWe say: \u2018well, he would say that, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d said Fitzgerald.",

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/feb/17/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos</a> from the last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s begin at The Beginning Of Spring by Penelope Fitzgerald, as recommended by <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13400011\">Dennis89</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Quiet, subtle and gloriously offbeat this tale of Moscow life at the turn of the 20th Century is a delight. Aided by a lush yet beautifully economic writing style Fitzgerald just seems to know how much to give the reader at each and every point ... at 170 odd pages this book felt like a masterclass in the compression and distortion of time \u2026 More Fitzgerald novels beckon. Onwards.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI have just finished Fraud by Anita Brookner,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13505124\">lonelybloomer</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Very, very impressed. She described internal lives of a few characters, balancing between different perspectives to show her character, Anna, in her own eyes and the eyes of others. People are shown as being judgemental of a spinster with nothing to do, yet she has an inner life richer than most of them. I have to honestly say that Brookner makes spinsterhood (for lack of a better word) seem a career worth pursuing...</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI wanted something a little lighter,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3165651\">captainlego</a>. \u201cSo I turned to Nina Stibbe and Man at the Helm\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A lovely, light, funny and entertaining novel about two sisters, 10 and 12 or thereabouts, trying to hook their whiskey-guzzling, bad play-writing mother up with a suitable man. It\u2019s great fun.</p> </blockquote> <p>Focus by Arthur Miller has given <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3349583\">Glozboy </a>food for thought:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Living in an antisemitic part of 1940s New York, Laurence Newman starts wearing glasses because of his poor eyesight. The glasses make him look jewish, turning the spotlight of prejudice fully upon him.</p> <p>This was an awesome read, the subtlety with which things slowly turn against Newman providing a palpable sense of dread throughout. I don\u2019t usually like it when people say things like \u2018food for thought in our current times\u2019, but it\u2019s definitely something worth considering.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100090602\">GELBuck</a> has enjoyed imbibing Anne Bront\u00eb\u2019s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I understand that this was written to discourage drinking and debauchery and encourage good and Godly behaviour. I\u2019m not sure it would work in that way today. The heroine is a priggish and saintly character who would be hard to live with while the hero is so wet you could grow cress on him. My sympathies were more with the villainous husband who would have been great company at a party even if you wouldn\u2019t want him to drive your wife home afterwards. Having said that, I enjoyed the \u2018will they, won\u2019t they\u2019 melodrama of the story and there were some delicious scenes. I particularly liked the four-year-old boy being taught to drink wine, gin and brandy and swear at his mother (don\u2019t judge!) as well as one female character proposing to disgrace her family by earning her own living!</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m dipping into some Soviet-Russian sci-fi with Roadside Picnic by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2438014\">nilpferd</a>, \u201cwho adapted their book into a screenplay for Tarkovsky\u2019s Stalker\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s apparently a thematic link back to Lem\u2019s Solaris and further back to Arthur C Clarke\u2019s Sentinel, the basis respectively for further films by Tarkovsky and Kubrick (2001). Having just rewatched Stalker, I was once again spellbound by this magnificent film, whose dialogue incidentally has many provocative points to make about literature and poetry. It is also a film which seems more contemporary each time I watch it, with its themes of decay and desire, our dwindling resources of faith and humanity, and the sense of blindly trapping ourselves into a toxic pressure cooker of pollution and waste.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12515333\">ChronicExpat </a>recommends another book which was turned into a classic film, In A Lonely Place by Dorothy B Hughes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stunning: beautifully written, superbly plotted, psychologically sophisticated \u2026 and terrifying in its gimlet-eyed examination of violent misogyny.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last week. Let\u2019s begin at The Beginning Of Spring by Penelope Fitzgerald, as recommended by Dennis89: Quiet, subtle and gloriously offbeat this tale of Moscow life at the turn of the 20th Century is a delight. Aided by a lush yet beautifully economic writing style Fitzgerald just seems to know how much to give the reader at each and every point ... at 170 odd pages this book felt like a masterclass in the compression and distortion of time \u2026 More Fitzgerald novels beckon. Onwards. \u201cI have just finished Fraud by Anita Brookner,\u201d says lonelybloomer: Very, very impressed. She described internal lives of a few characters, balancing between different perspectives to show her character, Anna, in her own eyes and the eyes of others. People are shown as being judgemental of a spinster with nothing to do, yet she has an inner life richer than most of them. I have to honestly say that Brookner makes spinsterhood (for lack of a better word) seem a career worth pursuing... \u201cI wanted something a little lighter,\u201d says captainlego. \u201cSo I turned to Nina Stibbe and Man at the Helm\u201d: A lovely, light, funny and entertaining novel about two sisters, 10 and 12 or thereabouts, trying to hook their whiskey-guzzling, bad play-writing mother up with a suitable man. It\u2019s great fun. Focus by Arthur Miller has given Glozboy food for thought: Living in an antisemitic part of 1940s New York, Laurence Newman starts wearing glasses because of his poor eyesight. The glasses make him look jewish, turning the spotlight of prejudice fully upon him. This was an awesome read, the subtlety with which things slowly turn against Newman providing a palpable sense of dread throughout. I don\u2019t usually like it when people say things like \u2018food for thought in our current times\u2019, but it\u2019s definitely something worth considering. GELBuck has enjoyed imbibing Anne Bront\u00eb\u2019s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall: I understand that this was written to discourage drinking and debauchery and encourage good and Godly behaviour. I\u2019m not sure it would work in that way today. The heroine is a priggish and saintly character who would be hard to live with while the hero is so wet you could grow cress on him. My sympathies were more with the villainous husband who would have been great company at a party even if you wouldn\u2019t want him to drive your wife home afterwards. Having said that, I enjoyed the \u2018will they, won\u2019t they\u2019 melodrama of the story and there were some delicious scenes. I particularly liked the four-year-old boy being taught to drink wine, gin and brandy and swear at his mother (don\u2019t judge!) as well as one female character proposing to disgrace her family by earning her own living! \u201cI\u2019m dipping into some Soviet-Russian sci-fi with Roadside Picnic by the brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky,\u201d says nilpferd, \u201cwho adapted their book into a screenplay for Tarkovsky\u2019s Stalker\u201d: There\u2019s apparently a thematic link back to Lem\u2019s Solaris and further back to Arthur C Clarke\u2019s Sentinel, the basis respectively for further films by Tarkovsky and Kubrick (2001). Having just rewatched Stalker, I was once again spellbound by this magnificent film, whose dialogue incidentally has many provocative points to make about literature and poetry. It is also a film which seems more contemporary each time I watch it, with its themes of decay and desire, our dwindling resources of faith and humanity, and the sense of blindly trapping ourselves into a toxic pressure cooker of pollution and waste. Finally, ChronicExpat recommends another book which was turned into a classic film, In A Lonely Place by Dorothy B Hughes: Stunning: beautifully written, superbly plotted, psychologically sophisticated \u2026 and terrifying in its gimlet-eyed examination of violent misogyny. I\u2019ve never seen the (more famous) 1950 film adaptation with Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Graham so I came to the novel cold, which was probably a good thing as I have now learned that the film\u2019s plot differs significantly from its source material. If you have even a fleeting interest in the hardboiled/noir genre and have not yet read this book, you really, just, must. No questions, just go and read it, right now. Sounds like we better go to it! Interesting links about books and reading What Charles Portis taught us. \u201cScience fiction is never about the future,\u201d says William Gibson, who ought to know. \u201cIt\u2019s only really about the moment in which it\u2019s written.\u201d The dream-life of Vladimir Nabokov. Hermione Granger for President! Sally Rooney has fallen in love with Henry James. On Russia\u2019s Dr Seuss. Why we need books more than ever.

      "bodyText": "A sports therapist has been found guilty of murdering a retired lecturer by shooting him with a crossbow at his remote island home in what police described as a \u201cbarbaric, medieval-style execution\u201d. Terence Whall, 39, targeted Gerald Corrigan, 74, as his victim adjusted his satellite dish outside his house in Anglesey, north Wales, in the early hours of 19 April last year. The bolt passed completely through Corrigan\u2019s body, causing terrible internal damage including bruising the heart. He was rushed to hospital but gangrene set in and he died almost a month later of multiple organ failure. A ballistics expert and pathologist concluded the shooter must have been only 10 metres away, probably in the field in front of the house and hiding behind a wall. Whall denied having anything to do with Corrigan\u2019s death but police were able to establish that a Land Rover he used was near the victim\u2019s home at the time of the shooting and on the previous night, when he scoped out the property. Outside court, Corrigan\u2019s partner, Marie Bailey, appealed for Whall to explain why he carried out the killing. Bailey said: \u201cTo that sad, twisted broken soul who murdered him, I say if you have an ounce of humanity, any sense of decency then you would tell us now why you have done this.\u201d She urged anyone who might know why Whall had carried out the murder to come forward. Corrigan\u2019s daughter, Fiona, said: \u201cThe injuries caused by a crossbow are not designed just to kill, they are designed to mutilate. The particular weapon is designed for hunting to bring down game, and that is what my dad became: prey. We may never know why.\u201d She added: \u201cThe reason the news of the shooting was such a shock for us was that he was such a good man. Just an average bloke enjoying his retirement. He enjoyed a lie in, a nice cup of tea and reading books. He loved Laurel and Hardy films and photographing flowers and mountains. Our lives won\u2019t be the same without him.\u201d DCI Brian Kearney of North Wales police said: \u201cGerald Corrigan was the victim of a barbaric, medieval-style execution in one of the safest parts of the UK. He was entirely innocent. \u201cTerence Whall believed he had planned and committed the perfect murder. There was no forensic evidence, no direct eyewitness evidence to the shooting and in fact no one saw him going to and from the scene.\u201d Peter Rouch QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Mold crown court it might never be known why Corrigan was murdered. But the court heard that, before his death, Corrigan and his partner, Marie Bailey, 64, had allegedly been conned out of \u00a3250,000 by a man called Richard Wyn Lewis, who had previous convictions for fraud. The court also heard there had been a row between Corrigan and Lewis over the growing of cannabis in outbuildings at the former\u2019s home. Jurors were told that Whall had been arrested at the Anglesey home of Lewis \u2013 who remains under investigation \u2013 on 31 May last year following an incident that the jury was told was a dispute over money. Rouch said Whall\u2019s association with Lewis \u201cmay be of significance\u201d. Whall was arrested in connection with Corrigan\u2019s death on 25 June. He initially lied to police and said he had been at his home on Anglesey at the time of the shooting, but later said he had been near Corrigan\u2019s home because he was having a sexual encounter with a friend. The friend denied this. In evidence not heard by the jury, the court was told a handmade garrotte was discovered in Whall\u2019s car after his arrest, and his internet history showed he had bought piano wire online and googled \u201ccentral nervous system neck injury\u201d. A punchbag, with holes that suggested it had been used for crossbow target practice, was seized from his home. Co-defendant Gavin Jones, 36, was convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in connection with the setting fire of a Land Rover that Whall used to drive to the scene of the attack. Martin Roberts, 34, Darren Jones, 41, pleaded guilty to arson earlier in court proceedings. All four will be sentenced on Friday.",

The rest of his themes are all there: family, memory and its deceptions, childhood, and the casual acts of cruelty we inflict on one another. But this story, which pits Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche in a head-to-head as a feuding mother and daughter, feels manifestly less potent than his usual work.

      "bodyText": "It is a truth universally acknowledged in world cinema that a celebrated auteur, making their first film outside their native tongue, must be preparing a dud. So news that Hirokazu Kore-eda was working on a film in French after his Palme d\u2019Or for Shoplifters was cause for alarm. Would the world be forced to endure another My Blueberry Nights \u2013 the turkey served up by Wong Kar-Wai in his English-language debut in 2007 \u2013 after two decades of highly regarded work? Kore-eda\u2019s film, The Truth, is not a flop, yet there is a sort of musty air that hangs over it, a kind of stale not-quite-there-ness that is surely attributable to the master shooting outside of Japanese. The rest of his themes are all there: family, memory and its deceptions, childhood, and the casual acts of cruelty we inflict on one another. But this story, which pits Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche in a head-to-head as a feuding mother and daughter, feels manifestly less potent than his usual work. An added complication thrown into the mix is that Binoche\u2019s husband is played by Ethan Hawke, whose French is rusty at best \u2013 so the actor sits there in silence, smiling, while people around him expound in French, and occasionally plays a bit of guitar.

How many more women have to die before we realise that this is the most hideous thing of all? \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist \u2022 In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Thompson has only coached two athletes \u2013 Erki Nool, the Olympic decathlon champion in 2000 and Tamsyn Lewis, who won gold in the world indoor 800m in 2008.</p> <p>Nool is Estonian; Lewis is Australian. Thompson shrugs when asked why he never coached in Britain. \u201cI\u2019ve just coached those two \u2013 one Olympic champion, one indoor champion. It\u2019s difficult to find athletes who will make the commitment it needs. I don\u2019t want to be more enthusiastic about your career than you are.\u201d</p> <p>What if a committed British athlete approached him now? \u201cI\u2019d love to help. I\u2019d be over the moon to help.\u201d</p> <p>Could he have helped Johnson-Thompson when she struggled a few years ago and before she transformed her career by moving to France and becoming the 2019 world champion? \u201cWe talked about doing it but Kat wanted a proper break [from Britain], which has worked well. She\u2019s going to have a great year and could easily be Olympic champion. I really hope she does all the right work and wins the Olympics.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/oct/18/athletics.johnrawling\" title=\"\">Thompson applied for the role of the performance director</a> at UK Athletics in 2004 but did not even make the shortlist. While the GB team enjoyed unprecedented success at London 2012 has he been disappointed with the way the sport is struggling again? \u201cYeah. London 2012 was a squandered opportunity. I don\u2019t think we put enough resources behind it with a proper plan.</p> <p>\u201cWe just said: \u2018We\u2019re going to have a great Games.\u2019 We did. We had the best Olympics ever. At the last one [in Rio], we were unbelievable again. But occasionally you have to rethink and change things. You have to keep people hungry. So many people I came up with pissed it all away.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson squeezed everything out of his extraordinary talent. He might have had a fast mouth and a swagger but he trained remorselessly. He loved being pushed to excel by West Germany\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Hingsen, who broke his world record. \u201cI never lost to him and we competed from when we were 18,\u201d points out Thompson, who broke the world record four times. \u201cIt was brilliant. He was the only reason I trained eight hours a day.\u201d</p> <p>Is it an indictment of British athletes that Thompson\u2019s record has stood for 36 years? \u201cThe decathlon\u2019s a hard, thankless thing. You have to spend three times longer training than anybody else. You have to train when it\u2019s miserable and you get very little. If you\u2019ve got a reasonable amount of talent in the sprints you get so much more being the 50th best sprinter than the best decathlete.\u201d</p> <p>Would he have done the same if he was aged 22 today? \u201cNo. To be the best in the world is a nice little accolade but with my last world record I thought I was going to do better than that. I\u2019m the only person to break the world record and not do a personal best in the 10 events. Most people do two or three PBs. I should\u2019ve done a bit better.\u201d</p> <p>When asked who he most admired as a decathlete he says, instantly: \u201cBruce Jenner. He was a phenomenal athlete. My hero.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/14/caitlyn-jenner-it-was-tough-wearing-a-bustier-for-vanity-fair\" title=\"\">What does he think of his hero\u2019s subsequent sex change</a> and Bruce becoming the now stratospherically famous Caitlyn Jenner? \u201c[She] must be the toughest person I know because if you have to live as somebody else for 60 years it can\u2019t be easy. I\u2019m cool about it.\u201d Jenner was Olympic champion in 1976 \u2013 when Thompson, who had just turned 18, finished 18th. Did he speak much to the American? \u201cAll the time. He was really forthcoming. Terrific.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson regards himself as the best decathlete of all time. Who is No 2? \u201cThere are a couple of people I could make good arguments for and against. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrApamjU7a0\" title=\"\">Ashton Eaton [the 2012 and 2016 Olympic champion from the US] is not bad</a>. But back in the old days a bloke called Bob Mathias [who won successive Olympics in 1948 and 1952, also of the US] was terrific.\u201d</p> <p>As a double Olympic champion himself why does Thompson think he was never knighted? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t care but the kids would like it. They want to call me sir. For me, the saving grace is always the bloke out there, in the street, likes me. I wouldn\u2019t swap that for any knighthood. Come on, let\u2019s get back to the interesting questions.\u201d</p> <p>Where did he stand on Brexit? \u201cI supported Brexit. I think we live in the best country in the world. It\u2019s not perfect by any means but I didn\u2019t like loads of people telling me my country can\u2019t survive on its own. So I thought we\u2019d give it a go.\u201d</p> <p>Remembering his youth, Thompson describes Notting Hill in the 1960s as \u201ca dump. A shithole. Nobody wanted to live there but many people were a lot worse off than us.\u201d</p> <p>Did it feel like a mini-version of apartheid, I ask, as Thompson knows I come from South Africa. \u201cNo. Our world changed a little faster than yours. Where you guys lived, racism was much more overt. But even now prejudice still exists.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson was six when his father left the family. For this reason, the murder of his dad had less impact on him than might have been expected. \u201cHe was out of my life anyway, so it did not change me. The only thing I realised, when he died, was what a big family I had because they all came over from Nigeria. Oh my God.\u201d</p> <p>Does Thompson feel African in any way? \u201cNo, I feel really British. My mum [a Scot from Dundee] was the key influence. She gave me this work ethic. I saw what she did and considered it normal to have three jobs as a cleaner and bring up kids on your own.\u201d</p> <p>When he told his mum as a teenager he was going to dedicate his life to sport she said he would need to move out. \u201cShe said it as she saw it. She wanted me to stick to my studies but I was luckier than most. I could stay with my aunt. Even when I won my Olympic medals my mum didn\u2019t mellow. She never said she was wrong but that was her. She gave me a lot. I just loved sport so much.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.laureus.com/\" title=\"\">Thompson has been associated with Laureus Sports</a> since its inception 20 years ago. As a Laureus Academy member he is passionate about sport\u2019s ability to unite and inspire. He is also enthused about his friendship with other academy members. \u201cI\u2019ve built a brilliant relationship with Morne du Plessis, Hugo Porta [former rugby players from South Africa and Argentina respectively] and Steve Waugh [a former Australia cricket captain].\u201d</p> <p>Has he always followed rugby and cricket? \u201cI\u2019m probably too good-looking for both,\u201d Thompson says, his laughter booming. \u201cEven now.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re way past our allocated time slot but Thompson wants to keep chatting. \u201cNext, we\u2019re going to talk about one of my best friends who is in charge of the IAAF.\u201d</p> <p>Seb Coe is the man Thompson most admires as a fellow athlete. \u201cSeb\u2019s got such grit and determination. He\u2019s faced such a hard four years. They\u2019ve had Caster Semenya, the Russian drugs thing, the trans-gender thing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/03/nike-world-athletics-eluid-kipchoge\" title=\"\">And now there\u2019s the shoe thing</a>.\u201d</p> <p>The IAAF\u2019s new regulations have failed to limit the impact of Nike\u2019s race-changing footwear. Thompson pulls a face. \u201cI don\u2019t think athletics should be about who\u2019s got the best shoes. So Seb has to deal with a lot and he\u2019s done a good job under the circumstances. With women athletes it\u2019s also been blurred by the transgender issue. There are some sports where you can just say \u2018I identify as a woman\u2019 even if you are a man. It\u2019s a whole can of worms. I just can\u2019t believe the IOC has not stood up to be counted. I think there should be a safe place for women. I\u2019m all for being inclusive but the sports federations don\u2019t understand the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Despite these complexities, will Thompson be in Tokyo? \u201cOf course.\u201d Has he missed an Olympics since his first in 1976? \u201cNo. Don\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s the best three weeks in the world. They\u2019ve all been good but you know what? They all pale into insignificance with ours. London was so good. That was the best 12 billion quid we\u2019ve ever spent.\u201d</p> <p>Why did British sport fail to build on such success? \u201cWe were having a holiday and enjoying it. Then we had to get back to the slog of life but for three weeks we were the centre of the universe.\u201d</p> <p>What about now? Does he ever feel doubt without the intensity of elite competition to bolster his self-belief? \u201cI now think I might die before I\u2019m 110,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good question. I went to a funeral the other day of a guy who coached me in football when I was at Wimbledon. He was six years younger than me. They talked about what he did. I was thinking, if I had to die soon, the only thing that would upset me would be not seeing all the kids grow up. Otherwise, I\u2019ve had the best life. I\u2019ve had an unbelievable life and it\u2019s still really exciting. I still look forward to every day.\u201d</p> <p><em>The 20th anniversary Laureus World Sports Awards honoured the greatest </em><em>triumphs of 2019 and celebrated the power of sport in transforming the lives of millions of young people</em></p>",

With women athletes it\u2019s also been blurred by the transgender issue. There are some sports where you can just say \u2018I identify as a woman\u2019 even if you are a man. It\u2019s a whole can of worms. I just can\u2019t believe the IOC has not stood up to be counted. I think there should be a safe place for women. I\u2019m all for being inclusive but the sports federations don\u2019t understand the consequences.\u201d Despite these complexities, will Thompson be in Tokyo? \u201cOf course.\u201d Has he missed an Olympics since his first in 1976? \u201cNo. Don\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s the best three weeks in the world. They\u2019ve all been good but you know what? They all pale into insignificance with ours. London was so good. That was the best 12 billion quid we\u2019ve ever spent.\u201d Why did British sport fail to build on such success? \u201cWe were having a holiday and enjoying it. Then we had to get back to the slog of life but for three weeks we were the centre of the universe.\u201d What about now? Does he ever feel doubt without the intensity of elite competition to bolster his self-belief? \u201cI now think I might die before I\u2019m 110,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good question. I went to a funeral the other day of a guy who coached me in football when I was at Wimbledon. He was six years younger than me. They talked about what he did. I was thinking, if I had to die soon, the only thing that would upset me would be not seeing all the kids grow up. Otherwise, I\u2019ve had the best life. I\u2019ve had an unbelievable life and it\u2019s still really exciting. I still look forward to every day.\u201d The 20th anniversary Laureus World Sports Awards honoured the greatest triumphs of 2019 and celebrated the power of sport in transforming the lives of millions of young people",

Officials from WHO visited Wuhan at the weekend for the first time since the outbreak, inspecting two hospitals and meeting officials at the centre for disease control in the province. There is growing alarm among economists and investors that the impact on global growth is going to be much worse than previously estimated. There is no official data about how the Chinese economy has fared in the past three weeks, but trackers of coal consumption and traffic congestion show that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy is still paralysed despite claims that many manufacturing areas are back to work. \u201cThe presumption was that we would see intermediate supply chains quickly reconnected and I think the market has had to go through a period of questioning that logic,\u201d said Ray Attrill, the head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.

A lack of experience and chequered ministerial career restored her to high office only because Boris Johnson wanted a rightwing loyalist who would carry his anti-Europeanism to extremes. Patel has set about this with a bludgeon.</p> <p>The readiness of Home Office officials to \u201cgold plate\u201d Tory xenophobia has long puzzled those who regard the British civil service as basically liberal at heart. It has shackled local police with <a href=\"https://www.policesupers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Review_Targets_2015.pdf\" title=\"\">target culture</a>, persistently opposed reform of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/13/advising-uk-drug-policy-crisis-government-experts\" title=\"\">drugs policy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/10/windrush-deporting-people\" title=\"\">persecuted any immigrant</a> who crosses their path. That officials might finally be seeking to sensitise a rightwing minister is welcome.</p> <p>However, bad-mouthing a minister is rarely productive. It is hard to believe Patel and Rutnam can long be in joint harness. Responsibility for this mess lies entirely with Johnson, for appointing an out-of-depth minister in the first place. He is clearly still in his \u201cTrumpian\u201d phase, thrashing about, sacking people, tearing things up and hoping they will settle. We all do.</p> <p>Johnson clearly wants to run what under Tony Blair was called a \u201cNapoleonic\u201d government, based on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/444979.stm\" title=\"\">strong central command</a> and a cabinet of poodles. The appointment of often useless ministers for short terms of office might work if balanced by a stable and experienced officialdom. Rumours of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/boris-johnson-urged-to-reject-firing-squad-approach-to-whitehall\" title=\"\">imminent sacking of officials</a> suggest no such balance. Disruptive aides, such as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Alan Walters and Blair\u2019s Alastair Campbell, have to be offset by wiser and older heads. As Thatcher said, \u201cEvery prime minister needs a Willie,\u201d referring to her experienced deputy, William Whitelaw.</p> <p>Johnson has no Willie \u2013 where it matters. He cuts at present a solitary figure. All his advice appears to come from Dominic Cummings. Such radical aides are important at the heart of government, but not let off the lead. The cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, clearly cannot control the government machine, as senior officials are demoted from advisers and chief executives into mere administrators who only obey orders.</p> <p>If constructive criticism is not sustained within government, it will default to the street, as is happening in democracies around the world. Johnson\u2019s distortion of the chemistry of British government is dangerous for all concerned, not least himself.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "When a boss and her number two issue statements professing love for each other, something is wrong. Witness the home secretary, Priti Patel, and her chief civil servant, Philip Rutnam, countering rumours from within their department. These allegations about Patel, leaked to the press, include \u201cbullying\u201d, \u201cbelittling officials\u201d, creating an atmosphere of fear, and being out of her depth. This is not a happy ship. The Home Office has seemed dysfunctional for more than a decade, as it has attempted to deliver Toryism\u2019s \u201cnasty\u201d edge, on law and order and, above all, immigration. Its explicitly \u201chostile environment\u201d towards immigrants and asylum seekers has come to embody Britain\u2019s \u201cun-welcome\u201d to the world. It desperately needs leadership that is politically subtle and sensitive. Patel\u2019s greatest fans would not laud her subtlety and sensitivity. A lack of experience and chequered ministerial career restored her to high office only because Boris Johnson wanted a rightwing loyalist who would carry his anti-Europeanism to extremes. Patel has set about this with a bludgeon. The readiness of Home Office officials to \u201cgold plate\u201d Tory xenophobia has long puzzled those who regard the British civil service as basically liberal at heart. It has shackled local police with target culture, persistently opposed reform of drugs policy and persecuted any immigrant who crosses their path. That officials might finally be seeking to sensitise a rightwing minister is welcome. However, bad-mouthing a minister is rarely productive. It is hard to believe Patel and Rutnam can long be in joint harness. Responsibility for this mess lies entirely with Johnson, for appointing an out-of-depth minister in the first place. He is clearly still in his \u201cTrumpian\u201d phase, thrashing about, sacking people, tearing things up and hoping they will settle. We all do. Johnson clearly wants to run what under Tony Blair was called a \u201cNapoleonic\u201d government, based on strong central command and a cabinet of poodles. The appointment of often useless ministers for short terms of office might work if balanced by a stable and experienced officialdom. Rumours of the imminent sacking of officials suggest no such balance. Disruptive aides, such as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Alan Walters and Blair\u2019s Alastair Campbell, have to be offset by wiser and older heads. As Thatcher said, \u201cEvery prime minister needs a Willie,\u201d referring to her experienced deputy, William Whitelaw. Johnson has no Willie \u2013 where it matters. He cuts at present a solitary figure. All his advice appears to come from Dominic Cummings. Such radical aides are important at the heart of government, but not let off the lead. The cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, clearly cannot control the government machine, as senior officials are demoted from advisers and chief executives into mere administrators who only obey orders. If constructive criticism is not sustained within government, it will default to the street, as is happening in democracies around the world. Johnson\u2019s distortion of the chemistry of British government is dangerous for all concerned, not least himself. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

She also speaks about the decades of misogynist abuse that she has had to absorb, mostly in an era when you had to toughen up and never admit to being hurt. Clinton remembers all this with good grace and good humour, and with that folksy, teacherly-grandmotherly chuckle she cultivated to ward off unpleasantness.

Bill is interviewed, and Obama makes a gracious contribution. Hillary never sounds angry about Trump, but comes close to revealing her contemptuous rage at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a>, whom she clearly regards as a populist poseur.</p> <p>There are no actual omissions in Burstein\u2019s documentary, although Sanders conspiracists may complain that there is no examination of possible bias in the way the Democratic contender was chosen in 2016. But Burstein does not ask about Clinton\u2019s acquaintance with Trump in the days when he was a celebrity Democratic supporter, and shies away from asking about the incident in September 2016 when Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-news-election-live?page=with:block-57d74139e4b07ac3d446b964#block-57d74139e4b07ac3d446b964\">appeared to faint</a> when leaving the 9/11 memorial service. It might have been interesting to hear more about the personal toll of electioneering, the 18-hour days and seven-day weeks. Everyone could sympathise with that.</p> <p>What emerges from Burstein\u2019s film is that Clinton found herself surrounded by a non-partisan, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop_Pact\">Molotov-Ribbentrop pact</a> of populism, attacked by Trump from the right and Sanders from the left \u2013 and there is anecdotal evidence that once Clinton had won the ticket some young feel-the-Berners went over to Trump to protest at the establishment. And establishment is undoubtedly what Clinton is. Tellingly, in an early remark, she says an inspiration was Bobby Kennedy, as opposed to John Kennedy: the family member put in an unelected position of power. Incredibly, her male opponents could claim insurgent-underdog status. Bill Clinton made his way in the scrappy business of politics by selling himself and pushing and pleading for power. Not Hillary. She won office as New York senator on her own merits and did perfectly well, but by then had acquired the reputation and mannerisms of entitlement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4af3d639262e1f5919345e5c4eb543cbc9401917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af3d639262e1f5919345e5c4eb543cbc9401917/0_220_4652_2792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at a presidential debate in October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changing political ground \u2026 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at a presidential debate in October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2016, she was somehow too late (because Obama had used up all the oxygen) and too soon (because the media and governing classes were still unready for another step change). The political ground had changed beneath Clinton\u2019s feet. Trump had mastered the new languages of reality TV, celebrity and social media \u2013 and mainstream media were hypnotised by his quasi-fascist bullying and ratings boosting. And, beyond anything Clinton might say about policy, there was unemployment and stagnation and a huge constituency of angry people out there, targeted by the data occultists, people who could be made to believe almost anything on a smoke-without-fire basis and feel it was time for a grassroots <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulturkampf\">Kulturkampf</a> against liberals.</p> <p>Watching this documentary, I felt that Clinton should perhaps have had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ruth-bader-ginsberg\">Ruth Bader Ginsberg</a>\u2019s life and career. Clinton could have been a supreme court justice by now \u2013 and a popular heroine into the bargain, with HRC T-shirts and buttons and comic books \u2013 making a real difference to policy, living a happy and incrementally successful life, without having to beg for votes and without having to endure the insults of bullies and sexists and idiots. There is still a reticence to Clinton, an obvious reluctance to say anything that could be used against her or against the Democrats in the 2020 campaign. But opening up is simply not her style.</p>",

She also speaks about the decades of misogynist abuse that she has had to absorb, mostly in an era when you had to toughen up and never admit to being hurt. Clinton remembers all this with good grace and good humour, and with that folksy, teacherly-grandmotherly chuckle she cultivated to ward off unpleasantness. (Her voice has changed over the years; Burstein finds TV footage of interviews she gave when Bill Clinton was governor in Arkansas, and she sounded a lot more down-home, promising to \u201cwork as haaahd as uh cay-un\u201d.) She stays even-tempered, except when she talks about how Bill had to admit to her the truth about Lewinsky in the late 90s and how their daughter, Chelsea, kept their marriage together. Bill is interviewed, and Obama makes a gracious contribution. Hillary never sounds angry about Trump, but comes close to revealing her contemptuous rage at Bernie Sanders, whom she clearly regards as a populist poseur. There are no actual omissions in Burstein\u2019s documentary, although Sanders conspiracists may complain that there is no examination of possible bias in the way the Democratic contender was chosen in 2016. But Burstein does not ask about Clinton\u2019s acquaintance with Trump in the days when he was a celebrity Democratic supporter, and shies away from asking about the incident in September 2016 when Clinton appeared to faint when leaving the 9/11 memorial service. It might have been interesting to hear more about the personal toll of electioneering, the 18-hour days and seven-day weeks. Everyone could sympathise with that. What emerges from Burstein\u2019s film is that Clinton found herself surrounded by a non-partisan, Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of populism, attacked by Trump from the right and Sanders from the left \u2013 and there is anecdotal evidence that once Clinton had won the ticket some young feel-the-Berners went over to Trump to protest at the establishment. And establishment is undoubtedly what Clinton is. Tellingly, in an early remark, she says an inspiration was Bobby Kennedy, as opposed to John Kennedy: the family member put in an unelected position of power. Incredibly, her male opponents could claim insurgent-underdog status. Bill Clinton made his way in the scrappy business of politics by selling himself and pushing and pleading for power. Not Hillary. She won office as New York senator on her own merits and did perfectly well, but by then had acquired the reputation and mannerisms of entitlement. In 2016, she was somehow too late (because Obama had used up all the oxygen) and too soon (because the media and governing classes were still unready for another step change). The political ground had changed beneath Clinton\u2019s feet. Trump had mastered the new languages of reality TV, celebrity and social media \u2013 and mainstream media were hypnotised by his quasi-fascist bullying and ratings boosting. And, beyond anything Clinton might say about policy, there was unemployment and stagnation and a huge constituency of angry people out there, targeted by the data occultists, people who could be made to believe almost anything on a smoke-without-fire basis and feel it was time for a grassroots Kulturkampf against liberals. Watching this documentary, I felt that Clinton should perhaps have had Ruth Bader Ginsberg\u2019s life and career. Clinton could have been a supreme court justice by now \u2013 and a popular heroine into the bargain, with HRC T-shirts and buttons and comic books \u2013 making a real difference to policy, living a happy and incrementally successful life, without having to beg for votes and without having to endure the insults of bullies and sexists and idiots. There is still a reticence to Clinton, an obvious reluctance to say anything that could be used against her or against the Democrats in the 2020 campaign. But opening up is simply not her style.",

Playing it in a different part of the country has been mooted as an alternative to going behind closed doors, but that would be a tough decision for the <em>Bianconeri</em>, who have dropped only two points all season at their Allianz Stadium.</p> \n<p>They did win away from home last weekend against opponents who sit bottom of the table. Spal were dogged but outmatched. Cristiano Ronaldo, making the 1,000th appearance of his professional career, marked the occasion by scoring for the 11th consecutive league game \u2013 matching the Serie A record held by Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella.</p> \n<p>Aaron Ramsey also found the net for the first time since November. His has been a frustrating first term in Turin, complicated by injuries and inconsistency. Maurizio Sarri still has not settled on a fixed starting XI, however, leaving at least a possibility for the Welshman to claim a more prominent role for the final part of the campaign.</p> \n<p>Juventus will need more than just Ronaldo chipping in if they are to stay ahead of a Lazio side that has goals in abundance. Ciro Immobile extended his tally to 27 as they won 3-2 win at Genoa on Sunday, joining Antonio Angelillo (at Inter, in 1958-59) as the only players ever to reach that number after 25 games of a Serie A campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1231923052864311296\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goal 2\ufe0f\u20e37\ufe0f\u20e3 of this Serie A season for Ciro Immobile<br><br>\u26a0\ufe0f He has equaled Antonio Angelilli\u2019s record of most goals scored by matchday 25, set in 1958/59 \ud83e\udd1d<br><br>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OptaPaolo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OptaPaolo</a> <br> <a href=\"https://t.co/vvZg9dQ765\">pic.twitter.com/vvZg9dQ765</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1231923052864311296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Immobile is now just nine shy of the single-season record set by Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, but this was another weekend to remind us that Lazio are no one-man team. Adam Marusic\u2019s opener, in which he kept his feet after being buffeted from either side by Andrea Masiello and Adama Soumaoro, both of whom wound up on the floor, was the pick of their goals, but Danilo Cataldi\u2019s opportunistic free-kick for the third was also well taken.</p> \n<p>For a Sunday with only two matches, there were quite a few strikes to enjoy. Even in defeat, the first-time finish that Francesco Cassata dispatched into the top corner for Genoa was perfection. Roma put four past Lecce, ending their run of three straight league defeats.</p> \n<p>Still, it was not enough to fill the void. Endless televised analysis and post-game interviews are the backing track to Italy\u2019s Sunday afternoons. Short of action to discuss, the long-time pundit Massimo De Luca instead turned his ire on Rai 2\u2019s A Tutta Rete toward the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of a 20-team top-flight, arguing that this situation showed again why having fewer teams would benefit Serie A, leaving more flexibility in the calendar.</p> \n<p>His words drew applause from a small studio audience. Other broadcasts had already closed their doors in response to the outbreak. At times the silence felt weighty on shows where audience reaction is a familiar part of the experience. It was nothing compared to that which might await Serie A\u2019s players this weekend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3aa97539-d81b-40f2-9859-40b7d96d4aeb\"

It was the early hours of Sunday morning but in Milan, Turin, Bergamo and Verona the directors of Serie A teams were still awake, working the phones, trying to find out whether that day\u2019s matches would go ahead. On Saturday evening, the government had passed legislation placing 11 northern towns in lockdown, prohibiting travel in or out as they attempted to contain outbreaks of coronavirus in Lombardy and Veneto. The same decree granted government ministers powers to suspend public gatherings. A decision was taken to delay all sporting events, right down to the amateur level, across the affected regions. Four out of six top-flight games scheduled for Sunday ended up being postponed: Atalanta-Sassuolo, Verona-Cagliari, Internazionale\u2011Sampdoria and Torino-Parma. The last of those decisions was not confirmed until almost lunchtime. Two fresh cases of the virus had been identified in Piedmont, the region in which Turin is located, that morning.

Maurizio Sarri still has not settled on a fixed starting XI, however, leaving at least a possibility for the Welshman to claim a more prominent role for the final part of the campaign. Juventus will need more than just Ronaldo chipping in if they are to stay ahead of a Lazio side that has goals in abundance. Ciro Immobile extended his tally to 27 as they won 3-2 win at Genoa on Sunday, joining Antonio Angelillo (at Inter, in 1958-59) as the only players ever to reach that number after 25 games of a Serie A campaign. Immobile is now just nine shy of the single-season record set by Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, but this was another weekend to remind us that Lazio are no one-man team. Adam Marusic\u2019s opener, in which he kept his feet after being buffeted from either side by Andrea Masiello and Adama Soumaoro, both of whom wound up on the floor, was the pick of their goals, but Danilo Cataldi\u2019s opportunistic free-kick for the third was also well taken. For a Sunday with only two matches, there were quite a few strikes to enjoy. Even in defeat, the first-time finish that Francesco Cassata dispatched into the top corner for Genoa was perfection. Roma put four past Lecce, ending their run of three straight league defeats. Still, it was not enough to fill the void. Endless televised analysis and post-game interviews are the backing track to Italy\u2019s Sunday afternoons. Short of action to discuss, the long-time pundit Massimo De Luca instead turned his ire on Rai 2\u2019s A Tutta Rete toward the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of a 20-team top-flight, arguing that this situation showed again why having fewer teams would benefit Serie A, leaving more flexibility in the calendar. His words drew applause from a small studio audience. Other broadcasts had already closed their doors in response to the outbreak. At times the silence felt weighty on shows where audience reaction is a familiar part of the experience. It was nothing compared to that which might await Serie A\u2019s players this weekend.",

      "bodyText": "Huawei is launching a new version of its folding smartphone, the Mate Xs, alongside revamped tablets and laptops. Despite Mobile World Congress being cancelled owing to fears over the coronavirus, the embattled Chinese firm Huawei launched a series of high-end updates to its most ambitious products at a virtual press conference instead. The headline product is a reworked version of Huawei\u2019s smartphone that unfolds into a tablet, which directly competes with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold rather than the South Korean firm\u2019s newer, smaller Galaxy Z Flip folding phone. The new Mate Xs has the same design as its predecessor, the Mate X, which was unveiled at last year\u2019s MWC but only launched in China in November. Beyond the wider release, which is expected to see the Mate Xs go on sale in Europe, the updated smartphone has a new, more robust hinge design and upgraded cameras. The Mate Xs will also have Huawei\u2019s new Kirin 990 processor with 5G connectivity. But one thing the new folding smartphone won\u2019t have is Google\u2019s version of Android or its apps, services or the Play Store, because Huawei is still on the US trade blacklist. Instead the Mate Xs will ship with Huawei\u2019s EMUI 10, based on the open source version of Android, with the Chinese firm\u2019s own mobile services as a replacement for Google\u2019s. It is the same approach as that used with its recent Mate 30 Pro handset, which Huawei is pushing in the UK bundled with wireless earbuds and smartwatches at aggressive prices. \u201cDespite Huawei\u2019s optimism, offering Android smartphones without Google\u2019s applications and services is a tough sell,\u201d said Ben Wood, chief of research for CCS Insight. \u201cThe big test will be whether consumers who sign up to Huawei\u2019s deals persevere with the device or ultimately give up and return it. \u201cThere is little question things will get tougher for Huawei as 2020 progresses as rival players unveil new Android smartphones with a full suite of Google services and apps.\u201d Alongside the Mate Xs, Huawei is also launching revamped models of its MatePad tablet and MateBook laptop range, plus a new smart speaker. The new MatePad Pro 5G is a premium, work-focused Google-free Android tablet, with a strong resemblance to its rival Apple\u2019s iPad Pro. It has a high-resolution 10.8in screen with tiny bezels, the firm\u2019s Kirin 990 5G chip, quad-speakers and advanced multitasking and split-screen functionality. Huawei also has a new M-Pencil stylus, which magnetically attaches to the top of the tablet to store and charge, plus a Smart Magnetic Keyboard. The Chinese firm\u2019s well-received MateBook Pro X and MateBook D Windows 10 laptops also received updates, featuring Intel\u2019s latest 10th-generation Core i7 chips. The MateBook D will be available in 14in and 15in versions, with an AMD Ryzen 5 processor option, following moves made by Microsoft and others to expand beyond Intel\u2019s chips. Huawei also partnered with the French high-end audio firm Devialet to create an Apple HomePod rival called the Sound X. The wifi-connected speaker has two woofers and an array of six tweeters to create 360-degree sound.",

      "bodyText": "A neo-Nazi group is to become the second extreme rightwing outfit to be banned as a terrorist organisation in the UK, the home secretary has announced. Sonnenkrieg Division (SKD), members of which have been jailed for serious offences, is to be proscribed, making membership of the group illegal and punishable by up to 10 years in prison, Priti Patel said. Another order will recognise the extreme right wing group System Resistance Network as an alias of the already proscribed neo-Nazi organisation National Action. Two teenage members of SKD, Michal Szewczuk, 19, from Leeds, and Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, 18, from west London, were jailed for terrorism offences in June last year. The pair encouraged an attack on Prince Harry, who they referred to as a race traitor for marrying Meghan Markle, a woman of mixed race, glorified the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik, and said white women who date non-white men should be hanged. The orders come less than a week after nine people with immigrant backgrounds were murdered in the western German city of Hanau by Tobias Rathjen, a 43-year-old who had posted a racist video and manifesto on the internet. Patel said: \u201cRecent attacks here and in Germany have highlighted the threat we continue to face from violent extremism. \u201cWe are working to keep the public safe by increasing funding for counter-terror police and strengthening the law to keep terrorists locked up for longer. \u201cBy proscribing these groups we are making it much harder for them to spread their hateful rhetoric.\u201d This decision follows a meeting of the Proscription Review Group, which brings together representatives from the police and other partners to assess the risk posed by groups that may be considered for proscription. SKD is the UK arm of the neo-Nazi Atomwaffen Division formed in 2015 in the southern US. It emerged in 2018 around the time of the arrests of Szewczuk and Koczorowski. According to the anti-racist group Hope Not Hate, SKD was heavily influenced and obsessed by Satanism and extremist Muslim ideology, which forms the basis of the so-called \u201cwhite jihad\u201d ideology, the spiritual component that encourages neo-Nazis to kill and die \u201cfor the cause\u201d. The move to ban SKD comes amid evidence suggesting far-right violence is on the rise across the UK. Senior counter-terrorism officials have warned that the far right poses the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK. A quarter of all terrorism arrests in the past year were linked to far-right violence and the far-right caseload of counter-terrorism police jumped from 6% to 10% in two years. Counter-terrorism officers have foiled eight far-right terrorist plots since March 2017. Of the 5,738 referrals to the government\u2019s anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent, 1,389 or 24% were referred for concerns related to right-wing radicalisation, up from 18% in the previous year, and 10% in the year to March 2016. In a paper written for the commission on countering-extremism, the academic Joe Mulhall said far-right demonstrations had grown to sizes not seen since the 1930s. Police forces do not record far-right incidents but they do record terror-related offences and hate crime, the latter of which has risen sharply. The most recent official statistics on hate crime show that in 2018-19, there were 103,379 hate crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales, an increase of 10% compared with 2017/18. The majority of hate crimes were race hate crimes, accounting for about three quarters of offences (76%; 78,991 offences). The Home Office said the increase was largely driven by improvements in police recording, although there were spikes in hate crime following the EU referendum and the spate of terrorist attacks in 2017. The most high-profile cases of far-right violence in recent years were the murder of the MP Jo Cox by the white supremacist Thomas Mair and the foiled plot to kill the MP Rosie Cooper by Jack Renshaw, a former member of National Action. Stephen Doughty MP, member of the House of Commons home affairs select committee, said he had repeatedly called for bans of both SKD and System Resistance Network. He told the Guardian: \u201cThis is a very welcome but hugely overdue decision. I and others \u2013 including journalists and organisations like Hope Not Hate \u2013 have repeatedly urged tough action on these sick, twisted neo-Nazi organisations for the last few years. \u201cYet despite repeatedly meetingministers and officials in private and raising concerns in public it has taken until now for them to be banned. \u201cThe government need to wake up to the threat posed by these extreme right organisations - who would seek to target communities from Muslims to Jews, the LGBT community and anyone who doesn\u2019t meet their white supremacist criteria.\u201d",

In a rare public statement on relations between a minister and their officials, the Home Office denied on Sunday that Patel had tried to move the department\u2019s permanent secretary, Rutnam, from her department after a series of rows. A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cThe home secretary and permanent secretary are deeply concerned about the number of false allegations appearing in the media. \u201cThey are focused on delivering on the Home Office\u2019s hugely important agenda, which includes creating an immigration system that works for the UK, putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism.\u201d Theresa Villiers, the Conservative former cabinet minister, said there was an element of misogyny in the briefings, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI\u2019m sick of spiteful briefings against women in high public office.

The Sunday Times quoted unnamed officials who claimed that MI5 found Patel \u201cextremely difficult to deal with\u201d and that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t grasp the subtleties of intelligence\u201d. The home secretary\u2019s allies believe officials are briefing against her because they do not like being challenged. Patel was first appointed to the cabinet in 2016 as international development secretary, when Theresa May was prime minister. She was forced to resign the following year after it emerged she had failed to tell No 10 about a series of meetings she had had with Israeli ministers while she was visiting the country for what was supposed to be a holiday.

Walt, on the cusp of being murdered by Gus Fring, had ordered the assassination of sweet, blameless Gale to buy him a stay of execution; the 13-month wait before the consequences were revealed felt like torture.</p> <p>But Better Call Saul\u2019s last season ended on a note that, while momentous \u2013 Jimmy McGill starts practising law under the name Saul Goodman \u2013 was much less hyperventilating. It wasn\u2019t a surprise, because that\u2019s how prequels work. Add to that the fact that the last episode aired in 2018, and that this enormous hiatus worked against the show during awards season, and that El Camino stole in and tugged the curtain out from underneath it, and you\u2019re left with a show suffering from a case of diminished buzz.

      "bodyText": "Warning: contains spoilers The one downside to Better Call Saul\u2019s methodical brilliance \u2013 its utter devotion to quiet processes, whether the removal of tape from a mural or the slow disintegration of a man\u2019s entire character \u2013 is that anticipation can sometimes fade a little. This point in Breaking Bad\u2019s history, the start of the penultimate season, was like being caught in a panic attack. Walt, on the cusp of being murdered by Gus Fring, had ordered the assassination of sweet, blameless Gale to buy him a stay of execution; the 13-month wait before the consequences were revealed felt like torture. But Better Call Saul\u2019s last season ended on a note that, while momentous \u2013 Jimmy McGill starts practising law under the name Saul Goodman \u2013 was much less hyperventilating. It wasn\u2019t a surprise, because that\u2019s how prequels work. Add to that the fact that the last episode aired in 2018, and that this enormous hiatus worked against the show during awards season, and that El Camino stole in and tugged the curtain out from underneath it, and you\u2019re left with a show suffering from a case of diminished buzz. Bob Odenkirk has done his best, promising audiences that this new season is worth the wait, but there\u2019s no doubt Better Call Saul has a hill to climb. Fortunately for all of us, on the basis of today\u2019s new episode, Better Call Saul is back on top and no momentum has been lost.

Millane\u2019s mother, Gillian, told her daughter\u2019s killer: \u201cYou have taken my daughter\u2019s future and robbed us of so many memories that we were going to create.\u201d The horrific murder of Millane, who met her killer (who cannot be named for legal reasons) on a Tinder date, has focused attention on the increasing use of the \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d defence by men who kill women. It\u2019s a defence that can only be described as victim-blaming taken to its most grotesque extreme. Here we have increasing numbers of men blaming women for the fatal violence committed against them, suggesting women can somehow consent to their own deaths (which is legally impossible) while claiming they themselves cannot be held responsible. It\u2019s time the use of this defence stopped \u2013 for good. In a twisted reversal, the defence also positions men as hapless victims of women\u2019s sexual demands. After all, how can it be his fault if he was just doing what she wanted? It argues men don\u2019t know that, for example, strangling, beating and cutting a woman\u2019s neck isn\u2019t dangerous, and so they cannot be blamed. But that\u2019s nonsense. Millane\u2019s killer strangled her for 10 minutes. As the sentencing judge explained, that\u2019s not \u201crough sex\u201d. It\u2019s violence. The campaigning group We Can\u2019t Consent to This, which tirelessly records the use of this defence, believes \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d was first used in 1972, when Carole Califono died after her partner Peter Drinkwater injected her with anaesthetics. He argued he was trying to \u201csatisfy her perverted sexual desires\u201d, and was sentenced to 12 years for manslaughter. For 40 years the use of the defence was relatively rare.

The oldest victim in the past 10 years was 66-year-old Lesley Potter \u2013 although this was just one of many excuses used by her killer. The youngest was 16-year-old Hannah Pearson, whose death I can\u2019t think about without starting to cry. James Morton killed Hannah hours after they met, saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t object\u201d when he started to strangle her. He was convicted of manslaughter. Morton and Drinkwater aren\u2019t the only men who have used the defence. Six cases since 2010 led to a manslaughter conviction, including that of Natalie Connolly in 2018.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is trying to stop the publication of a book by his third national security adviser, John Bolton, but he will soon have to contend with a volume published by his second. Lt Gen HR McMaster will publish Battlegrounds: The Fight to Defend the Free World, on 28 April. Bolton\u2019s book, The Room Where It Happened, is reported to contain details of events central to the president\u2019s impeachment over his approaches to Ukraine, which he survived after acquittal in the Senate. It is due for publication in March but Trump is reportedly trying to block it until at least after November\u2019s election. McMaster has long been known to be writing a book but it has not been expected to be a memoir of the tell-all kind which has plagued the Trump White House. Harper Collins duly said McMaster\u2019s book would offer a \u201cgroundbreaking reassessment of America\u2019s place in the world, drawing from McMaster\u2019s long engagement with these issues, including 34 years of service in the US army with multiple tours of duty in battlegrounds overseas\u201d. But the publisher also said the general would write about \u201chis 13 months as national security adviser in the Trump White House\u201d. McMaster replaced another general, the disgraced Michael Flynn, as national security adviser in early 2017 and lasted in the role until 22 March 2018. Trump\u2019s fourth national security adviser in less than four years, currently filling the hot seat, is the former hostage negotiator Robert O\u2019Brien. Books on the Trump administration are full of descriptions of a relationship with McMaster that never flourished, the cerebral general clashing with the impulsive president. In the bestselling A Very Stable Genius, for example, the Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker write that McMaster had \u201cdifficulty holding the president\u2019s attention\u201d as Trump \u201cwould get annoyed with what he considered McMaster\u2019s lecturing style\u201d. McMaster is a decorated combat veteran who won a famous tank battle in the first Gulf war and also the author of a book on the Vietnam war, Dereliction of Duty, which examines a colossal failure of US foreign and national security policy. According to Leonnig and Rucker, Trump would not read briefing materials McMaster prepared and complain of scheduled meetings: \u201cI\u2019m not fucking doing that. I\u2019m not talking with McMaster for an hour. Are you kidding me?\u201d The situation did not improve, they write, because \u201cMcMaster felt it was his duty to speak truth to his commander\u201d. Trump\u2019s complaint that McMaster dressed \u201clike a beer salesman\u201d has been widely reported. Leonnig and Rucker also say Trump would imitate McMaster\u2019s military bearing and \u201cbarking kind of voice\u201d. An unidentified McMaster aide is quoted as saying: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t fire people. He just tortures them until they\u2019re willing to quit.\u201d McMaster was generally considered one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d around Trump in the first two years of his presidency, senior figures from the military or business generally able to restrain the brash and unconventional real estate developer. Other such figures long gone from the White House include two other retired generals, former defense secretary James Mattis and ex-chief of staff John Kelly, and former Exxon Mobil chief executive and secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Mattis published his own memoir, Call Sign Chaos, last year. It only obliquely addressed his service under Trump and his differences with him. McMaster has fought shy of speaking on record about his time in the White House and has given only one major interview: to the Guardian about his passion for rugby union. That interview took place the day after he packed up his belongings and left Washington for California, where he is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. McMaster perhaps gave a taste of the sections of his book on his time in the US army and about America\u2019s place in the world, if not his time in the Trump White House. \u201cI think the warrior ethos is analogous to what a good rugby team has,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be daunted by another team, or a difficult a situation in a game.

But it also signalled the beginning of the end for the music-themed panel show, setting in place a chain of events that led to its drawn-out, terminal decline.</p> <p>When it started in 1996, its anarchic, piss-taking spirit felt like something fresh and rare. The surly Mark Lamarr was perfect as initial host, and when Amstell replaced him in 2006 he took what he\u2019d done with Popworld and ran with it; he was brilliantly merciless with the guests, such as when he tore Donny Tourette from Towers of London apart (\u201cHello! Donny\u2019s put sunglasses on \u2013 that\u2019ll tell Thatcher\u201d). Some, like Amy Winehouse, were given space to give as good as they got. After Winehouse revealed she was off to meet Pete Doherty about a collaboration, Amstell suggested working with someone nice like Katie Melua instead. \u201cI\u2019d rather have cat Aids, thank you,\u201d was Winehouse\u2019s withering reply.</p> <p>But, post-Preston, it increasingly felt that Amstell, misplacing his usual self-deprecating style, was punching down: a malicious machine gun aimed at a barrelful of pop fish. Noel Fielding said Amstell\u2019s \u201ccruel jibes\u201d made guests reluctant to appear, and Phill Jupitus, team captain since the show\u2019s inception, almost quit due to Amstell\u2019s verbal attacks: \u201cIt struck me that people were being booked especially to have the piss taken out of them \u2026 and [it] started to get a bit wearing.\u201d</p> <p>Yet when Amstell left, his biting wit was irreplaceable. There was a new focus on team captains and a \u201ccosier\u201d image using a series of guest hosts. It had lost its edge and, just like Preston trying to leave the studio, didn\u2019t know where to go. There were some inspired choices of host (Terry Wogan \u2013 apparently the only time they had a standing ovation in the studio) and some puzzling guests (Gabby Logan). And, of course, we\u2019ll always have Huey Morgan smashing his mug because he got angry with Rizzle Kicks. But Noel Fielding increasingly delivered his kooky non sequiturs about hummus and motorbikes with a look that said he didn\u2019t want to be there. When they finally decided on a regular host, Rhod Gilbert \u2013 not as razor-sharp as Lamarr or Amstell \u2013 never seemed in his element.</p> <p>Buzzcocks had always been adept at filling the gaps: Amstell for Lamarr; Bill Bailey for Sean Hughes. But it became a game of diminishing returns, and after almost 28 (twenty-eight!) series it ended with barely a whimper. When it began, one of Lamarr\u2019s running jokes was his mock despair at how terrible the programme was. Sadly, it became prophetic.

Yet even in that broody cave, with its exposed beams and starched, white cloths, I still at first thought \u201c35%\u201d when I was handed two sorts of scripelle abruzzesi: the first batch rolled around ricotta and baked; the second served mbusse in clear chicken broth. The percentage gauge skipped up as I ate. It happened again in Campania, this time with crespelle ripiene: frilly-edged rounds rolled around in ricotta and mozzarella, the melted substance of which was welcome \u2013 after all, pancakes are by their very nature a bit flaccid. While fridge magnets and wine are the best souvenirs, recipes are a close third, and I brought all of them home. Keep in mind that the law of crespelle is the same as the law of pancakes: the first one is always a dud and the last a dilemma. Do you pour all the remaining batter into the pan and make a fat one? Or do you make one and-a-half? Either way, \u201cup, u-u-p\u201d. Crespelle ripiene The tomato is not so much a sauce as a seasoning liquid to prevent the crespelle drying as they cook. Prep 5 min Rest 30 min Cook 30 min Serves 4 4 eggs 300ml milk 80g flour 2 tbsp grated parmesan, plus 50g to top 1 tbsp finely minced parsley Salt and pepper 125g ricotta 100g mozzarella, diced 1 tbsp tomato paste or 3 tbsp passata Butter In a large bowl, beat the eggs into the milk with a fork. Sieve the flour into the bowl, add two tablespoons of parmesan, parsley and salt and pepper, and whisk into a batter. Leave to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Rub a large, nonstick frying pan with oil and put on a medium heat. Add a small ladleful of batter and tilt the pan so the mixture spreads. Cook on one side for 30 seconds, flip and cook for 20 seconds on the other, then slide on to a warm plate. Continue until all the batter is used. You should have eight to 10 crespelle. In a bowl, mix the ricotta and mozzarella, and season. Working with one crespella at a time, put a spoonful of the cheese mixture an inch away from one of the edges, spreading it out as best you can. Roll the crespella into a log, then repeat with the rest. Arrange the rolls in a well-buttered dish. Dilute the tomato with 60ml water and zig-zag over the rolls. Sprinkle with the remaining parmesan and bake at 180C (160C)/gas 4 for 20 minutes.",

      "bodyText": "The Football Association, alongside its Scottish and Irish counterparts, has taken steps to curtail heading in youth football following research that showed former professionals were more than three times likely than non-players to die from brain disease. The \u201cupdated Heading Guidance\u201d, drawn up in conjunction with Uefa\u2019s medical committee, states that children between the ages of 6 and 11 should no longer head the ball during training sessions. A \u201cgraduated approach\u201d will be taken to children between the ages of 12 and 16, but there will be no limit applied to heading in matches for any age group. Mark Bullingham, the FA\u2019s new chief executive, said: \u201cThis updated heading guidance is an evolution of our current guidelines and will help coaches and teachers to reduce and remove repetitive and unnecessary heading from youth football.\u201d The guidelines have been released following the landmark FIELD study into footballers and brain disease, conducted by the University of Glasgow last year. Based on the health records of 7,676 former players and 23,000 members of the public, it was the largest study of its kind and came to shocking conclusions. According to the report, former professionals were 3.5 times as likely as a member of the public to die from brain disease and, more specifically, five times more likely to die of Alzheimer\u2019s, four times more likely to die of motor neurone disease and twice as likely to die of Parkinson\u2019s. The report was co-funded by the FA and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association and immediately sparked concerns over heading in contemporary youth football. This in turn has brought about the guidance, which will be implemented immediately. The governing bodies were keen to stress that the results of the FIELD study did not prove that heading had caused the conditions experienced by former professionals. There is also an acknowledgement that heading is not a significant feature of competitive youth football, meaning the ban will not be applied to matches. Ian Maxwell, the chief executive of the Scottish FA, said: \u201cWhile it is important to re-emphasise there is no research to suggest that heading in younger age groups was a contributory factor in the findings of the FIELD study into professional footballers, nevertheless Scottish football has a duty of care to young people, their parents and those responsible for their wellbeing throughout youth football. \u201cIt is important to reassure that heading is rare in youth matches but we are clear that the guidelines should mitigate any potential risks.\u201d While brain injury charities welcomed the new guidance, there were calls for more action to be taken and quickly. \u201cIt seems entirely sensible to limit the number of times children are allowed to head footballs,\u201d said Peter McCabe, the chief executive of Headway, the brain injury association. \u201cThe question is, is this enough?

      "body": "<h2>Goals, drama but no winner at Manchester City</h2> <p>Manchester City and Chelsea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/stanway-hits-2000-milestone-in-epic-manchester-city-draw-with-chelsea\">played out a brilliant 3-3 draw</a>, full of relentless end-to-end action, quality play, and the pendulum swinging. There were periods when you were sure Chelsea would go on and win it and 10 minutes when it seemed a City victory was inevitable \u2013 we might not have seen the best of either team, but the entertainment was top-level. The league now takes a break while England compete in the SheBelieves Cup, and speaking to the managers afterwards they both agreed that the break will be an opportunity to recharge the batteries and change things up a bit. After a few months of seeing the same faces and hearing the same voices training has maybe become a bit flat, and you could see that in some parts of the game. The City forward Lauren Hemp was the player of the match, had the better of Maren Mjelde all game and nipped in ahead of the Norway captain to score the final goal of what was a stunning game \u2013 the last time two members of the top three will meet in the league this season \u2013 and make it 3-3.</p> <h2>Everton\u2019s new era off to limp start</h2> <p>In front of a sell-out crowd at their new home ground at Walton Hall Park, Everton found themselves 3-0 down with a little over an hour played \u2013 a nightmare start. United had lost two and drawn two of their six previous league games but had obviously had a word with themselves, recommitted and they owned the first half. Willie Kirk must have really fired up his players at the break because they came out and played with a lot of pride in the second half. The wind was awful and affected the game in some ways and Storm Dennis should probably get the assist for Everton\u2019s second as Lucy Graham\u2019s cross flew into the net, but the damage had been done. Still, this is a positive moment for Everton. They have their own facility, just down the road from Goodison Park, which can draw in local fans. It\u2019s small, but it\u2019s a home \u2013 for a team that has previously played at Southport and Widnes, which aren\u2019t anywhere near, this is a big step, a big commitment, and a sign of the ambition that Everton have for the women\u2019s team. Not a good result, but a great occasion for the club.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/old-trafford-stage-grand-opening-2021-women-euros-england-phil-neville\">Old Trafford picked to stage grand opening of Women\u2019s Euro 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Liverpool shamed by side\u2019s slide</h2> <p>Sadly there are no positives to be drawn across the city at Liverpool. Like Everton, Vicky Jepson\u2019s side scored a couple of late goals, but having been 4-0 down it wasn\u2019t even nearly enough. Liverpool had kept only one clean sheet this season but they\u2019re normally hard to score against \u2013 a fortnight ago they had not conceded more than two in any game this season. Now they have let in seven goals in two matches, and it was a bit jaw-dropping to see them fall so far behind against a West Ham side coming into this game on the back of 8-0 and 2-0 defeats. Matt Beard and his squad have done a lot of soul-searching, and the players responded. With Bristol City winning, Liverpool are now bottom of the league, and I think it is a bit embarrassing to see a club produce a men\u2019s side having unparalleled success, thanks not only to having the best players and coach but also the best training facilities and backup staff, and a women\u2019s side not being given the platform to compete. Nobody is questioning the players, who are well organised and work their socks off but just aren\u2019t getting the results they need. The club need look around at what their Premier League counterparts are doing and consider if they are pulling their weight, but at the moment they are heading for relegation.</p> <h2>Victory lets Spurs start forward planning</h2> <p>As a game this was ruined by Lea Le Garrec\u2019s first-half red card. I didn\u2019t think the first yellow was needed, but once you\u2019re on a booking you\u2019ve got to be clever. Instead she made a rash decision and with only half an hour played her team were down to 10. There was never going to be much between the teams \u2013 even with an extra player Spurs needed a penalty to win it \u2013 so a sending-off was inevitably going to be decisive. Despite this defeat Brighton have almost certainly got enough to avoid relegation, but now Tottenham are far beyond any sort of worry on that front. This means they can already look to next season, start fixing budgets and identifying possible signings. It is such an advantage if you\u2019re safe at this stage of the season, and in their debut WSL campaign Spurs have earned respect from other clubs and from prospective players.

      "bodyText": "Goals, drama but no winner at Manchester City Manchester City and Chelsea played out a brilliant 3-3 draw, full of relentless end-to-end action, quality play, and the pendulum swinging. There were periods when you were sure Chelsea would go on and win it and 10 minutes when it seemed a City victory was inevitable \u2013 we might not have seen the best of either team, but the entertainment was top-level. The league now takes a break while England compete in the SheBelieves Cup, and speaking to the managers afterwards they both agreed that the break will be an opportunity to recharge the batteries and change things up a bit. After a few months of seeing the same faces and hearing the same voices training has maybe become a bit flat, and you could see that in some parts of the game. The City forward Lauren Hemp was the player of the match, had the better of Maren Mjelde all game and nipped in ahead of the Norway captain to score the final goal of what was a stunning game \u2013 the last time two members of the top three will meet in the league this season \u2013 and make it 3-3. Everton\u2019s new era off to limp start In front of a sell-out crowd at their new home ground at Walton Hall Park, Everton found themselves 3-0 down with a little over an hour played \u2013 a nightmare start. United had lost two and drawn two of their six previous league games but had obviously had a word with themselves, recommitted and they owned the first half. Willie Kirk must have really fired up his players at the break because they came out and played with a lot of pride in the second half. The wind was awful and affected the game in some ways and Storm Dennis should probably get the assist for Everton\u2019s second as Lucy Graham\u2019s cross flew into the net, but the damage had been done. Still, this is a positive moment for Everton. They have their own facility, just down the road from Goodison Park, which can draw in local fans. It\u2019s small, but it\u2019s a home \u2013 for a team that has previously played at Southport and Widnes, which aren\u2019t anywhere near, this is a big step, a big commitment, and a sign of the ambition that Everton have for the women\u2019s team. Not a good result, but a great occasion for the club. Liverpool shamed by side\u2019s slide Sadly there are no positives to be drawn across the city at Liverpool. Like Everton, Vicky Jepson\u2019s side scored a couple of late goals, but having been 4-0 down it wasn\u2019t even nearly enough. Liverpool had kept only one clean sheet this season but they\u2019re normally hard to score against \u2013 a fortnight ago they had not conceded more than two in any game this season. Now they have let in seven goals in two matches, and it was a bit jaw-dropping to see them fall so far behind against a West Ham side coming into this game on the back of 8-0 and 2-0 defeats. Matt Beard and his squad have done a lot of soul-searching, and the players responded. With Bristol City winning, Liverpool are now bottom of the league, and I think it is a bit embarrassing to see a club produce a men\u2019s side having unparalleled success, thanks not only to having the best players and coach but also the best training facilities and backup staff, and a women\u2019s side not being given the platform to compete. Nobody is questioning the players, who are well organised and work their socks off but just aren\u2019t getting the results they need. The club need look around at what their Premier League counterparts are doing and consider if they are pulling their weight, but at the moment they are heading for relegation. Victory lets Spurs start forward planning As a game this was ruined by Lea Le Garrec\u2019s first-half red card. I didn\u2019t think the first yellow was needed, but once you\u2019re on a booking you\u2019ve got to be clever. Instead she made a rash decision and with only half an hour played her team were down to 10. There was never going to be much between the teams \u2013 even with an extra player Spurs needed a penalty to win it \u2013 so a sending-off was inevitably going to be decisive. Despite this defeat Brighton have almost certainly got enough to avoid relegation, but now Tottenham are far beyond any sort of worry on that front. This means they can already look to next season, start fixing budgets and identifying possible signings. It is such an advantage if you\u2019re safe at this stage of the season, and in their debut WSL campaign Spurs have earned respect from other clubs and from prospective players. Good as it has been they will want to improve things in the summer, and the ability to get to work already puts them ahead of other teams, including Brighton who \u2013 like the weather \u2013 will surely have calmer, sunnier times ahead but for now still have to cope with the clouds and the wind. Can Birmingham\u2019s senior players come to their rescue? A massive victory for Bristol City, who move off the bottom and will now be buzzing, full of belief that they can avoid relegation. For Birmingham this was a kick in the teeth, a result that sent them down to 11th and means they are in real peril. It has been a tough season for the Blues, given the number of players they lost pre-season, and they also had to cope here without their playmaker and senior player, Lucy Staniforth, who was suspended after having an argument with a fan during an FA Cup win at her former club Sunderland a week earlier.

In Germany, for example, you have open training sessions, the fans come and [talk to you], ask you why.</p> <p>\u201cHere, everything is closed.

      "bodyText": "Granit Xhaka feared he had played his last game for Arsenal after falling out with the club\u2019s fans in October and being stripped of the club captaincy, but feels proud of the resolve he has shown in restoring his reputation since then. The path back for Xhaka seemed narrow when, during the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on 27 October, he gestured towards the Emirates Stadium support and swore after his substitution was cheered. He explained afterwards that he had reached \u201cboiling point\u201d after receiving threats online, and was minded to leave the club in January before Mikel Arteta talked him round. Since then he has become a vital cog in a team who have gone 10 games unbeaten in all competitions, and there has been no sign of lingering bad blood between player and public. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t lie. There was a moment [when I thought I wouldn\u2019t play for Arsenal again], because it was not easy for me and my family. I hope people understand this,\u201d he told the Evening Standard. \u201cBut I think I showed my character. I am not a guy who runs away. I always say to the club: \u2018When I [am] here, I am ready to give everything.\u2019 It was like this always. I train very hard and that things turned around is the key. This [has given me] the most happiness.\u201d Xhaka had been named club captain a month before the Palace match by Unai Emery, the club\u2019s previous head coach, after a lengthy process that arguably exacerbated the situation that followed. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has succeeded him and, although he briefly wore the armband again towards the end of the rematch with Palace at Selhurst Park last month, Xhaka would probably stop short of accepting any offer to reassume the role. \u201cI know with or without the armband what I can give the team,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this moment [against Palace] I don\u2019t want to take the armband back, but Sokratis [Papastathopoulos] and David [Luiz] told me I have to take it. If one day the club asks me about the armband, I have to think twice.\u201d He described the events of last autumn, which led to him spending a month out of the side, as \u201cnot about a player \u2026 more about a human\u201d and suggested the distance between players and supporters in the Premier League does not help the relationship \u2013 contrasting it with the dialogue that can be opened in Germany, where he previously played with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. \u201cOn one side I understand the fans, because they always want the players to perform, but on the other side they have to understand us as well. It is not always easy. I think this is the biggest difference [between] Germany and England, because [here] we don\u2019t have the [close] connection with the fans. In Germany, for example, you have open training sessions, the fans come and [talk to you], ask you why. \u201cHere, everything is closed. So, for me, it would be good this time to explain to the people what is not going good or bad. But it doesn\u2019t matter now. Now we have to enjoy, that\u2019s the most important.\u201d",

With such a tight race at the top of the Bundesliga, there shouldn\u2019t really have been time for a Bayern Munich dress rehearsal as they get set to restart their Champions League campaign. Yet what they served up on Friday night\u2019s game against Paderborn felt suspiciously like one.</p> \n<p>There were plenty of fluffed lines. Bayern conceded not one but two improbable equalisers to visitors who were in the third tier the season before last, and whose annual playing budget is so small that nine first-teamers at the Allianz Arena each earn more than Paderborn\u2019s entire squad put together. In the absences of Benjamin Pavard and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, the hosts experimented with three at the back but as <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/autoren/tim-brack-1.2626289\">S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Tim Brack</a> pointed out, Manuel Neuer simply laughed wryly when asked if the plan might be revisited for Tuesday\u2019s visit to Chelsea.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/chelsea-bayern-munich-champions-league-final-2012\">'I didn't know where to run': Chelsea's Champions League win over Bayern revisited</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Neuer himself set the tone of below-optimum focus, gifting the first Paderborn equaliser to Dennis Srbeny in first-half stoppage time by wandering from his goal and being beaten to the ball, allowing the former Norwich striker to walk it in. \u201cI had the feeling he was getting there ahead of me and I didn\u2019t want to get a red card,\u201d was Neuer\u2019s explanation to DAZN of a lackadaisical sequence of play. In the end Robert Lewandowski\u2019s 88th-minute winner, tapped in from a Serge Gnabry cross (the Pole\u2019s second of the night and his 25th in the Bundesliga alone this season) \u201csaved Bayern from disgrace\u201d, as Brack put it, but it was way too close, and too casual, for comfort. This was not the Bayern we have become used to since Hansi Flick took over in November.</p> \n<p>Brought in to reinvigorate a side led down a moribund blind alley by Niko Kovac, the interim coach has largely succeeded in doing so, to the extent that he was confirmed in the post until the end of the campaign before the winter break. Yet the issue in recent weeks has been that there is as yet no firm offer for Flick to continue next season, and his work has caught the eye of other clubs. Bayern\u2019s pause before committing is sensible, whatever the relative feelgood factor of the moment. This week is big for Bayern but make no mistake, it\u2019s big for Flick as well.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1230950098932305921\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Manuel Neuer where are you off to? \ud83d\ude48<br><br>The Bayern goalkeeper goes walkies, gets nutmegged, and Paderborn pull level just before half-time! <a href=\"https://t.co/umTiMxVUVZ\">pic.twitter.com/umTiMxVUVZ</a></p>\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1230950098932305921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 21, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the moment where he can prove he is the coach who can take the lead on the big stage, especially in a tie that has historical resonance \u2013 nobody in Munich in forgetting about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/chelsea-bayern-munich-champions-league-final-2012\">the 2012 final</a> in a hurry \u2013 but in which Bayern are ultimately expected to prevail. There is optimism that increased competition at home will make them sharper than ever for the Champions League knockouts but with that rejig at the back, and with Corentin Tolisso and Philippe Coutinho brought in for Thomas M\u00fcller and Kingsley Coman, Flick showed he is not willing to leave anything to chance. If Bayern master Chelsea and give a good account of themselves in Europe it could be the difference between the club \u2013 heading into a new era post-Uli Hoeness under Oliver Kahn \u2013 putting their confidence in Flick or accelerating mutual interest with the likes of Thomas Tuchel.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe good thing we can take into Tuesday is that even when the pressure was high [after the second Paderborn equaliser] we still responded well,\u201d M\u00fcller suggested afterwards.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019ll be alright on the night, they hope. With such a tight race at the top of the Bundesliga, there shouldn\u2019t really have been time for a Bayern Munich dress rehearsal as they get set to restart their Champions League campaign. Yet what they served up on Friday night\u2019s game against Paderborn felt suspiciously like one. There were plenty of fluffed lines. Bayern conceded not one but two improbable equalisers to visitors who were in the third tier the season before last, and whose annual playing budget is so small that nine first-teamers at the Allianz Arena each earn more than Paderborn\u2019s entire squad put together. In the absences of Benjamin Pavard and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, the hosts experimented with three at the back but as S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Tim Brack pointed out, Manuel Neuer simply laughed wryly when asked if the plan might be revisited for Tuesday\u2019s visit to Chelsea. Neuer himself set the tone of below-optimum focus, gifting the first Paderborn equaliser to Dennis Srbeny in first-half stoppage time by wandering from his goal and being beaten to the ball, allowing the former Norwich striker to walk it in. \u201cI had the feeling he was getting there ahead of me and I didn\u2019t want to get a red card,\u201d was Neuer\u2019s explanation to DAZN of a lackadaisical sequence of play. In the end Robert Lewandowski\u2019s 88th-minute winner, tapped in from a Serge Gnabry cross (the Pole\u2019s second of the night and his 25th in the Bundesliga alone this season) \u201csaved Bayern from disgrace\u201d, as Brack put it, but it was way too close, and too casual, for comfort. This was not the Bayern we have become used to since Hansi Flick took over in November. Brought in to reinvigorate a side led down a moribund blind alley by Niko Kovac, the interim coach has largely succeeded in doing so, to the extent that he was confirmed in the post until the end of the campaign before the winter break. Yet the issue in recent weeks has been that there is as yet no firm offer for Flick to continue next season, and his work has caught the eye of other clubs. Bayern\u2019s pause before committing is sensible, whatever the relative feelgood factor of the moment. This week is big for Bayern but make no mistake, it\u2019s big for Flick as well. This is the moment where he can prove he is the coach who can take the lead on the big stage, especially in a tie that has historical resonance \u2013 nobody in Munich in forgetting about the 2012 final in a hurry \u2013 but in which Bayern are ultimately expected to prevail. There is optimism that increased competition at home will make them sharper than ever for the Champions League knockouts but with that rejig at the back, and with Corentin Tolisso and Philippe Coutinho brought in for Thomas M\u00fcller and Kingsley Coman, Flick showed he is not willing to leave anything to chance. If Bayern master Chelsea and give a good account of themselves in Europe it could be the difference between the club \u2013 heading into a new era post-Uli Hoeness under Oliver Kahn \u2013 putting their confidence in Flick or accelerating mutual interest with the likes of Thomas Tuchel. \u201cThe good thing we can take into Tuesday is that even when the pressure was high [after the second Paderborn equaliser] we still responded well,\u201d M\u00fcller suggested afterwards. That was pretty much all that could be taken from the game. If Bayern, and Flick, wanted to show how much the Champions League means to them this season, they had already done exactly that. Just not in the manner in which they had intended. Talking points \u2022 A Saturday teatime trip to Schalke away looked far from ideal for RB Leipzig after an exacting effort in the Champions League at Tottenham last Wednesday but despite Julian Nagelsmann making just one change from the win in north London \u2013 Dayot Upamecano coming back from a ban to replace to Ethan Ampadu in defence \u2013 it looked as if the home side had been enduring their busier week. Leipzig were spectacular, not allowing David Wagner\u2019s side a sniff from the moment when Marcel Sabitzer fizzed them in front after 51 seconds, with a swerving shot from range that Alexander N\u00fcbel might have done better with. It ended 5-0, with Timo Werner netting the pick of the goals in what Nagelsmann called \u201can extraordinary achievement,\u201d despite a late return from England after what the boss described as extensive border checks on the way. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, and now maybe it\u2019s even more with Brexit, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Nagelsmann said. \u2022 Meanwhile Werner raised a flag high and handsome for Liverpool to see for the second time in a week. \u201cThere are many things that suggest my style would be a good fit [there],\u201d said the striker, stopping once again to praise J\u00fcrgen Klopp before reiterating that wants \u201cto focus\u201d on the present. It\u2019s worth noting that if a move to Anfield doesn\u2019t come off, Werner hasn\u2019t ruled out staying put. \u2022 It was the stodgy to follow the spectacular for Borussia Dortmund, as they put in a largely laboured performance at Werder Bremen to bookend a week that include their dazzling Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t work them out,\u201d noted Emre Can of a frustrating first half but they got the job done after the break with goals by Dan-Axel Zagadou and the inevitable Erling Braut Haaland. It may well be a relief to Lucien Favre that his team can do stodgy. \u2022 More serious was the stoppage to the game caused by a number of ultras raising a banner depicting Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp in crosshairs, seemingly in support of their Dortmund counterparts days after BVB fans were banned from travelling to Hoffenheim for the next two years for displaying an identical banner. Sporting director Max Eberl and captain Lars Stindl attempted to reason with those fans, as did the stadium announcer, and Eberl later told Sky he felt \u201dashamed\u201d of the incident. \u2022 There was another 5-0 away win, as K\u00f6ln celebrated Karneval season in great style by running riot at Hertha Berlin.

The victory was overshadowed by an ankle injury to the talismanic Kevin Volland, however, suffered in the Europa League win over Porto and worse than initially thought. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d grimaced coach Peter Bosz. \u201cKevin will be absent for a long time.\u201d",

In some cryptic devices, the setter must give the exact word that needs to be played with: for the answer CARNIVOROUS, he or she can put \u201coutbreak of coronavirus\u201d, but not \u201cnasty disease\u201d.

How should it be for the carrollism? Peter\u2019s sample clue gives you exactly the words needed (\u201csniff\u201d and \u201cwheeze\u201d): fairer, but too constricting?</p> <p>The final item on the council\u2019s agenda is to do with sounds. Would it be good form to clue RENO by \u201crendezvous with casino, wrote Carroll\u201d, or is the difference between \u201ceno\u201d and \u201cino\u201d a dealbreaker?</p> <p>Council is now in session.

In our cluing competition for SNEEZE, Peter Moore Fuller proposes this wordplay: \u2026 \u2018a sniff and a wheeze\u2019 wrote Carroll In other words, we are acting as if an answer in the puzzle was created by Lewis Carroll, who was fond of inventing words by bolting together bits of existing ones: if something is miserable as well as flimsy, we can now, thanks to Carroll, describe it as \u201cmimsy\u201d. As Peter points out, this is not unlike the spoonerism (which we take a look at here): not only is the answer produced by mangling other words, but the device is indicated by the name of the author. How should the Crossword Council rule on this? Well, this imaginary body values kindness to the solver above all else. So the carrollism gets marks immediately for making itself obvious to the solver through the presence of the word \u201cCarroll\u201d (although it seems likely that setters will be tempted to use \u201cwrote the deacon\u201d in the same way that some disguise their spoonerisms with \u201cthe reverend\u2019s\u201d and the like). And the words that need to be carrollised? In some cryptic devices, the setter must give the exact word that needs to be played with: for the answer CARNIVOROUS, he or she can put \u201coutbreak of coronavirus\u201d, but not \u201cnasty disease\u201d. Other times, the fodder can be hinted at \u2026 14d So long to Spooner\u2019s dog-end? (6-3) \u2026 such as when Qaos asks you to dream up \u201cpoodle-tip\u201d en route to TOODLE-PIP. How should it be for the carrollism? Peter\u2019s sample clue gives you exactly the words needed (\u201csniff\u201d and \u201cwheeze\u201d): fairer, but too constricting? The final item on the council\u2019s agenda is to do with sounds. Would it be good form to clue RENO by \u201crendezvous with casino, wrote Carroll\u201d, or is the difference between \u201ceno\u201d and \u201cino\u201d a dealbreaker? Council is now in session. If you enjoy this not-100% serious exercise, we could before long take a look at this habit of taking the letters in positions indicated by prime numbers.",

There are also fears the European Union could ban imports of pheasant, wood pigeon, grouse and other types of game from the UK, unless action was taken. Sales of game meat have risen in successive years after a number of initiatives, along with the establishment of the British Game Alliance to promote its consumption, but there are fears inspection will not eradicate the risk of consuming lead particles. Hunters will now be expected to transition to using ammunition made with steel, bismuth or other non-toxic metals. Shooting animals with lead ammunition has been illegal in Denmark for 25 years and California banned it for all hunting last year. Petrol, paint, pipes and other materials had lead removed from them decades ago, as evidence of its toxicity mounted. Shooting wildfowl with lead was banned in 1999 but enforcement has been lax and research in England has found that more than 70% of ducks are shot with lead. \u201cLead is a poison, and we should be taking every step possible to remove it from our environment,\u201d said the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust\u2019s director of conservation, Dr James Robinson, who welcomed the shooting fraternity showing leadership. \u201cWe need a full transition to non-toxic ammunition \u2013 and soon \u2013 to reduce the many thousands of tonnes of lead ammunition which accumulate in our environment every year. \u201cWe look forward to the UK government and the devolved administrations catching up and introducing new legislation to remove all lead ammunition from our game meat, and importantly from the environment.\u201d The statement was signed by BASC, the Countryside Alliance, British Game Alliance, Country Land and Business Association, Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Gamekeepers\u2019 Organisation, Moorland Association, Scottish Land &amp; Estates and Scottish Association for Country Sports. Until Monday morning, BASC had warned on its website against the restriction of any aspect of shooting, such as the prohibition of lead shot, since \u201can attack on shooters will be seen as an attack on the countryside itself\u201d. \u201cThe evidence shows that proper processing of game meat eradicates the risk,\u201d it had said. However, BASC has effectively admitted myths were spread to defend the use of lead ammunition, including that more people would break their teeth on the alternatives and that lead was less likely to ricochet than steel shot. In 2016, the then Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs minister, Liz Truss, deemed that the proven risks to human health and wildlife from lead ammunition were not significant enough to change current policy, following an expert report that recommended a general ban. Defra welcomed the move away from lead and applauded the shooting organisations for reaching the decision, without commenting on the calls for a ban. Meanwhile, the department announced last week it would review whether to introduce tighter safeguards to govern the release of non-native game birds around vulnerable habitats following concern over their impact, as scrutiny on the impact of hunting on the environment grows.",

Despite the best efforts by authorities in Ahmedabad to quash all signs of dissent, a group of students staged a moving protest through the city against what they described as a \u201cfascist alliance\u201d between Trump and Modi. \u201cThis kind of visit is part of a wider alliance between authoritarian and far-right political formations across the world,\u201d said Ajin Thomas, who took part in the demonstration. \u201cIn both cases, it is democracy that is in peril.\u201d",

You can shoot a movie or record an album on a smartphone, you can become a household name with a webcam and a YouTube channel, and you can download any of a dozen applications and build a video game from nothing.</p> <p>But the latter is an intimidating notion. Games are ultimately complex mechanisms, constructed from code, involving physics, narrative, animation and audio. There has been a deliberate effort within the industry to make creative tools more accessible, arguably spearheaded by Unity, a technology that both powers games and lets users create them \u2013 and yet, designing and constructing a game can feel overwhelming. Even the first step, having confidence in your ideas, is a difficult one. It\u2019s also where Media Molecule\u2019s ambitious new PlayStation 4 release Dreams comes in.</p> <p>Dreams isn\u2019t just a game with a level building mode and it certainly isn\u2019t a traditional game development tool like Unity.

I don\u2019t record myself every time, or put it on YouTube. I just enjoy doing it because when you\u2019re in the midst of doing it, to me, that\u2019s what the word \u2018art\u2019 means.\u201d</p> <p>Healey and his colleagues often compare Dreams to a notepad for doodling or a toy box in which you can tinker for the sheer joy of it. But you can release completed creations out into the world via the game\u2019s community. In fact, a rather sterile term best defines Dreams. It is a platform: a place where you can build games using simple, surprisingly instinctive tools. Or you can use it to craft an animated scene that isn\u2019t a game, paint in 3D, or just compose music.</p> <p>Dreams\u2019 lineage actually goes back to the series of platform games that first brought Media Molecule fame. The LittleBigPlanet titles always put user-generated content at the centre of the experience, providing a wealth of simple tools to get players making their own levels.</p> <p>The studio\u2019s latest release ups the ambition by allowing a vast amount of creative freedom. With an early build of Dreams available to some players since April 2019, many have simply chosen to create content that other users can place in their creations: models of trees or even office furniture. That\u2019s something Media Molecule actively fosters, in fact. Recognising that games are commonly made through numerous contributions by different individuals, Dreams is deeply informed by remix culture and the idea of creative collaboration. Yet Media Molecule\u2019s platform has also been used to create some very impressive things, from the strikingly polished to the daringly original.</p> <p>SlidEout 3019, for example, is a loving homage to the Wipeout racing series that has stunned even the lead Dreams team, and enjoyed considerable viral success. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECRHMMwf5OU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ECRHMMwf5OU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cSomeone was saying to the guy that made it: \u2018Well, why didn\u2019t you do this in Unity? Why didn\u2019t you use a professional game engine?\u2019,\u201d remembers Alex Evans, Media Molecule co-founder and technical director. \u201cHe gave some really interesting answers. He had previously had no idea he could have made what he made. He only made it because I stumbled into it after he picked up Dreams. He was messing around and suddenly, you know, he was putting a lot of effort into it, and he made a popular game. It was brilliant, and that\u2019s somebody who probably would never have thought to have tried to make such an ambitious game.\u201d</p> <p>And that is the aim with Dreams. The Media Molecule team are equally quick to add that it will suit people with a clear, ambitious idea for a game. But encouraging creativity and shooing away imposter syndrome are core to what Dreams is. Indeed, the included campaign mode game Art\u2019s Story tells the studio\u2019s own tale of creative self-doubt and discovery.</p> <p>\u201cI really hope it\u2019s a bridge for people to get into zones that they have dreamed about getting into really, so people can end up getting into maybe the games industry or another creative role,\u201d says Healey. \u201cBut what I really hope is that someone makes a game in Dreams that is so good we have to put on the PSN store as a standalone game, and then it sells more than Dreams. That\u2019s what I would really want to see; sort of our greatest achievement.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7SIdSzdVBg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i7SIdSzdVBg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Evans has an even grander vision. \u201cI\u2019d want someone to go and collect an Oscar and say: \u2018I\u2019m doing this now because I picked up a video game 10 years ago called Dreams\u2019,\u201d he reveals. \u201cI\u2019d love for that to happen, and I think it will, or could. On a smaller scale we\u2019re hiring people from this community already, so it\u2019s almost already happening.\u201d</p> <p>One of those people is Jamie Breeze, a former teacher turned Dreams community content creator, who now works at Media Molecule, having fallen for his new employer\u2019s output early in the LittleBigPlanet series. \u201cAs a kid, I always wanted to be in games eventually, but that\u2019s not very realistic, is it? I just thought I\u2019m going to try something that\u2019s a bit more down-to-earth. So I went for teaching and I enjoyed it. Of course, it\u2019s a brilliant contribution to the world. But with Dreams I feel like I\u2019ve got a wider sort of audience since I can inspire more people by doing this. I was limited as a teacher, in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Teaching remains a vital societal contribution; there\u2019s little doubt about that.

She has been kidnapped from outside the chess tournament she was competing in, and is being kept in a cellar beneath the woods. Here she is found by Elijah, 12, who has always lived in the woods. He\u2019s never had a proper friend, and now that he\u2019s stumbled upon Elissa, he\u2019s reluctant to let her go. There\u2019s a nightmarish, fairytale quality to Sam Lloyd\u2019s debut thriller, which switches between timelines and perspectives: the horrors Elissa\u2019s mother is going through; the strange life Elijah leads; the brilliantly sharp mind of Elissa as she weighs up her options for escape. And then, painfully and honestly, there\u2019s the world of DS Mairead MacCullagh, who might be exactly the right woman for the job, but is also trying to ignore the miscarriage she might be in the middle of. The dreamy nature of the story slowly dissipates as the danger deepens, leaving this reader with pounding heart and sweating palms.</p> <h2>The Guest List <br>Lucy Foley</h2> <p><em>HarperCollins, \u00a312.99, pp384</em></p> <p>Lucy Foley\u2019s first thriller, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/01/scrublands-the-hunting-party-my-name-is-anna-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Hunting Party</em></a>, told the story of a party of old friends snowed in at a Highland lodge when a murder occurs. It was a huge bestseller. Her second follows a similar formula \u2013 this time, it\u2019s a wedding on a remote Irish island, where the friends are trapped by a storm. The body is, again, discovered early on, and Foley\u2019s narrative again flits between alternative points of view: Jules, the perfectionist bride trying not to think about the mysterious note she received; the celebrity groom and his old school friends who went to the sort of horrific boarding school where \u201conly the strong survived\u201d; the wedding planner who thinks, \u201cterrible things happen, I learned that while I was still a child\u201d. Everyone appears to have a motive and a dark tragic secret in their past, and the mounting sense of doom is piled on pretty thick. It\u2019s bound to be another hit.</p> <h2>The Holdout <br>Graham Moore</h2> <p><em>Orion, \u00a312.99, pp336</em></p> <p>Maya Seale is a brilliant defence attorney. We meet her successfully defending a woman who has cut her abusive husband\u2019s head off with a pair of gardening shears. But this has nothing to do with anything: Maya, it turns out, is a notorious woman herself. Notorious because 10 years earlier, she was part of the jury ruling on the disappearance of 15-year-old heiress Jessica Silver, who vanished on the way home from school. Maya managed to convince her fellow jurors that there was not enough evidence to convict Jessica\u2019s teacher, Bobby Nock, of the crime, and he was judged not guilty \u2013 to the rage of Jessica\u2019s parents, who all believe he did it, and the rest of the world. Now a podcast is planning a docuseries about the old case, and Maya\u2019s been reluctantly ordered to get involved. Then one of the jury members winds up dead, and she becomes the prime suspect. Written in snappy chapters, and short, bullish sentences, this is a lot of (silly, gripping) fun.</p> <h2>Firewatching <br>Russ Thomas</h2> <p><em>Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a312.99, pp432</em></p> <p>DS Adam Tyler makes his debut in Russ Thomas\u2019s debut novel. Sidelined to the cold case review unit in Sheffield, Tyler manages to finagle his way on to a current case when a corpse is discovered bricked into a room \u2013 \u201cprobably alive when he went in\u201d \u2013 in a house that has been destroyed by fire. As Tyler investigates, dealing with latent and not-so-latent homophobia among his colleagues, more fires start springing up, and the cold case suddenly isn\u2019t quite so cold any more.

It\u2019s certainly hidden France: we met no other Brits there earlier this month (February). There were only two runs open in this gem of a ski resort, so we walked through woods to an impressive waterfall \u2013 La Grande Cascade \u2013 along a path leading to the top of the ridge for a sunny picnic. We forwent watching the Six Nations in our lovely Airbnb flat to drink hot rum at a jolly <em>buvette</em> in the square and saw France beat England on its TV. We spent less than \u00a31,000 on fares, flat, ski pass and food for a week.<br><strong>Liz Little</strong></p> \n<h2>Cycling and camping in the Vercors, near Grenoble</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f8f6569a1c56c40cd8204e3106a95413c404bc98\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8f6569a1c56c40cd8204e3106a95413c404bc98/0_101_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vercors The view north-west over Combe Laval\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/aug/06/electric-bikes-france-vercors-grenoble-mountains-forests-outdoors\" title=\"\">Vercors</a> is a French version of the Lost World, surrounded by vertical cliffs south-west of Grenoble. Those who make the 1,000-metre climb up one of the winding access roads are rewarded by deep gorges, limestone cliffs and alpine meadows. Simultaneously pastoral and rugged, it is an ideal area for a wide range of outdoor activities. One of the strongholds of the resistance during the second world war, it has a number of poignant memorial sites. I visited as part of a cross-France cycle tour and made the delightful <em>camping municipal</em> at <a href=\"http://www.lachapelleenvercors.fr/434/\" title=\"\">La Chapelle-en-Vercors</a> (pitch from \u20ac3, adult \u20ac5 each) my base for a rest day. <br><strong>Steve Rock </strong></p> \n<h2>Ch\u00e2teau de Pennautier, near Carcassonne, Occitanie</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5a1a0d1b5492d65c34a504b96c249dae345305c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5a1a0d1b5492d65c34a504b96c249dae345305c/0_206_1365_819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"chateau de pennautier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Just outside Carcassonne, lies the much less-known village of Pennautier. This unassuming spot is picture perfect, with narrow and winding streets in its tightly knit old town, hiding the true gem of the place, the Ch\u00e2teau de Pennautier. At this gorgeous 17th-century palace where Louis XIII once stayed, you can explore the beautiful grounds and even host events. Just over the river from the chateau and old town is a lovely traditional <em>boulodrome</em> (<em>bo</em><em>ules</em> pitch) and a restaurant selling a wonderful selection of wines from the surrounding vineyards.

Ten minutes from the A26, its gorgeous 16th-century timbered buildings are a step back in history. Although small, the village is alive with restaurants, shops, cafes, a delicatessen and, quite uniquely, the sight of craftspeople and artists working away in their studios. From the main square you peer through the open windows of shop fronts and catch a glimpse of artisans toiling at the back. There are so few places left like this in the world \u2013 where you see real crafts people creating their goods and their love and pride in what they are doing is so evident.

Having some time between rounds I went for a wander. The town appears to be typical French modern: big supermarket, cheap hotels and bars. But then I walked further and discovered that there was a complete walled medieval village in the centre. I was totally astonished by the citadel area, views over battlements and the River Thouet, which curves around the town, and so many ancient houses. My UK neighbours recently visited on my advice and came back thanking us profusely, saying there was so much they didn\u2019t know what to photograph.

It\u2019s certainly hidden France: we met no other Brits there earlier this month (February). There were only two runs open in this gem of a ski resort, so we walked through woods to an impressive waterfall \u2013 La Grande Cascade \u2013 along a path leading to the top of the ridge for a sunny picnic. We forwent watching the Six Nations in our lovely Airbnb flat to drink hot rum at a jolly buvette in the square and saw France beat England on its TV. We spent less than \u00a31,000 on fares, flat, ski pass and food for a week. Liz Little Cycling and camping in the Vercors, near Grenoble The Vercors is a French version of the Lost World, surrounded by vertical cliffs south-west of Grenoble. Those who make the 1,000-metre climb up one of the winding access roads are rewarded by deep gorges, limestone cliffs and alpine meadows. Simultaneously pastoral and rugged, it is an ideal area for a wide range of outdoor activities. One of the strongholds of the resistance during the second world war, it has a number of poignant memorial sites. I visited as part of a cross-France cycle tour and made the delightful camping municipal at La Chapelle-en-Vercors (pitch from \u20ac3, adult \u20ac5 each) my base for a rest day. Steve Rock Ch\u00e2teau de Pennautier, near Carcassonne, Occitanie Just outside Carcassonne, lies the much less-known village of Pennautier. This unassuming spot is picture perfect, with narrow and winding streets in its tightly knit old town, hiding the true gem of the place, the Ch\u00e2teau de Pennautier. At this gorgeous 17th-century palace where Louis XIII once stayed, you can explore the beautiful grounds and even host events. Just over the river from the chateau and old town is a lovely traditional boulodrome (boules pitch) and a restaurant selling a wonderful selection of wines from the surrounding vineyards. It\u2019s a perfect day out. Maddy Arts and flowers, La Gacilly, Brittany The flower-filled town of La Gacilly, 37 miles south-west of Rennes, is home to around 30 craft boutiques and a botanical garden founded by the plant-inspired cosmetics pioneer Yves Rocher, which is open all year, free entry, and with a great cafe alongside the picturesque River Aff. From June to September the place is taken over by France\u2019s largest open-air photography festival, dedicated to nature and the planet, with giant images on building facades and panels throughout town.

Are you planning to hole up indoors while a pandemic, natural disaster or terrorist attack runs its course? Blake\u2019s company \u2013 Emergency Food Storage UK \u2013 has got you covered, but it\u2019s not cheap: \u00a3385 will buy you one month of food, as long as you like freeze-dried macaroni cheese and chicken-fried rice.</p> <p>The prices aren\u2019t putting Blake\u2019s customers off. Since coronavirus emerged in China in December, he has been swamped with orders. In the last two weeks alone, Emergency Food has done as much business as it normally would in six months. Which is bad news for anyone thinking now might be a good time to stock up on some of its powdered custard apple crunch, because it\u2019s all gone.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all we have left,\u201d says Blake, gesturing around his half-empty warehouse. (He has insisted I keep the location secret, for security reasons. He has also refused to tell me his age, for reasons that are unclear.) The shelves are mostly bare, save for some tins of spaghetti bolognese, chilli and three-bean stew. In the corner are water filtration devices: a jerrycan with built-in antibacterial filter, and smaller, more portable bottles.</p> <p>We are actually in the smaller warehouse Blake uses to house his personal supplies, and orders that have yet to be filled.

      "bodyText": "James Blake, the owner of Europe\u2019s largest emergency food supplier, is one of the few people to be doing good business out of coronavirus. Are you planning to hole up indoors while a pandemic, natural disaster or terrorist attack runs its course? Blake\u2019s company \u2013 Emergency Food Storage UK \u2013 has got you covered, but it\u2019s not cheap: \u00a3385 will buy you one month of food, as long as you like freeze-dried macaroni cheese and chicken-fried rice. The prices aren\u2019t putting Blake\u2019s customers off. Since coronavirus emerged in China in December, he has been swamped with orders. In the last two weeks alone, Emergency Food has done as much business as it normally would in six months. Which is bad news for anyone thinking now might be a good time to stock up on some of its powdered custard apple crunch, because it\u2019s all gone. \u201cThis is all we have left,\u201d says Blake, gesturing around his half-empty warehouse. (He has insisted I keep the location secret, for security reasons. He has also refused to tell me his age, for reasons that are unclear.) The shelves are mostly bare, save for some tins of spaghetti bolognese, chilli and three-bean stew. In the corner are water filtration devices: a jerrycan with built-in antibacterial filter, and smaller, more portable bottles. We are actually in the smaller warehouse Blake uses to house his personal supplies, and orders that have yet to be filled. There was no point in showing me his main warehouse, because it\u2019s empty. These are busy times for his company, which has also had to contend with public fears about Brexit affecting the food supply. The \u00a3375 Brexit Box \u2013 featuring 60 main meals, a water filter and firestarter \u2013 flew off the shelves last year. Blake sources his food from a factory in Lancashire, which is working 24/7 to replenish his stock. In addition to shipping Brexit Boxes direct to consumers, Blake says that Emergency Food also supplies government departments, although he won\u2019t reveal which. And you\u2019ll find his freeze-dried emergency food on the RRS Sir David Attenborough, commonly known as Boaty McBoatface. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at a zombie apocalypse situation,\u201d Blake admits. \u201cMost short-term issues can be resolved in time.\u201d Still, \u201cWe should all just be a little more self-reliant.\u201d Self-reliance is the organising principle of Blake\u2019s life: he grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormons, and food preparation is an integral part of Mormon life. As a child, Blake would watch his mother store and preserve food. \u201cWheat was a big thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would always have a few containers.\u201d Although he left the Mormons in his 20s, some habits are hard to shake: opening a ceiling hatch, Blake reveals a secret stash of foil-lined bags of wheat. He argues that the people buying from him are the opposite of selfish. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting the food in the supermarket, by purchasing your supplies from a different point.\u201d He doesn\u2019t like the word stockpiling \u2013 but prepping won\u2019t work either. \u201cPrepping has a negative connotation perpetuated by the media,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they see preppers as often quite crazy.\u201d He favours the term \u201cfood storage\u201d, which he sees as more neutral. \u201cIf you think about what\u2019s in your kitchen cupboard today,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s a few tins of beans, some manky rice.

      "bodyText": "The BBC has decided not to appeal against the equal pay case involving the Newswatch presenter Samira Ahmed after she won an employment tribunal against the broadcaster, giving hope to other women seeking back pay from the national broadcaster. Ahmed successfully claimed she was owed almost \u00a3700,000 in back pay because of the difference between her \u00a3440-an-episode rate and the \u00a33,000 an episode Jeremy Vine received for hosting Points of View, a similar programme to Newswatch. An employment tribunal unanimously concluded in January that the BBC had failed to provide convincing evidence that the pay gap was for reasons other than gender discrimination. The BBC had argued, among other issues, that Vine deserved a higher pay packet as he was more famous and had a \u201cglint in his eye\u201d, but the tribunal said it did not provide sufficient evidence that this was the case. The BBC initially objected to the ruling but has now declined to appeal against it, reaching an undisclosed financial settlement with Ahmed. The presenter, who was supported by the National Union of Journalists, has not commented on the settlement, but after the tribunal verdict she said: \u201cI love working for the BBC. No woman wants to have to take action against their own employer.\u201d In their verdict the tribunal judges said there were only \u201cminor differences\u201d in the work Ahmed and Vine did presenting the two comparable viewer feedback programmes. They wrote: \u201cJeremy Vine read the script from the autocue. He read it in the tone in which it was written. If it told him to roll his eyes, he did.

Equal pay \u2013 which covers gender discrimination between individuals doing the same or equivalent work \u2013 is different to the wider societal issue of the gender pay gap.

We knew we just had to knuckle down and have a really good partnership to get ourselves back in the game. Just getting a partnershop going \u2013 that was really the key message when I got out there. The ball was sliding on. I don\u2019t think turn or swing was playing too much of a factor by the time I got out there.

But that brought Rachael Haynes to the crease, a player blessed with poise and power. Along with Lanning, they systematically set about getting the job done from a tough spot, and duly did. For Sri Lanka\u2019s part, they will rue dropped catches (not least Haynes on 26) and a poor DRS referral, which essentially cost them Lanning\u2019s scalp early in her stay.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e539d8e8f0811db2fafd542\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:56:42.892Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">AUSTRALIA WIN BY FIVE WICKETS!

Lanning has flirted with her luck well outside the off-stump off Siriwardena and this time the outside edge has bounced out of Sanjeewani\u2019s gloves. Despair for the Sri Lankans. Of course, the Aussie skipper makes them pay right away, slogging the next ball over midwicket for four. Nicola Carey, in at No6 instead of Perry because she is left-handed (seriously; Perry isn\u2019t in the Australian top six) finishes the set with a boundary of her own, hammering long down to long on. They have eight runs left to collect in these final two overs. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e539b548f08e13324748fd1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:48:27.428Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

That\u2019s surely their last hope gone. It was a straightforward chance on the long-on rope, a full toss hit straight down to Dilhari. Not to be. Earlier in the over, Lanning got in on the act with a commanding pull for four. <strong>Australia need 18 runs from 18 balls.</strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e539a228f086a28115b1603\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:43:46.855Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Haynes to 50!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>16th over: Australia 97-3 (Lanning 27, Haynes 58) </strong>There it is! Haynes has played so well; so cleverly. It was all leading up to this moment, heaving Kumari for <strong>CONSECUTIVE SIXES </strong>over cow corner! Down the track, bang... and bang again. Suddenly, Australia need about a run a ball and that is that. The first of the blows raised her half-century in 43 deliveries. Dropped earlier, sure, but a super knock.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5398dd8f0811db2fafd515\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:37:50.768Z\">9.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>15th over: Australia 79-3 (Lanning 26, Haynes 43) </strong> Class! Haynes <em>once again</em> takes a calculated risk from the first ball of an over, coming down the track and lifting Atapattu over midwicket for four. From there, they milk four singles. Easy. The updated equation is 44 from 30. In reality, it comes down to whether Sri Lanka can remove both of these players pronto. Nothing else matters while they\u2019re there.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e53980a8f08e13324748fab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:34:33.064Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>14th over: Australia 71-3 (Lanning 24, Haynes 37) </strong>Dilhari again<strong> </strong>to complete her spell but just as it was in her previous set, Haynes goes at the first ball, middling it straight past the spinner for four. Lovely shot. She looks the matchwinner here. Three more singles follow, back to that risk-free formula with a boundary banked. WinViz has the home side at 88 per cent now, which feels about right. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/_hypocaust/status/1231872411169181696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dilhari is the only bowler I&#39;m aware of to have carried out a Mankad in women&#39;s international cricket.<br><br>This game has had everything else so far...<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUSvSL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AUSvSL</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/T20WorldCup?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#T20WorldCup</a></p>&mdash; hypocaust (@_hypocaust) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_hypocaust/status/1231872411169181696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 24, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e53972f8f086a28115b15dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:29:55.484Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>13th over: Australia 64-3 (Lanning 23, Haynes 31) </strong>So close!

Again, no risks. They are just pumping these strokes out to the fielders on the rope. It makes sense but it is not for nothing that the required rate is now 8.5 an over.

This is wonderfully placed with Australia just 45 at halfway. Sure, they should still win from here with two set players and endless talent to come. But Sri Lanka, just as it was with India on Friday night, keep pushing that required rate up. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5393d78f08e13324748f97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T09:15:25.549Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>DILHARI TRAPS HAYNES LBW! </strong>Well, I said they needed a wicket and Dilhari has beaten the inside edge from around the wicket.

Earlier in the over, a dive was required by Haynes to complete a quick single but the throw wasn\u2019t the direct hit necessary for Sri Lanka.

She will face the first ball, to be sent down by Megan Schutt. <strong>PLAY! </strong><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e53732b8f0811db2fafd3e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T06:55:47.480Z\">6.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The players are on the field for anthems. </strong>I wonder whether they allow an extra couple of minutes for Sri Lanka\u2019s epic?

For our third and final day in Perth in this Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, we have a Group A doubleheader. In the first of those matches, Australia have the chance to get on the board after unexpectedly dropping the tournament opener on Friday to India. In reality, that means they need to win each of their three remaining pool games to secure qualification for the semi-finals and keep their dreams alive of turning out at a packed MCG for the decider on International Women\u2019s Day. </p> <p>But despite the fact that Sri Lanka are the fourth seed in this group, their teamsheet is headed by Chamari Atapattu. Meg Lanning\u2019s opposing skipper has made two international tons against her side, including a stunning unbeaten 178 off 143 deliveries during the 2017 World Cup. I was calling that innings on radio and it\u2019s one of the most remarkable I\u2019ve ever seen. And she\u2019s in great nick at the moment too, having single-handedly knocked off England in a warm-up fixture last week and smashed New Zealand around in the power play on Saturday.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the hosts won\u2019t go into this worried about one player. The reason they are the defending world champions and by far the top ranked side in this competition is because of their depth. The fact that they nearly crawled to the finish line on Friday after losing four wickets in two overs to India\u2019s legspinner Poonam Yadav, in a way, speaks to that. And Ellyse Perry doesn\u2019t often miss out twice in a row. Also, where better to bounce back than the pacy WACA track?</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now from me. Thanks for your company, yet another close World Cup scrap. This tournament really is set up brilliantly so keep following it throughout on the site and we\u2019ll be back with another OBO for England\u2019s next outing on Wednesday when they take on Thailand in Canberra. Bye for now! Rachael Haynes, the player of the match, spoke before too. \u201cIt was much easier batting out there; when I came off I couldn\u2019t watch that last little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cWalking out to bat, it wasn\u2019t an ideal situation, but knowing one of the best batters in the world is at the other end [helps]. We knew we just had to knuckle down and have a really good partnership to get ourselves back in the game. Just getting a partnershop going \u2013 that was really the key message when I got out there. The ball was sliding on. I don\u2019t think turn or swing was playing too much of a factor by the time I got out there. It was just about trusting your game.\u201d Meg Lanning speaks. As you would expect, she is happy Australia won. She acknowledges they got out of jail. Says that the plan was easy with Haynes as soon as she came to the middle: to build a partnership. Relieved to get off the mark and happy with the ball and in the field but knows they must do better with the bat. Chamari Atapattu speaks. Says she tried to play her natural game but got out at a bad time; knows it would have changed the game had she batted through. As always, she remains very positive about her young side. Check out the match report. We\u2019ll hear from the captains shortly. Looking to the games ahead for the two teams, Australia play Bangladesh on Thursday in Canberra and Sri Lanka cop India at Melbourne\u2019s Junction Oval on Friday. Far from the most convincing display. Australia get the win but they have been hard-held to say the least, Sri Lanka taking three early wickets to really put a rocket under the contest early in the chase. But that brought Rachael Haynes to the crease, a player blessed with poise and power. Along with Lanning, they systematically set about getting the job done from a tough spot, and duly did. For Sri Lanka\u2019s part, they will rue dropped catches (not least Haynes on 26) and a poor DRS referral, which essentially cost them Lanning\u2019s scalp early in her stay. 19.3 overs: Australia 123-5 (Lanning 41, Perry 3) Australia get their hard-fought win, Perry clipping two into the legside, Lanning making her ground with a dive. 19.2 overs - Perry steers a couple. Two from four balls needed. 19th over: Australia 119-5 (Lanning 41, Perry 1) Perry, in at No7, is off the mark from the the one ball she gets to look at in this 19th over, down to long-on with a single. She keeps the strike with four runs required to win from the final over. Bowled with the quicker ball, through Carey\u2019s gate. One to come in the 19th over. 18th over: Australia 115-4 (Lanning 38, Carey 5) You better believe it: another dropped catch! Lanning has flirted with her luck well outside the off-stump off Siriwardena and this time the outside edge has bounced out of Sanjeewani\u2019s gloves. Despair for the Sri Lankans. Of course, the Aussie skipper makes them pay right away, slogging the next ball over midwicket for four. Nicola Carey, in at No6 instead of Perry because she is left-handed (seriously; Perry isn\u2019t in the Australian top six) finishes the set with a boundary of her own, hammering long down to long on. They have eight runs left to collect in these final two overs. First ball of the tweaker\u2019s final over and she\u2019s beaten Haynes in flight, who was well down the track trying to smack another big one. She\u2019ll be frustrated to fall this close to the line but she played so well. A tiny glimmer of hope for Sri Lanka. 17th over: Australia 105-3 (Lanning 33, Haynes 60) Haynes dropped again! That\u2019s surely their last hope gone. It was a straightforward chance on the long-on rope, a full toss hit straight down to Dilhari. Not to be. Earlier in the over, Lanning got in on the act with a commanding pull for four. Australia need 18 runs from 18 balls. 16th over: Australia 97-3 (Lanning 27, Haynes 58) There it is! Haynes has played so well; so cleverly. It was all leading up to this moment, heaving Kumari for CONSECUTIVE SIXES over cow corner! Down the track, bang... and bang again. Suddenly, Australia need about a run a ball and that is that. The first of the blows raised her half-century in 43 deliveries. Dropped earlier, sure, but a super knock. 15th over: Australia 79-3 (Lanning 26, Haynes 43) Class! Haynes once again takes a calculated risk from the first ball of an over, coming down the track and lifting Atapattu over midwicket for four. From there, they milk four singles. Easy. The updated equation is 44 from 30. In reality, it comes down to whether Sri Lanka can remove both of these players pronto. Nothing else matters while they\u2019re there. 14th over: Australia 71-3 (Lanning 24, Haynes 37) Dilhari again to complete her spell but just as it was in her previous set, Haynes goes at the first ball, middling it straight past the spinner for four. Lovely shot. She looks the matchwinner here. Three more singles follow, back to that risk-free formula with a boundary banked. WinViz has the home side at 88 per cent now, which feels about right. 13th over: Australia 64-3 (Lanning 23, Haynes 31) So close! Haynes is dropped on the fielding circle at mid-on, Siriwardena putting the chance down off her captain. It doesn\u2019t deter the left-hander, who plays the same shot again but with slightly more elevation later in the over, getting two more for it. Such fine margins here. 12th over: Australia 56-3 (Lanning 21, Haynes 25) Okay, four more singles. Again, no risks. They are just pumping these strokes out to the fielders on the rope. It makes sense but it is not for nothing that the required rate is now 8.5 an over. Nothing changes for Sri Lanka: they need to see a new player (or two) out there. 11th over: Australia 52-3 (Lanning 19, Haynes 23) All of the Haynes experience is on display here, getting into position early to lap the Kumari\u2019s first ball for four. With those runs in the can, they are happy to absorb a couple of dots. No risks yet. 10th over: Australia 45-3 (Lanning 18, Haynes 17) Dilhari didn\u2019t get the wicket but she didn\u2019t cough up a boundary ball after it was overturned, either. This is wonderfully placed with Australia just 45 at halfway. Sure, they should still win from here with two set players and endless talent to come. But Sri Lanka, just as it was with India on Friday night, keep pushing that required rate up. DILHARI TRAPS HAYNES LBW! Well, I said they needed a wicket and Dilhari has beaten the inside edge from around the wicket. But Haynes has sent it upstairs right away... she\u2019s right to do so, NOT OUT the new decision because she hit it. 9th over: Australia 41-3 (Lanning 17, Haynes 15) Now to Kumari for her left-arm orthodox. She doesn\u2019t get away with a long-hop to begin, Haynes all over it with a controlled cut for four. She\u2019s into her groove after that, both Australians satisfied with singles. With both players now set, the pressure is back onto Sri Lanka. They have to find a wicket and they have to find it pretty much straight away, I reckon. 8th over: Australia 32-3 (Lanning 16, Haynes 7) The veteran offie replaced by the youngster Dilhari and she\u2019s pleading for a caught behind decision to go her way, Lanning for the second time in this innings ever so close to edging a delivery well outside the off-stump. The experienced Australian duo are finding a bit of rhythm now though, hitting the sweepers. Oooooh, technology shows Lanning did hit that earlier in the over! But Sri Lanka already burned their review. Oh no. 7th over: Australia 27-3 (Lanning 13, Haynes 6) Paobodani does send down her final set on the bounce but it doesn\u2019t quite go to plan, Lanning leaping on some width to carve a much-needed boundary. Earlier in the over, a dive was required by Haynes to complete a quick single but the throw wasn\u2019t the direct hit necessary for Sri Lanka. The end of a magnificent spell, 2/17 from the left-armers\u2019 four overs. 6th over: Australia 19-3 (Lanning 7, Haynes 4) Well how about that, Australia make just 19 runs in the power play, losing three wickets in the process. Forget what I said about half an hour ago about knocking the runs off quickly to boost their Net Run Rate, yeah? Romeo is on me about this too: \u201cI suggest you refrain from saying things like \u201cthis really shouldn\u2019t be a bother\u201d. Not very wise. He also asks about my young daughter, who is ten days old today. She\u2019s the best. I had a big cuddle with her during the innings break. A far better use of my time than a cup of tea. 5th over: Australia 16-3 (Lanning 6, Haynes 2) Lanning steers Prabodhani - who to this point, has been doing a Mitch Starc impression - down to the rope. But she\u2019s kept quiet for the rest of the over, solid in defence. No risks allowed at this point. They have to bowl out the left-armer, she has the Australians playing her game. \u201cThis World Cup has been one of those which just keeps on giving,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cThe Atapattu half-century was one of best seen in women\u2019s cricket in recent times, as it often is when she gets going. A wicket before any runs on the board means the game is well and truly on now. Smart batting will get the Aussies home, but a few stumbles and a reminder about the thrilling nature of the matches played so far will surely not inspire much confidence.\u201d Let\u2019s hope so! 4th over: Australia 11-3 (Lanning 2, Haynes 1) NOT OUT! It was the glove of Sanjeewani that made the noise. What DRAMA at the WACA Ground! And what a fantastic over from the 35-year-old. Australia now need 7 an over to win, too. HAS LANNING EDGED SIRIWARDENE? Atapattu thinks so, sending it straight upstairs! What a moment this is... stand by! AUSTRALIA 10-3! AUSTRALIA 10-3! Mooney dances at Siriwardene and misses, Sanjeewani does the rest behind the stumps with an assured take. Blimey! 3rd over: Australia 10-2 (Mooney 6, Lanning 2) Lanning off the mark from the one ball she has to deal with. Is there something special going on here? SHE\u2019S DONE IT AGAIN! Hoop dreams! Through Gardner\u2019s gate this time, who played back when she should have been forward. The ball crashes into the top of off-stump and Prabodhani is racing around like she\u2019s won Olympic gold. Sri Lanka have never beaten Australia in any women\u2019s international. Dare to dream? Wow. 2nd over: Australia 8-1 (Mooney 6, Gardner 2) Siriwardene, as always, bowling in a cap. The spinner gives Mooney a half-volley early in the over, which the left-hander directs through point for four no fuss at all. She knows the deal here. 1st over: Australia 2-1 (Mooney 1, Gardner 1) Ooh, she\u2019s got that lovely shape going to Gardner too, the No3 getting her bat down in time to get off the mark through midwicket. Mooney keeps the strike and gets her first run with a steer. We saw South Africa make very hard work of a comparable chase on this ground last night. A gorgeous inswinger castles Healy second ball! From over the wicket, Prabodhani slips through the gate with a gem! Sri Lanka celebrate accordingly. Whoa! The players are back on the field. It is Healy and Mooney; tried and true. Prabodhani to begin with her left-arm medium pace. PLAY! Good shout. After losing their first game, they need to keep New Zealand and India at bay on this measure. With Australia\u2019s depth, they should try and knock this off quickly. Sri Lanka will probably be happy with that. Atapattu batted wonderfully for her half-century, the defining contribution for Sri Lanka. Australia used seven bowlers along the way with Strano and Carey both taking wickets at important times. The home side leave the field satisfied as well - this really shouldn\u2019t be a bother. 20th over: Sri Lanka 122-6 (Siriwardena 5, Madavi 2) Your standard chaos from the final ball, a misfield a dive and all the rest. They get two from it though, to finish with total that will require Australia to go at just a touch better than a run a ball. IS MADAVI LBW FIRST BALL? She\u2019s given lbw. But that call is overturned via DRS; there\u2019s an inside edge on the way through. One delivery to go. Very tidy work from Healy, stumping Nilakshi after Jonassen slipped between bat and pad with her straighter, quicker one. A handy cameo all the same. 19th over: Sri Lanka 118-5 (Nilakshi 17, Siriwardena 4) Alright! Nilakshi does take it on and does it well! Inside-out over long-off she goes early in the Stano over, landing just inside the rope, getting four for it. From the next ball she steps back into her crease to play with the crossbat over midwicket for four more! 12 off the over, against the flow of play. Now they should get to 125. Stick the landing! 18th over: Sri Lanka 106-5 (Nilakshi 6, Siriwardena 2) They are limping to the finish line now, four unconvincing singles off Jonassen Sri Lanka\u2019s lot. How do they find a route to the boundary in these last couple of overs? They need one. 17th over: Sri Lanka 101-5 (Nilakshi 4, Siriwardena 0) Two wickets and two runs from the Strano over. I\u2019ll revise my prediction to 112. I\u2019ve seen this film before. Two wickets in three balls! How often do we see this with Sri Lanka? Atapattu goes and they lose their bundle - same old. Kanchana wasn\u2019t doing the wrong thing by trying to clobber Strano through the legside but her was sweep more a top edge, landing in the safe hands of Perry at deep backward square leg. Not a great time to lose another set player, Sanjeewani picking out Kimmince at midwicket after using her feet to take Strano on. The squeeze is very much on. 16th over: Sri Lanka 99-3 (Sanjeewani 23, Nilakshi 4) Not the most convincing strokeplay but they get through Perry\u2019s fourth and final over without further loss while adding four runs. They\u2019ll probably be happy with that. I predict 118. 15th over: Sri Lanka 95-3 (Sanjeewani 21, Nilakshi 2) Sure enough, the wicket has slowed the rate, just four singles from Strano\u2019s second set. 95 after 15 overs in a strudy base but Sri Lanka, for a change, need runs from non-Atapattu sources. Atapattu picks out Lanning at extra cover! It completes an eventful Carey over. Earlier in it, she drove her for four through cover then raised a half-century in 37 deliveries. There was also a delay when both batters were nearly run out on the same delivery after a mix-up. But it all that matters little compared to the downfall of the skipper, which could very well end up the defining moment of this game. 14th over: Sri Lanka 91-3 (Sanjeewani 19) 13th over: Sri Lanka 85-2 (Atapattu 45, Sanjeewani 18) Atapattu goes long again, this time lifting Jonassen over the midwicket rope! She has such clean hands; such wonderful timing. Nine off the over as the rain starts to fall in Perth. They are staying on the ground for now. Sri Lanka will want to remain out there, they have Australia in a fantastic position with the bonus now of a wet ball to bowl with. 12th over: Sri Lanka 76-2 (Atapattu 37, Sanjeewani 17) A nice little tickle from Atapattu, running Schutt away fine for four. A run out chance goes begging for Australia later in the over, Sanjeewani caught on the back foot running to the danger end after miscuing into the off-side. There was nothing wrong with Healy\u2019s bounce throw to Schutt over the stumps but she fails to take it cleanly. 11th over: Sri Lanka 68-2 (Atapattu 31, Sanjeewani 16) Strano is on for her first over in this the 11th; she bowled the first of the innings against India. It\u2019s another steady one for Sri Lanka, picking up five runs. Atapattu only faced two of the deliveries though, which is an increasingly important measure. They have to find a way to get her facing three to four an over from here, if not more. Eight an over from here will get them to an even 140 - realistic if Atapattu bats through. 10th over: Sri Lanka 63-2 (Atapattu 30, Sanjeewani 12) Carey once more and now the singles are coming, from all six balls of the over. Even without a boundary that\u2019s still very good batting, accumulating without risk. Sri Lanka are 63 at halfway. As the TV tells me, to put that in perspective, they average 88 against Australia completed T20 innings. It\u2019s all about Atapattu facing 30-35 more balls. 9th over: Sri Lanka 57-2 (Atapattu 27, Sanjeewani 9) Sanjeewari\u2019s job is to turn the strike over - keep it simple. But from the fingerspin of Gardner, into the attack for the first time, she is struggling to do so in the first half of the over so she has a pop at a sweep from outside the off-stump instead, edging over Healy\u2019s head for four! And she does it again! Almost a carbon copy of the delivery before it, this time the nick flies through first slip for four. Terribly frustrating for Australia. Well then! 8th over: Sri Lanka 49-2 (Atapattu 27, Sanjeewani 1) Kimmince, the middle-over specialist, into the attack with her deep bag of tricks. And it nearly pays off too, winning a fat top edge from Atapattu but it sails over short fine leg before tricking into the rope. Emphatic to finish! One of the shots of the tournament far, launching the medium pacer over long-off FOR SIX! Stand and deliver! Can she keep this going? Can she really pile the pressure on the Australians? In an effort to keep the good times rolling, Thimeshani tries to flay Carey over cover for a second time but miscues into the hands of Jonassen at mid-off. But still, her 20 off 20 with four boundaries has been an important early contribution. 7th over: Sri Lanka 38-2 (Atapattu 19) 6th over: Sri Lanka 32-1 (Atapattu 12, Thimeshani 19) We said off the top that Atapattu needs somebody to go with her and Thimeshani is doing that so far, keeping nice and still to Perry before flaying her over extra cover for her third boundary. Nothing wrong with that as an approach with the field up. Perry responds by banging in short at her but it is too short, called a wide. The shot of the day so far comes after that, Perry hammered through cover on the up; a glorious drive! Ten off the over all up, a power play of 32. They\u2019ll take that, now carrying plenty of positive energy into the accumuation phase of the innings. 5th over: Sri Lanka 22-1 (Atapattu 12, Thimeshani 10) The left-arm spin of Jonassen for the first time today and she\u2019s given Atapattu a loose delivery outside leg-stump to begin, lifted with ease on the sweep over the fielding circle and down to the rope. You cannot bowl there to her. An enthusiastic lbw shout follows when the Queenslander beats her with a quicker ball - sweeping again - but it is missing leg. There\u2019s nearly a mix-up with Thimeshani running when she needn\u2019t but she made it back to her ground with a dive. One power play over to go, Perry to bowl it. 4th over: Sri Lanka 17-1 (Atapattu 8, Thimeshani 9) Atapattu finishes with a beautiful looking off-drive but straight to the fielder. That makes four dots in a row from Perry to the Sri Lankan superstar, just what Australia want in the power play. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 16-1 (Atapattu 8, Thimeshani 8) Schutt jumping out of the blocks to begin her run-up, a feature of her approach. It doesn\u2019t help her when giving Atapattu something to hit on leg stump though, the Sri Lankan captain clipping her away over square leg for a boundary to get her afternoon going. But the South Australian rights back, landing a perfect off-cutter to beat the outside edge. Good cricket. Atapattu\u2019s turn to return serve, lofting an attractive drive over the fielders on the circle at cover for a second boundary, holding the pose for the photographers. Without overdoing this point, it is all about Chamari. If she can bat for 15 overs, Sri Lanka will finish with a very competitive tally. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 8-1 (Atapattu 0, Thimeshani 8) If a second slip was in position for Perry she would have had Thimeshani\u2019s wicket first ball! It was a lovely delivery, shaping away from the right-hander and kissing the edge on the way through. Instead, it beats the diving Lanning from first slip with four runs added - Sri Lanka are off the mark. She plays a far more attractive shot later in the over, stroking Perry straight back past her boots for a second boundary. 1st over: Sri Lanka 0-1 (Atapattu 0, Thimeshani 0) Well, after talking up Sri Lanka\u2019s power play exploits against New Zealand on Saturday where they added 51 without loss, this time around, by contrast, it is a wicket maiden first up. Superb from Schutt, who took some tap against India during the power play on Friday. Third ball, Madushika takes a swipe at Schutt outside the off-stump but gets very little of it, the ball ballooning to Mooney who takes an easy chance at point. Meg Lanning leads her side to the middle. This really is a task in two parts for the hosts: first, the have to contain/remove Atapattu, especially in this power play. Then, they need to squeeze Sri Lanka\u2019s fragile batting line-up. But they can\u2019t get ahead of themselves - one follows the other. Madushika joins her captain in the middle, going nicely so far on this trip; they added 60 against New Zealand. She will face the first ball, to be sent down by Megan Schutt. PLAY! The players are on the field for anthems. I wonder whether they allow an extra couple of minutes for Sri Lanka\u2019s epic? It cops a lot of grief but I\u2019m a fan. Oh, I neglected to mention off the top... if you are new to the OBO you can drop me an email at any time - or ping me a tweet if that\u2019s more your style. Australia: Alyssa Healy (wk), Beth Mooney, Ashleigh Gardner, Meg Lanning (c), Ellyse Perry, Rachael Haynes, Nicola Carey, Jess Jonassen, Delissa Kimmince, Molly Strano, Megan Schutt. Sri Lanka: Hasini Perera, Chamari Atapattu (c), Umesha Thimashini, Anushka Sanjeewani (wk), Harshitha Madavi, Shashikala Siriwardene, Nilakshi de Silva, Ama Kanchana, Kavisha Dilhari, Sugandika Kumari, Udeshika Prabodhani. \u201cWe want to play our positive cricket again today.\u201d Too right. It was lost in the coverage of their tournament opener on Saturday just how close they came to knocking off New Zealand on Saturday at this same ground. Meg Lanning says that Australia would have bowled had they won the toss, so they aren\u2019t too worried. She is wearing a new cap, to reflect her 100th game. \u201cIt looks like a typical Waca wicket with plenty of grass on it, it\u2019ll play well.\u201d All-rounder Nicola Carey is into the Australian XI in place of Annabel Sutherland. We\u2019re not far away from toss and teams. The word from the ground via Laura Jolly, CA\u2019s excellent women\u2019s cricket writer, is that \u201cSophie Molineux not warming up with the rest of the Aussie squad,\u201d she tweets. \u201cLooks like her recovery from a corked thigh continues.\u201d That should earn Molly Strano another opportunity. I wonder whether they\u2019ll be tempted to bite the bullet and pop Perry up the top of the list today? Not that she needs to bat higher than six in this line-up but just to get her right into the thick of the action after falling first ball on Friday. Can\u2019t hurt. Speaking of the skippers, it is Meg Lanning\u2019s 100th T20 International against Sri Lanka today and what a career it has been so far, the superstar still just 27 years of age. When reflecting on her journey so far we tend to think about her unparalleled ODI record but then you take a look at the numbers and realise she\u2019s made 2661 runs at this level at an average of 35 striking at 117 along the way. Then there have been the two tons, both record-breaking in their own right. The unbeaten 133 not out against England at Chelmsford during last year\u2019s Women\u2019s Ashes - in just 63 balls, reinforced that she really is the complete modern player. Hello. For our third and final day in Perth in this Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, we have a Group A doubleheader. In the first of those matches, Australia have the chance to get on the board after unexpectedly dropping the tournament opener on Friday to India. In reality, that means they need to win each of their three remaining pool games to secure qualification for the semi-finals and keep their dreams alive of turning out at a packed MCG for the decider on International Women\u2019s Day. But despite the fact that Sri Lanka are the fourth seed in this group, their teamsheet is headed by Chamari Atapattu. Meg Lanning\u2019s opposing skipper has made two international tons against her side, including a stunning unbeaten 178 off 143 deliveries during the 2017 World Cup. I was calling that innings on radio and it\u2019s one of the most remarkable I\u2019ve ever seen. And she\u2019s in great nick at the moment too, having single-handedly knocked off England in a warm-up fixture last week and smashed New Zealand around in the power play on Saturday. Nevertheless, the hosts won\u2019t go into this worried about one player. The reason they are the defending world champions and by far the top ranked side in this competition is because of their depth. The fact that they nearly crawled to the finish line on Friday after losing four wickets in two overs to India\u2019s legspinner Poonam Yadav, in a way, speaks to that. And Ellyse Perry doesn\u2019t often miss out twice in a row. Also, where better to bounce back than the pacy WACA track?",

The Social Democratic party (SPD) bucked the national trend by holding on to one of its few remaining strongholds, emerging top with 39% of the vote. The Greens, the SPD\u2019s junior coalition partner, doubled their share to 24.2%. The crisis in the CDU, which has been in turmoil since the resignation of the party leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, earlier this month, was deepened further after the centre-right party came third with only 11.2%, the second worst result at a state-level vote in the party\u2019s history.

Both the SPD and the Greens can claim to have put into practice the outcome of a 2013 referendum in favour of bringing the city\u2019s utilities grids back into public hands with considerable success. But as the only state elections scheduled in Germany this year, the outcome of the vote nonetheless has symbolic power. Coming just days after a racist gunman murdered 10 people in the western city of Hanau and weeks after a scandal over centre-right parties voting with the AfD in the eastern state of Thuringia, the Hamburg vote shows that the far right\u2019s aggressively nationalistic posturing and xenophobic rhetoric does not necessarily have to set the political agenda. While the total number of votes for the AfD remained relatively stable, the party\u2019s share was pushed down by an increased turnout in support of the centre-left, possibly in protest against the racially motivated attack in Hanau. For a CDU trying to establish whether the way out of Merkel\u2019s shadow involves sticking to her centrist course or tacking right, its poor showing among urban voters will offer food for thought.

But the show\u2019s reliance on hashtags and Islanders to accrue as large an Instagram following as possible makes it particularly susceptible to online abuses. Moral arguments aside, Love Island has gone from being good-bad TV to bad-bad TV. Though the incentives for appearing on it have changed, its format has barely evolved. The near identical conveyor belt of Chrises and Jesses and Jacks have long been a running joke online, as producers certainly have a \u201ctype on paper\u201d. \u201cTwists\u201d such as double dumpings and Casa Amor are as hackneyed as the obligatory end-of-series pool jump. In the show\u2019s five-year history, not a single Islander has ever chosen to steal the money from their partner at the finale when given the option. By its end, when Finley Tapp and Paige Turley were crowned series winners, the hour-long episodes airing six nights a week had begun to feel like a test of endurance. Yet few lessons appear to have been learned. The 2020 summer series has already been confirmed. On Sunday, the most read article on the Mirror\u2019s website involved contestant Shaughna Phillips looking \u201cunrecognisable\u201d after leaving the villa. In the same top five were two about Flack\u2019s suicide. The show lost its magic long ago \u2013 now it has lost its chance to end on a high.",

While that is the dismal reality for the coach Franco Smith and his players to reflect on before their trip to Ireland in a couple of weeks, it would be wrong to write off this talented group. The Azzurri are trying to play positive, entertaining rugby and players such as the back-row Jake Polledri, the wings Matteo Minozzi and Mattia Bellini and the fly-half Tommaso Allan have had their moments, especially in Paris, while Scotland were forced to scrap for success in Rome on Saturday.

      "bodyText": "Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez was 16 when he crossed into Brazil in June, fleeing a life of hunger on the streets of his disintegrating homeland. In Pacaraima, the Brazilian border town that is the main entry point for fleeing Venezuelans, he told social workers he hoped for a fresh start. Those dreams were short-lived. Less than four months later, on 7 October, Jes\u00fas\u2019sdisfigured corpse was found dumped in a wheelbarrow near an army-run shelter for refugees in the Amazon city of Boa Vista. Police have yet to catch his killers but suspect he was murdered by members of Brazil\u2019s biggest drug faction, the First Capital Command (PCC), after racking up a debt of just over \u00a350 ($65). Nonato Souza, who runs the government refuge where Jes\u00fas had lived, said the murder was an extreme example of the dangers facing young Venezuelans escaping into Brazil. But after six years of economic meltdown in Venezuela, Brazilian authorities say they are witnessing the arrival of more and more unaccompanied minors such as Jes\u00fas. Between July and December last year, at least 422 Venezuelan children and teenagers entered Brazil through its northern border without their parents or guardians, according to the public defender\u2019s office. Some were as young as 11. A recent report by the Venezuelan investigative news website Armando.info said 25,000 unaccompanied minors had left since 2015, mostly for Colombia and Brazil. The surge in arrivals has been such that the UN\u2019s agency for children, Unicef, recently opened two homes in Boa Vista, the nearest major city to the border, to cater specifically to young migrants. \u201cThey come to Brazil hoping to find some kind of work, to survive and to help their families back in Venezuela,\u201d said Ligia Prado da Rocha, a public defender who monitors incoming minors at the Brazilian border. Rocha said most of the underage and unaccompanied arrivals were \u2013 like Jes\u00fas \u2013 boys aged 15 to 17 who often ended up being exploited on the streets of Boa Vista. But younger children were also coming as Venezuela\u2019s economic implosion intensified. \u201cIn December, an 11-year-old boy and his 14-year-old cousin came over on their own to Pacaraima,\u201d Rocha said. \u201cThey said they\u2019d been living on the streets in Venezuela for a while and wanted a better life in Brazil.\u201d Venezuela\u2019s teenage refugees are impossible to miss on the streets of Boa Vista, a small city in Brazil\u2019s Roraima state that has borne the brunt of the worst migration crisis in modern South American history. Officials say a total of 60,000 Venezuelans have arrived here since the global collapse in oil prices in 2013 sent their country into an economic nose-dive. On a recent evening half a dozen teenage boys battled for the attention \u2013 and charity \u2013 of drivers near the city\u2019s bus station, their nationality betrayed by their Spanish pleas for help: \u201cUna ayuda, patr\u00f3n!\u201d \u201cToday I got three reais [about 50p or 70 cents],\u201d said Luis, a 17-year-old from Venezuela\u2019s Gu\u00e1rico state, after a day begging on Boa Vista\u2019s streets. Luis said he had abandoned Venezuela last October, leaving his 11-month-old son, Esdras, at home with his mother in order to seek food and work in Brazil. These days he sleeps on a sliver of cardboard on a wasteland by the bus station. \u201cWhat\u2019s my biggest dream? I\u2019d never thought about it,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably to see my son and my mom doing OK.\u201d Daniel, 16, arrived at the Brazilian border last August, penniless and starving, having been robbed of what few possessions he had while hitchhiking there on a truck. He grew up in the city of San F\u00e9lix, but was forced on to the streets at the age of 12 by the collapse of both his family and his country. After three years of living on the streets, he headed for the lawless gold mines of south Venezuela, where he spent six months before deciding it was too dangerous. In January, with the help of social workers, he managed to enroll himself in a Brazilian primary school where he, too, is hoping for a new start. \u201cThe thing I most want to do now is study,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cI want to make up for all the time I have lost.\u201d",

Conversely, then, you can eliminate soreness almost entirely by keeping the reps low, or doing moves that don\u2019t have an eccentric, such as throws and sled pushes.

The first is what bodybuilders aim to do, but the second is what your body would do \u2013 automatically \u2013 if you had to lift a car off a loved one. In sports where excess size is a negative, it is what competitors teach themselves to do. This is how female Olympic weightlifters in the lighter weight categories can outlift larger men. Getting big requires specific, targeted training, including lots of volume and extra calories and protein \u2013 and it almost never happens by accident.</p> <h2><strong>Scales are pointless</strong></h2> <p>This one\u2019s been popularised by modern fitness gurus, who will (fairly sensibly) point out that weight isn\u2019t a true measure of progress, as fluctuations in the amount of water being retained can lead to day-to-day shifts in the numbers, and putting on muscle can lead to the numbers going up while you\u2019re making progress in the right direction. This doesn\u2019t mean you should toss away your scales entirely. \u201cYes, you have to understand that short-term fluctuations are inevitable and don\u2019t represent changes in body fat,\u201d says Emma Storey-Gordon, the trainer/owner of ESG Fitness. \u201cBut, over time, changes in scale weight are predictive of body fat. Even if you are also building muscle, the rate at which you can lose fat will be much quicker than the rate at which you can build muscle.\u201d Don\u2019t become overreliant on them, but scales can show whether you\u2019re moving in the right direction.</p> <h2><strong>Exercise is bad for your knees</strong></h2> <p>Actually, it\u2019s more like the opposite: properly done squats will strengthen the stabiliser muscles around your knee joints, safeguarding you against injury as well as making you a bit more capable of bounding up escalators. As for running, a 20-year study conducted by Stanford University found that consistent runners (many of whom were well into their 70s by the time the research period ended) showed a lower incidence of arthritis than non-runners as they aged. It also showed that runners have a lower risk of osteoarthritis and hip replacements, suggesting that pounding pavements isn\u2019t actually as bad for you as advertised.</p> <h2><strong>You can \u2018spot reduce\u2019 fat</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8d5321ba5fb6f6229a6a60953e717a242e611f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8d5321ba5fb6f6229a6a60953e717a242e611f0/0_0_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patience is the key ...\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patience is the key ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While we all lived in the offline wilderness, the myth persisted that you could, for instance, target the fat around your midriff by doing hundreds of situps.

These can\u2019t be easily changed, so you can\u2019t really choose where you lose fat from. Don\u2019t give up, though. Stubborn areas will get leaner alongside everything else. Patience is the key.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Less rest means you\u2019re working harder</strong></h2> <p>CrossFit and endless neon-tinted, EDM-soundtracked fitness classes have made \u201crest\u201d a four-letter word in the fitness industry, but constant movement for the sake of it could actually be hindering your gains, not helping them. \u201cFor most people \u2013 especially beginners \u2013 periods of recovery between sets or intervals allows for higher-intensity, better-quality movement, lower risk of injury and a greater training stimulus that is likely to lead to superior results,\u201d says the performance and wellbeing coach George Anderson. Or, in other words: if you push yourself for an hour straight, you\u2019ll be forced to lift lower weights, go slower and generally put in less work than you might with some strategic downtime. And the optimum varies \u2013 for fat loss, anywhere from 15 to 60 seconds between sets is ideal, but for strength you might spend five minutes preparing for ultra-intense efforts.</p> <h2><strong>Machines are pointless (or dangerous)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a49cfa6d55132f7bd72fb89a750bfe04774f0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69a49cfa6d55132f7bd72fb89a750bfe04774f0c/0_201_5441_3265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Machines are not pointless, but good technique is important.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Machines are not pointless, but good technique is important.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mireya Acierto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As sparse-and-spartan gym spaces emphasising basic barbell movements have proliferated, so, too, has the idea that using machines to train is at best inefficient, at worst dangerous.

Now it seems almost glacial, with three, two, and one-minute workouts promising to harness high-intensity interval training\u2019s (HIIT) mystical powers and leave you more time for Candy Crush. The truth? Anything is better than nothing, and it\u2019s certainly possible to make some gains in whatever limited time you have, but longer workouts have effects that no micro-workout can mimic. Oh, and by the way: in the original Tabata study, the test subjects \u2013 who were professional cyclists \u2013 worked so intensely that some of them refused to countenance trying the protocol again. If you\u2019re not doing that, there\u2019s no guarantee it will work as advertised.</p> <h2><strong>There is one \u2018best\u2019 way to train</strong></h2> <p>Is running better than lifting for longevity? Do you need the mobility yoga offers more than a really jacked set of quads? Is Zumba just a waste of valuable time that you could spend boxercising? \u201cWhatever training style you experiment with, you\u2019ll find someone ready to argue that everything else is useless and stupid, that you should stick with them or go home,\u201d says Dr Michael Banna. \u201cThis kind of absolutism risks deflating people by telling them that their efforts have been pointless. The reality is, any physical activity has health benefits; the right type is the one that doesn\u2019t injure you, make you sad or make you want to stop.\u201d Ideally your physical activity should include a mixture of cardio, resistance and mobility work spread across the week \u2013 but do what you enjoy.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Joel Snape is a former editor of Men\u2019s Fitness and runs the website LiveHard</p>",

Do you need the mobility yoga offers more than a really jacked set of quads? Is Zumba just a waste of valuable time that you could spend boxercising? \u201cWhatever training style you experiment with, you\u2019ll find someone ready to argue that everything else is useless and stupid, that you should stick with them or go home,\u201d says Dr Michael Banna. \u201cThis kind of absolutism risks deflating people by telling them that their efforts have been pointless. The reality is, any physical activity has health benefits; the right type is the one that doesn\u2019t injure you, make you sad or make you want to stop.\u201d Ideally your physical activity should include a mixture of cardio, resistance and mobility work spread across the week \u2013 but do what you enjoy. \u2022 Joel Snape is a former editor of Men\u2019s Fitness and runs the website LiveHard",

Her partnership with Meg Lanning settled the hosts after three quick wickets left them reeling at 10-3 inside four overs, conjuring up memories of the tournament opener in Sydney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/feb/24/australia-v-sri-lanka-womens-twenty20-world-cup-live\">Australia beat Sri Lanka by five wickets: Women's Twenty20 World Cup \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWalking out to bat, it wasn\u2019t an ideal situation but knowing one of the best batters in the world is at the other end, I knew we just had to knuckle down and get a really good partnership and we could get ourselves back in the game,\u201d said Haynes.</p> <p>\u201cThe ball was sliding on. I don\u2019t think turn or swing was playing too much of a factor by the time I got out there. It was just about trusting your game. It was actually much easier batting out there \u2013 once I got off the field I couldn\u2019t watch.\u201d</p> <p>The partnership between Lanning and Haynes started slowly and sent the match into cautious territory, as both teams went into defensive mode. Like a pair of track cyclists the teams warily watched each other, waiting for someone to make the first aggressive move.</p> <p>Poor fielding plagued Sri Lanka with a number of fumbled balls and dropped catches, while the Australians prodded and poked at the ball, turning over the strike but unable to accelerate and take control of the game.</p> <p>Haynes eventually grew tired of the slow accumulation and opened up, with two consecutive sixes in the 16th over that gave the players and spectators the kind of confidence that the win predictor had been exhibiting all match.</p> <p>Questions still remain over the form and fitness of Belinda Clark medallist Ellyse Perry, who was bumped down the order to seven. Although she scored a vital five from four balls to finish the game, it did not look like a convincing follow up to her surprise golden duck in Sydney.</p> <p>Australian assistant coach Shelley Nitchke stressed the importance of staying calm and remaining flexible in the face of adversity.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important to try and relax [when early wickets fall] because there is some tension that flows through the dugout,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a flexible batting line up, so we just try to talk about who might come in next.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"258d52b59355b118b1f06c0ab0f4c2a5f7e28966\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/258d52b59355b118b1f06c0ab0f4c2a5f7e28966/0_0_4246_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chamari Atapattu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chamari Atapattu hit 50 from 38 balls for Sri Lanka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the wickets didn\u2019t flow as freely as they would have liked, the Australians can take some heart from their bowling performance, which allowed them time to settle and form a partnership even after the nervous start to their innings.</p> <p>With a sub-par bowling performance against India still playing on her mind, Megan Schutt opened the bowling and had an immediate impact, dismissing Hasini Madushika for a duck in the first over.</p> <p>But from there Sri Lanka started to fire, with Chamari Atapattu the key to their innings. The Australian bowlers weren\u2019t able to get their line right, bowling too full and wide to the Sri Lankan captain as she cruised to 50 from 38 balls.</p> <p>Nicola Carey, who was left out of the playing squad for the first match, eventually took the crucial wicket and Molly Strano put the brakes on further with two wickets in an over to limit Sri Lanka to 122-6.</p> <p>\u201cI try to play my natural game and unfortunately I got out in the 14th over, but if I stayed three or four more overs, that would have changed the game,\u201d said Atapattu after the match.</p> <p>It might not have been the regulation win Australia would have preferred, Lanning was quietly confident it would provide the spark her team needed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a nice feeling to have a win on the board,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would have liked to have played better and we definitely need to improve heading into the next couple of games, but sometimes it\u2019s good to just get off the mark.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was nervous, it was unconvincing, and it was a victory that Australia desperately needed after falling to India three days earlier. The five-wicket win over Sri Lanka at the Waca Ground kept the host nation\u2019s hopes alive, but there promises to be some soul-searching within the Australian camp as they prepare for their match against Bangladesh later this week. Rachael Haynes proved the difference in the end, with a smart 60 from 47 balls. Her partnership with Meg Lanning settled the hosts after three quick wickets left them reeling at 10-3 inside four overs, conjuring up memories of the tournament opener in Sydney. \u201cWalking out to bat, it wasn\u2019t an ideal situation but knowing one of the best batters in the world is at the other end, I knew we just had to knuckle down and get a really good partnership and we could get ourselves back in the game,\u201d said Haynes. \u201cThe ball was sliding on. I don\u2019t think turn or swing was playing too much of a factor by the time I got out there. It was just about trusting your game. It was actually much easier batting out there \u2013 once I got off the field I couldn\u2019t watch.\u201d The partnership between Lanning and Haynes started slowly and sent the match into cautious territory, as both teams went into defensive mode. Like a pair of track cyclists the teams warily watched each other, waiting for someone to make the first aggressive move. Poor fielding plagued Sri Lanka with a number of fumbled balls and dropped catches, while the Australians prodded and poked at the ball, turning over the strike but unable to accelerate and take control of the game. Haynes eventually grew tired of the slow accumulation and opened up, with two consecutive sixes in the 16th over that gave the players and spectators the kind of confidence that the win predictor had been exhibiting all match. Questions still remain over the form and fitness of Belinda Clark medallist Ellyse Perry, who was bumped down the order to seven. Although she scored a vital five from four balls to finish the game, it did not look like a convincing follow up to her surprise golden duck in Sydney. Australian assistant coach Shelley Nitchke stressed the importance of staying calm and remaining flexible in the face of adversity. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to try and relax [when early wickets fall] because there is some tension that flows through the dugout,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a flexible batting line up, so we just try to talk about who might come in next.\u201d While the wickets didn\u2019t flow as freely as they would have liked, the Australians can take some heart from their bowling performance, which allowed them time to settle and form a partnership even after the nervous start to their innings. With a sub-par bowling performance against India still playing on her mind, Megan Schutt opened the bowling and had an immediate impact, dismissing Hasini Madushika for a duck in the first over. But from there Sri Lanka started to fire, with Chamari Atapattu the key to their innings. The Australian bowlers weren\u2019t able to get their line right, bowling too full and wide to the Sri Lankan captain as she cruised to 50 from 38 balls. Nicola Carey, who was left out of the playing squad for the first match, eventually took the crucial wicket and Molly Strano put the brakes on further with two wickets in an over to limit Sri Lanka to 122-6. \u201cI try to play my natural game and unfortunately I got out in the 14th over, but if I stayed three or four more overs, that would have changed the game,\u201d said Atapattu after the match. It might not have been the regulation win Australia would have preferred, Lanning was quietly confident it would provide the spark her team needed. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a nice feeling to have a win on the board,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would have liked to have played better and we definitely need to improve heading into the next couple of games, but sometimes it\u2019s good to just get off the mark.\u201d",

One quick win after these latest floods is for a genuine end to building homes on flood plains.</p> <p>\u201cWith more severe weather happening more often we now need a new plan for flooding and that can start today with ministers agreeing with Labour that it is time to end building homes on flood plains.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers are facing renewed calls to review the government\u2019s housing strategy as experts, local authorities and insurers warn that building on flood plains is increasing the danger to thousands of people from extreme weather, which climate scientists say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/17/uk-must-prepare-for-more-intense-storms-climate-scientists-say\">will become more commonplace</a>.</p> <p>The government aims to build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/14/house-building-in-england-at-30-year-high-government-data-show\">300,000 homes a year</a> by the mid-2020s to help ease a chronic housing shortage across the UK. Yet local authorities say they are struggling to meet these demands because of a dearth of available land, leading to as many as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/19/one-in-ten-new-homes-in-england-built-on-land-with-high-flood-risk\">one in 10 new homes</a> being built on high-risk flood sites since 2013.</p> <p>Boris Johnson suggested in December that building on flood-prone land must stop, saying on an election campaign visit <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-housing-build-construction-flood-plains-derbyshire-election-a9234456.html\">in flood-hit Derbyshire</a>: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop building on flood plains.

Nearly 20,000 houses were built on land at high risk of flooding \u2013 9% of the total \u2013 in 2017-18, according to the latest official figures.</p> <p>The environment secretary, George Eustice, is expected to be questioned by MPs later on Monday amid criticism of the government\u2019s response to the storms, which have left thousands of homes and livelihoods in ruins.</p> <p>Johnson has been accused of failing to grasp the scale of the damage caused by one of the wettest Februarys in 254 years of records, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/pms-refusal-to-call-cobra-meeting-hampering-storm-recovery\">criticised</a> for not calling an emergency Cobra meeting that would have speeded up the release of vital recovery funds to the areas hardest hit.</p> <p>Nine days after Storm Ciara, the government invited flood-stricken residents and businesses to apply for up to \u00a3500 in \u201cfinancial hardship payments\u201d, council tax and business rates relief, and access to funds of up to \u00a32,500 to cover some uninsurable losses.

      "bodyText": "Labour has called for an immediate end to building houses on land at high risk of flooding following the worst winter storms in years. The Guardian revealed on Sunday that more than 11,000 homes were planned in areas the government considers a high flood risk in the seven English regions swamped by Storms Ciara and Dennis. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said he would press ministers on the issue when parliament returns from recess on Monday: \u201cThe climate crisis means we have to do things differently. One quick win after these latest floods is for a genuine end to building homes on flood plains. \u201cWith more severe weather happening more often we now need a new plan for flooding and that can start today with ministers agreeing with Labour that it is time to end building homes on flood plains.\u201d Ministers are facing renewed calls to review the government\u2019s housing strategy as experts, local authorities and insurers warn that building on flood plains is increasing the danger to thousands of people from extreme weather, which climate scientists say will become more commonplace. The government aims to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s to help ease a chronic housing shortage across the UK. Yet local authorities say they are struggling to meet these demands because of a dearth of available land, leading to as many as one in 10 new homes being built on high-risk flood sites since 2013. Boris Johnson suggested in December that building on flood-prone land must stop, saying on an election campaign visit in flood-hit Derbyshire: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop building on flood plains. We\u2019ve got to stop building on areas which are vulnerable to flooding.\u201d But that does not appear to have been a formal policy announcement and would have major implications for the government\u2019s ambitious housing targets. Nearly 20,000 houses were built on land at high risk of flooding \u2013 9% of the total \u2013 in 2017-18, according to the latest official figures. The environment secretary, George Eustice, is expected to be questioned by MPs later on Monday amid criticism of the government\u2019s response to the storms, which have left thousands of homes and livelihoods in ruins. Johnson has been accused of failing to grasp the scale of the damage caused by one of the wettest Februarys in 254 years of records, and criticised for not calling an emergency Cobra meeting that would have speeded up the release of vital recovery funds to the areas hardest hit. Nine days after Storm Ciara, the government invited flood-stricken residents and businesses to apply for up to \u00a3500 in \u201cfinancial hardship payments\u201d, council tax and business rates relief, and access to funds of up to \u00a32,500 to cover some uninsurable losses. Ministers also said flood-hit homes and businesses would be able to apply for up to \u00a35,000 to \u201chelp make them more resilient to future flooding\u201d. A joint investigation by the Guardian and Greenpeace\u2019s Unearthed news unit found that of the 11,410 new homes planned across seven flood-stricken English authorities, 1,479 are in four of the areas hit hardest by Storms Ciara and Dennis: Calderdale, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcester. The government defines high-risk areas as having a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any year. In Shropshire, where a severe weather warning remains in place \u2013 meaning an imminent danger to life \u2013 764 homes are set to be built in areas with a high flood risk. In Doncaster, where the Fishlake area was flooded in November, nearly 4,000 homes are intended for such flood zones. The Environment Agency said flooding of properties was expected to continue this week as a further band of rainfall sweeps across Britain. Nearly 96 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, are in place across England from Dorset to Cumbria on Monday, along with a further 184 alerts meaning flooding is possible. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cLocal authorities have a responsibility to assess the number of homes their communities need, and our planning policy is clear that housing should be located in the areas at least risk of flooding. Where development in a risk area is absolutely necessary, sufficient measures should be taken to make sure homes are safe, resilient and protected from flooding.\u201d",

It\u2019s not an unusual sight to spot him sporting a skirt, dress, or sarong at a party, picnic, or trailhead.

      "bodyText": "My gaze scanned the colorful racks of clothing and stopped abruptly on something I\u2019d never expected to see: my boyfriend was clutching a wedding dress \u2013 that he wanted to buy for himself. \u201cEmily!\u201d he cried with victorious glee. \u201cI\u2019ve found the one!\u201d Ian thrust the white garment into the air like a Nascar trophy. Its lace sleeves sashayed from the tapered bodice and fluffy tulle grazed the dirty tiles of the thrift store floor. A smile stretched across Ian\u2019s scruffy face and his blue eyes danced with the giddy excitement of a bride saying, \u201cI do!\u201d \u201cOh, wow,\u201d I managed to spit out. We were at Goodwill searching for dresses to wear during the annual Mother\u2019s Day Climb up Mount St Helens, a decades-long tradition in which everyone scaling the volcano that day sports flowing garments in honor of female mountaineers and mothers everywhere. I knew Ian would be among the most outrageous on the mountain. My boyfriend is aggressively fun and a flair fanatic, which I find wildly attractive on most occasions \u2013 like when he\u2019s scaling technical slopes in jorts and a cat shirt or skiing the steepest lines in the Pacific north-west in space tights. But I found myself unexpectedly uneasy with his new fondness for feminine frocks \u2013 a reaction that challenged the progressive ideals I\u2019d prided myself on for decades. I\u2019d long thought I was contributing to a progressive shift in how we define masculinity, finally allowing men to be emotional and vulnerable, or to ask for help, or to hug their male friends \u2026 or to wear dresses. Ian giggled. \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d His chest hair battled the sheer neckline. The skirt fanned out as wide as a beach umbrella \u2013 a garment fit for a Vegas chapel. I imagined him skiing down Mount St Helens in it, the lengthy rag concealing his chiseled calves and hardened quadriceps, and strained to find it an appealing vision. It was too much \u2013 even for him. This was not the first time I\u2019d found myself a little uncomfortable with the sight of Ian in women\u2019s wear. It\u2019s not an unusual sight to spot him sporting a skirt, dress, or sarong at a party, picnic, or trailhead. He uses his unconventional apparel as a display of his individuality and a reflection of his fondness for fun. I adore both of those qualities, but I was realizing I was less fond of seeing them exhibited through floral numbers or tight sequined garments or wedding dresses. While it was attraction-at-first sight with Ian, his closet full of feminine gear put a tiny dent in his desirability from the very beginning of our relationship. Not enough to stop me from acting on my huge crush, but enough to notice there was an unexpected disconnect between what I thought I was OK with a man wearing, and what I actually found appealing on his body. On the first weekend we hooked up, I had to yank a green sparkly dress over his head to unclothe him. Foreplay involved palming his glittery glutes while dancing to Kesha\u2019s Woman and caressing his furry thigh along a hemline so tight you could almost see the outlines of each and every hair follicle beneath it. \u201cThat was the first time I\u2019ve undressed a man \u2013 from a dress!\u201d I shrieked the next morning. My palms slapped the concrete countertop as I regaled my housemate Eli with stories from the night before. \u201cOh girl, what an exciting milestone!

      "body": "<p>For someone who was raised in Italy, came of age in Philadelphia, and ultimately established himself as a star in southern California, it is telling that Kobe Bryant once referred to China as his \u201chome away from home.\u201d Bryant first visited the country in 1998 to host a basketball camp, a year after he entered the NBA straight out of high school. The trips would become a fixture of Bryant\u2019s offseason during his 20-year career. There he was, wowing fans with slam dunks on the Great Wall. And there he was, getting mobbed at airports in scenes reminiscent of Beatlemania. \u201cI thought I was famous,\u201d remarked LeBron James at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, \u201cuntil I got here with Kobe.\u201d</p> <p>Bryant had the best-selling sports jersey in China for years, and by the time he retired in 2016, he was far and away <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15833269/nba-kobe-bryant-remains-no-1-athlete-china-ahead-messi-ronaldo-lebron-james\">the country\u2019s most popular athlete.</a> A reported 110 million people tuned in to Tencent, the NBA\u2019s digital streaming partner in China, to watch Bryant\u2019s last game for the Lakers. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for me to walk around here than in the States,\u201d Bryant said during a 2013 visit. \u201cIn the States, you get a lot of recognition. They say, \u2018Hi.\u2019 They want autographs and pictures. But here, it\u2019s uncontrollable.

The trips would become a fixture of Bryant\u2019s offseason during his 20-year career. There he was, wowing fans with slam dunks on the Great Wall. And there he was, getting mobbed at airports in scenes reminiscent of Beatlemania. \u201cI thought I was famous,\u201d remarked LeBron James at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, \u201cuntil I got here with Kobe.\u201d Bryant had the best-selling sports jersey in China for years, and by the time he retired in 2016, he was far and away the country\u2019s most popular athlete. A reported 110 million people tuned in to Tencent, the NBA\u2019s digital streaming partner in China, to watch Bryant\u2019s last game for the Lakers. \u201cIt\u2019s harder for me to walk around here than in the States,\u201d Bryant said during a 2013 visit. \u201cIn the States, you get a lot of recognition. They say, \u2018Hi.\u2019 They want autographs and pictures. But here, it\u2019s uncontrollable. They rush you and surround you to the point where you can\u2019t go out.\u201d Bryant\u2019s shocking death last month prompted a similar mass outpouring on Weibo, essentially China\u2019s version of Twitter, where he had posted a video message commemorating Chinese New Year to his nine million followers just two days before his helicopter crashed in Calabasas, California.

      "body": "<p>For too many women, cervical cancer is a death sentence. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. A life-saving preventative vaccine can dramatically cut cases and put the world on track to eliminate this deadly disease.</p> <p>The UK first began offering a vaccine against HPV \u2013 the primary cause of cervical cancer \u2013 in 2008. According to a 2018 study by <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/218/6/911/5025126\">Public Health England</a>, infections of certain cancer-causing types of HPV have since fallen by 86% among 16- to 21-year-old women. A <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1161\">study</a> conducted in Scotland last year found that the vaccine reduced pre-cancerous cervical lesions by up to 90%.</p> <p>But such impact has been largely confined to wealthy countries, where the vaccine is widely available. Today, 90% of all cervical cancer deaths around the world <a href=\"https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/hpv/en/\">occur in developing countries</a>, many of which have yet to introduce inoculation. Just <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329962/WER9447-eng-fre.pdf?ua=1\">21 low-income countries</a> have the vaccine.</p> <p>While demand for the vaccine is high, efforts to roll it out in developing countries have been threatened by a <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/367/bmj.l6765\">global supply shortage</a>. With limited doses available, millions of women and girls are left without protection against a largely preventable disease, simply because of where they live.</p> <p>Last summer, the UK announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/09/hpv-vaccine-to-be-given-to-boys-in-effort-to-slash-cancer-rates\">expansion of their HPV vaccination programme to include boys</a>. Other countries, including the US, Germany and Australia, have implemented similar policies. The US also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/06/26/new-hpv-vaccine-recommendation-people-through-age/\">recommends the vaccine for certain women up to 45</a>.</p> <p>Encouraging more people to get vaccinated is unquestionably a positive thing. But, in the context of a global shortage, expanding the population that receives inoculation could mean girls and women in poorer countries are left behind.</p> <p>It should be noted that vaccinating girls against HPV protects boys too, through <a href=\"https://publichealthengland.exposure.co/childhood-vaccination\">herd</a> immunity: when enough girls in a community are protected, the virus can\u2019t spread from person to person and everyone is safeguarded.</p> <p>The effects of the vaccine shortage are compounded by lack of access to timely screening and treatment options in low- and middle-income countries. Reliable preventive care services to spot cancer early, like pap smears and visual inspection with acetic acid, are often unavailable. This can mean that cancer diagnoses are often made too late, if at all.</p> <p>Even when cervical cancer is diagnosed, many areas do not have healthcare facilities with cancer specialists, or the equipment for treatments like radiation and chemotherapy. These services are also expensive, putting them out of reach for many. Without access to the HPV vaccine, girls and women in the regions of highest need are left without any tools to protect themselves.</p> <p>In November, the World Health Organization\u2019s strategic advisory group of immunisation experts <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329962/WER9447-eng-fre.pdf?ua=1\">recommended</a> that all countries temporarily postpone the implementation of HPV vaccination strategies for boys and older age groups. The expert group also suggested that countries consider adopting a vaccination schedule where the second dose is administered three to five years after the first, as appropriate to the national context.

      "bodyText": "For too many women, cervical cancer is a death sentence. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. A life-saving preventative vaccine can dramatically cut cases and put the world on track to eliminate this deadly disease. The UK first began offering a vaccine against HPV \u2013 the primary cause of cervical cancer \u2013 in 2008. According to a 2018 study by Public Health England, infections of certain cancer-causing types of HPV have since fallen by 86% among 16- to 21-year-old women. A study conducted in Scotland last year found that the vaccine reduced pre-cancerous cervical lesions by up to 90%. But such impact has been largely confined to wealthy countries, where the vaccine is widely available. Today, 90% of all cervical cancer deaths around the world occur in developing countries, many of which have yet to introduce inoculation. Just 21 low-income countries have the vaccine. While demand for the vaccine is high, efforts to roll it out in developing countries have been threatened by a global supply shortage. With limited doses available, millions of women and girls are left without protection against a largely preventable disease, simply because of where they live. Last summer, the UK announced the expansion of their HPV vaccination programme to include boys. Other countries, including the US, Germany and Australia, have implemented similar policies. The US also recommends the vaccine for certain women up to 45. Encouraging more people to get vaccinated is unquestionably a positive thing. But, in the context of a global shortage, expanding the population that receives inoculation could mean girls and women in poorer countries are left behind. It should be noted that vaccinating girls against HPV protects boys too, through herd immunity: when enough girls in a community are protected, the virus can\u2019t spread from person to person and everyone is safeguarded. The effects of the vaccine shortage are compounded by lack of access to timely screening and treatment options in low- and middle-income countries. Reliable preventive care services to spot cancer early, like pap smears and visual inspection with acetic acid, are often unavailable. This can mean that cancer diagnoses are often made too late, if at all. Even when cervical cancer is diagnosed, many areas do not have healthcare facilities with cancer specialists, or the equipment for treatments like radiation and chemotherapy. These services are also expensive, putting them out of reach for many. Without access to the HPV vaccine, girls and women in the regions of highest need are left without any tools to protect themselves. In November, the World Health Organization\u2019s strategic advisory group of immunisation experts recommended that all countries temporarily postpone the implementation of HPV vaccination strategies for boys and older age groups. The expert group also suggested that countries consider adopting a vaccination schedule where the second dose is administered three to five years after the first, as appropriate to the national context. Deferring the second dose for younger girls does not affect the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness and will make more doses available now, when they are urgently needed. Implementing these recommendations and steering vaccine supply toward countries at high risk could save hundreds of thousands of lives. The HPV vaccine shortage has an end in sight \u2013 new manufacturers are entering the market and more doses will be available eventually, though probably not until 2024 at the earliest. But millions of girls should not have to wait years to receive the life-saving benefits of HPV vaccination. To create a future where girls and women don\u2019t have to bear the burden of cervical cancer, leaders need to take steps to ensure that the limited doses we have go to the regions where they can save the most lives. Countries must also invest in life-saving services like cervical cancer screening and treatment programmes that can protect women who haven\u2019t received the vaccine. If we take these actions, we\u2019ll be sending a clear message that the lives of girls and women in poorer countries really are equal to those in rich ones.

      "body": "<h2>1) Not all good news for Arteta</h2> <p>Mikel Arteta is entitled to be pleased with three wins in eight days, but must also reflect on the sloppiness which gifted Everton two goals. Though Arteta said that in the first 65 minutes they played exactly as he wants them to, the reality is that Arsenal flowed for perhaps half that time, hanging on to the points not because of any great discipline and organisation; their opponents just finished poorly and Bernd Leno had a good second half. And Leno\u2019s response, when asked about his mistake which led to Everton\u2019s equaliser, was telling: Richarlison, its scorer, was \u201clucky\u201d; he, its unwitting victim, was \u201cunlucky\u201d; and it didn\u2019t matter in the end, because Arsenal won. This is not how winners think, and this is the mentality Arteta must change, but if he is as delighted with his team\u2019s performance as he intimated, he would do well to re-evaluate his own too. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/arsenal-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Arsenal 3-2 Everton</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/aubameyang-future-at-arsenal-more-certain-says-mikel-arteta\">Aubameyang future at Arsenal more certain, says Mikel Arteta</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2) Dyche revels in attacking riches</h2> <p>Matej Vydra is currently only playing because Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood are injured, but with two goals in two games the Czech striker is going to be hard for Sean Dyche to leave out, particularly as he plays so well alongside Jay Rodriguez. Burnley actually have four effective strikers at the moment, and that does not include Dwight McNeil who is becoming noticeably better at playing through the middle, but Dyche maintains whoever plays up front must have an understanding with his partner. \u201cIf you are going to play two up front they cannot operate as individuals, they have to connect,\u201d the Burnley manager said. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased that Matej has come in and done well, because he\u2019s been waiting and waiting for his chance. He\u2019s stretched the pitch and connected well with the others. He puts in a lot of work and his finishing is sublime.\u201d <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/arsenal-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Burnley 3-0 Bournemouth</a></em></p> <h2>3) Goalscoring Giroud makes his case</h2> <p>It has not been easy for Olivier Giroud to accept his diminished role at Chelsea this season. The striker has not even made the bench at times and it was difficult to understand why Giroud ended up staying at Stamford Bridge last month. Against Tottenham, however, the Frenchman showed he is a better deputy for Tammy Abraham than Michy Batshuayi. It was only Giroud\u2019s third league start under Frank Lampard, and his first since he struggled in the defeat to West Ham in November, and he was outstanding in a crucial Chelsea victory. He bullied the Spurs defence, scored a cracking goal and combined with Ross Barkley and Mason Mount for Marcos Alonso\u2019s decisive strike. Now Lampard has a tough call to make: does Giroud keep his place when Chelsea side host Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday or should Abraham return after shaking off an ankle injury? <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/chelsea-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Chelsea 2-1 Tottenham</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbd2b97cada702304e06a481c8a0c185342030c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbd2b97cada702304e06a481c8a0c185342030c4/0_128_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Giroud made a rare start for Chelsea against Spurs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Giroud made a rare start for Chelsea against Spurs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4) Bruce needs Gayle to blow in</h2> <p>Steve Bruce\u2019s admission that he may have to consider a change of approach following the abject defeat to Crystal Palace could be good news for Newcastle\u2019s forgotten man Dwight Gayle. The former Palace striker made his first appearance for six weeks at Selhurst Park having recovered from a hamstring injury and Bruce is now hoping he can finally get the opportunity to show his ability after being sent on loan to West Brom last season by Rafael Ben\u00edtez. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve said in the last few months \u2013 I\u2019ve gone on record to say I tried to buy him three times,\u201d said the Newcastle manager. \u201cUnfortunately, since the day I walked into the club he had a calf injury which never got any better. Then he did his hamstring. Dwight is a very good player and a natural goalscorer. It would be a welcome boost for us if he was available to us for the rest of the season.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/crystal-palace-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Crystal Palace 1-0 Newcastle</a></em></p> <h2>5) City keep their eye on the ball</h2> <p>After a week of endless public arguments about every facet of the club aside from the actual football, Manchester City took things back to basics on Saturday by executing two of their defining features to near perfection: they missed a penalty and they suffocated a top rival with their possession. City grew into the game and they created numerous opportunities in the second half until Gabriel Jesus finished a lovely move created by Riyad Mahrez, wrapping up a sufficiently positive performance before a meeting with Real Madrid that carries even greater importance after the Champions League ban. \u201cDo you still doubt about what they\u2019ve done?\u201d asked Guardiola after questions about the team\u2019s attitude. Cutting through all the noise to focus on winning is part of the job description of professional players, but to see it in motion is impressive all the same. <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/leicester-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Leicester 0-1 Manchester City</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Greenwood\u2019s finishing school</h2> <p>Mason Greenwood\u2019s rocket of a finish was his 11th goal of the season in all competitions and fifth in the Premier League \u2013 making the 18-year-old one of Europe\u2019s most prolific teenagers. As Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said after the game the boy from Bradford is only going to improve. \u201cHe is the best finisher we have and one of the best I have seen, right foot, left foot, doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cHe knows how to score. He is just so sharp in and around the goal. What pleased me more is his link-up play, his switches of play he found Daniel James from right to left. The whole season he has had says a lot for him. He is just going to be better and better. He is only 18 and is not fully grown. Not like Wayne Rooney was at 18. In a couple of years\u2019 time he will be more or less the complete No 9 or forward.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/manchester-united-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Manchester United 3-0 Watford</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/bruno-fernandes-vows-to-get-united-into-champions-league\">Bruno Fernandes vows to get United into Champions League</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7) Potter\u2019s Brighton get back to basics</h2> <p>Compromise is sometimes seen as a dirty word in football but Graham Potter is far too shrewd, and sensible, to fall into that particular trap. Potter\u2019s Brighton have played some aesthetically very enjoyable stuff this season but results have not always matched performances and relegation fears are rising. On Saturday he recognised the need to dust down his, much more pragmatic, predecessor Chris Hughton\u2019s old playbook and grind out a precious point against dynamically dangerous opponents chasing an unexpected European dream. Aided by the use of three different formations\u2013 all based on a back three \u2013 during the 90 minutes, plus some untypically direct passing and in depth defending, Brighton duly achieved their aim courtesy of Neil Maupay\u2019s equaliser at the end of a classic route one move. There were spells when Sheffield United had them on the ropes but the resilience of Potter\u2019s players suggests survival should be secured. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/sheffield-united-brighton-hove-albion-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Sheffield United 1-1 Brighton</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ac2cb6c7ddd3619c5d745def157b6b7192604d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ac2cb6c7ddd3619c5d745def157b6b7192604d5/0_174_5206_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neal Maupay celebrates scoring the equaliser for Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neal Maupay celebrates scoring the equaliser for Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) Hasenh\u00fcttl has Smallbone to pick</h2> <p>Arguably the biggest boon from Southampton\u2019s win over Aston Villa was the performance of Will Smallbone on his league debut. The midfielder, who turned 20 on Friday, was assured, unfazed and quietly knitted things together for a dominant Southampton side, delicately shifting possession and almost opening the scoring when he hit a post. James Ward-Prowse was excellent at full-back, Michael Obafemi arrived off the bench and Matt Targett lined up against his former club at St Mary\u2019s, but Smallbone, who joined Southampton as an eight-year-old, was the academy graduate on the lips of supporters at the final whistle. \u201cI knew before this season that he would play a few Premier League games, that was clear,\u201d said his manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. \u201cIt\u2019s good for him and for every young player at the club. If they are good enough we won\u2019t be scared to let them play. This must be our way for the future.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/southampton-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Southampton 2-0 Aston Villa</a></em></p> <h2>9) Taking note of Jota \u2013 Wolves\u2019 man in form</h2> <p>It would be fascinating to sit in on a recruitment meeting at Wolves. Not one that discussed individual targets, rather the strategy that has brought the club such success. The sort of meeting that Jorge Mendes might dial into. When hiring from Portugal, as Wolves have been inclined to, what marks out a player who could make the transition from there to here? A Ronaldo and not a Renato Sanches? Diogo Jota is an intriguing case in point. The 23-year-old is now in his third year in England and with five goals in three days he is Wolves\u2019 man in form. Against Norwich he ran the regarded Ben Godfrey ragged with his pace and close control, while his first strike was superbly executed. But as with his strike partner Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez it is often his strength and determination in the challenge that makes the difference. Finding that sweet spot between technical gifts and physical graft is one of the secrets of Wolves\u2019 success. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/wolves-norwich-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Wolves 3-0 Norwich</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/wolves-norwich-premier-league-match-report\">Diogo Jota double seals easy win for Wolves over Norwich</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>10) Schmeichel a consistency unmatched</strong></h2> <p>Things could have been very different in the career of Kasper Schmeichel after he left Manchester City back in 2009 to recently-monied Notts County in League Two, as City looked away from homegrown stars to more expensive acquisitions. In Nottingham, Schmeichel got games under his belt, even if the club went nowhere. It was easy to see such a level was way below the Dane\u2019s talents ever since he has been a beacon of quality and consistency for whichever team he played for, proving it once more with a stunning performance against his first club on Saturday, including a fine penalty save. Not only is he one of the league\u2019s best goalkeeper\u2019s but also the most inspiring of leaders and he would not be out of place as Manchester City\u2019s No 1 over a decade after leaving but he looks very content with his lot. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <em><a

      "bodyText": "1) Not all good news for Arteta Mikel Arteta is entitled to be pleased with three wins in eight days, but must also reflect on the sloppiness which gifted Everton two goals. Though Arteta said that in the first 65 minutes they played exactly as he wants them to, the reality is that Arsenal flowed for perhaps half that time, hanging on to the points not because of any great discipline and organisation; their opponents just finished poorly and Bernd Leno had a good second half. And Leno\u2019s response, when asked about his mistake which led to Everton\u2019s equaliser, was telling: Richarlison, its scorer, was \u201clucky\u201d; he, its unwitting victim, was \u201cunlucky\u201d; and it didn\u2019t matter in the end, because Arsenal won. This is not how winners think, and this is the mentality Arteta must change, but if he is as delighted with his team\u2019s performance as he intimated, he would do well to re-evaluate his own too. Daniel Harris \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 3-2 Everton 2) Dyche revels in attacking riches Matej Vydra is currently only playing because Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood are injured, but with two goals in two games the Czech striker is going to be hard for Sean Dyche to leave out, particularly as he plays so well alongside Jay Rodriguez. Burnley actually have four effective strikers at the moment, and that does not include Dwight McNeil who is becoming noticeably better at playing through the middle, but Dyche maintains whoever plays up front must have an understanding with his partner. \u201cIf you are going to play two up front they cannot operate as individuals, they have to connect,\u201d the Burnley manager said. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased that Matej has come in and done well, because he\u2019s been waiting and waiting for his chance. He\u2019s stretched the pitch and connected well with the others. He puts in a lot of work and his finishing is sublime.\u201d Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Burnley 3-0 Bournemouth 3) Goalscoring Giroud makes his case It has not been easy for Olivier Giroud to accept his diminished role at Chelsea this season. The striker has not even made the bench at times and it was difficult to understand why Giroud ended up staying at Stamford Bridge last month. Against Tottenham, however, the Frenchman showed he is a better deputy for Tammy Abraham than Michy Batshuayi. It was only Giroud\u2019s third league start under Frank Lampard, and his first since he struggled in the defeat to West Ham in November, and he was outstanding in a crucial Chelsea victory. He bullied the Spurs defence, scored a cracking goal and combined with Ross Barkley and Mason Mount for Marcos Alonso\u2019s decisive strike. Now Lampard has a tough call to make: does Giroud keep his place when Chelsea side host Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday or should Abraham return after shaking off an ankle injury? Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 2-1 Tottenham 4) Bruce needs Gayle to blow in Steve Bruce\u2019s admission that he may have to consider a change of approach following the abject defeat to Crystal Palace could be good news for Newcastle\u2019s forgotten man Dwight Gayle. The former Palace striker made his first appearance for six weeks at Selhurst Park having recovered from a hamstring injury and Bruce is now hoping he can finally get the opportunity to show his ability after being sent on loan to West Brom last season by Rafael Ben\u00edtez. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve said in the last few months \u2013 I\u2019ve gone on record to say I tried to buy him three times,\u201d said the Newcastle manager. \u201cUnfortunately, since the day I walked into the club he had a calf injury which never got any better. Then he did his hamstring. Dwight is a very good player and a natural goalscorer. It would be a welcome boost for us if he was available to us for the rest of the season.\u201d Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 1-0 Newcastle 5) City keep their eye on the ball After a week of endless public arguments about every facet of the club aside from the actual football, Manchester City took things back to basics on Saturday by executing two of their defining features to near perfection: they missed a penalty and they suffocated a top rival with their possession. City grew into the game and they created numerous opportunities in the second half until Gabriel Jesus finished a lovely move created by Riyad Mahrez, wrapping up a sufficiently positive performance before a meeting with Real Madrid that carries even greater importance after the Champions League ban. \u201cDo you still doubt about what they\u2019ve done?\u201d asked Guardiola after questions about the team\u2019s attitude. Cutting through all the noise to focus on winning is part of the job description of professional players, but to see it in motion is impressive all the same. Tumaini Carayol \u2022 Match report: Leicester 0-1 Manchester City 6) Greenwood\u2019s finishing school Mason Greenwood\u2019s rocket of a finish was his 11th goal of the season in all competitions and fifth in the Premier League \u2013 making the 18-year-old one of Europe\u2019s most prolific teenagers. As Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said after the game the boy from Bradford is only going to improve. \u201cHe is the best finisher we have and one of the best I have seen, right foot, left foot, doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cHe knows how to score. He is just so sharp in and around the goal. What pleased me more is his link-up play, his switches of play he found Daniel James from right to left. The whole season he has had says a lot for him. He is just going to be better and better. He is only 18 and is not fully grown. Not like Wayne Rooney was at 18. In a couple of years\u2019 time he will be more or less the complete No 9 or forward.\u201d Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester United 3-0 Watford 7) Potter\u2019s Brighton get back to basics Compromise is sometimes seen as a dirty word in football but Graham Potter is far too shrewd, and sensible, to fall into that particular trap. Potter\u2019s Brighton have played some aesthetically very enjoyable stuff this season but results have not always matched performances and relegation fears are rising. On Saturday he recognised the need to dust down his, much more pragmatic, predecessor Chris Hughton\u2019s old playbook and grind out a precious point against dynamically dangerous opponents chasing an unexpected European dream. Aided by the use of three different formations\u2013 all based on a back three \u2013 during the 90 minutes, plus some untypically direct passing and in depth defending, Brighton duly achieved their aim courtesy of Neil Maupay\u2019s equaliser at the end of a classic route one move. There were spells when Sheffield United had them on the ropes but the resilience of Potter\u2019s players suggests survival should be secured. Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 1-1 Brighton 8) Hasenh\u00fcttl has Smallbone to pick Arguably the biggest boon from Southampton\u2019s win over Aston Villa was the performance of Will Smallbone on his league debut. The midfielder, who turned 20 on Friday, was assured, unfazed and quietly knitted things together for a dominant Southampton side, delicately shifting possession and almost opening the scoring when he hit a post. James Ward-Prowse was excellent at full-back, Michael Obafemi arrived off the bench and Matt Targett lined up against his former club at St Mary\u2019s, but Smallbone, who joined Southampton as an eight-year-old, was the academy graduate on the lips of supporters at the final whistle. \u201cI knew before this season that he would play a few Premier League games, that was clear,\u201d said his manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. \u201cIt\u2019s good for him and for every young player at the club. If they are good enough we won\u2019t be scared to let them play. This must be our way for the future.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Southampton 2-0 Aston Villa 9) Taking note of Jota \u2013 Wolves\u2019 man in form It would be fascinating to sit in on a recruitment meeting at Wolves. Not one that discussed individual targets, rather the strategy that has brought the club such success. The sort of meeting that Jorge Mendes might dial into. When hiring from Portugal, as Wolves have been inclined to, what marks out a player who could make the transition from there to here? A Ronaldo and not a Renato Sanches? Diogo Jota is an intriguing case in point. The 23-year-old is now in his third year in England and with five goals in three days he is Wolves\u2019 man in form. Against Norwich he ran the regarded Ben Godfrey ragged with his pace and close control, while his first strike was superbly executed. But as with his strike partner Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez it is often his strength and determination in the challenge that makes the difference. Finding that sweet spot between technical gifts and physical graft is one of the secrets of Wolves\u2019 success. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Wolves 3-0 Norwich 10) Schmeichel a consistency unmatched Things could have been very different in the career of Kasper Schmeichel after he left Manchester City back in 2009 to recently-monied Notts County in League Two, as City looked away from homegrown stars to more expensive acquisitions. In Nottingham, Schmeichel got games under his belt, even if the club went nowhere. It was easy to see such a level was way below the Dane\u2019s talents ever since he has been a beacon of quality and consistency for whichever team he played for, proving it once more with a stunning performance against his first club on Saturday, including a fine penalty save. Not only is he one of the league\u2019s best goalkeeper\u2019s but also the most inspiring of leaders and he would not be out of place as Manchester City\u2019s No 1 over a decade after leaving but he looks very content with his lot.

Nearby was an artificial beach of gravel, a ship\u2019s carcass snagged in the shallows, strange sun umbrellas with overlong stalks and a nearby jetty that looked like it was slipping into steel-grey waters that were frozen for seven months of the year. There were no people. The foggy landscape was \u201cbald, scarred, austere\u201d. And her hotel lacked a second floor, with just a first and third.</p> <p>Such was the bizarre scene greeting this inquisitive British travel writer when she entered Kolyma, the eastern flank of Siberia. She had arrived in the bay where a fleet of ships, some foreign-owned, had once landed the despairing human cargo carted off to the gulags under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/joseph-stalin\" title=\"\">Joseph Stalin</a>. These sad souls included Poles, Russians, Koreans, Japanese and thousands of Spaniards \u201crescued\u201d as children during that country\u2019s civil war. Many perished on the journey from disease. Guards used hoses of freezing water to control their charges. One historian estimates that of 3 million prisoners exiled to Kolyma, just 500,000 survived.</p> <p>The region\u2019s harsh landscape and historical legacy form the backdrop to Roberts\u2019s intriguing debut.

      "bodyText": "Sophy Roberts\u2019s first glimpse of the Sea of Okhotsk was from beside the foot of a metallic mammoth, sculpted from discarded cogs, chains and pipes. Nearby was an artificial beach of gravel, a ship\u2019s carcass snagged in the shallows, strange sun umbrellas with overlong stalks and a nearby jetty that looked like it was slipping into steel-grey waters that were frozen for seven months of the year. There were no people. The foggy landscape was \u201cbald, scarred, austere\u201d. And her hotel lacked a second floor, with just a first and third. Such was the bizarre scene greeting this inquisitive British travel writer when she entered Kolyma, the eastern flank of Siberia. She had arrived in the bay where a fleet of ships, some foreign-owned, had once landed the despairing human cargo carted off to the gulags under Joseph Stalin. These sad souls included Poles, Russians, Koreans, Japanese and thousands of Spaniards \u201crescued\u201d as children during that country\u2019s civil war. Many perished on the journey from disease. Guards used hoses of freezing water to control their charges. One historian estimates that of 3 million prisoners exiled to Kolyma, just 500,000 survived. The region\u2019s harsh landscape and historical legacy form the backdrop to Roberts\u2019s intriguing debut. She spent two years crisscrossing the snow-bound wilderness of Siberia, which stretches from the Arctic Circle to Mongolia and includes more than three-quarters of Russia\u2019s terrain. It has a lake holding one-fifth of the planet\u2019s fresh water along with the longest railway and coldest inhabited city on Earth.

      "bodyText": "The road to the White House is paved with dollars and coins. But in 2020, Mike Bloomberg is hoping to seal off that road from the competition with the steepest wall of cash ever spent by one person on an election in US history. One of the richest people in the world, the media mogul and former New York mayor entered the race late, and with heaps of money, in an attempt to upend the normal campaign model and unseat Donald Trump. He has vowed to spend up to $1bn of his own wealth, though some reports have suggested he could double that. His fortune has launched a campaign dripping in cash: showering hundreds of millions on adverts, hiring thousands of staffers with astonishing perks and creating a web of political patronage that has won him key endorsements. His money has now propelled him into the top tier of the Democratic race, leapfrogging rivals who have been trudging along on the traditional campaign trail for more than a year. Bloomberg was assailed by Democratic challengers on the debate stage Wednesday night, but the question remains: can the richest campaign ever launched in the US really buy the White House? Sarah Bryner, research director at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, said while wealth has always been a tool in elections, money is doing an outsized amount of work for Bloomberg. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of changing the boundaries for what is possible,\u201d she said. In the first quarter of his campaign, Bloomberg spent $188m. When he entered the Democratic race in November, the then frontrunner, Joe Biden, had raised $59m in all of 2019. Latest figures released last week show Bloomberg has now spent $460m so far. The bulk of that almost half a billion dollars is going to advertising. His ads blanket television markets and social media in a barrage of messaging. But the flood is carefully targeted too: he has spent $124m on ads in the 14 states that hold primaries on 3 March, known as Super Tuesday, when the most voters have an opportunity to show who they want to represent their party in the presidential election. Wherever American eyeballs go, so goes the Bloomberg campaign. Bloomberg took the unprecedented step of buying a $10m, 60-second ad to run during the Super Bowl \u2013 the president announced he was doing the same hours later. But it is not just ads. His vast wealth has created a campaign able to spend lavishly on itself, in stark contrast to the usual bare-bolts style of most presidential efforts. Bloomberg is subsidizing some campaign staff\u2019s rent, workers have been issued the latest iPhones and MacBooks and their wages are high. At events, potential voters are given free feasts of steak sandwiches, smoked salmon and honeyed brie. The campaign has even hired hundreds of people in California to post positive things about Bloomberg on their social media accounts and to text their friends about him, according to the Wall Street Journal. Spending the most money doesn\u2019t guarantee a win, but Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, author of Political Brands, said for a politician, getting their name in front of people is invaluable. \u201cThe candidate who is willing to merchandise themselves is usually the candidate who wins,\u201d said Torres-Spelliscy. Recent polls indicate the spending is certainly helping. Bloomberg entered the race in November 2019 with 3% support. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday showed support for Bloomberg jumped to 14%, putting him behind only Bernie Sanders and Biden. He is leading in some states, such as Florida and Oklahoma.

The former New York mayor was the main target of the other five Democratic candidates and he looked flustered as they volleyed brutal criticisms about his policies and past comments. \u201cDemocrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another,\u201d the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said in her opening remarks, reminding Bloomberg of his past insults to women and gay people.

Breed repeatedly had to defend Bloomberg\u2019s stop-and-frisk policy and when asked about it, told NPR: \u201cI think that unfortunately it occurred, and there isn\u2019t a politician alive that hasn\u2019t made a mistake, and their policy sometimes has led to a situation like this that has negatively impacted the African American community.\u201d Some have suggested this money has had a chilling effect, by silencing those who have benefited from his backing. Advocates for homeless people and teachers in New York told HuffPost how Bloomberg\u2019s web of patronage could create a culture that limited criticism of the mayor\u2019s work. He has also donated money to Republicans. In 2012, he gave $1m to the state senate Republicans\u2019 general fund, following earlier donations to state senators who helped make same-sex marriage legal in the state. The other billionaire The closest model for Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is the billionaire who already occupies the Oval Office: Trump.

      "bodyText": "Two of Britain\u2019s biggest estate agency groups are in talks over a possible \u00a3470m merger that would bring together well-known brands such as Hamptons International and Your Move. A combination of Countrywide and LSL would create a company with about 14,000 employees and 1,000 estate agent branches. News of the talks, which are in early stages but thought to be serious, sparked fears that the tie-up would lead to scores of branch closures and job losses. Countrywide is the UK\u2019s largest listed estate agent group by branches, and sells and rents properties through 60 high street brands including Hamptons International, Bairstow Eves and Gascoigne-Pees. When Countrywide floated in March 2013 amid a buoyant housing market, it was worth \u00a3750m. Since then its market value has shrunk to \u00a3111m \u2013 less than a third of LSL\u2019s \u00a3360m value \u2013 as it has struggled with mounting losses and a heavy debt burden in recent years. Countrywide has more than 850 branches across the UK and employs 9,500 people. It started closing outlets a year ago and has reportedly shut about 250, and recently announced the \u00a338m sale of its commercial property arm Lambert Smith Hampton. Its troubles prompted Countrywide\u2019s founder, Harry Hill, to tweet in July that the \u201cbusiness is beyond salvation\u201d, as he criticised its executive chairman Peter Long, who also used to chair Royal Mail. Long stepped up to executive chair at Countrywide in January 2018 after the company issued two profit warnings in three months and Alison Platt quit as chief executive. LSL owns estate agency chains Your Move, Reeds Rains and the London brand Marsh &amp; Parsons, and has about 4,200 employees and 360 branches. It shut 124 Your Move and Reeds Rains outlets last year with the loss of 460 jobs. One industry analyst said: \u201cThese are two companies that are struggling. They\u2019ve both got to restructure. They can cut out a lot of central costs by having one head office and combining IT systems.\u201d Countrywide has blamed Brexit for its malaise, and rival Foxtons has also suffered. Traditional estate agents are also under pressure from a recent breed of online estate agents such as Purplebricks, as well as longer-established property websites including Rightmove and Zoopla. The Brexit vote in June 2016 led to a downturn in the housing market but there have been signs of a pickup in the past month as confidence has returned among buyers and sellers. Countrywide confirmed it was in discussions with LSL regarding a \u201cpossible all-share combination\u201d but said there could be no certainty an offer would ultimately be made. LSL issued a similar statement, and said it \u201creserves the right to introduce other forms of consideration and/or vary the mix or composition of consideration of any offer\u201d. The firm has to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Countrywide by 23 March.",

The company is just one of a number of online flight-booking agencies to collapse in recent months, and its demise raises questions about the adequacy of self-regulation in the industry. Among the hundreds of Fly365 customers to have potentially lost money from the company\u2019s collapse are James Price and Steven Somers, who spent $11,000 booking flights to Europe for themselves and family members on Friday, 14 February. The couple booked the trip after Somers was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in January. \u201cWe decided that with a host of potential travel issues in the future we\u2019d go while we still could, we wanted to travel with our family to Europe,\u201d Price said. The money was withdrawn from their account five days later, but when Somers attempted to choose seats on the flight he discovered the booking reference number didn\u2019t work. The couple attempted to contact Fly365 on Friday, only to receive a one-line response stating the company was \u201cno longer trading\u201d. \u201cPlease be advised that Fly365 Pty Ltd is no longer trading. Please contact your airline directly regarding bookings you have made,\u201d the email seen by the Guardian read. After finding out the name of the liquidator and being added to a list of creditors, Somers set up a Facebook group to see whether others had also lost money making bookings with the company. 24 hours later the group now has more than 250 members, with some saying they made bookings with the company only the day before it entered voluntary liquidation while others have been unable to receive refunds on flights cancelled due to the spread of the coronavirus. But Fly365 is just the latest in a string of online booking companies to go belly-up. In January last year the collapse of online booking site Bestjetleft travellers who booked flights through the company thousands of dollars out of pocket and searching for answers. Bestjet was founded by Rachel James, the wife of former Air Australia owner Michael James, just weeks after the budget airline\u2019s high-profile collapse in 2012. The company\u2019s former general manager, Scott Mayne, is also a director of Fly365, according to documents lodged with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. Unlike Bestjet, however, Fly365 was accredited with the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, the organisation charged with the self-regulation of travel agencies in Australia. On Monday Afta\u2019s chief executive, Jayson Westbury, said in a statement that the organisation would give \u201cserious consideration\u201d to reviewing the way it applies its travel accreditation scheme, known as Atas, to online travel agents. \u201cThis is a very regrettable situation and Afta strongly believes that contributing circumstances beyond the control of Afta and the Atas scheme have resulted in this outcome,\u201d Westbury said. \u201cAfta does all that it can to monitor and review travel businesses who hold Atas accreditation and for the most part this has enabled Afta to predict certain outcomes \u2013 but on this occasion, unfortunately, Afta was not in a position to either provide advance support to the business prior to its failure or predict this outcome. \u201cWhile the liquidation process will need to run its course, a much deeper review of the situation is being undertaken by Afta and a further review of the Atas scheme will be given serious consideration as it applies to online travel agents in Australia.\u201d",

Next month will mark the 50th anniversary of Bitches Brew, a pivotal album that altered the trajectory of jazz, messed with the boundaries of funk, and pushed psychedelic rock to new heights of exploration. A double set released in March 1970, Bitches greatly advanced a pattern of progression in Davis\u2019s music that snaked back to the start of his recording career in the 1950s. The full arc of Davis\u2019s sound, and life, forms the basis of Birth of the Cool, a two-hour film created for the PBS series American Masters. (The film, which debuts on 25 February in the US, opens in the UK on 13 March and also spawned a new soundtrack on Legacy Records.) It covers everything from Davis\u2019s ravenous creative development, to his ever-evolving fashion sense, to his complex relationship with women. But a key part of the drama centers on what led up to, and followed, the creative Vesuvius that was Bitches Brew.</p> <p>McLaughlin found himself a central figure in that drama immediately after arriving in New York from his home in Europe at the start of 1969. \u201cI was nervous as anything, with sweat running off me,\u201d the guitarist recalled, with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019d only been in New York for 48 hours and I was with my hero!\u201d</p> <p>McLaughlin had come to America to join Lifetime, a new band led by Davis\u2019s drummer, Tony Williams. But before he could start working with Williams, Davis snagged him, despite the fact that the trumpeter hadn\u2019t heard McLaughlin\u2019s just-recorded debut solo album, which planted the seeds for what would become the fusion movement. Davis seized on the young McLaughlin purely on the strength of Williams having hired him, as well as on his interest in using an electric guitar on the album he was starting to record, In a Silent Way. It was an album that would become nearly as legendary as Bitches. McLaughlin calls the Silent Way sessions a \u201cbaptism by fire\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a455e764dc4241b0ea34e8fc77d19588527dc95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a455e764dc4241b0ea34e8fc77d19588527dc95/0_0_3504_2470/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McLaughlin in 1974\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McLaughlin in 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Dickson / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As soon as they started recording, Davis gave the young player cryptic instructions, such as \u201cplay like you don\u2019t know how to play guitar\u201d, McLaughlin recalled. \u201cI just closed the score and started playing: no rhythm, no harmony, just playing the melody and casting my fate to the wind. He loved it.\u201d</p> <p>Silent Way \u2013 which also featured key players like Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul \u2013 represented Davis\u2019s first all-electric album, following dalliances in that direction the year before on the Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro albums. Though a contemplative and inward work, Silent Way made a deep impression when it came out in July 1969, encouraging Davis to expand his electric forays exponentially with Bitches. McLaughlin\u2019s guitar proved crucial to that expansion. \u201cMiles took me under his wing,\u201d the musician said. \u201cI used to go over to his house on West 77th Street and he always wanted me to bring my guitar. I lost count of how many days I spent there, just hanging out. He would hit a couple of chords on the piano and say: \u2018What do you hear? Do you hear a riff? A bass line?\u2019 In England, I had earned my living playing rhythm and blues, funk and R&amp;B-jazz. So, Miles picked my brain for anything he could relate to.\u201d</p> <p>Davis was curious, too, about the new sound of psychedelia. \u201cHe was asking me about Jimi [Hendrix],\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cWe had played together and I loved Jimi. Miles had never seen him. So, I took him to this art movie theater downtown to see the film Monterey Pop where Jimi ended by squirting lighter fluid on his guitar, setting it on fire. Miles was next to me saying: \u2018Fuuck!\u2019 He was enchanted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiles was being influenced by everything around him,\u201d Troupe said. \u201cHe was trying to move his music forward.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"048b113201d503d1092405fe5034a21bbd674209\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048b113201d503d1092405fe5034a21bbd674209/0_510_2863_2353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miles Davis in 1970\" width=\"1000\" height=\"822\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miles Davis in 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was motivated, too, by the changing taste of the public. \u201c1969 was the year jazz seemed to be withering on the vine,\u201d Davis said in his official biography. \u201cWe played to a lot of half empty clubs. That told me something. I started realizing that most rock musicians didn\u2019t know anything about music. I figured if they could sell all those records without knowing what they were really doing, I could too \u2013 only better.\u201d</p> <p>Just six months separated the sessions between Silent Way and Bitches. The latter took place over three days in August 1969, one week after Woodstock. Still, the two sessions seemed a world apart, given the dense cultural, aesthetic and political changes of the time. \u201cThat period was<em> very</em> volatile,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThe Vietnam war was happening, the whole black-white thing in America \u2026 Things were moving very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>When the musicians entered the studio to record Bitches, \u201cit was clear that Miles wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted\u201d, McLaughlin recalled. \u201cBut he knew what he <em>didn\u2019t </em>want. He didn\u2019t want anything like what he had done before. He wanted it more rough and ready. We didn\u2019t really have any scores, maybe just some chords he wrote down on a piece of paper from the bag he brought his coffee in. He\u2019d set a tempo and we\u2019d start. Every time we hit a groove, a really nice beat, he was happy and then he\u2019d start playing. We just moved from one experiment to the next.\u201d</p> <p>Along the way, Davis would throw more inscrutable instructions at the musicians \u2013 which again, included Shorter, Zawinul and Corea, along with the bassist Dave Holland. \u201c\u2018Play the space,\u2019 he told me,\u201d McLaughlin said, with a laugh. \u201cWhat does that mean? It was like hearing a koan from a zen master.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q26k14yBAnM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q26k14yBAnM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But it had a positive effect. \u201cIt obliged you to think differently,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get into musical habits the same way you get into daily habits. You have to beware of musical indolence. Miles was very much an overseer against musical indolence. He wanted blood and guts and heart <em>all the time</em>.\u201d</p> <p>The subsequent throw-it-at-the-wall approach resulted in sections that went nowhere, with parts that had to be thrown out. Consequently, the final album was a collage, assembled from various segments overseen by Davis and producer Teo Macero. \u201cMiles loved Teo,\u201d said Troupe. \u201cBut, in the end, it was his name that was going to be on it: he\u2019s the creator of this.\u201d</p> <p>The musicians themselves were surprised by some of the final recording. \u201cSometimes in the studio, you don\u2019t see the wood for the trees,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cBut to hear the album, you hear it all.\u201d</p> <p>And there was a lot to hear. Everything about the music amplified Davis\u2019s earlier approach. He featured more musicians that he had ever used before, often doubling, or tripling, the keyboardists and drummers. \u201cHe was opening up from his strict little quartets and quintets,\u201d Troupe said. \u201cHe had access to a lot of different musicians and he could plug them in anytime he wanted to. And they were all young, energetic and different.\u201d</p> <p>The goal, Troupe said, was to create \u201ca maelstrom of music. Everything swirling around him, going in different directions at once.

      "bodyText": "Guitarist John McLaughlin, who helped electrify Miles Davis\u2019s music, describes Bitches Brew as \u201cPicasso in sound\u201d. Stanley Nelson, who directed a new documentary on Davis, calls it \u201can all-out assault\u201d, while Davis\u2019s official biographer, Quincy Troupe, labels it \u201ca cultural breakthrough: it sounded like the future\u201d. Fifty years on, it still does. Next month will mark the 50th anniversary of Bitches Brew, a pivotal album that altered the trajectory of jazz, messed with the boundaries of funk, and pushed psychedelic rock to new heights of exploration. A double set released in March 1970, Bitches greatly advanced a pattern of progression in Davis\u2019s music that snaked back to the start of his recording career in the 1950s. The full arc of Davis\u2019s sound, and life, forms the basis of Birth of the Cool, a two-hour film created for the PBS series American Masters. (The film, which debuts on 25 February in the US, opens in the UK on 13 March and also spawned a new soundtrack on Legacy Records.) It covers everything from Davis\u2019s ravenous creative development, to his ever-evolving fashion sense, to his complex relationship with women. But a key part of the drama centers on what led up to, and followed, the creative Vesuvius that was Bitches Brew. McLaughlin found himself a central figure in that drama immediately after arriving in New York from his home in Europe at the start of 1969. \u201cI was nervous as anything, with sweat running off me,\u201d the guitarist recalled, with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019d only been in New York for 48 hours and I was with my hero!\u201d McLaughlin had come to America to join Lifetime, a new band led by Davis\u2019s drummer, Tony Williams. But before he could start working with Williams, Davis snagged him, despite the fact that the trumpeter hadn\u2019t heard McLaughlin\u2019s just-recorded debut solo album, which planted the seeds for what would become the fusion movement. Davis seized on the young McLaughlin purely on the strength of Williams having hired him, as well as on his interest in using an electric guitar on the album he was starting to record, In a Silent Way. It was an album that would become nearly as legendary as Bitches. McLaughlin calls the Silent Way sessions a \u201cbaptism by fire\u201d. As soon as they started recording, Davis gave the young player cryptic instructions, such as \u201cplay like you don\u2019t know how to play guitar\u201d, McLaughlin recalled. \u201cI just closed the score and started playing: no rhythm, no harmony, just playing the melody and casting my fate to the wind. He loved it.\u201d Silent Way \u2013 which also featured key players like Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul \u2013 represented Davis\u2019s first all-electric album, following dalliances in that direction the year before on the Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro albums. Though a contemplative and inward work, Silent Way made a deep impression when it came out in July 1969, encouraging Davis to expand his electric forays exponentially with Bitches. McLaughlin\u2019s guitar proved crucial to that expansion. \u201cMiles took me under his wing,\u201d the musician said. \u201cI used to go over to his house on West 77th Street and he always wanted me to bring my guitar. I lost count of how many days I spent there, just hanging out. He would hit a couple of chords on the piano and say: \u2018What do you hear? Do you hear a riff? A bass line?\u2019 In England, I had earned my living playing rhythm and blues, funk and R&amp;B-jazz. So, Miles picked my brain for anything he could relate to.\u201d Davis was curious, too, about the new sound of psychedelia. \u201cHe was asking me about Jimi [Hendrix],\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cWe had played together and I loved Jimi. Miles had never seen him. So, I took him to this art movie theater downtown to see the film Monterey Pop where Jimi ended by squirting lighter fluid on his guitar, setting it on fire. Miles was next to me saying: \u2018Fuuck!\u2019 He was enchanted.\u201d \u201cMiles was being influenced by everything around him,\u201d Troupe said. \u201cHe was trying to move his music forward.\u201d He was motivated, too, by the changing taste of the public. \u201c1969 was the year jazz seemed to be withering on the vine,\u201d Davis said in his official biography. \u201cWe played to a lot of half empty clubs. That told me something. I started realizing that most rock musicians didn\u2019t know anything about music. I figured if they could sell all those records without knowing what they were really doing, I could too \u2013 only better.\u201d Just six months separated the sessions between Silent Way and Bitches. The latter took place over three days in August 1969, one week after Woodstock. Still, the two sessions seemed a world apart, given the dense cultural, aesthetic and political changes of the time. \u201cThat period was very volatile,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThe Vietnam war was happening, the whole black-white thing in America \u2026 Things were moving very quickly.\u201d When the musicians entered the studio to record Bitches, \u201cit was clear that Miles wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted\u201d, McLaughlin recalled. \u201cBut he knew what he didn\u2019t want. He didn\u2019t want anything like what he had done before. He wanted it more rough and ready. We didn\u2019t really have any scores, maybe just some chords he wrote down on a piece of paper from the bag he brought his coffee in. He\u2019d set a tempo and we\u2019d start. Every time we hit a groove, a really nice beat, he was happy and then he\u2019d start playing. We just moved from one experiment to the next.\u201d Along the way, Davis would throw more inscrutable instructions at the musicians \u2013 which again, included Shorter, Zawinul and Corea, along with the bassist Dave Holland. \u201c\u2018Play the space,\u2019 he told me,\u201d McLaughlin said, with a laugh. \u201cWhat does that mean? It was like hearing a koan from a zen master.\u201d But it had a positive effect. \u201cIt obliged you to think differently,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get into musical habits the same way you get into daily habits. You have to beware of musical indolence. Miles was very much an overseer against musical indolence. He wanted blood and guts and heart all the time.\u201d The subsequent throw-it-at-the-wall approach resulted in sections that went nowhere, with parts that had to be thrown out. Consequently, the final album was a collage, assembled from various segments overseen by Davis and producer Teo Macero. \u201cMiles loved Teo,\u201d said Troupe. \u201cBut, in the end, it was his name that was going to be on it: he\u2019s the creator of this.\u201d The musicians themselves were surprised by some of the final recording. \u201cSometimes in the studio, you don\u2019t see the wood for the trees,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cBut to hear the album, you hear it all.\u201d And there was a lot to hear. Everything about the music amplified Davis\u2019s earlier approach. He featured more musicians that he had ever used before, often doubling, or tripling, the keyboardists and drummers. \u201cHe was opening up from his strict little quartets and quintets,\u201d Troupe said. \u201cHe had access to a lot of different musicians and he could plug them in anytime he wanted to. And they were all young, energetic and different.\u201d The goal, Troupe said, was to create \u201ca maelstrom of music. Everything swirling around him, going in different directions at once. And he was at the center, directing everything like a mad scientist.\u201d \u201cIt was Miles painting with music,\u201d McLaughlin said, \u201cand we were all his brushes.\u201d The result gave the music a quality at once unsettling and intriguing. In the long tracks \u2013 two of which occupy their own side \u2013 the musicians forever seem to be coalescing around something, moving towards a target without ever quite arriving. It\u2019s the sound of perpetual discovery, without a final destination. \u201cWhen you explore, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to run into,\u201d Troupe said. \u201cIt\u2019s following your instincts. Music wasn\u2019t a final resting place for Miles. It was a way forward.\u201d At the same time, the music left some of the audience, and certain critics, behind. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole group of people who talk about Kind of Blue as the be all and end all,\u201d Nelson said of that 1959, landmark release. \u201cBut Bitches Brew was something new.

      "bodyText": "The world is fast approaching a tipping point in the spread of the coronavirus, according to experts, who warn that the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it, after major outbreaks forced Italy and Iran to introduce stringent internal travel restrictions and South Korea\u2019s president placed the country on red alert. Some of the countries most affected by the virus are scrambling to halt its progress two days after Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said the international community needed to act quickly before the narrowing \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d closed completely. With almost 78,000 cases of Covid-19 now confirmed across the globe, experts say the situation will soon reach a critical threshold. In 11 north Italian towns, 50,000 people have been in lockdown since Friday night, with police patrolling the streets and fines imposed on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. In Iran, the authorities have ordered the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces as \u201ca preventative measure\u201d. On Sunday, South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on \u201cred alert\u201d after it reported its sixth death and more than 600 infections. And four of the 32 British and Irish Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers flown to the UK on Saturday have tested positive for Covid-19, the Chief Medical Officer for England said on Sunday. It brings the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 13. While the number of patients worldwide is increasing, some virus clusters have shown no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia and an authority on the new coronavirus infection, echoed Tedros\u2019s warning and said the time for containing the disease was running out. \u201cThe director general of the WHO has recently spoken of a narrowing of the window of opportunity to control the current epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tipping point after which our ability to prevent a global pandemic ends seems a lot closer after the past 24 hours.\u201d Hunter said that while cases were declining in China, where the outbreak began, the weekend had seen some \u201cextremely concerning developments elsewhere\u201d. He said the surge in South Korean cases had been unprecedented so far in the epidemic, adding: \u201cThe identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to be quite a few more cases identified in the next few days.\u201d Hunter also said the situation in Iran could have major implications for the Middle East. \u201cA further problem with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region,\u201d he said. Dr Robin Thompson, junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, pointed out that case numbers in Italy had doubled between Friday and Saturday. \u201cThis is an important stage of the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d he said. \u201cFast isolation of even mild cases in affected areas is important for preventing substantial person-to-person transmission in Europe. It is critical that public health guidelines are followed.\u201d Two people have died from the virus in Italy since Friday and more than a hundred cases have now been reported, most of them centred around the small town of Codogno, about 40 miles south-east of Milan. Those living in the affected areas now face what the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said could be weeks of lockdown. The final two days of the Venice carnival were cancelled and Milan fashion week was also affected. Iran has recorded eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases, bringing the overall number of infections to 43. Four new infections surfaced in the capital, Tehran, seven in the city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said. Pakistan responded by closing its land border with Iran, while Afghanistan said it was suspending travel to Iran \u201cto prevent the spread of the novel \u001dcoronavirus and protect the public\u201d. Turkey also closed its borders and said it would halt incoming flights, adding that all motorways and railways at the border would be shut on Sunday afternoon. Jordan, meanwhile, will not allow entry to citizens of China, Iran and South Korea and other foreigners travelling from those countries in response to the deadly outbreak. Announcing his decision to raise South Korea\u2019s alert level on Sunday, Moon said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take \u201cunprecedented, powerful\u201d measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by \u201cregulations\u201d. As his country struggled to contain theoutbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as \u201ca very important moment\u201d, the news agency Yonhap said. Of the 123 new cases, 75 were related to the Shincheonji church in Daegu, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city, and a neighbouring hospital. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they had placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers had been screened for the virus. The raising of the alert level came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country\u2019s management of the outbreak. Warning that China\u2019s virus epidemic was \u201cstill grim and complex,\u201d the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, called on Sunday for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting the spring planting of crops. Xi defended the ruling Communist party\u2019s response as \u201ctimely and effective\u201d in a video conference with officials in charge of anti-disease work, according to the Xinhua news agency. \u201cThe current epidemic situation is still grim and complex,\u201d Xinhua cited Xi as saying. \u201cPrevention and control are at the most critical stage.\u201d AFP and the Associated Press contributed to this report",

In the current government women make up 24% of the 329 representatives in parliament, 10% more following the 2012 election. \u201cWomen are powerless only when they are outside the political space,\u201d said Ikraam Hirsi, who was among a wave of young politicians who dared to challenge the status quo in the last election. \u201cBut once we are in the parliament we have equal votes and have even proven to be more capable and more committed than men.\u201d Hirsi said she is planning to seek another term to continue the fight for gender equality in Somalia. \u201cOur target is not just 30%,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to demand our constitutional rights for full political participation, we will not stop there until we reach our goal.\u201d The passing of the law is seen as a milestone by the government and its international partners but many critics, including major opposition leaders and federal member states, say they have not been fully consulted on the changes. \u201cGiven the current political and security situation, a one person, one vote election does not seem feasible,\u201d said Abdimalik Abdullahi, a Somali political analyst. \u201cTwo important federal member states [Puntland and Jubaland] are at loggerheads with the government. There is also a high tension in Gedo region between military forces loyal to the federal government and Jubaland security forces, which could blow into a full-scale conflict.\u201d Of particular concern to the opposition parties is article 53 of the electoral law, which says elections will be postponed in the event of a national disaster such as floods, famine or armed conflict. The article is seen as a mechanism that the government could use to extend its term. Earlier this month, the regional government of Puntland closed the offices of the national independent electoral commission and called for a meeting of the federal member states to discuss critical issues about the elections and the country\u2019s federalism project. \u201cPuntland administration had closed our offices but they have not boycotted Somalia\u2019s general election,\u201d said Ismail. \u201cThey have called for an inclusive dialogue and we hope something good will come out of the expected talks. \u201cAs a commission we have made all necessary preparations for a general election. Every technical detail has been put in place, but it is up to the Somali political leaders to come together and reach consensus on the way forward. If only there is political will among the Somali elites, then it is possible to hold a one person, one vote election by the end of the year.\u201d",

When the Food and Drug Administration in the United States licensed IQOS there, it said the high nicotine hit it delivered could make it an attractive alternative to cigarettes for smokers, but there was a risk of creating addiction in non-smokers.</p> \n<p>Ash has advocated a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d fund for smoking cessation services, but not one that transitions people on to other addictive tobacco products. Arnott said PMI was seeking to buy respectability, access to government and a role in smoking policy that the industry at the moment is categorically denied.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is completely unacceptable,\u201d said Arnott. \u201cThe tobacco industry is the most profitable consumer business on the planet, selling products which kill 7 million people a year globally and nearly 100,000 in the UK alone. The industry can afford to pay and it should be made to pay, not allowed a seat at the government policymaking table so it can ensure the fund is used to further the interests of its shareholders rather than public health.\u201d</p> \n<p>The MP who met PMI was Labour\u2019s Kevin Barron, now retired, who has an exemplary record in combating smoking and is credited with getting the bill that banned smoking in public places through parliament. Barron said he believed e-cigarettes and other nicotine-delivery devices that were less harmful than cigarettes had an important part to play and he had no qualms in meeting companies that wanted to go in that direction.</p> \n<p>The internal documents \u2013 an email and two briefing papers \u2013 are dated March and May 2018. An email from Mark MacGregor, PMI\u2019s corporate affairs director and a former chief executive of the Conservative party, said an exploratory conversation with the MP had been extremely positive. \u201cHe understands the concept of the \u2018deal\u2019 that is on offer and is very attracted to the incentive that the fund could provide to change behaviours among smokers and the industry \u2013 though balanced by enabling industry to inform smokers,\u201d it said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"722072136cc3052c728d9d9a017228b264f4bd2f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/722072136cc3052c728d9d9a017228b264f4bd2f/244_677_4665_2799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People try IQOS\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People try IQOS during a demonstration at a store in Tokyo, Japan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Washington Post/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That would have meant the removal of advertising restrictions. PMI proposed the setting up of a \u00a31bn fund over 10 years from 2021 in exchange for the loosening of laws curbing advertising of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products. The money was to come from all the major tobacco companies with products on the market in the UK.</p> \n<p>The documents show that the bill, if passed, would have rewritten the rules on e-cigarettes after the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. A European directive dictates the size and strength of nicotine liquids in e-cigarettes, which has, for instance, resulted in Juul devices popular with young people containing only 20mg of nicotine instead of 59mg in the USA, so that they are less addictive. That restriction would go, as would limits on packaging and advertising. The relevant parts of the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016, which enshrined the EU rules in UK law, would be repealed, \u201cenabling adult smokers to make informed decisions\u201d, the document says.</p> \n<p>PMI envisaged that IQOS would be redefined as a \u201cconsiderably less harmful novel smokeless tobacco product\u201d (CLHTP). Such products would have lighter regulation and would be promoted to people who cannot stop smoking and do not switch to e-cigarettes, says the document. \u201cPublicly funded public health communications and anti-smoking campaigns, as well as professional health advice such as Nice guidance, must include advice on e-cigarettes and CLHTPs,\u201d says PMI\u2019s draft bill.</p> \n<p>The money from the fund would mostly go to local authorities, which are responsible for smoking cessation programmes. Public Health England would get \u00a315m \u201cto facilitate switching\u201d from cigarettes to IQOS, and would have to \u201creport annually on its efforts and achievements in improving the scientific knowledge base and consumer understanding of non-combustible alternatives\u201d.</p> \n<p>Barron introduced a 10-minute-rule bill to the Commons on 30 October 2018 that proposed the tobacco transition fund. He had met PMI earlier in the year, has had disussions with other tobacco companies, and maintains it was the right thing to do. He said the issue was simple: smoking kills 50% of users and more than 200 people a day. Tobacco companies are now promoting and selling products that are up to 95% safer and satisfy people\u2019s addiction. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be encouraging them to do that?\u201d he asked.</p> \n<p>He said companies must not be able to stipulate that their specific products must be used. \u201cYou cannot buy the market, although they have money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they want to promote a safer, less harmful product for somebody who is addicted to nicotine, my view is we should help them to do that because it will lessen the deaths from combustible tobacco. So I did the 10-minute-rule bill. I spoke to ministers and said this was what it was about. I don\u2019t think the discussions were completely hostile.\u201d</p> \n<p>The bill, competing with 149 others, was not adopted. Ash worries that in the post-Brexit world, the EU\u2019s tight regulations over e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products could be lifted with the sort of consequences that occurred in the US when Juul took off among teens.</p> \n<p>Arnott said: \u201cAsh has worked with Kevin Barron for decades. He led the campaign in parliament to ban tobacco advertising and it\u2019s thanks to his work that pubs are now smoke-free. If, as it looks like, PMI persuaded Kevin Barron of the need for government to partner with the industry, their \u2018normalisation\u2019 strategy is clearly working.</p> \n<p>\u201cKevin may have left parliament, but PMI\u2019s parliamentary and public relations campaign continues. Now the government has committed to considering the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 approach, PMI will be lobbying to ensure it\u2019s structured to suit their commercial interests.\u201d</p> \n<p>Philip Morris said it supported the government\u2019s commitment to make England smoke-free by 2030. \u201cTo realise this ambition, millions of current smokers need to be persuaded to quit altogether or switch to less harmful alternatives. Critical to this will be putting in place a regulatory framework that ensures smokers have the facts about alternatives and that tobacco companies are pushed to phase out cigarettes.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have made this point time and time again to MPs, civil servants, local councillors, journalists and the broader public. What this story really shows is that Philip Morris has been consistent in its efforts to make smoke-free 2030 a reality.\u201d</p>",

He said companies must not be able to stipulate that their specific products must be used. \u201cYou cannot buy the market, although they have money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they want to promote a safer, less harmful product for somebody who is addicted to nicotine, my view is we should help them to do that because it will lessen the deaths from combustible tobacco. So I did the 10-minute-rule bill. I spoke to ministers and said this was what it was about. I don\u2019t think the discussions were completely hostile.\u201d The bill, competing with 149 others, was not adopted. Ash worries that in the post-Brexit world, the EU\u2019s tight regulations over e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products could be lifted with the sort of consequences that occurred in the US when Juul took off among teens. Arnott said: \u201cAsh has worked with Kevin Barron for decades. He led the campaign in parliament to ban tobacco advertising and it\u2019s thanks to his work that pubs are now smoke-free. If, as it looks like, PMI persuaded Kevin Barron of the need for government to partner with the industry, their \u2018normalisation\u2019 strategy is clearly working. \u201cKevin may have left parliament, but PMI\u2019s parliamentary and public relations campaign continues. Now the government has committed to considering the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 approach, PMI will be lobbying to ensure it\u2019s structured to suit their commercial interests.\u201d Philip Morris said it supported the government\u2019s commitment to make England smoke-free by 2030. \u201cTo realise this ambition, millions of current smokers need to be persuaded to quit altogether or switch to less harmful alternatives. Critical to this will be putting in place a regulatory framework that ensures smokers have the facts about alternatives and that tobacco companies are pushed to phase out cigarettes. \u201cWe have made this point time and time again to MPs, civil servants, local councillors, journalists and the broader public. What this story really shows is that Philip Morris has been consistent in its efforts to make smoke-free 2030 a reality.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Sci-fi aside, how long will I live?</h2> <p>Living to 100 will soon become a routine fact of (long) life. Life expectancies have been rising by up to three months a year since 1840 and although gains in the UK began to slow in 2011, it is still estimated that more than half the babies born in wealthier countries since 2000 may reach their 100th birthdays.</p> <p>It is an impressive increase: in the early 1900s, the probability of a baby reaching 100 was 1%. A newborn in the UK today has a 50% chance of living to 105. There were 3,600 centenarians in 1986. Today there are some 15,000.</p> <p>You do not have to be a newborn to benefit from this trend of increased longevity, though. A 60-year-old in the west today has an even chance of living to 90 and a 40-year-old can expect to live to 95.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-12T11:38:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK longevity graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-12T11:38:15/embed.html\">UK longevity graph</a> </figure>  <p>But the longevity boost is not done yet: it is generally agreed that the natural ceiling to human life is somewhere around 115. Others say that even without cutting-edge AI or other technological wizardry, we could live far longer. Opinion broadly divides into three groups: the \u201clevellers\u201d who say we are at peak lifespan now. The \u201cextrapolators\u201d who argue that technology and education have made their biggest leaps but can squeak us up to a ceiling of 120 before levelling off for good. And the \u201caccelerators\u201d \u2013 those determined to defeat ageing, who believe we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in scientific and technological research that will increase longevity, pushing us into the realms of immortality.</p> <h2>Why are we living so much longer?</h2> <p>Life expectancy has been increasing since we cracked infant mortality in the 19th century. Economy, technology, healthcare and education have all combined with vaccines, safer childbirth and medical advances in the care of stroke and heart attack patients to keep the relentless pace of increasing longevity going strong.</p> <p>But the growth in life expectancy began to slow in 2011 in the UK and people live longer in more than two dozen other countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-12T11:36:23/embed.html\" data-alt=\"World life expectancy chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-12T11:36:23/embed.html\">World life expectancy chart</a> </figure>  <p>There has not been a big medical or health gamechanger in the past couple of decades. While some argue that we should celebrate the longest lifespans that humans have ever attained, others warn that illness and infirmity risk turning long lives into slow, miserable declines.</p> <h2>How to avoid this? How can I stay healthy for longer?</h2> <p><br>In his essay on ageing, De Senectute, Cicero says there are four reasons why people write off old age: it stops you working, it makes your body weak, it denies you pleasure and every day is one step closer to death. Then he shows why each argument is wrong. \u201cThe old retain their wits quite well,\u201d he notes, \u201cso long as they exercise them\u201d.</p> <p>Dan Buettner coined the term \u201cblue zones\u201d for five regions he identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others (they are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2006/may/31/japan.shortbreaks\" title=\"\">Okinawa</a> in Japan, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/sardinia\" title=\"\">Sardinia</a> in Italy, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2005/aug/06/costarica.guardiansaturdaytravelsection\" title=\"\">Nicoya</a> peninsula in Costa Rica, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loma_Linda,_California\" title=\"\">Loma Linda</a> in California and Ikaria in Greece). The diets of those living in these regions, he discovered, consist almost entirely of minimally processed plant-based foods \u2013 mostly wholegrains, greens, nuts, tubers and beans. Meat is eaten, on average, five times a month. They drink mostly water, herbal teas, coffee and some wine. They drink little or no cow\u2019s milk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da17d166322c6bf59118ae0b01622c3775628fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da17d166322c6bf59118ae0b01622c3775628fb2/0_63_5347_3208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Market in Sardinia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sardinia is one of the regions where people\u2019s diet tends to give them longer lives. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other scientists have added different ideas to the mix. Sufficient sleep and a sense of purpose are important but exercise is key \u2013 at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week, plus twice-weekly muscle-strengthening sessions, to reap health and longevity benefits.</p> <p>Having said that, <a href=\"https://time.com/5438387/exercise-guidelines-benefits/\">short bouts of light physical activity</a>, such as walking and cleaning, have been shown to increase the lifespans of older people. And <a href=\"https://time.com/5502042/sitting-exercise-move/\">a study</a> published last January found that simply moving instead of sitting for 30 minutes each day could reduce the risk of early death by 17%.

      "bodyText": "Sci-fi aside, how long will I live? Living to 100 will soon become a routine fact of (long) life. Life expectancies have been rising by up to three months a year since 1840 and although gains in the UK began to slow in 2011, it is still estimated that more than half the babies born in wealthier countries since 2000 may reach their 100th birthdays. It is an impressive increase: in the early 1900s, the probability of a baby reaching 100 was 1%. A newborn in the UK today has a 50% chance of living to 105. There were 3,600 centenarians in 1986. Today there are some 15,000. You do not have to be a newborn to benefit from this trend of increased longevity, though. A 60-year-old in the west today has an even chance of living to 90 and a 40-year-old can expect to live to 95. But the longevity boost is not done yet: it is generally agreed that the natural ceiling to human life is somewhere around 115. Others say that even without cutting-edge AI or other technological wizardry, we could live far longer. Opinion broadly divides into three groups: the \u201clevellers\u201d who say we are at peak lifespan now. The \u201cextrapolators\u201d who argue that technology and education have made their biggest leaps but can squeak us up to a ceiling of 120 before levelling off for good. And the \u201caccelerators\u201d \u2013 those determined to defeat ageing, who believe we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in scientific and technological research that will increase longevity, pushing us into the realms of immortality. Why are we living so much longer? Life expectancy has been increasing since we cracked infant mortality in the 19th century. Economy, technology, healthcare and education have all combined with vaccines, safer childbirth and medical advances in the care of stroke and heart attack patients to keep the relentless pace of increasing longevity going strong. But the growth in life expectancy began to slow in 2011 in the UK and people live longer in more than two dozen other countries. There has not been a big medical or health gamechanger in the past couple of decades. While some argue that we should celebrate the longest lifespans that humans have ever attained, others warn that illness and infirmity risk turning long lives into slow, miserable declines. How to avoid this? How can I stay healthy for longer? In his essay on ageing, De Senectute, Cicero says there are four reasons why people write off old age: it stops you working, it makes your body weak, it denies you pleasure and every day is one step closer to death. Then he shows why each argument is wrong. \u201cThe old retain their wits quite well,\u201d he notes, \u201cso long as they exercise them\u201d. Dan Buettner coined the term \u201cblue zones\u201d for five regions he identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others (they are Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica, Loma Linda in California and Ikaria in Greece). The diets of those living in these regions, he discovered, consist almost entirely of minimally processed plant-based foods \u2013 mostly wholegrains, greens, nuts, tubers and beans. Meat is eaten, on average, five times a month. They drink mostly water, herbal teas, coffee and some wine. They drink little or no cow\u2019s milk. Other scientists have added different ideas to the mix. Sufficient sleep and a sense of purpose are important but exercise is key \u2013 at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week, plus twice-weekly muscle-strengthening sessions, to reap health and longevity benefits. Having said that, short bouts of light physical activity, such as walking and cleaning, have been shown to increase the lifespans of older people. And a study published last January found that simply moving instead of sitting for 30 minutes each day could reduce the risk of early death by 17%. Some research suggests that club sports such as tennis and soccer are best for longevity because they also encourage social interaction, another vital ingredient to longevity. What other ideas are there for prolonging healthy life? At conferences on longevity, it is immediately obvious during the morning breaks that the buffets remain largely untouched \u2013 and that everyone drinks their tea and coffee inky black, disdaining even a drop of milk. Most serious seekers of longevity also practice both calorific fasting and intermittent fasting. In a nutshell, the approach is to eat 30% fewer calories and fast for 16 hours a day, though this may not be appropriate for certain vulnerable groups. In essence, it means skipping breakfast and not making up for the missed meal during the day. No one knows quite why intermittent fasting works. The best guess is that it has something to do with metabolic switching and cellular stress resistance causing the body to increase production of antioxidants. Repeated studies on mice going back a century seem to prove that it works \u2013 on rodents, at least. Last December, the New England Journal of Medicine reviewed all the studies in this area and concluded that a combination of fasting and calorific reduction does slow ageing, extend lifespan and counteract age-related disorders, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and stroke. \u201cAnimal models show that intermittent fasting improves health throughout the lifespan,\u201d the paper concluded. The problem with gauging its efficacy on humans is that, as the paper said: \u201cIt remains to be determined whether people can maintain intermittent fasting for years and potentially accrue the benefits seen in animal models.\u201d Are there any anti-ageing drugs in the pipeline? US scientists are raising funds to launch a five-year clinical trial of a product called metformin, commonly prescribed for pre-diabetics and diabetics. Longevity advocates believe it may have a side effect slowing the development of age-related diseases. \u201cI\u2019m not telling everyone to go out and take it until our clinical trial proves it does what I believe it does,\u201d said Dr Nir Barzilai, the director of the Institute for Ageing at New York\u2019s Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \u201cBut if our trials come back with the results I expect then, yes, I believe everyone should take this drug.\u201d Even more niche are the the promises of Dr Aubrey de Gray, a gerontologist who founded the Sens (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) Research Foundation with the goal of \u201cundoing ageing\u201d. \u201cSens is defined by a focus on repairing molecular and cellular damage rather than on merely slowing down its accumulation,\u201d he said. The logistics of indefinitely healthy ageing will, he believes, be simple and affordable: \u201cMostly it\u2019ll be injections once a decade.\u201d Can I tell how long I\u2019m going to live? The latest epigenetic clock, DNAm PhenoAge, will shortly hit the shelves. Epigenetic clocks \u2013 a form of molecular augury \u2013 were first developed in 2011 and claim to offer a glimpse into the future. By analysing the pattern of chemical chains that attach to the DNA in your cells, these clocks apparently reveal how swiftly you are ageing \u2013 and perhaps even how much longer you will live. The big sell with these tests is that while DNA is fixed at birth, our epigenetic patterns change according to our lifestyles. The promise of those who produce these clocks for commercial use is that they enable us to calibrate our ageing. The tests haven\u2019t been independently evaluated and do not need to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration but that has not stopped some life insurance companies using the tests to predict lifespans. Researchers have jumped on board, too, using the clocks to test anti-ageing drugs and to look for an anti-ageing diet. Can I live for ever? Talk of immortality was \u201coutlaw science\u201d until a couple of decades ago but now it is attracting serious interest and big bucks: in 2013, Google invested $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) in an entire division, Calico, which is devoted to \u201csolving death\u201d.

There are plenty of claims that we can already slow down the ageing of cells \u2013 or senescence \u2013 but the most radical adherents claim that the first person to live to 1,000 has already been born.

An all-party caucus of humanist MPs and peers says reform of the way parliament works must include removing the guarantee of seats in the upper house for Anglican bishops. The All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group (APPHG), comprised of 115 MPs and members of the Lords, point out that the only other country where senior clerics must have seats in a parliament is Iran. The APPHG report will be published on Tuesday. Their report highlights how parliamentarians who don\u2019t take part in Christian prayer services in the Palace of Westminster are discriminated against. Humanist, atheist and secular MPs can miss out on seats in the House of Commons green benches for PMQs and other key debates, the report argues. It states that \u201cprayer cards\u201d for those taking part in services can secure seats. The report also calls for the introduction of \u201chumanist pastoral carers\u201d who can meet the pastoral needs of the growing number of parliamentarians who are humanists, atheists or agnostics at Westminster. It stresses that in other places, such as hospitals and prisons, non-religious humanist pastoral care services are provided. On their recommendation about Church of England bishops, the report cites nine cases where senior Anglican clerics used their guaranteed seats in the House of Lords to change the outcome of votes. These include two that directly benefited the C of E, the report says. In the first bishops\u2019 votes helped remove a clause in the Equality Act 2010, which enabled the C of E to have wider exemptions in its employment practices. The other vote on the Education and Adoption Act 2016 ensured that C of E maintained schools that are failing can be forcibly converted to academies, which the report says gave the church more control over its schools. The report criticises the unique speaking rights afforded to Anglican bishops and access to officials who are charged with writing new laws. On the issue of prayers before crucial Commons votes, one MP in the report said: \u201cI stand outside the House of Commons chamber at the start of the session, peering through the window as colleagues take part in prayers.

Everyone wants paedophiles and terrorists stopped. But suddenly, it becomes anyone suspected of a crime that brings more than two to three years imprisonment, if convicted. And then a whole heap of other people are having their personal affairs opened up to spy agencies. You don\u2019t have to be convicted.

Being Tuesday, that means it\u2019s party-room time, and there ain\u2019t no party like a bunch-of-people-pretending-they-are-all-under-the-one-policy-umbrella party. We\u2019ll bring you that, as well as everything else ghost-of-climate-wars past. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin, as well as everyone else in the Guardian brains trust. And thank you to you for following along, and all the messages. Apologies if I didn\u2019t get back to you, it gets a bit hectic, but I do try to at least read them all. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Until then \u2013 take care of you. Barnaby Joyce is explaining why some, including the Liberal-National NSW state government, are living in a \u201cfairytale nirvana\u201d by having a target of net zero emissions by 2050. He\u2019s on Sky News. Narrator: they did not. Asked about the criticism the government has levelled at her climate bill \u2013 which includes establishing a statutory body to monitor Australia\u2019s emissions reduction action, which government MPs have claimed would amount to an \u201cunelected tsar\u201d making policy decisions on behalf of Australia \u2013 Zali Steggall says: That is rubbish, that is like saying the RBA is an unelected tsar of the Australian economy; it is a very good, expert base arbiter of what needs to be done. At the end of the day the RBA doesn\u2019t take what the treasurer does in the way of policy but ... raises concerns when there are issues that need to be addressed. The commission would do the same. An expert-based commission, it would still appoint people to the commission, with appointments approved by the joint parliamentary committee \u2013 again, trying to take the partisan politics out of this and make this bipartisan approach to climate policy, the way the UK has. I can only assume that those comments from Jason [Falinski] and Tim [Wilson] are really just trying, they are scrambling, because they know everybody needs to get to a net zero by 2050. The business community knows this, state Coalition governments know this; for some reason, they can\u2019t seem to get their head around it. Zali Steggall does say, though, that Bettina Arndt being awarded an Australia Day honour \u201ccheapened\u201d the award: I was dumbfounded by that. Having received that medal myself I prize that in recognition of service to Australia and the community. I felt that cheapened the award and brought it into disrepute. I can certainly sympathise with the victims out there that that award, in light of her comments, is really hard to comprehend. Zali Steggall shaking her head, as Patricia Karvelas lays out Pauline Hanson\u2019s comments on the Queensland man who murdered his wife and children, is all of us. But she doesn\u2019t say whether or not Hanson should be removed from the family law court inquiry, as the Greens are calling for. Anthony Albanese has been on Sky News, talking to Kieran Gilbert. He is asked if Labor has learned the lesson of the last election and is prepared to put a cost-and-detail to its policy. He says, as he has all day, that yes, of course Labor has taken on that lesson, and it will consult with all the different sectors before it lands on its final roadmap. I say this to you here, Kieran, and when did Scott Morrison go on your program or on Insiders and be prepared to subject himself to a debate about the costs of inaction? Because I tell you what, we saw a bit of the cost of inaction over the bushfire season, when we lost 33 lives, when we lost over 3,000 homes, when we lost 12m hectares of land \u2013 when we have, who knows what the cost is. What we know is that the cost of that season certainly won\u2019t be $2bn that the government talks about. We know that more extreme weather events, we know the predictions are an increase in droughts. We know the consequences of dangerous climate change are catastrophic for our economy. Global economists predict that the cost of a greater-than-2C increase in global temperatures will be between 15 and 25% lower economic growth \u2013 a greater cost than we saw during the Great Depression. And one of the things that your job has to be, if I can be so bold, is to hold the government to account, that have Treasury, that have Finance, that won\u2019t meet its 2030 target. That\u2019s why they went to Madrid and argued for an accounting trick rather than actually lowering their emissions. And on the public spat he and Barnaby Joyce engaged in this morning, Joel Fitzgibbon tells Patricia Karvelas: Barnaby Joyce and I having a spat in Parliament House is nothing unusual. There are some things we agree on but plenty we disagree on, and of course he was out there spinning like he usually does, misrepresenting Labor\u2019s position and really dancing the dance of distress because he knows that with the support of the BCA, the farmers\u2019 federation, Meat and Livestock Australia, premier Berejiklian and other state premiers and territory leaders, Santos, BHP, they have a job ahead of them now that we\u2019ve embraced such a sensible policy proposal to give the majority of Australians what they are looking for, and that is meaningful action on climate change. Joel Fitzgibbon on why he doesn\u2019t think coal jobs will be impacted by Labor\u2019s 2050 policy: What we are striving to do is meet the commitment made in Paris by Malcolm Turnbull and the commitment requires us to take account of the emissions here in Australia, not the emissions emitted by other countries when, for example, they buy our coal ... There is no need to do any harm to the coalmining industry and we will not do any harm, exporting our coal to markets in Asia, earning foreign exchange, the foreign exchange which enables us to pay for the imports and cars. Joel Fitzgibbon just had a chat to Patricia Karvelas about the problems he has with a 2030 target for Labor: The problem with the 2030 target is that we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to inherit from Scott Morrison. He says he has this aspirational goal target to get to 26-28% by 2030 and it\u2019s very clear that is not going to come anywhere near close to meeting the target. He wants to cheat by fiddling the books and using Kyoto credits. They don\u2019t count and should not count. Let\u2019s see where Scott Morrison is and we are two years from the election. We\u2019ve made the commitment on zero net emissions and we\u2019ve got plenty of time now to consult. Question time, as seen by Mike Bowers: Right, here is what the National Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s position on carbon neutrality is: The current NFF climate policy does not include a reference to net zero emissions by 2050. We have committed in the roadmap for a $100bn industry by 2030 that we want to be on a trajectory to carbon neutrality by 2030, and to do so want to work with the major commodities to develop sector plans by 2025. Given our commitment to growth towards a $100bn sector, that has been signed on to by both major political parties, the industry would have real difficulty in supporting any target/proposal that would put the competitiveness or ongoing growth of major agricultural sectors at risk. This is a complex issue for agriculture and we continue to seek sufficient detail on any commitments, including net zero by 2050, to inform the best policy outcome for the sector. Before question time, the government\u2019s bill for an amnesty for employers who failed to pay superannuation passed the Senate, despite Labor\u2019s attempt to amend it to include an enforceable right for unions and workers to pursue unpaid super in the Fair Work Commission. Rex Patrick told the Senate Centre Alliance he decided to support the bill after the assistant minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, made a commitment to consider Labor\u2019s amendment separately. Hume confirmed the government would \u201cconsider the options outlined in Labor\u2019s amendment\u201d in the next six months, because it believed it needed \u201cconsiderable time and scrutiny\u201d before the plan could be approved. Hume said in a statement: This policy is all about reuniting hardworking Australians with their super. We anticipate at least $160m of super will be paid to Australian workers who would otherwise miss out. Since the one-off amnesty was originally announced back in 2018, over 7,000 employers have already come forward to voluntarily disclose historical unpaid super. We estimate an additional 7,000 employers will come forward in the next six months before the amnesty ends. Employers will not be off the hook. To use the amnesty, they must still pay all that is owing to their employees, including the high rate of interest. However, the amnesty will make it easier for workers to secure the super they are owed by not hitting employers with the penalties usually associated with late payment. Labor believes that the amount the government is claiming will be paid back pales in comparison to the $5.9bn a year that Industry Super Australia has estimated is ripped off by employers from workers. The good news is this problem should be a thing of the past because Australian Tax Office oversight is much improved, with single touch payroll giving them real-time information when employers fail to pay super. The last moment the House actually achieved anything: Scott Morrison keeps question time going for one last lickspittle on just how incredible the government\u2019s climate policy is, and he responds with just how terrible Labor is. Question time ends. Christian Porter announces changes to a bunch of committees, removing Llew O\u2019Brien from their membership. Nick Champion to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister: can he confirm 42% of the urban congestion fund for South Australia is allocated to the marginal state of Boothby? Is there no traffic congestion on the seats of Hindmarsh, Spence and Kingston? Morrison: I refer the member to my early response when I listed quite a lot of South Australian seats which have benefited from the investment of this government, but I have to say the member for Boothby does a fantastic job. You can find no better advocate for dealing with the issues and challenges in Boothby than the member for Boothby, that is why the member for Boothby was re-elected, because she understands what\u2019s going on in her community and she fights for her community. And she has the ear of the government, who can deliver for the people ... that\u2019s why the people of Boothby made the right decision to re-elect the member for Boothby, and all the other members, Mr Speaker, who sat on this side of the House, because they know when the government makes a promise to Australians, we keep it, and that is what our government is doing. The member for Boothby, Nicolle Flint, nods along with this assessment. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation assures me it will be sending through a statement on what its carbon neutrality position actually is. Question time is still going for some reason. There has been way, way too much Michael McCormack for anyone\u2019s liking. Including his own side of the chamber, if their faces are any indication. He\u2019s back again. I read in one of Sharri Markson\u2019s columns that he doesn\u2019t believe he deserves to be called boring because he brings the house down when he does speeches, and dresses as Elvis. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve given a speech in the last couple of years where I haven\u2019t had the crowds roaring with laughter. Ring Paul Nicolau or James Pearson from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and they will tell you I\u2019m certainly not boring, and as an after-dinner speaker I\u2019m the funniest they\u2019ve had. Journalists who just sit behind their computers or television studios who don\u2019t know me from a bar of soap pile on and it\u2019s just not true. I\u2019m quite a gregarious person who likes self-deprecating humour. If you can\u2019t laugh at yourself there\u2019s something wrong and I\u2019m more than happy to do that. I think anybody who goes out in his electorate and dresses up as Elvis to help tourism for one of the towns or dresses up as ABBA, I don\u2019t think you can accuse them of being boring. I even sang Suspicious Minds in front of 11,000 people. Wow. I take it all back. He can make people who buy tickets to see him and want to court his influence laugh, and dresses up as Elvis. What. A. Great. Leader. John Anderson wasn\u2019t showy. Tim Fischer wasn\u2019t either. Warren Truss was also pretty solid and staid. You know what they did, though? They did their job. They represented their constituents. Spot the difference? Stop with the ridiculous slogans and culture wars, the pitting of city and country voters against each other, the bullshit about looking steers in the eyes, and country people never telling lies and just be better. Oh god. Now Labor is summoning Michael McCormack: Why did 94% of the central coast package from the urban congestion fund go to one seat, the marginal Liberal seat of Robertson? Is traffic congestion in the rest of the central coast not a problem? McCormack: Here by popular demand, obviously, from those opposite. The urban congestion fund ... I\u2019ll speak slowly so they\u2019ll understand it ... The urban congestion fund is busting congestio,n ensuring vital roadworks are being filled. This is bringing together 266 crucial projects, 70 will start construction this year, all are under way with geo-technical investigations, and other work under way on many more. We took these projects to the Australian people on May 18, remember that date? And, guess what, we got elected, in the same way that Labor, to our understanding, I\u2019m not quite sure of all the policies and promises, 66 election commitments and small-scale urban projects, 100%, that means every single one of them in Labor or target seats. He keeps going, but I just hear Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream. Tony Burke is not playing with his point of orders after Catherine King was kicked out, and he brings up that McCormack has not raised anything to do with the central coast. Then Anthony Albanese pops up to say these weren\u2019t election commitments, they were in the budget. McCormack has another go at speaking: These are decisions of governments, not competitive grants; we took into account other spending from the infrastructure program, thanks to the Liberal and Nationals\u2019 government, the fact we get our books balanced, unlike those opposite, when was the last time there was a surplus, 1989 ... We take into account demand and population growth. The central coast is a growing population, and this is important, is not a joke, it\u2019s the truth \u2013 nearly all railroad projects are decisions of government under Coalition and Labor governments. How do you stop livestock from passing wind? The CSIRO is working on that. These are the same people who helped give us Twisties (among, you know, some other pretty important things) so I think they know what they are doing. I am now rocking under my desk, so to discover just how awe-smackingly stupid this latest \u201cdebate\u201d is, read this. Catherine King is booted from question time for making a \u201cpolitical point during a point of order\u201d. Greens senator Larissa Waters has asked the minister for women, Marise Payne, about Pauline Hanson\u2019s comments on domestic violence that \u201cthese things happen\u201d in relation to the murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children by her former partner. Payne replied: We have to speak right, report more accurately and empathetically about domestic violence ... [and] think more carefully about our expectations of healthy, respectful relationships ... Language does matter. We cannot tolerate public language that trivialises or distorts domestic violence. Each act of domestic violence is an individual atrocity. Payne avoided Waters\u2019 question about whether the government would seek to remove Hanson as deputy chair of the family law inquiry. Asked about funding for domestic violence services, Payne had a shot at the Greens by noting that the Coalition and Labor \u201cwill not be politicising the events of last week\u201d, then spruiked the benefits of the $340m fourth action plan on domestic violence. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: So far in this parliament the prime minister has used his numbers to shut down debate with me on 42 occasions. If the prime minister is so confident of his position, will he agree to a climate change debate at the National Press Club before the climate change conference in Glasgow this year? Morrison: It\u2019s all about you, Albo, isn\u2019t it? When we come in here and all the leader of the opposition can complain about is that he can\u2019t get his 15 minutes of fame \u2013 what an indulgent leader of theopposition. I tell you what, if you want to sit in this chair, you\u2019ve got to put the Australian people first, not yourself first, and worry about how much airtime you are getting. The problem with the leader of the opposition is he is so focused on the bubble politics of Canberra and all of this, he even forgets his own record. This is how many closures he moved when sitting on the government\u2019s side: 44 in 2008, 33 in 2009, 18 in 2010, 11 \u2013 they didn\u2019t even have the numbers then \u2013 33 in 2012, 13 in 2016. That\u2019s 152, Mr Speaker. There will be debates before the next election, and if you can last long enough to see me there, I\u2019ll see you there. Just for the record, here is what Morrison said when he returned from Hawaii during the bushfire crisis: I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. Oops, spoke too soon. David Littleproud: The Federal Government has put it around our farmers and that with the infrastructure, roads, rail, airports to make sure that our produce gets to these supermarkets as quickly as it possibly can to ensure that our Australian consumers get that produce as quickly as possible, but there is a real threat to that and that came only on the weekend with a reckless policy of zero emissions because it\u2019s not just farmers going up, they put a gun to the Australian agricultural sector\u2019s head and said we believe in supporting you but we\u2019re going to take you out but now they are going, now they are going after a checkout tax because every consumer will pay for this, not just at the farm gate, they will also pay for it at.... He\u2019s told to pull his head in when it comes to his analogies. And rightly so. Ugh. David Littleproud has settled on yelling at people as a political persona, but at least his sentences make some sort of sense. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: Why is the government\u2019s climate change policy still being driven by extreme climate sceptics, where net zero emissions by 2050 is supported by 73 countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany, every state and territory in Australia, the Business Council, our largest airline and bank and mining company and telecommunications company? Morrison: More slogans, but no answer. The new favourite: The bill you couldn\u2019t afford at the last election, Mr Speaker, is repeated by this Labor policy. It\u2019s a reheat of the bill they couldn\u2019t afford before and they still can\u2019t afford it. What\u2019s that? Oh, I think it\u2019s the ghost of Tony Abbott. Michael McCormack is now watching David Littleproud do his job. Angus Taylor answers a lickspittle on how amazing the government is on climate, because it is not worried at all, nope, no need to talk about this, because it is totally across it all. He is called back by Jim Chalmers with this question: I refer to the prime minister\u2019s earlier failure to answer the question. Has the government modelled the economic impact of failing to make its Paris agreement commitment of net zero emissions by 2050? Taylor: That is not what is in the Paris agreement. Article 4.1 is clear it\u2019s about global agreement to reach net zero in the second half of the century \u2013 and our commitment, the commitment that is more pressing and that we are focused on achieving, our 2030 target, is a 26 per cent reduction, Mr Speaker. We have a strong plan and an enviable track record and that enviable track record does not involve imposing a carbon tax. It\u2019s about technology, not taxes. It\u2019s not just me. Joel Fitzgibbon to Michael McCormack (yet another of his sins): Is the government aware that both the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and Meat and Livestock Australia have plans for their sectors to be carbon neutral by 2030? Only McCormack can make this three minutes stretch to four years. The election has come and gone. No one noticed because the climate wars have become so serious, Australian society is now divided by tribes, only recognisable by the shibboleth of how they pronounce \u201cideological\u201d. Oh \u2013 McCormack didn\u2019t answer the question, because he is seemingly incapable of answering anything, unless it includes some made-up country homily that played well in front of his shaving mirror. Accidentally letting out his secrets on how he makes policy decisions, Michael McCormack advises Labor to \u201clook a steer in the eye\u201d and ask it how it will stop its methane. I tell you what, methane emissions could drop right now if the deputy prime minister shut his mouth. For the record, the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and Meat and Livestock Australia are both aiming for carbon neutrality by 2030. Michael McCormack has been summoned. It\u2019s something that happens when you place white bread in a toaster and hit the lever three times. Zali Steggall asks Scott Morrison about the cost of climate inaction. She receives a bunch of slogans for her troubles. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister agree with the liberal premier of New South Wales that her government\u2019s target of net zero emissions by 2050 is consistent with both the Paris agreement and the federal government\u2019s own commitment to the Paris agreement? Morrison: I refer the member to the answer by the minister for energy and emissions reduction which spells out clearly what the government has signed up to in terms of the Paris agreement, and I must say about the Paris agreement our commitment is a 26 per cent reduction in emissions over 2005, and I\u2019m pleased to tell the House that is ... now down by 13.1%, which means we are halfway there, and we have a plan to meet the 2030 commitment. The only problem is when I look at what those opposite are talking about, they have no idea what they want to commit to for 2030. They say: I don\u2019t know if I will tell you before the election or not. They want to talk about 30 years from now and can\u2019t even agree on what they want in 10 years. It continues in this vein. Another \u201chow amazing are we when it comes to climate\u201d dixer (so far, it has been Jason Falinski and Dave Sharma asking the questions \u2013 two of the self-declared \u201cmodern Liberals\u201d \u2013 so you know the government is *serious* about this, because here are two people who can say the words \u201cclimate change action\u201d without choking). Anthony Albanese to Angus Taylor: Isn\u2019t it the case cabinet committed to net zero emissions by 2050 when it signed up to the Paris agreement? Taylor: Mr Speaker, thank you. That\u2019s incorrect. We signed up to the Paris agreement ... which involves the world achieving net zero in the second half of the next century. That was our commitment, and of course we have strong targets, a clear plan and an enviable track record, as we\u2019ve just heard from the prime minister. Taylor to Sky News this morning: Well, there is that targeting built into the Paris agreement, where the world has agreed to get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century. That\u2019s already there. We\u2019ve got to do our bit. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be focusing on technology. The first dixer is on how amazing the government\u2019s climate policy is. SO, SO amazing. It\u2019s basically as if Blue Ivy grew up to take her rightful place as the ruler of us all, it is that amazing and special. And it\u2019s all been achieved without a carbon price, says Scott Morrison. Except ... it counts emissions reductions from when Labor was in power and had a carbon price, so that\u2019s not entirely right. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm he suggested to the New South Wales premier that the scope of the bushfire recovery cleanup funding proposal by NSW was not consistent with the black Saturday framework, in a bid to reduce the costs to the federal government? Morrison: As I confirmed to the journalist who put the same matter to us on the weekend, the proposal I put to the NSW premier was the proposal that was adopted in the proposal that was announced, the proposal that was arranged between the treasurer and the treasurer of NSW and the head of the national bushfire recovery agency and their counterparts in NSW. What we proposed is what was announced. There is a moment of silence for Hannah Clarke and her family. Then the questions begin. Anthony Albanese: I do want to say that I think we need to repel some of the attacks as well. We need to speak up when people make the sort of comments, including in the aftermath of this tragedy, that were entirely inappropriate. The existence of a standalone, specialist family court is a Labor legacy that we will defend. Whatever problems there are with the family law system, the existence of a standalone, specialist family court is not one of them. It\u2019s a necessary part of the solution. The government and opposition can work on this. All of us as members of parliament have a role to play. The memory of Hannah Clarke and her three beautiful children must galvanise a soul in further action to galvanise against violence against women and children. We can\u2019t accept this is normal. We have it in us to be so much better. Lives depend on it, as we see all too often. No one is saying Baxter represents all men. That Pauline Hanson pulls out that card, at this time, is abhorrent. Pauline Hanson\u2019s statement in the Senate is long on condemnation on Rowan Baxter but its ultimate conclusion was simply this: not all men. Hanson described the murders as the \u201cultimate act of betrayal\u201d and a \u201ccalculated, cowardly and evil act\u201d. The incident has \u201cfurther added fuel to an already twisted and difficult family law debate\u201d, she said, adding that \u201cmany decent men are deprived of their parental rights\u201d. She concluded: I am so angry at the selfish motivation [Rowan Baxter] has shown. Please do not let this bastard\u2019s actions reflect on all men. In the Senate, the MPs are also taking time to honour Hannah Clarke and her children. Anthony Albanese: Yet again a woman has lost her life to a former male partner. Yet again children have been robbed of their futures by a father who betrayed what should have been the most powerful bond of all \u2013 between a parent and their child. We cannot let their shocking and horrific deaths be the whole story. We must hold on to their names, hold on to the image of those four faces, so happy because they were with each other. The courage that Hannah showed, as the prime minister said, she left. That takes courage. She took her kids to what she thought was safety, only to find that that wasn\u2019t the case. That a man who had a record \u2013 a record \u2013 of crime, because it is a crime, against his own family conducted the ultimate crime, and in a manner which quite frankly is just beyond comprehension, really. It is just difficult to understand how that could possibly occur. Scott Morrison: There are never any excuses, there are none, or justifications for the evil that Hannah and her children experienced \u2013 never, not under any circumstances. With the states and territories and together as a parliament we will continue to work together to translate these words \u2013 that I\u2019m sure the leader of the opposition will also state with the same passion \u2013 into actions and changes that make a real difference for women and children ... Let me read one of Hannah\u2019s last Instagram posts. It expressed the hope. She wrote: \u201cI am a strong woman\u201d \u2013 no doubt she was \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t sit around feeling sorry for myself, nor will I let anyone mistreat me again. I am a survivor, not a victim. I am in control of my life, and there is nothing I can\u2019t achieve. My girls will grow up being strong women who understand their worth.\u201d This hope was crushed when Hannah and her children were murdered. We must work together, as we have been, for as long as it takes to restore that hope to those we know right now, today in this country, who are living in exactly the same danger as Hannah and her children. Scott Morrison: Murder \u2013 that\u2019s what it is. Murder. Again last Thursday it shocked our country. When Jenny and I spoke about it, we just couldn\u2019t get our heads around it, as I\u2019m sure is the case for every single parent, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a parent or not \u2013 you can\u2019t imagine it. It is just too horrible to contemplate \u2013 the act itself and that somebody could perpetrate that act, particularly as a father. It is incomprehensible. And such depravity, that only makes you ask: how does such evil happen in our land? To the Clarke family, all of us here extend our sympathies and our love, but I must wonder if that could ever be enough to cover the profound grief. They have shown incredible resilience and character in the worst of all possible circumstances. As best we can, we also send the country\u2019s love to you. In your grief you have every right to be angry \u2013 furious \u2013 because everything we have done across this country to protect women and children didn\u2019t protect Hannah and her children from this evil. I believe state, territory and national governments, all of us, and importantly the judiciary, must all reflect again on these terrible murders. We must reflect on how and where the system failed Hannah and her children, as it has failed so many others. It is so frustrating. It is so devastating. While this was the action of the depraved and evil man, we know enough of the circumstances leading up to the murders to know this should not have happened, and there will rightly be an inquest in Queensland \u2013 and I commend the Queensland government for taking that action as they should. It will speak the truth, I have no doubt, as so many others have spoken the truth. And we already know this: Hannah deserved to feel safe and be safe, and to watch her joyous and wonderful children grow up. It starts with statements of indulgence about what happened to Hannah Clarke and her three children. And the murders Australia just can\u2019t seem to come to terms with. He\u2019s also not a fan of freedom of information requests. Centre Alliance wants an inquiry into domestic and family violence: Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick today announced that he will seek to establish an urgent Senate inquiry to pressure all levels of Australian government to take further action and commit greater resources to prevent violence against women and their children. \u201cThe shocking murder last week of Hannah Clarke and her three children is the latest tragedy in an all-too-repeated horror across our nation,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cAs a father of two daughters, my heartfelt desire is that they are able to contribute and thrive in a society that values their opinion and provides them the opportunity to live free from harm and fear. I want my daughters, and all our daughters, and Australian women, to always be safe in their homes and as they go about their lives.\u201d Queensland did this in 2015. The time for inquiries is probably done. The time for action is well past. One thing we could stop doing, though, is allowing Pauline Hanson and her ilk to lead the conversation. Hannah and all the women who came before her \u2013 and the ones who are being failed as we speak \u2013 deserve so much more than what we\u2019ve done. It was inevitable the \u201cdebate\u201d would end up here. Everything is great. From Adam Morton: Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have dipped slightly on the back of new clean energy and a sharp fall from agriculture due to the drought, but the decline was almost entirely wiped out by surging industrial pollution. Official data released on Monday revealed national emissions were down 0.3% in the year to September. Emissions from electricity generation fell 2% (3.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide) as the now-filled renewable energy target boosted invested in solar and wind power. Pollution from agriculture fell even further \u2013 4.1m tonnes, or 5.8% \u2013 due to the impact on livestock of the historic eastern seaboard drought and north Queensland floods. But fugitive emissions, released during coal and gas extraction, were estimated to have jumped 6% (3.3m tonnes). Pollution from stationary energy \u2013 which includes the manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors \u2013 was up 2.6% (2.6m tonnes). Greg Hunt has given a short update on the coronavirus (Covid-19) situation: All of those passengers have left the Howard Springs temporary quarantine facility and, as a consequence of that, they are now free to go about day-to-day activities. No passengers in that group were diagnosed or confirmed with coronavirus. So I think that is a very, very important operation which has shown the importance of quarantine, and the results of the seven passengers \u2013 who came from the Diamond Princess \u2013 reaffirm absolutely not just the reason why we sought to airlift them back to Australia, but the reason why on medical advice we imposed a supervised quarantine arrangement, and I think that was strong but very clear medical advice. He has to leave because the division bells are ringing in the House. It is the downhill run to question time. There is not a lot happening in the chambers at the moment. That just gives more time for the stupid to spill into the hallways After a letter from Anthony Albanese (which we are told was hand-delivered), speaker Tony Smith has agreed to allow the House to stand in a moment of silence for Hannah Clarke and her children, Laianah, 4, Aaliyah, 6, and Trey, 3. And then every single MP needs to get very, very loud indeed about domestic and family violence \u2013 and those who attempt to excuse it with the abhorrent and deliberately outrageous \u201cdriven to it\u201d lie. Pauline Hanson was just on her feet in the Senate, arguing against Larissa Waters\u2019 bill to close the Galilee basin, because it\u2019s Australia and a day ending in y. She doesn\u2019t think we have had an \u201cactual debate on hearing from the scientists about what global warming is about\u201d. Which I take to mean she either wants us to: a) debate on whether we should hear from scientists on climate change or b) listen to the scientists\u2019 debate about what global warming is about. Hanson is paid $211,250 as a base salary for these gems. She also gets $44,100 in super contributions a year and $32,000 in electorate allowance. Plus a car. As a base. She did manage one truth bomb, though, as she spoke about climate policy: That\u2019s the problem within Australia, that we have listened to the fear mongers. The poster child for Australian Rhodes scholars. Pauline Hanson is helping to lead the latest family law court inquiry, which was set up by the government as a salve for her, despite the government having multiple reports into how the family court system could be improved \u2013 the most latest recommendations of which have not been implemented. She also gets paid more to be the deputy chair of that committee, and gets to comment on family court issues, because the government gave her that legitimacy with the inquiry. Great work by all involved, really. Just brilliant. I don\u2019t have enough evens to can\u2019t today. I just don\u2019t. Go back to bed, everyone. Wake me up when the apocalypse is half done. Larissa Waters introduced a bill in the Senate to keep the Galilee basin closed to coal mining, saying: The Galilee basin is a carbon bomb and in reality the science demands we don\u2019t open up a single new coal mine. We need to keep that Galilee coal in the ground and today I have a bill that will do just that. If the Galilee basin were to be mined and it was a country, it would be the seventh-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Australia\u2019s emissions continue to rise and millions of hectares of the country were burnt over summer due to climate-fuelled bushfires. We desperately need a climate plan and that climate plan means getting out of thermal coal. The numbers are not there for it to pass the Senate \u2013 and there is zero chance of it passing the House. Just a reminder that Pauline Hanson is paid to say things like this on the Nine Network\u2019s Today show: Let\u2019s just make it quite clear: I made a very strong comment on my Facebook page. It was a horrendous act, what he did to his children. It was a tragedy and I feel very deeply sorry for everyone, family and friends involved in this treacherous \u2013 what he did to his former wife and his children. But Bettina Arndt should not be stripped of her Order of Australia. She is clearly stating what she thinks and what a police officer said. This is why I have pushed for the family law inquiry to get behind what is happening on this. You know, this has been for a week we have been in the news nearly every day about this horrific tragedy. But we don\u2019t hear much about it when a woman has murdered her children by driving a car into a tree \u2013 she threw out a suicide note. Or the woman who doused her husband with fuel and set him alight and said she was possibly driven to it. A lot of people are driven to this, to do these acts for one reason or another. Hopefully the family law inquiry will get to the bottom of it. But don\u2019t bastardise all men out there, or women for that matter, because these things happen. Let\u2019s get to the bottom of it, why it is happening, and hopefully find the answers so it never happens again. Don\u2019t just take my word for it \u2013 the Today show also highlighted it in a tweet: AAP has looked at Barnaby Joyce\u2019s latest brain spurt, so we don\u2019t have to: Barnaby Joyce is sick of most senators being from capital cities and has a plan to change that. The Nationals backbencher has introduced a private member\u2019s bill to parliament which would split each state into six regions \u2013 like mega-electorates \u2013 that each vote for two senators. \u201cThis is something that is so important,\u201d he told the lower house on Monday. \u201cWe need for our Senate to have a constituency and to have the capacity to represent a geographic area.\u201d Joyce said that in most instances, 11-out-of-12 senators came from capital cities. He also pointed out that New York had two senators, while Adelaide had 11. \u201cWe need to make sure that as the seats get bigger and bigger and bigger in the House of Representatives in regional areas, that this is offset by the capacity to get more Senate representation.\u201d Under the plan \u2013 which was seconded by independent MP Bob Katter \u2013 no region could be bigger than 30 per cent of the state\u2019s landmass and the capital city would be confined to a single region. Joyce said this would also help to improve indigenous representation in parliament. The backbencher, who recently launched a failed bid to reclaim the Nationals leadership, said the proposal would not warrant a change to the Constitution. It was up to the parliament to change how senators were elected. Senate president Scott Ryan was quick to shoot down Mr Joyce\u2019s idea after he floated it last year. \u201cThe current Senate is actually very reflective of the national vote despite the differences in state populations,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut this proposal would destroy that.\u201d Father Frank Brennan, one of the Ruddock review panel members who conducted the inquiry on religious freedom, has had some interesting thoughts on the government\u2019s religious discrimination bill and the way the debate has gone. Brennan told the Australian Catholic University on Thursday: \u201cThe Morrison government has decided not to pursue the Ruddock recommendation of a clean, lean religious discrimination act. Rather, in response to those who have long advocated a religious freedom act, the Morrison government is attempting to formulate what we might call a Religious Discrimination PLUS Bill which will include some bells and whistles you would not expect to find in a standard piece of anti-discrimination legislation.\u201d Brennan agreed with the Australian Human Rights Commission that legislating for individual cases - such as Israel Folau and Archbishop Porteous- \u201cis not good legislative practice\u201d and said that he is \u201cnot convinced\u201d that the commonwealth overriding Victorian rules requiring doctors to refer patients for abortions is the best way to go. Brennan predicted the bill will not pass, and hopes the states will fix issues with their laws without commonwealth intervention: \u201cI think there is little prospect of any Religious Discrimination PLUS Bill passing the Senate. When such a bill is ultimately rejected by the Senate, I do hope that our federal politicians will have the good sense to legislate a neat and clean Religious Discrimination Act, and our politicians in the NSW and South Australian parliaments will have the good sense to bring their legislation up to an appropriate standard honouring our commitments and undertakings under the ICCPR.\u201d Brennan noted that the Coalition and Labor had agreed that schools should not be able to discriminate against students on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, but said he \u201c[despaired] at our parliament\u2019s protracted delay and incapacity to deliver on this commitment\u201d. A friend of the blog has also pointed me in the direction of this handy website, which, with the help of Monash university resources, is helping to track those looking at net zero emissions by 2050 I have just been reminded by a reader of the Montreal protocol, which was signed in the late 1980s and was designed to phase out the chemicals that were harming the ozone layer. It\u2019s working. Practically the whole world signed up. And guess what? The world hasn\u2019t ended. The science outlining what was happening to the ozone layer was published in 1973. Less than 15 years later, an international agreement was created and signed. Imagine having that \u201cdebate\u201d now. At the same time: Just some of those driving the energy policy in this country at the moment, being completely normal humans. One of the reasons Barnaby Joyce wants this bill is because he believes the regions don\u2019t receive good enough representation. The same regions which are represented by his party. At the UN conference of parties (Cop), Chile\u2019s environment minister Carolina Schmidt laid out the alliance of \u201csilly\u201d countries, cities, businesses and investors who have signed up to \u201cfollow the recommendations of science as regards climate change\u201d (as in, working towards net-zero emissions by 2050). There are 73 parties to the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), 14 regions, 398 cities, 786 businesses and 16 investors. So. Far. For the record, the list of countries who have committed to a \u201csilly\u201d zero net emissions target by 2050, include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Beliz, Benin, Cape Verde, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Comoros, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Ethiopia, European Union, Federated Stated of Micronesia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Grenada, Guyana, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Kiribat, Lao PDR, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Maldives, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Namibia, Nauru Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niue, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Portugal, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Spain, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu. It\u2019s silly to have a target without a plan. But apparently you can have a \u201cstrategy\u201d without a target. Or a plan. This is the level of stupid we have reached today. Compounding that stupid, is the fact we have signed up to the Paris agreement. We keep hearing about how we are meeting our obligations. A big part of the Paris agreement is to work out how to become carbon neutral by the second half of the century. Which is just another way of saying \u2013 ZERO NET EMISSIONS BY 2050. And what did Angus Taylor say this morning, in between talking about how silly Labor\u2019s \u201cuncocked\u201d policy was? Well, there is that targeting built into the Paris agreement where the world has agreed to get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century. That\u2019s already there. We\u2019ve got to do our bit. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be focusing on technology. I swear I have become dumber today just following this \u201cdebate\u201d. I have actually lost brain cells. We are literally at \u201cYOUR FACE IS\u201d phase of this debate. *packs bags, moves to Mars* The bells are ringing, and with it, my ears. In the midst of all of this, the government is looking at expanding the powers of the Australian Signals Directorate \u2013 a story first broken by Annika Smethurst in 2018 \u2013 who not only got a bunch of quite personal denials for her trouble, but now lives with the threat of prosecution over her head, after the AFP raided her home and office. The government wants ASD to be able to spy on Australians, suspected of serious crimes, within Australia. Currently, it can only focus on overseas servers. The moment an investigation reaches Australian shores, it has to stop. The ABC reported last week the government was advancing the proposal, although it is yet to confirm it. The argument is that Australia\u2019s crime-fighting and intelligence agencies should have the powers they need to follow investigations into child abuse and terrorism in Australia. No one debates that. The problem is, this government has a habit of expanding national security powers without actually laying out how broad those powers are. Everyone wants paedophiles and terrorists stopped. But suddenly, it becomes anyone suspected of a crime that brings more than two to three years imprisonment, if convicted. And then a whole heap of other people are having their personal affairs opened up to spy agencies. You don\u2019t have to be convicted. Just suspected. This government has not been shy with the national security brush. There have been 19 tranches of national security legislation since the government came into power. Do you know what they all do? Chances are, you don\u2019t. From AAP: Opposition frontbencher Jenny McAllister is introducing legislation to enhance oversight of the increasingly powerful agencies, as recommended by a Coalition government review three years ago. \u201cUnfortunately, like its approach on so many matters of accountability, the Morrison government has dragged the chain on implementing important recommendations from its own review,\u201d she said on Monday. \u201cStrong and effective oversight mechanisms do not stand in opposition to our national security arrangements \u2013 they are best understood as an essential part of them.\u201d Liberal senator Sarah Henderson has said she believes She Who Should Never Be Named Because She Feeds Off The Outrage should have her Order of Australia award revoked, given her comments following the Camp Hill tragedy. Samantha Maiden at the New Daily reported the governor general has received complaints about the award, which have been forwarded to the council, with the honour now up for review. No one knows who nominated her. Or who supported that nomination. And yet, here we are. The not-actually-a-psychologist has made some pretty abhorrent comments before this. We all know them. And she was still given the honour. It seems almost anything is forgivable in this country, if you claim your right to free speech is under attack. Unless of course, you are standing up for a minority, pointing out an inconvenient truth or trying to point out the facts about climate change. The government\u2019s big argument against Labor\u2019s zero emissions by 2050 policy, which is something that every single state and territory has taken up, including Liberal governments, and is something the resources industry and farmers are in support of, is that New Zealand has quarantined its agriculture industry from its target. So suddenly, after years and years of rhetoric over how we don\u2019t need to look to other countries for our policies, including New Zealand, in the wake of its (repeated) offer to take additional refugees from Nauru, New Zealand is the gold standard of policy. Parliament starts at 10am. Tellingly, Joel Fitzgibbon is on board with Labor\u2019s plan. Here he is writing for his local paper, the Newcastle Herald over the weekend: The aspiration of carbon neutrality by 2050 (zero net emissions) offers a conservative and low-risk path to satisfying the commitment Malcolm Turnbull made in Paris on our behalf back in 2015. First, it provides plenty of time to think and act, including the time needed to embrace existing and future technologies. Second, it stands a chance of securing bipartisanship and therefore, broader community support. Third, it turns the focus to efforts to absorb carbon from the atmosphere and away from an almost singular focus on reducing emissions. In other words, building on existing methods for drawing carbon from the atmosphere and finding innovative new ways of doing so. This is what \u201cnet\u201d means: working towards a time when we are putting no more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than we are taking out. For a reminder on what Labor\u2019s policy is, here is where Katharine Murphy broke the story on Thursday: Labor has locked in behind a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and will oppose taxpayer funding of new coal-fired power plants, in the party\u2019s first major decisions about climate policy for the next federal election. As well as adopting the clear 2050 target that Scott Morrison appears reluctant to sign up to, in part because of rolling combat within the Coalition, Guardian Australia understands shadow cabinet has also decided to oppose using carryover credits from the Kyoto period to meet future emissions reduction targets. The Morrison government plans to use carryover credits to meet about half of Australia\u2019s 2030 emissions reduction target, and departmental officials have confirmed they are not aware of any countries other than Australia planning to use controversial accounting methods to meet international climate commitments. No target without a plan, says Angus Taylor, which you would think is actually part of the government\u2019s job \u2013 developing plans. Given it is actually in government. \u201cWhat we\u2019re not open to, is a target, any target, which has got no plan, is uncocked and unfunded,\u201d he says. Why would anyone invest if they don\u2019t know what the target is, Sky News asks Taylor. People invest in all sorts of industries without government targets, I mean there are a lot of frustrated central planners out there. They want to target it in every industry, but the airline industry doesn\u2019t need one, farmers don\u2019t need one. Look, businesses set their own targets and get on with it. We do have a target for 2030 for emissions reduction. So does the government have a long-term strategy or a long-term target? Well, there is that targeting built into the Paris agreement where the world has agreed to get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century. That\u2019s already there. We\u2019ve got to do our bit. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be focusing on technology. This debate is all happening while the market is actively moving away from thermal coal. BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest fund managers, if not the largest, is moving away from coal investments. India has announced it will phase out thermal coal import from the 2023-2024. The change is coming no matter how much Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack and Angus Taylor shake their fists at clouds. The bigger question is whether Australia\u2019s workforce is being prepared for the inevitable market change. Based on history, it doesn\u2019t look like it. Is there a single voter who finds any of this productive? Who wants this? Who thinks, yes, that is what I want in my politicians? \u201cIdeological path.\u201d As expected, the government has lost its mind over Labor\u2019s zero emissions by 2050 policy, despite major private interests, including BHP, the Business Council of Australia, as well as the UK conservatives, and practically every single state and territory in Australia already on board. Angus Taylor says we don\u2019t need targets. Except for the 2030 target. That\u2019s fine. But 2050 \u2013 pffft. What the government has is a long-term strategy. See the difference? People will just get on with it, he says. It has to be \u201ctechnology not taxes which lead the way\u201d, Taylor says. Labor has ruled out a carbon tax. Stunningly though, Taylor hasn\u2019t been the headline act today, because Barnaby Joyce is feelingly stunningly unleashed, and decided to bring his particular brand of discourse \u2013 yelling over people in hallways \u2013 to a press conference with Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon. Here\u2019s a taster from the Barnaby Joyce school of debate: What a load of rubbish. What a load of pig manure. He\u2019s going to reach out to you. He\u2019s going to reach out to the coalmines. Don\u2019t worry, fellas, we\u2019re reaching out to you. We\u2019re reaching out and saying you\u2019re going to lose your job. Reaching out, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to do it. You\u2019re going to make the equation work by putting trees back on people\u2019s properties whether they like it or not. We\u2019re going to let the shrubs grow back on the country. It\u2019s not just mercury which is in retrograde \u2013 Australia\u2019s political discourse is so backwards on this topic, it\u2019s like watching your neighbours take up the wheel and pretending you\u2019re fine just pushing your rocks around with your back. Oh, and emissions in Australia dropped by just 0.3% in the year to September last year. NAILING IT. We\u2019ll bring you all of the latest meltdowns, as well as everything else \u2013 hey, maybe we\u2019ll get some legislation to talk about this fortnight \u2013 with Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin at your service.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Stocks fall sharply after Xi warning on economy</h2> \n<p>Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start the week.</p> \n<p>Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-china-wuhan-lockdown-economy-south-korea-npc-annual-parliament\">has eased the lockdown that has been in place since 23 January</a> by announcing that non-symptomatic people requiring medical operations will be allowed to leave the city. In another possible sign of improving conditions, Chinese media said that<strong> </strong>six cities in Hubei province, including Huanggang and Jingzhou, reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, while 24 out of 31 other Chinese provinces also recorded no rise. However, the situation appeared to be deteriorating in other parts of the world as South Korea reported another 161 cases overnight. Flights into the locked down city of Daegu have been suspended while Air New Zealand said it was putting its service to Seoul on hold.</p> \n<p>Stock markets, meanwhile, have taken a battering in the wake of Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s comments that the outbreak would have a \u201cbig impact\u201d on the country\u2019s economy. Shares in Seoul plunged more than 3% and heavy losses are expected when trading gets under way in Europe and the US later. The jittery mood was not helped after experts warned earlier that the tipping point where the world would not be able to stop a pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/world-is-approaching-coronavirus-tipping-point-experts-say\">was getting closer</a> because of the spread of the virus to the Middle East and Europe. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/turkey-and-pakistan-close-borders-with-iran-over-coronavirus-deaths\">Turkey and Pakistan have closed borders with Iran</a>, where eight people have died after contracting the virus. In Italy, authorities have imposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/italy-draconian-measures-effort-halt-coronavirus-outbreak-spread\">draconian measures</a> to try to contain the spread of the virus in 11 towns in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto as the country notched up its third fatality.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Patel denials \u2013 </strong>An informed security source has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/mi5-rejects-claims-withhold-intelligence-priti-patel\">denied reports </a>that intelligence chiefs have lost confidence in the home secretary, Priti Patel. The source said Sunday Times reports at the weekend were \u201csimply untrue\u201d and that she was getting the same information from the agency as any other home secretary. It comes in the wake of a series of stories claiming that Patel has had difficult relationships with officials during her ministerial career. Her allies believe she is being targeted because officials do not like being challenged.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Malaysia drama \u2013 </strong>Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/anwar-ibrahim-decries-traitors-amid-cracks-in-deal-to-make-him-malaysias-next-pm\">has resigned</a> on a day of political drama. Mahathir, who is 94, took office in May 2018 when he defeated Najib Razak. Would-be leader Anwar Ibrahim earlier accused Mahathir of plotting to bring down the ruling coalition.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Labour vote \u2013 </strong>As Labour party members begin receiving ballot papers for the leadership election today, the frontrunner, Sir Keir Starmer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/keir-starmer-commits-to-shadow-cabinet-posts-for-long-bailey-and-nandy\">has pledged to give leading shadow cabinet posts</a> to his rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Speaking at a hustings event in Durham, Starmer said they were both excellent candidates and suggested that all three represented the future of the party. \u201cWhichever one of us actually wins this, what you are seeing on display here is the leadership of the Labour party,\u201d he said. Most members will be able to vote via email, but paper ballots will be available as well. The vote closes on 2 April with the result to be announced two days later.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Bin death warning \u2013 </strong>At least seven people are known to have died in the last five years as a result of sleeping in bins and being crushed when the rubbish is emptied,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/deaths-homeless-people-sleeping-bins-calls-action-uk\"> the waste industry says</a>, as it highlights a deadly consequence of Britain\u2019s growing homelessness problem. Bosses also say there were 109 near misses between April and December last year as destitute people increasingly seek shelter in large, enclosed rubbish containers.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Diabetes risk \u2013</strong> A growing obesity crisis means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/type-2-diabetes-uk-obesity-crisis-nhs\">a record number of people are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes</a> and with it an increased chance of a heart attack or stroke. To tackle the problem, the NHS is going to make a radical new liquid diet available to patients which will put type 2 diabetes into remission. A pilot scheme will see 5,000 patients restricted to 800 calories per day for three months. They will then have another nine months of support to help them maintain weight loss.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99aaf9c56b40a068b0c49920291176d9460bd54e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99aaf9c56b40a068b0c49920291176d9460bd54e/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sandstorm from the Sahara hits Tenerife on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sandstorm from the Sahara hits Tenerife on Sunday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific Press/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Caught in a storm \u2013 </strong>Hundreds of British holidaymakers stranded in the Canary Islands after a sandstorm may be able to return home today after airports reopened.

When Javid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/02/immigrant-language-criteria-to-harden-after-brexit-says-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">was asked</a>, in 2018, if he was sad about supporting laws that would have barred his own father, he replied that he was \u201cvery optimistic about our future because \u2026 we will remain the global-outlook nation that welcomes people from across the world.\u201d Just not people like his father. Last week Priti Patel was a little more blunt when <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/priti-patel-immigration-laws-parents-home-office-brexit-a9343571.html\" title=\"\">she conceded</a> that her parents, Indians from east Africa, would no longer be welcome. \u201cThis is the point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are changing our immigration policy to one that\u2019s fit for purpose for our economy, based on skills.\u201d</p> <p>Skills. The country no longer needs her parents\u2019 skills. The founders and owners of a successful chain of newsagents across London and the south-east, it\u2019s not clear what dire economic need their admission to the UK would have fulfilled at the time. They simply came, did a job well, and bore children who became so well-integrated and influential that they used their power to change the very laws that allowed their own existence in the first place. (Javid and Patel should be grateful that the world doesn\u2019t work like the picture of Marty McFly\u2019s family in Back to the Future, or they would currently be fading from existence, having eliminated the conditions of their own birth.)</p> <p>But let us get back to skills and points. Their parents were not \u201cskilled\u201d and therefore would not have scored the requisite number of points needed under the new regime to gain entry into the country. But I am sure that neither Javid nor Patel has the desire or temperament to drive a bus or run a newsagents \u2013 or to do any of the other jobs they are consigning to the \u201cunskilled\u201d bin with these new rules.</p> <p>That is the purpose of this new skills apartheid: it creates an arbitrary way of sifting people into \u201cgood migrants\u201d and \u201cbad migrants\u201d, so that an overtly punitive regime can become even more cruel. There is no good economic justification for it, only a political one. Alighting on \u201cskills\u201d as the arbiter of who is worth admitting is a clever way to give a neutral technocratic veneer to what is fundamentally ideological.</p> <p>In this regard, it is consistent with Conservative attitudes toward class, work and race. Under the new immigration rules, there is no use for Javid senior \u2013 but his son, who made millions at Deutsche Bank, where <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sajid-javid-s-link-to-banking-crisis-makes-him-unfit-for-office-claims-labour-897fhdgw7\" title=\"\">he constructed</a> precarious collateralised loan obligations using emerging market government debt, is absolutely welcome.</p> <p>Before \u201cskills\u201d it was the designation \u201cEU\u201d and \u201cnon-EU\u201d that created the two-tier classification of immigrant. And, trust me, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/05/immigrant-home-office-british-citizenship-hostile-environment\" title=\"\">my non-EU immigrant experience</a> of the Home Office was not made easier by any skills, education or English language fluency. Now that EU citizens have been downgraded after Brexit, a new caste of immigrants must be demonised to shore up the image of a Britain that has taken back control. But the operating principles remain the same \u2013 an immigration system that is not based on economic or humanitarian logic, but on public posturing and pandering. Back when Brexiteers were scaremongering about \u201copen borders\u201d, the Home Office was already deporting the Windrush elderly, and it was already impossible to come to the UK from outside the EU to fill a desperate need for doctors in the NHS without an English exam, a job offer and the payment of an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application\" title=\"\">NHS surcharge</a> for the duration of the visa.</p> <p>But this was not enough. As the rules tighten once again, the policy seems to be moving on to something more sinister, more like a creeping amnesia. Javid and Patel\u2019s disavowal of their parents\u2019 generation is a de facto rewriting of history. It erases the contribution of Britain\u2019s multiracial postwar working class, who came from all corners of the empire to do social care, work in hospitals, staff factories and drive the buses \u2013 as if the millions of immigrants who did not speak English and did not have job offers, yet still found a way to launch their offspring into the cabinet, did not exist. They were a blip, an aberration, a servant class of immigrant \u2013 to be upgraded, just as Britain after Brexit is refashioned into a nation that takes only the very best. It is a remaking of Britain\u2019s image as a country that no longer needs help from poor immigrants, only adornment from rich ones.</p> <p>Even the self-interested middle class liberal defence of migration \u2013 the one that asks who will pick our fruit and care for our elderly if the drawbridge is raised \u2013 doesn\u2019t trouble this government. An immigrant\u2019s entry is no longer justified even by their utility.</p> <p>In any case, that defence was never a valid one. Those whose presence is no longer required had lives that were not justified by the brute terms of their \u201ccontribution\u201d, but by the very DNA of the country as it is today. They simply made, and are part of, Britain. Those who came here to drive buses and run newsagents did not exist in some alternate universe where these occupations required no skills, helped no one and made no imprint. They were not hermetically sealed away from Britain\u2019s culture. They are part of the story, but are now not even dignified with a postscript.</p> <p>We will come to rue this short memory. The new immigration rules will not only hurt the country economically \u2013 they give a glimpse into a new world that is taking shape, one where non-elite jobs are stripped of all honour, virtue and value. Where the government\u2019s disdain for the working class becomes apparent in its contempt for the kind of postcolonial labour that built and rebuilt this country, and its disinterest in the prospects of the \u201cindigenous\u201d workers who are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/19/immigration-firms-will-need-to-train-more-uk-workers-says-priti-patel\" title=\"\">expected to tool up</a> and fill the gap. Where the sons and daughters of those who would now score zero points on an immigration application enjoy a success that has many fathers, but not their own.</p> <p>Immigration is now so toxic, its suppression so central to the thriving of the Conservative party, that the contributions of \u201cthe wrong kind\u201d of immigrant \u2013 the kind that looks like Javid\u2019s father \u2013 must be minimised, along with the value of the sort of jobs they did. This is not an unforeseen and unintended consequence of the new immigration policy. As Patel says: it is the point.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist.

Under the new immigration rules, there is no use for Javid senior \u2013 but his son, who made millions at Deutsche Bank, where he constructed precarious collateralised loan obligations using emerging market government debt, is absolutely welcome. Before \u201cskills\u201d it was the designation \u201cEU\u201d and \u201cnon-EU\u201d that created the two-tier classification of immigrant. And, trust me, my non-EU immigrant experience of the Home Office was not made easier by any skills, education or English language fluency. Now that EU citizens have been downgraded after Brexit, a new caste of immigrants must be demonised to shore up the image of a Britain that has taken back control. But the operating principles remain the same \u2013 an immigration system that is not based on economic or humanitarian logic, but on public posturing and pandering. Back when Brexiteers were scaremongering about \u201copen borders\u201d, the Home Office was already deporting the Windrush elderly, and it was already impossible to come to the UK from outside the EU to fill a desperate need for doctors in the NHS without an English exam, a job offer and the payment of an NHS surcharge for the duration of the visa. But this was not enough. As the rules tighten once again, the policy seems to be moving on to something more sinister, more like a creeping amnesia. Javid and Patel\u2019s disavowal of their parents\u2019 generation is a de facto rewriting of history. It erases the contribution of Britain\u2019s multiracial postwar working class, who came from all corners of the empire to do social care, work in hospitals, staff factories and drive the buses \u2013 as if the millions of immigrants who did not speak English and did not have job offers, yet still found a way to launch their offspring into the cabinet, did not exist. They were a blip, an aberration, a servant class of immigrant \u2013 to be upgraded, just as Britain after Brexit is refashioned into a nation that takes only the very best. It is a remaking of Britain\u2019s image as a country that no longer needs help from poor immigrants, only adornment from rich ones. Even the self-interested middle class liberal defence of migration \u2013 the one that asks who will pick our fruit and care for our elderly if the drawbridge is raised \u2013 doesn\u2019t trouble this government. An immigrant\u2019s entry is no longer justified even by their utility. In any case, that defence was never a valid one. Those whose presence is no longer required had lives that were not justified by the brute terms of their \u201ccontribution\u201d, but by the very DNA of the country as it is today. They simply made, and are part of, Britain. Those who came here to drive buses and run newsagents did not exist in some alternate universe where these occupations required no skills, helped no one and made no imprint. They were not hermetically sealed away from Britain\u2019s culture. They are part of the story, but are now not even dignified with a postscript. We will come to rue this short memory. The new immigration rules will not only hurt the country economically \u2013 they give a glimpse into a new world that is taking shape, one where non-elite jobs are stripped of all honour, virtue and value. Where the government\u2019s disdain for the working class becomes apparent in its contempt for the kind of postcolonial labour that built and rebuilt this country, and its disinterest in the prospects of the \u201cindigenous\u201d workers who are now expected to tool up and fill the gap. Where the sons and daughters of those who would now score zero points on an immigration application enjoy a success that has many fathers, but not their own. Immigration is now so toxic, its suppression so central to the thriving of the Conservative party, that the contributions of \u201cthe wrong kind\u201d of immigrant \u2013 the kind that looks like Javid\u2019s father \u2013 must be minimised, along with the value of the sort of jobs they did. This is not an unforeseen and unintended consequence of the new immigration policy. As Patel says: it is the point. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist.

      "bodyText": "Rough sleepers are sheltering in bins all year round, with surging homelessness in the UK blamed for a rising number of deaths by crushing and near misses while containers are being emptied, a waste industry report has found. Homelessness charities and waste industry officials are calling for action to prevent \u201cterrible fatalities\u201d, after incidents in which vulnerable people sleeping in waste containers have died after being accidentally tipped into bin lorries. At least seven people are known to have been killed in the last five years, according to the Health and Safety executive, and waste industry bosses have warned rising destitution in the UK is putting more lives at risk. A report by the waste company Biffa, the Open University and the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management, seen by the Guardian, found the problem of rough sleepers sheltering in bins had surged in the last five years. Although most incidents take place in the winter, the report said people were being discovered inside waste containers by bin collectors at all times of the year. Rough sleepers are typically discovered inside closed containers during cold weather in secluded urban areas, according to the survey of 57 waste disposal companies and councils. But people are increasingly being discovered sheltering in bins in towns and villages as the homelessness crisis worsens. Over a third of organisations reported encountering issues with people sheltering in bins in the last year. From April to December 2019, Biffa employees recorded 109 \u201cnear misses\u201d or encounters with people either sleeping in or near its bins, although the figures rely on internal reporting and the true extent of the issue is unknown. Swindon, Sheffield, Newton Abbot, central London, Cardiff and South Shields are all understood to be hotspots for such incidents. The waste disposal company provided a video to the Guardian recorded this month of workers discovering a man sheltering in a bin in Norwich in the early hours of the morning. In the report, Petra Salva, the head of rough sleeping at the homelessness charity St Mungo\u2019s, said: \u201cLatest statistics show that 726 homeless people died while street homeless or in emergency accommodation in England and Wales in 2018. As this report notes, regrettably, homelessness and rough sleeping has risen drastically over the last decade. People dying while homeless is an absolute tragedy. \u201cTerrible fatalities occur when people seek refuge in bins. We think it\u2019s unacceptable that people are forced to sleep rough in the first place but almost unthinkable that people are so desperate that they will seek refuge in bin containers. And some of the most vulnerable people in our society find themselves in this situation, facing not just homelessness but also mental and physical health issues, drug or alcohol problems, maybe long histories of neglect and abuse.\u201d The government has acknowledged it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d for anyone to be forced to take shelter in waste disposal containers and has committed to ending rough sleeping by the end of this parliament. In 2014, Biffa issued safety guidance to bin lorry drivers on how to prevent homeless people from being crushed in compaction units after it became an unexpected consequence of a rise in rough sleeping. Michael Topham, Biffa\u2019s chief executive, said the issue of people sheltering in bins was as pressing as it had been five years ago and said his company was committed to improving industry practices to avoid \u201ctragic\u201d incidents. Veolia, another waste disposal company, has also reported increased problems with people sheltering in bins. Last year, an inquest heard how a 47-year-old man died after suffering crushing injuries to his legs when he was tipped into a bin lorry in Rochester, Kent. Trevor Nicoll, the president of the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management, said: \u201cThe issue of people seeking shelter in bins continues to be a challenge for the resources and waste management sector and the risk is likely to grow as the number of homeless people sleeping rough rises. \u201cRecent figures from the Greater London Authority, for example, show that the number of new rough sleepers in London has increased by 50% in one year and many of these vulnerable members of society may seek shelter in a waste container. At the same time, there have also been some tragic accidents when individuals have taken refuge in waste containers after a night out.\u201d About one in 10 cases of a person found sheltering in a bin involves a person that had been on a night out, according to the report, which can sometimes have tragic consequences. The RAF gunner Corrie McKeague is believed to have climbed into a bin that was then taken away by a lorry before his disappearance in September 2016. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cIt is completely unacceptable that anyone should have to face sleeping in these conditions in modern Britain. This does not reflect the society we should be and this is why we have committed to ending rough sleeping by the end of this parliament. \u201cWe have also committed a record \u00a31.2bn into funding services for rough sleepers and those at risk of becoming homeless, and have introduced the Homelessness Reduction Act which means councils [can] take action to prevent homelessness before it happens.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Before Ioan Gruffudd\u2019s first day at drama school, he had been told to wear something comfortable. He recalls walking towards the entrance of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada), where his fellow students were waiting, \u201clooking like Marlon Brando\u201d in white T-shirts, cool jeans and leather jackets. Gruffudd was wearing a shellsuit. A Welsh football association shellsuit. \u201cAnd I was a very young-looking 18-year-old,\u201d he says. \u201cVery patriotic, very fervently Welsh. I was a virgin as well. All the girls were like: \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to be the first, we can\u2019t have this young kid falling in love with us.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cThis is who I am.\u201d This was also the unworldly, naive boy who almost joined a fundamentalist church around the same time, but more of that later.</p> <p>The man who sits opposite me in a central London restaurant \u2013 despite being a successful, handsome actor with a much better-developed dress sense \u2013 seems to have retained enough of that endearing unaffectedness that I can perfectly picture him rustling through central London in head-to-toe polyester. In fact, there is a rare and touching openness about Gruffudd; he is perhaps the least guarded actor I\u2019ve met.</p> <p>Gruffudd is nearing the end of the shoot for Liar, the ITV drama that became a bit of a talking point when the first series aired in 2017. He has been away from his family for months, and says filming this has \u201cbeen probably the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do\u201d. It is not just that he misses his wife and their two young daughters, who are at home in Los Angeles; playing the serial rapist Andrew Earlham again, in this second series, has had its gruelling moments. \u201cEvery day, I\u2019m playing this person who\u2019s unravelling, slowly,\u201d he says. In the first series, Andrew ends up dead after being exposed by one of his victims, Laura (played by Joanne Froggatt); series two explores his past in flashbacks. \u201cIt looks great on the page \u2013 you read it and go: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to get my teeth into this.\u2019 And then the act of doing it \u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cI find myself in a corner, having a cry during the day sometimes, because you have to numb yourself to \u2026 You can\u2019t judge your character, you have to be the character.\u201d It means he has had partly to desensitise himself \u201cto all these horrible things he\u2019s done\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e987297f7d2560c147ac470c0f37291241f30e8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e987297f7d2560c147ac470c0f37291241f30e8c/189_365_5748_3449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joanne Froggatt and Gruffudd in Liar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joanne Froggatt and Gruffudd in Liar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the suspense of the first series came from whether or not Laura was lying about being raped. Was Gruffudd concerned about pushing the narrative that women\u2019s testimonies are not to be trusted? \u201cThat aspect of it, I hadn\u2019t really considered how it would be perceived,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to present one side over the other, we were just presenting a story that could happen anywhere.\u201d For Gruffudd, who is more likely to be seen in hero mode \u2013 he has played a swashbuckling navy admiral in Hornblower and a superhero in Fantastic Four \u2013 it was the chance to play someone different. \u201cBecause of my past on-screen characters, most of the people in the street who approached me didn\u2019t want to believe that I was that person [a rapist] at all,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though we clearly presented him doing these things. It worked so well that they can\u2019t comprehend somebody like that would have done such a thing. But offenders exist in every walk of life \u2013 CEOs of banks, teachers, doctors.\u201d</p> <p>He insists that presenting the horror of sexual assault, within a drama, \u201cis a subject matter to which we\u2019re all very keen to do justice. Not only do women feel terrified to come forward, if they do come forward, only a third of the cases [result in charges], let alone go to trial.\u201d</p> <p>The first series coincided with the beginning of the #MeToo movement in the autumn of 2017, and allegations of rape and sexual assault emerged about the film producer Harvey Weinstein. After the initial revelations were made, Gruffudd\u2019s wife, the actor Alice Evans, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/did-rejecting-harvey-weinsteins-sinister-advances-shut-career/?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_fb_tmg\" title=\"\">wrote an article</a> in which she said she met Weinstein at a party, and he had asked her to go to the bathroom with him. \u201cIt\u2019s not your average tipsy come-on,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s sinister. The sort of thing that makes you want to run away fast.\u201d When she turned him down, she said he made a comment about Gruffudd\u2019s career \u2013 her then boyfriend had auditioned for Weinstein the day before. She went on to say that neither she, nor Gruffudd, were ever again considered for one of Weinstein\u2019s films.</p> <p>\u201cI was very proud of Alice,\u201d says Gruffudd now. \u201cBecause women were not being believed. She wanted to say: \u2018No, this is definitely his modus operandi. This is how he behaves. I\u2019ve witnessed it.\u2019 So she wanted to present the case, help bolster the case.\u201d</p> <p>Evans told him what had happened at the time (\u201cI was stunned,\u201d he says). Was there any sense then that she would have gone public? That people already knew all about Weinstein? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that we spoke about,\u201d he says. \u201cThe incident happened, it wasn\u2019t anything physical, it was just the words.\u201d In terms of Weinstein\u2019s behaviour more widely being an open secret, he says, \u201cagents, I guess, certainly sent people to these scenarios, to hotel rooms\u201d.</p> <p>Does he believe he and Evans were blacklisted by Weinstein? \u201c[Alice] was very careful to say \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019,\u201d he says, adding that he doesn\u2019t know either. What\u2019s his feeling? \u201cI was so young when this happened and the idea of \u2026 I don\u2019t know. I mean, just hearing and reading all these stories, it\u2019s so beyond my comprehension, abusing that power.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"442183003e0026d996f35a5545fc5ef36c50f4c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/442183003e0026d996f35a5545fc5ef36c50f4c6/250_19_2530_1518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gruffudd and Alice Evans on the set of 102 Dalmatians in 2000.

Gruffudd says he has never witnessed any sexual harassment, but he says behaviour has changed \u2013 there aren\u2019t the same \u201cjokes\u201d being made that could be considered offensive.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if all those other abuses of power on the executive side have changed. I\u2019ve not lived a day in a female body.\u201d Evans had told him about her experience of sexual harassment, not just within the industry, but men in general. \u201cLearning what Alice had gone through in her 20s, I can\u2019t comprehend it because that\u2019s not how I behaved.\u201d</p> <p>He and Evans met 20 years ago \u2013 he is touchingly uxorious but he says: \u201cI think we\u2019ve struggled the past four years, making time for each other because physically we\u2019re apart.\u201d But, he says, in terms of work and income \u201cwe\u2019re very practical about the whole thing\u201d. Currently, it is Gruffudd who is working more. Has he ever done his turn at full-time parenthood? \u201cNo. I think I did it for a week and thought I was really cool.\u201d He expected lots of plaudits? He laughs. \u201cYes. Alice had come back, she had been away for a week. I was showing off \u2013 \u2018the kids are in bed\u2019 \u2013 and she was \u2018Yeah, you\u2019ve done one week Ioan, try six months\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Gruffudd\u2019s career took off quickly. He had small roles in Titanic and Wilde straight after drama school, then was cast as the lead in the ITV series Hornblower. He made it to Hollywood, with parts in Black Hawk Down and King Arthur, and then as Reed Richards in two Fantastic Four films.</p> <p>\u201cI sort of assumed that would be a calling card.\u201d But, he says, he failed to take advantage of his profile, and found that work dried up in his 30s. He has said before that he lost his confidence and started seeing a therapist. Does he ever look at the roles other people get and feel envious? \u201cWhen you\u2019re not working, in Hollywood, you get presented every week with a new poster going up and you know where you are in the pecking order,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to not suppress that, but to be aware of it and not take any heed of it, because you can\u2019t compete with another actor as far as I\u2019m concerned. The decision that is taken is not in his hands or my hands.\u201d He says he feels genuinely pleased when he sees his peers doing well. \u201cBecause if he can do it, then I can do it \u2013 that\u2019s how I look at it.\u201d</p> <p>It was Evans, heavily pregnant with their first daughter, who, as he puts it, staged \u201can intervention one day and said: \u2018We\u2019re going to have to change things up.\u2019\u201d She encouraged him to change his management team. His new manager said: \u2018Give me five months, I\u2019m going to put this back on track.\u2019 And she did.\u201d He started picking up lead roles, mainly in television. Liar marked his return to British TV; he also plays the lead, a forensic pathologist, in the Australian drama Harrow.</p> <p>When we talk about him being recognised in the street he admits he is thrilled by it, then volunteers, laughing at himself, that he puts makeup on before he leaves the house \u2013 \u201cbit of tinted moisturiser, bit of powder\u201d \u2013 because when people take selfies with him: \u201cI\u2019m sick of seeing pictures of myself looking like shit.\u201d He grins. \u201cIf someone says: \u2018Can I take a selfie?\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018No, let me take it.\u2019 I\u2019ll walk straight up to the window: \u2018That light will look great.\u2019 I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7685661513f8db9046084a58d21985f723f7f302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7685661513f8db9046084a58d21985f723f7f302/0_68_3069_1841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Alba, Gruffudd, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis as the Fantastic Four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Alba, Gruffudd, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis as the Fantastic Four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gruffudd grew up in a fairly religious family and must have been fairly easy pickings for a man who approached him on a London street and invited him to his evangelical church. \u201cAnd I got sucked in. Because I was thinking: \u2018Maybe I should get back in touch with this.\u2019 I got really sucked into it, to the point where I was going to be baptised into this church.\u201d He says the \u201cbrothers\u201d would have prayer meetings separately from the women, and he was being pressured to give up his place at Rada because they were concerned he was in plays where he\u2019d have to kiss women. Eventually, his mum had to drive up from Wales to rescue him. But he admits he felt \u201cthis massive conflict\u201d and was impressed by their conviction, which made his childhood Christianity look a bit lightweight. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve just never really recovered from it,\u201d he says. \u201cThis idea of this all-seeing, all-knowing being watching everything you do is a horrible trick to play on a child and I struggled with that.\u201d Did he really believe it? \u201cYes. Well, you do. If you imprint that on a young person\u2019s mind, it\u2019s a horrible thing to shake off. I wouldn\u2019t want to impose that on my children.\u201d</p> <p>At school, growing up in Wales, he did an audition for a character in the Welsh language soap opera Pobol y Cwm. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very good,\u201d he says, but he still loved it, and was determined to get better. Both his parents were teachers and in lots of ways he had a wonderful education at his state school, which took music very seriously (Gruffudd was a talented oboe player and sang in choirs), but he is aware that the arts is a harder place now for students from lower-income families. He was one of the last generation to get a grant: \u201cSo you did have a very diverse crowd at Rada then and probably since then, maybe not so much.\u201d Drama school was, he says, a \u201clevel playing field,\u201d but also intimidating.</p> <p>Has he noticed that a surprisingly large number of Britain\u2019s leading actors now come from upper-class backgrounds? He doesn\u2019t really answer the question, but does acknowledge the role of confidence that comes from privilege. \u201cWhen you look at some of the great actors we have \u2013 Benedict Cumberbatch, Dominic West, Damian Lewis \u2013 these are all friends of mine, and there is such confidence and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s upbringing, that\u2019s schooling.

      "bodyText": "Before Ioan Gruffudd\u2019s first day at drama school, he had been told to wear something comfortable. He recalls walking towards the entrance of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada), where his fellow students were waiting, \u201clooking like Marlon Brando\u201d in white T-shirts, cool jeans and leather jackets. Gruffudd was wearing a shellsuit. A Welsh football association shellsuit. \u201cAnd I was a very young-looking 18-year-old,\u201d he says. \u201cVery patriotic, very fervently Welsh. I was a virgin as well. All the girls were like: \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to be the first, we can\u2019t have this young kid falling in love with us.\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cThis is who I am.\u201d This was also the unworldly, naive boy who almost joined a fundamentalist church around the same time, but more of that later. The man who sits opposite me in a central London restaurant \u2013 despite being a successful, handsome actor with a much better-developed dress sense \u2013 seems to have retained enough of that endearing unaffectedness that I can perfectly picture him rustling through central London in head-to-toe polyester. In fact, there is a rare and touching openness about Gruffudd; he is perhaps the least guarded actor I\u2019ve met. Gruffudd is nearing the end of the shoot for Liar, the ITV drama that became a bit of a talking point when the first series aired in 2017. He has been away from his family for months, and says filming this has \u201cbeen probably the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do\u201d. It is not just that he misses his wife and their two young daughters, who are at home in Los Angeles; playing the serial rapist Andrew Earlham again, in this second series, has had its gruelling moments. \u201cEvery day, I\u2019m playing this person who\u2019s unravelling, slowly,\u201d he says. In the first series, Andrew ends up dead after being exposed by one of his victims, Laura (played by Joanne Froggatt); series two explores his past in flashbacks. \u201cIt looks great on the page \u2013 you read it and go: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to get my teeth into this.\u2019 And then the act of doing it \u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cI find myself in a corner, having a cry during the day sometimes, because you have to numb yourself to \u2026 You can\u2019t judge your character, you have to be the character.\u201d It means he has had partly to desensitise himself \u201cto all these horrible things he\u2019s done\u201d. Part of the suspense of the first series came from whether or not Laura was lying about being raped. Was Gruffudd concerned about pushing the narrative that women\u2019s testimonies are not to be trusted? \u201cThat aspect of it, I hadn\u2019t really considered how it would be perceived,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to present one side over the other, we were just presenting a story that could happen anywhere.\u201d For Gruffudd, who is more likely to be seen in hero mode \u2013 he has played a swashbuckling navy admiral in Hornblower and a superhero in Fantastic Four \u2013 it was the chance to play someone different. \u201cBecause of my past on-screen characters, most of the people in the street who approached me didn\u2019t want to believe that I was that person [a rapist] at all,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though we clearly presented him doing these things. It worked so well that they can\u2019t comprehend somebody like that would have done such a thing. But offenders exist in every walk of life \u2013 CEOs of banks, teachers, doctors.\u201d He insists that presenting the horror of sexual assault, within a drama, \u201cis a subject matter to which we\u2019re all very keen to do justice. Not only do women feel terrified to come forward, if they do come forward, only a third of the cases [result in charges], let alone go to trial.\u201d The first series coincided with the beginning of the #MeToo movement in the autumn of 2017, and allegations of rape and sexual assault emerged about the film producer Harvey Weinstein. After the initial revelations were made, Gruffudd\u2019s wife, the actor Alice Evans, wrote an article in which she said she met Weinstein at a party, and he had asked her to go to the bathroom with him. \u201cIt\u2019s not your average tipsy come-on,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s sinister. The sort of thing that makes you want to run away fast.\u201d When she turned him down, she said he made a comment about Gruffudd\u2019s career \u2013 her then boyfriend had auditioned for Weinstein the day before. She went on to say that neither she, nor Gruffudd, were ever again considered for one of Weinstein\u2019s films. \u201cI was very proud of Alice,\u201d says Gruffudd now. \u201cBecause women were not being believed. She wanted to say: \u2018No, this is definitely his modus operandi. This is how he behaves. I\u2019ve witnessed it.\u2019 So she wanted to present the case, help bolster the case.\u201d Evans told him what had happened at the time (\u201cI was stunned,\u201d he says). Was there any sense then that she would have gone public? That people already knew all about Weinstein? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that we spoke about,\u201d he says. \u201cThe incident happened, it wasn\u2019t anything physical, it was just the words.\u201d In terms of Weinstein\u2019s behaviour more widely being an open secret, he says, \u201cagents, I guess, certainly sent people to these scenarios, to hotel rooms\u201d. Does he believe he and Evans were blacklisted by Weinstein? \u201c[Alice] was very careful to say \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019,\u201d he says, adding that he doesn\u2019t know either. What\u2019s his feeling? \u201cI was so young when this happened and the idea of \u2026 I don\u2019t know. I mean, just hearing and reading all these stories, it\u2019s so beyond my comprehension, abusing that power.\u201d I wonder if he has noticed a significant change in the culture in the industry. Gruffudd says he has never witnessed any sexual harassment, but he says behaviour has changed \u2013 there aren\u2019t the same \u201cjokes\u201d being made that could be considered offensive. \u201cI don\u2019t know if all those other abuses of power on the executive side have changed. I\u2019ve not lived a day in a female body.\u201d Evans had told him about her experience of sexual harassment, not just within the industry, but men in general. \u201cLearning what Alice had gone through in her 20s, I can\u2019t comprehend it because that\u2019s not how I behaved.\u201d He and Evans met 20 years ago \u2013 he is touchingly uxorious but he says: \u201cI think we\u2019ve struggled the past four years, making time for each other because physically we\u2019re apart.\u201d But, he says, in terms of work and income \u201cwe\u2019re very practical about the whole thing\u201d. Currently, it is Gruffudd who is working more. Has he ever done his turn at full-time parenthood? \u201cNo. I think I did it for a week and thought I was really cool.\u201d He expected lots of plaudits? He laughs. \u201cYes. Alice had come back, she had been away for a week. I was showing off \u2013 \u2018the kids are in bed\u2019 \u2013 and she was \u2018Yeah, you\u2019ve done one week Ioan, try six months\u2019.\u201d Gruffudd\u2019s career took off quickly. He had small roles in Titanic and Wilde straight after drama school, then was cast as the lead in the ITV series Hornblower. He made it to Hollywood, with parts in Black Hawk Down and King Arthur, and then as Reed Richards in two Fantastic Four films. \u201cI sort of assumed that would be a calling card.\u201d But, he says, he failed to take advantage of his profile, and found that work dried up in his 30s. He has said before that he lost his confidence and started seeing a therapist. Does he ever look at the roles other people get and feel envious? \u201cWhen you\u2019re not working, in Hollywood, you get presented every week with a new poster going up and you know where you are in the pecking order,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to not suppress that, but to be aware of it and not take any heed of it, because you can\u2019t compete with another actor as far as I\u2019m concerned. The decision that is taken is not in his hands or my hands.\u201d He says he feels genuinely pleased when he sees his peers doing well. \u201cBecause if he can do it, then I can do it \u2013 that\u2019s how I look at it.\u201d It was Evans, heavily pregnant with their first daughter, who, as he puts it, staged \u201can intervention one day and said: \u2018We\u2019re going to have to change things up.\u2019\u201d She encouraged him to change his management team. His new manager said: \u2018Give me five months, I\u2019m going to put this back on track.\u2019 And she did.\u201d He started picking up lead roles, mainly in television. Liar marked his return to British TV; he also plays the lead, a forensic pathologist, in the Australian drama Harrow. When we talk about him being recognised in the street he admits he is thrilled by it, then volunteers, laughing at himself, that he puts makeup on before he leaves the house \u2013 \u201cbit of tinted moisturiser, bit of powder\u201d \u2013 because when people take selfies with him: \u201cI\u2019m sick of seeing pictures of myself looking like shit.\u201d He grins. \u201cIf someone says: \u2018Can I take a selfie?\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018No, let me take it.\u2019 I\u2019ll walk straight up to the window: \u2018That light will look great.\u2019 I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that.\u201d Gruffudd grew up in a fairly religious family and must have been fairly easy pickings for a man who approached him on a London street and invited him to his evangelical church. \u201cAnd I got sucked in. Because I was thinking: \u2018Maybe I should get back in touch with this.\u2019 I got really sucked into it, to the point where I was going to be baptised into this church.\u201d He says the \u201cbrothers\u201d would have prayer meetings separately from the women, and he was being pressured to give up his place at Rada because they were concerned he was in plays where he\u2019d have to kiss women. Eventually, his mum had to drive up from Wales to rescue him. But he admits he felt \u201cthis massive conflict\u201d and was impressed by their conviction, which made his childhood Christianity look a bit lightweight. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve just never really recovered from it,\u201d he says. \u201cThis idea of this all-seeing, all-knowing being watching everything you do is a horrible trick to play on a child and I struggled with that.\u201d Did he really believe it? \u201cYes. Well, you do. If you imprint that on a young person\u2019s mind, it\u2019s a horrible thing to shake off. I wouldn\u2019t want to impose that on my children.\u201d At school, growing up in Wales, he did an audition for a character in the Welsh language soap opera Pobol y Cwm. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very good,\u201d he says, but he still loved it, and was determined to get better. Both his parents were teachers and in lots of ways he had a wonderful education at his state school, which took music very seriously (Gruffudd was a talented oboe player and sang in choirs), but he is aware that the arts is a harder place now for students from lower-income families. He was one of the last generation to get a grant: \u201cSo you did have a very diverse crowd at Rada then and probably since then, maybe not so much.\u201d Drama school was, he says, a \u201clevel playing field,\u201d but also intimidating. Has he noticed that a surprisingly large number of Britain\u2019s leading actors now come from upper-class backgrounds? He doesn\u2019t really answer the question, but does acknowledge the role of confidence that comes from privilege. \u201cWhen you look at some of the great actors we have \u2013 Benedict Cumberbatch, Dominic West, Damian Lewis \u2013 these are all friends of mine, and there is such confidence and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s upbringing, that\u2019s schooling. But it sort of oozes out of them.\u201d Gruffudd likes acting, he says, because: \u201cI have, sometimes, a discomfort and unease in being myself, publicly. The characters I play are a lot more interesting than I am, and I think acting gives me a way of satisfying that show-off nature.\u201d He says he has confidence in his talent as an actor, but the rest of it that goes with the job? Talkshows, he says, are \u201ca terrifying experience. It\u2019s a very exposing thing, and you need to be confident because people expect you to be. A lot of it is an act.\u201d He is about to take \u201ca self-imposed break, just to have that re-entry to the family\u201d. But he is also delighted to be so busy. The prettiness of his youth has given way to something about his face that is a bit darker, more worn, and more \u201cinteresting and difficult\u201d roles are coming his way. \u201cI\u2019m meeting all these characters that I\u2019ve always wanted to play,\u201d he says with a smile that suddenly looks a touch wolfish. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more grateful to be working, and working on good things, than I am now.\u201d Liar returns to ITV on 2 March",

In 2000, around 2.3% of officers were from ethnic minorities compared to 7.2% of the population in England and Wales, a gap of 4.9%.</p> <p>In 2019 the percentage of ethnic minority officers was 6.9%, but the ethnic population had doubled to 14.5%, a gap of 7.6%.</p> <p>Haigh said: \u201cIf it is the best they can achieve under the current framework then they need to have firm targets written into legislation.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/05/its-nowhere-near-good-enough-broken-promises-on-police-diversity\">Analysis commissioned by the Guardian last year showed police were decades away</a> from looking like their communities.

Cuts to neighbourhood policing have taken the police even further away from the communities, and it is even more urgent now that it was 10 years ago. \u201cWhat is being lost is the presence in communities and relationship with the communities. \u201cIt leads to a more reactive style of police service which leads to a more distant relationship and more conflict.\u201d Positive discrimination is currently illegal. Police have previously been in favour of it, but it was opposed by Labour and then Conservative governments. A form of it was used for the Police Service of Northern Ireland and helped lessen Protestant dominance of the force. The largest gap is in Britain\u2019s largest force, the Metropolitan police, which covers London \u2013 a region with a 43% ethnic minority population, while its police force has only 14% ethnic minority officers. The Met\u2019s own internal estimates say it could be nearly a century away from its goal. Haigh said:\u201cThe pace of change is so glacial the Metropolitan police will still be disproportionately white for another 100 years at this rate of change. \u201cWe still have not reached those targets 21 years later. Diversity has fallen away among senior police leaders both on race and gender. There\u2019s only been one ethnic minority police and crime commissioner and there\u2019s only ever been one ethnic minority chief constable. \u201cThe police need to do better at recruiting from all communities and need to be reflective of their communities.\u201d New research commissioned by Labour showed that when the police last continuously grew from 2000 to 2009, the race gap in English and Welsh forces which were using positive action, grew, from 4.9% to 6.9%. In Northern Ireland which used a form of positive discrimination, Catholic representation massively increased from 8% in 2001 to 30% in 2011. That gap has also grown since 2000, the year after the Macpherson report was published. In 2000, around 2.3% of officers were from ethnic minorities compared to 7.2% of the population in England and Wales, a gap of 4.9%. In 2019 the percentage of ethnic minority officers was 6.9%, but the ethnic population had doubled to 14.5%, a gap of 7.6%. Haigh said: \u201cIf it is the best they can achieve under the current framework then they need to have firm targets written into legislation.\u201d Analysis commissioned by the Guardian last year showed police were decades away from looking like their communities. With the proportion of Britain\u2019s ethnic minority population increasing, the gap could get bigger. Asked if police were still institutionally racist, Haigh said:\u201cI think society is racist, and the criminal justice system is still turning out disproportionate outcomes for ethnic minority people, so yes I think there is a problem with disproportionate outcomes and racism across the criminal justice system. \u201cIt\u2019s time we took proper action on this.\u201d Ian Hopkins, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for workforce representation, said the chiefs would not be asking for positive discrimination: \u201cA substantial uplift in officer numbers gives us a generational opportunity to increase the diversity of our workforce. \u201cA number of forces are having considerable success in attracting new talent into policing through positive action. Therefore we are currently focusing on maximising the benefits of positive action rather than calling for a change in law required to move to positive discrimination.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An inquiry into allegations of money laundering at Crown Resorts Melbourne casino has heard that other jurisdictions have far more stringent controls on junkets which bring high rollers to casinos. On the first day of evidence in a NSW inquiry, a gaming expert, Paul Bromberg from Spectrum Asia, said that other countries such as Singapore \u2013 and US gaming states such as New Jersey \u2013 required junket operators to be licensed. Japan had decided to ban them operating in casinos entirely. The inquiryis being chaired by the former supreme court judge Patricia Bergin and is examining allegations of money laundering and links to organised crime in Crown. She is also considering whether there are probity issues raised by Lawrence Ho\u2019s Melco Resorts\u2019 purchase of 10% of Crown\u2019s shares. Reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age last year alleged that Crown Resorts, part-owned by one of Australia\u2019s richest men, James Packer, was using junkets backed by Asia\u2019s most powerful organised crime syndicates as part of its program to attract Chinese high rollers to its casinos. Reports also alleged that Crown\u2019s casinos were used to launder money. Bromberg told the inquiry there was substantial work by academics which linked Macau\u2019s junkets \u2013 organisations which bring high rollers to overseas casinos \u2013 to the triads. Bromberg said that as well as organising travel, junket operators arranged prostitutes and narcotics for their clientele and also provided cross-border finance and enforced debts. The enforcement of gaming debts is illegal in China. \u201cFor all these reasons, organised crime has been involved in junkets for many years,\u201d he said. He said there had been reports in the Hong Kong media about the organised crime connections of Suncity, including the CEO, Alvin Chau. The allegations drew a sharp response from Crown, which ran advertisements in newspapers calling the reports a \u201cdeceitful campaign\u201d. Crown pointed to registration of junkets by the gaming authorities in Macau and the fact that the largest junket Crown was involved with, Suncity, is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. But Bromberg, a veteran of the Asian gaming scene, said the fact that Macau registered junket operators offered \u201clittle comfort\u201d. He said until recently Macau had failed to enforce its own gaming legislation and that registration was very different from enforcement. Macau merely required junket operators to certify that they had no foreign criminal connections, without doing its own checks, he said. Asked what comfort could be gained by a junket like Suncity being listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Bromberg replied: \u201cI would say very little.\u201d He said that apart from limited financial scrutiny, the HK stock exchange did not have the resources for probity checks of any companies listed on its bourse, and that applied equally to companies not in the gaming industry. On the other hand, Singapore, which opened its first two casinos in 2010, required junkets to be licensed, he said. Its regulator, which has the powers of a law enforcement body, had rejected several junket operators because they did not meet probity checks, he said. Bromberg said Japan had gone further and taken the decision not to allow junkets to operate in its gaming industry. Australian casinos are required to notify the state casino authorities if they are using junkets to promote their casino or allowing them to operate within the casino. But the authorities do not run probity checks on the junkets, leaving that function to the casino itself. Bromberg said this clearly gave rise to a potential conflict of interest, as the casino was wanting to bring as many wealthy VIPs to its casino as possible. Also he pointed out that casinos did not have access to information gathered by other law enforcement agencies. The regulation of Macau\u2019s gaming scene is particularly relevant to Crown because Macau\u2019s Melco Resorts, chaired by Lawrence Ho, has bought a 10% stake in Crown. However, Ho recently announced he would not proceed to buy a further 10% from Packer due to the downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

      "bodyText": "The conservative commentator and ABC critic Gerard Henderson has been dropped by the revamped ABC Insiders program hosted by David Speers. Guardian Australia understands its executive producer, Sam Clark, Speers and the ABC\u2019s news executive see no role for Henderson on the Insiders couch this year and are trying new conservative voices. Sources said Henderson did not sufficiently engage with the issues during the journalists\u2019 discussions. The decision had nothing to do with his conservative views. The executive director of the rightwing thinktank the Sydney Institute, Henderson is an opinion columnist for the Australian, and he also publishes a weekly blog, Media Watchdog. Henderson confirmed he would no longer appear on Insiders, telling Guardian Australia that Clark \u201cdeclined to guarantee me any appearances in the future\u201d and he had \u201cunderstood the message\u201d. Henderson\u2019s occasional appearances on the program alongside Guardian Australia writer David Marr have been celebrated for the stark difference between the two men\u2019s views. \u201cI\u2019m distraught,\u201d Marr said when told about Henderson. There had been calls for Henderson to be removed as an ABC commentator after comments he made last week on Andrew Bolt\u2019s Sky News show, but the ABC\u2019s decision predated that. During a discussion about a Four Corners\u2019 expose of St Kevin\u2019s College in Melbourne, Bolt asked Henderson: \u201cHow terrible was [the school\u2019s handling of the case] really?\u201d Henderson replied: \u201cNot at all.\u201d Child protection advocates criticised Bolt and Henderson\u2019s intervention and they both apologised. Henderson had said the program was \u201cwithin the ABC tradition of attacking mainly Catholic institutions, sometimes Christian institutions\u201d, and the story was a \u201ca gross exaggeration\u201d. The victim, Paris Street, condemned their characterisation of the crime, saying their comments made him \u201csick\u201d. Henderson had been trying to secure a spot on the Insiders couch and had sent several emails to a number of news executives at the ABC, Guardian Australia understands. Sources said he was told the revamped show was trying out some new faces and no dates had been set for him to appear. On Monday the former editor-in-chief of the Australian, Chris Mitchell, made a case for Henderson to appear on Insiders. In a media column which was lavish in its praise for Speers \u2013 \u201cscrupulously fair and the best political interviewer in the post-Laurie Oakes era\u201d \u2013 Mitchell said Henderson was yet to receive a call. \u201cIt would be a pity to see [Henderson] leave Insiders over criticism of his appearance with Andrew Bolt,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe show has had many critics, especially among conservatives, but has been big enough to give some of them a seat on the couch.\u201d Henderson sought to clarify the column in a letter he has asked the Australian to publish on Tuesday. \u201cI wish to clarify Chris Mitchell\u2019s comment about my relationship with Insiders,\u201d Henderson wrote. \u201cIn response to my email of February 4 about possible appearance dates in early 2020, Insiders\u2019 executive producer Sam Clark phoned me the next day and advised that he had not made up his mind as to whether I would be asked on the program this year. \u201cIn a subsequent conversation on February 7, Sam Clark declined to guarantee me any appearances in the future. I understood the message and sent Insiders an \u2018au revoir\u2019 response on February 11. \u201cAll this had nothing to do with what I may or may not have said on the Bolt Report many days later.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s political deadlock hinges on the cold, hard numbers of parliamentary arithmetic, but there is an additional, nebulous factor: the conscience of Miche\u00e1l Martin. The leader of Fianna F\u00e1il is the party leader best positioned to wrangle a government and emerge as taoiseach. It would safeguard his job as party leader and crown his career, giving him a chance to shape history in the Brexit era. But conscience \u2013 others call it blinkeredness and arrogance \u2013 may impede Martin from forming a ruling coalition, leading to stalemate, another election and his political oblivion. The issue is Sinn F\u00e9in. Martin has ruled out entering government with the nationalist party on moral grounds: it supported the IRA during the Troubles and allegedly retains links with shadowy figures. So, in defiance of parliamentary arithmetic and political gravity, he has said no to any deal with Sinn F\u00e9in.

A less charitable interpretation is that Martin is too stubborn or calculating to accept Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s transformation from pariah to legitimate voice of the left. The 8 February general election turned the 160-seat D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann into a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Sinn F\u00e9in won the popular vote and 37 seats. Fianna F\u00e1il won 38.

      "bodyText": "The driver of the Sydney-to-Melbourne express passenger train who was killed when the train derailed emailed a friend less than a month before the tragedy outlining faults with the track. John Kennedy, 54, from Canberra, was killed when the train derailed on Thursday night at Wallan, 60km north of Melbourne. His 49-year-old pilot, from Castlemaine in regional Victoria, was also killed in the accident, while 11 of the 160 passengers were injured. Investigators continue to sift through the wreck as questions have been raised about the maintenance of the train and railway line, signalling, and the speed of the train at the time. In an email dated 3 February, Kennedy wrote to his friend, Australian National University professor Clive Williams, that numerous trips along the same rail line had been precarious. \u201c\u2026 my last six Melbourne return trips have been very late or cancelled mainly due to train fault issues, 3 of the six runs I was down to one engine, on another trip I had no speedo and the only trip without a train fault was disrupted by the big derailment last week,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Williams told Guardian Australia that he and Kennedy became friends over their mutual interest in a fast train service between Canberra and Sydney. Kennedy invited Williams to travel with him on routes from Canberra to get a better understanding of the rail system, which he did several times. \u201cWe had trouble on the Albury to Melbourne sector, it\u2019s not a very good track\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere was a lot of jumping and bumping around and it was quite violent. \u201cHe was a genuine train enthusiast, and he died doing what he loved doing. It\u2019s just so sad because it\u2019s really down to politicians, who should be putting more money into a railway system that\u2019s falling apart at the seams.

A fresh outbreak of stupidity in the political debate has been triggered by Labor\u2019s decision last week to sign up to a net zero target by 2050.

Achieving net zero emissions by mid-century is certainly a challenging task, requiring the transformation of Australia\u2019s carbon-intensive economy. But increasingly, net zero is not a controversial ambition. More than 70 countries and 398 cities say they have adopted a net zero position.

The BCA, which represents Australia\u2019s biggest companies, says Australia should legislate a target of net zero emissions by 2050.

The point here is: attitudes are shifting, and rapidly. What is the Morrison government\u2019s position on net zero? Because the government is speaking out both sides of its mouth, the position is confusing. Let\u2019s step through the sequence. Both the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, and the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, have acknowledged over the past couple of weeks that signatories to the Paris agreement (and that\u2019s Australia) have already signed on to achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century, or not long after. As Taylor told Sky News on Monday: \u201cThere is that targeting built into the Paris agreement where the world has agreed to get to net zero emissions in the second half of the century.

Will the Coalition adopt the target or not? Very good question. Last Friday the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, confirmed the government \u201cwill be finalising a longer-term target in time for Cop26\u201d (which is the UN-led climate talks scheduled for the end of this year) but Taylor\u2019s language is different. The emissions reduction minister talks about \u201ca long-term strategy\u201d rather than a target, which is highly suggestive that the government won\u2019t adopt a formal target despite having already implicitly signed up to a net zero objective by signing and ratifying Paris. But just to be clear: nobody significant in the government is ruling out adopting a target over the course of the year. Please explain I\u2019m sorry if your head is hurting. Bear with me. When the emissions reduction minister was asked about his position on targets on Monday, Taylor said the government would be \u201cfocusing on technology\u201d \u2013 which translates as the government identifying new technologies than can help Australia\u2019s export industries reduce emissions \u201cwithout job destruction\u201d.

The direction doesn\u2019t give the actors much to do beyond unmodulated shouting, twitching (to strobe lights!) and standing around waiting for a play to happen. Actor Daniel Fischer shows an energetic potential for comedy that\u2019s consistently misdirected into stage mania. Tamara Lee Bailey seizes at two isolated monologues in the script that allow her to actually do some acting and delivers moments so beautiful that while they can\u2019t save this play they do rescue Ho\u2019s reputation as a writer of potential. These moments prove he can turn a line \u2013 and while his emerging theatrical ideas aren\u2019t coherent in The Great Australian Play, it\u2019s cause for some excitement that he\u2019s having them. For that reason, if you have a spare 160 minutes and the curiosity, The Great Australian Play is worth a visit. Not because it\u2019s great but because it illustrates in one or two strong moments amid its failed experiments what a long and difficult expedition the pursuit of greatness really is. \u2022 The Great Australian Play is at Theatre Works in St Kilda, Melbourne until 29 February",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s largest theme park and its management had \u201ca culpable culture\u201d from the board down, the Queensland coroner has found after the deaths of four people on a ride at Dreamworld on the Gold Coast three years ago. Coroner James McDougall said he reasonably suspected the park\u2019s operator, Ardent Leisure, had committed a workplace offence and referred his findings to the Queensland office of industrial relations to consider a prosecution. The state has previously decided not to bring charges against Ardent or individuals in relation to the deaths of Cindy Low, who was a New Zealander, Kate Goodchild, her brother Luke Dorsett and his partner Roozi Araghi. They were on \u201craft five\u201d of the Thunder River Rapids ride and died when a water pump malfunctioned on 25 October 2016. Under Queensland law, companies can be fined up to $3m and individuals fined up to $600,000 or jailed for up to five years. McDougall detailed \u201cirresponsible\u201d, \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d safety practices at the theme park that contributed to the four deaths. He made scathing comments about Dreamworld\u2019s maintenance and oversight of the ride, which had a history of malfunction and incident. He said Dreamworld\u2019s safety failures were \u201csystemic\u201d. These included inadequate training for staff, poor emergency and safety procedures, and piecemeal engineering modifications undertaken without risk assessment. The ride had broken down five times in the previous seven days. McDougall said he found it difficult to believe that safety action was not taken before the fatal accident. \u201cSuch a culpable culture can only exist when leadership from the board down are careless in terms of safety,\u201d McDougall said. \u201cIt is clear from the expert evidence that at the time of the incident the design and construction of the [ride] posed a significant risk to the health and safety of patrons. \u201c[A fatal accident] was simply a matter of time. [Multiple safety issues] posed a risk and would have been easily identifiable to a competent person, had one ever been commissioned to conduct risk or hazard assessments of the ride. \u201cWhilst it is accepted there is always an inherent risk to safety, given the nature of an amusement ride, that was not the case with respect to the [Thunder River Rapids]. No risk assessment [was undertaken] in its 30 years of commission. \u201cShoddy record keeping was a significant contributor to this incident.\u201d Earlier, family members of those who died gave emotional statements in the courtroom. \u201cThe thought that Cindy would not experience all that life had in store for her was harder for us than the thought we might not see her again,\u201d Low\u2019s husband, Matthew, told the court. \u201cOur heart aches daily as we try with varying success to be grateful for the decades we had. She had the heart of a tiger, fierce and protective.\u201d Kim Dorsett, the mother of Luke and Kate, spoke about her children and Araghi. \u201cThe easier part was burying them, the harrowing part is living without them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe exist in a world full of grief and shattered family and friends; three mothers who have lost their children living with broken hearts and souls, and let us not forget those four beautiful children who will now grow up without a mum, and that is what this is really about.\u201d Goodchild\u2019s 12-year-old daughter and Low\u2019s 10-year-old son survived the accident. Ardent Leisure issued a statement on Monday afternoon expressing \u201cdeepest sympathies\u201d to the families of the victims. It said safety was the No 1 priority for the new leadership team at the park, which was focused on continuous improvements to \u201cride safety and reliability, training of ride operators, emergency management procedures, safety management systems and safety governance\u201d. \u201cThese significant changes which we continue to drive at Dreamworld have been acknowledged by the coroner in his report,\u201d the statement said. The statement said the company \u201creaffirms its commitment to implement the coroner\u2019s recommendations\u201d, but made no reference to the coroner\u2019s criticism of the park\u2019s practices or the potential for prosecution.",

Official data released on Monday revealed national emissions were down 0.3% in the year to September. Emissions from electricity generation fell 2% (3.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide) as the now-filled renewable energy target boosted invested in solar and wind power. Pollution from agriculture fell even further \u2013 4.1m tonnes, or 5.8% \u2013 due to the impact on livestock of the historic eastern seaboard drought and north Queensland floods. But fugitive emissions, released during coal and gas extraction, were estimated to have jumped 6% (3.3m tonnes). Pollution from stationary energy \u2013 which includes the manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors \u2013 was up 2.6% (2.6m tonnes). The biggest leap was in the surging liquefied natural gas export industry, now worth $50bn after a wave of investment, particularly in Western Australia. LNG emissions were up 16.9% (6.3m tonnes). As Guardian Australia has reported, the rise in industrial pollution has occurred as the government has allowed big polluters to increase emissions limits under a scheme known as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, which was promised in 2015 to prevent rises above business-as-usual levels. National emissions across the year were estimated to be 530.8m tonnes, nearly 1% lower than they were in 2000. The government\u2019s 2020 target over that timeframe is a 5% cut. Emissions are down about 1.3% since the Coalition was elected in 2013, but just 0.4% since 2014, the year the national carbon price was repealed and replaced by then prime minister Tony Abbott with the emissions reduction fund. Climate pollution fell about 14% when Labor was in power under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. The data was released in the wake of the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, recommitting the party to a target of Australia having net zero emissions by 2050. It has not yet explained how it would get there. Every Australian state, the Business Council of Australia and more than 70 countries have supported a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Asked on Monday if the federal government would make the same commitment, the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said the world had agreed \u201cto get to net zero emissions in the second half the century\u201d under the Paris climate agreement but the Coalition would not adopt a target that was unfunded or not backed by a plan. The government is expected to soon release a \u201ctechnology investment roadmap\u201d, but has confirmed few details. It has also received a report from a panel led by the businessman Grant King, which was last year asked to advise on new ways to cut emissions. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do our bit, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be focusing on technology,\u201d Taylor said on Monday. In a statement on the new emissions data, Taylor emphasised emissions were down 13% since 2005, the year against which Australia\u2019s Paris target for 2030 (a 26-28% cut) is measured. Labor\u2019s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the fall in emissions was \u201clittle more than a rounding error\u201d, and the government\u2019s policies were \u201chopelessly inadequate\u201d. \u201cThere was no reduction in emissions in the quarter to September 2019 and annual emissions only reduced by a pitiful 0.3%,\u201d he said. \u201cScott Morrison is failing to protect Australians from the dangerous realities of climate change.\u201d Taylor said the Australian economy was \u201csteadily decarbonising\u201d but growth in exports was putting upward pressure on emissions. In particular, he said, LNG exports were reducing global emissions \u201cby displacing more emissions-intensive fuels overseas\u201d. Guardian Australia last year asked for the evidence that Australian LNG was displacing coal-fired power in Asia to the extent the government has claimed. It was not made available. A government report at the time suggested gas would be increasingly competing with zero-emissions nuclear and renewable energy in Japan, Australia\u2019s biggest LNG market. Taylor said emissions from export industries had increased 54% since 2005 levels, but per capita pollution and the emissions intensity of the economy \u2013 the amount released relative to production \u2013 were at the lowest levels in nearly three decades. \u201cThe value of our exports has increased by $83bn since September 2013, reflecting the Coalition government\u2019s good economic management,\u201d Taylor said.",

      "bodyText": "Bettina Arndt\u2019s Order of Australia has been referred to the independent body that hands out the awards amid growing calls for the controversial sex therapist and writer to be stripped of the honour. Arndt was criticised last week after she congratulated a Queensland detective who said police would keep an \u201copen mind\u201d in a case where a man allegedly killed his wife and three children by dousing them with petrol and setting them alight. On Monday the office of the governor general, David Hurley, confirmed he had referred correspondence over Arndt\u2019s award to the Council of the Order of Australia. \u201cIn all matters relating to the Order of Australia, the governor general acts on advice from and recommendations made by the Council for the Order of Australia,\u201d his spokesman said. \u201cWhen the governor general receives correspondence \u2013 including requests to terminate or cancel an award \u2013 it is referred to the council \u2026 for advice and action. \u201cFollowing this standard process, the governor general has referred correspondence in relation to the appointment of Ms Arndt to the council.\u201d The Victorian attorney general, Jill Hennessy, had already written to Hurley asking him to rescind Arndt\u2019s honour over a controversial interview she conducted with twice-convicted paedophile Nicolaas Bester in 2017. But Ardnt\u2019s comments congratulating a policeman for heavily criticised comments suggesting police were keeping an \u201copen mind\u201d over whether the death of Hannah Clarke and her children was a case of a \u201chusband being driven too far\u201d has prompted further scrutiny over her award. \u201cCongratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been \u2018driven too far\u2019,\u201d Arndt said in a tweet. \u201cBut note the misplaced outrage.

The policeman praised by Arndt, Det Insp Mark Thompson, was stood aside by Queensland police after his choice of words sparked outrage. Katrina Carroll, the Queensland police commissioner, said he had volunteered to step down \u201cfor the integrity and the confidence\u201d of the investigation and of Queensland policing more generally. She said Thompson was \u201can extraordinarily committed, experienced and brilliant investigator\u201d and \u201can exceptionally good police officer\u201d who was distressed and distraught by the consequences of what he had said. Arndt said: \u201cWe need to stand up to this dangerous mob rule and demand Mark Thompson is reinstated.\u201d Clarke, 31, and her children, Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4, and Trey, 3, died after Baxter allegedly poured petrol on his family and set them alight at Camp Hill in Brisbane last week.

It said the headroom would be less than a third of the buffer earmarked by former tory chancellor Philip Hammond. Should public borrowing rise by more than expected, the government may need to raise around \u00a319bn of additional tax income, it added. Leslie continued: \u201cIf the chancellor wants to increase spending on day-to-day public services in a fiscally responsible way he will have to change another of his party\u2019s traditional priorities \u2013 lower taxes. He added: \u201cHigher spending will require higher taxes.\u201d",

Over four years, 1536-40, his tasks include the seemingly impossible. He must reconcile Lady Mary to her father the king, bring down two of the most powerful families in Europe, turn monks into money, prevent imperial invasion, organise a new queen. Taking opponents in his grasp like the snake whose poisoned bite he once survived, he must manoeuvre his arch-enemies the Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner. Cromwell lives these years with henchmen at his back, and guards at every door. \u201cThe times being what they are, a man may enter the gate as your friend and change sides while he crosses the courtyard.\u201d As for clothes, best try a reversible garment: \u201cone never knows, is it dying or dancing?\u201d</p> <p>We can already tell the shape of this book. We see that the crowd dispersing after Anne Boleyn\u2019s execution in the opening pages (\u201ctime for a second breakfast\u201d) will gather again at its close. Working with and against our foreknowledge, Mantel keeps us on the brink, each day to be invented. \u201cScaramella\u2019s off to war,\u201d hums Cromwell, a tune from his Italian youth. You need a war-song to go into dinner. This is what it\u2019s like to be at the centre of power in Tudor England, and also a particular understanding of what it is, anywhere, to be alive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6bfc935ab14d102dc7d7ba2e4d14040086fec96e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bfc935ab14d102dc7d7ba2e4d14040086fec96e/0_0_2708_3192/848.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Sir Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein the Younger, 1532.\" width=\"848\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portrait of Sir Thomas Cromwell by Hans Holbein the Younger, 1532.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Dagnall/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Mirror &amp; the Light</em> is generously self-sufficient \u2013 to read this alone would hardly be skimping: it is four or five books in itself.

He knows the power of palimpsests. His Reformation involves the whitewashing of walls, but he sees how old faces show through from underneath. <em>The Mirror </em><em>&amp; the Light</em> is startlingly fresh in every moment, a new-made story with predecessors close enough to bleed through the pages.</p> <p>Mantel\u2019s Cromwell, now in his 50s, keeps the same daunting schedules as ever through 18-hour days. Lawyer, banker, chief diplomat, he is master of the grand scheme and every last memorandum. \u201cBear in mind,\u201d he tells a friend and spy, \u201cmy field of interest is very wide.\u201d He knows the price of wool and alum, and market values in the court\u2019s \u201cinner economy\u201d of gossip and shame. He has drained the roads, reintroduced beavers, grafted better plums. And still his life depends entirely on Henry\u2019s favour. Should the king die, or withdraw his love, all is lost. A moment\u2019s inattention and the structure falls: hence the difficulty of sleep, hence the disaster of illness in which, through absence, one loses the advantage. \u201cYou are one man,\u201d says Margaret Pole. \u201cWho follows you? Only carrion crows.\u201d</p> <p>She is restating the terms of class warfare. The central conflict between the self-made blacksmith\u2019s son and his aristocratic opponents (Norfolks, Courtenays, Poles) intensifies along with Cromwell\u2019s power. As his chief of staff Wriothesley correctly observes, \u201cThe higher you rise in the king\u2019s service, the more you mention the low place you come from.\u201d His country, too, is obsessed by the relationship of class and power. The labouring rebels who march in the Pilgrimage of Grace uprising cry vengeance on the \u201cvile blood\u201d of any lowborn who tries to rule them. In Cromwell\u2019s rearrangement of hierarchies, intelligence is all; those not clever enough to save themselves are not worth sympathy.

Cromwell and Henry\u201d: they step apart from the court to talk alone, needing each other in desperate though different ways. Cromwell\u2019s most vehement love and loyalty, however, belongs to a dead man, Thomas Wolsey: his teacher, employer and elected father.

It\u2019s characteristically bracing of her to consider the horror of finding that one\u2019s life is wrongly told: Cromwell has forced on many victims an \u201cestrangement of self\u201d and suffers in his turn from contortions of evidence, wilful misreadings. Of the book\u2019s many mirrors, this is the most disturbing: the glass in which the truth of your life is stolen away and reconfigured.

Not since <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-bleak-house\" title=\"\">Bleak House</a></em> has the present tense performed such magic.
