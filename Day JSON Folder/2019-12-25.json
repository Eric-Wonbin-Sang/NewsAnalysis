      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been nearly a decade since we last saw Gavin, Stacey and the rest of the Billericay-Barry massive. It feels like a lifetime ago. James Corden and Ruth Jones\u2019s creation was born in and of a different era. Whether it was of stability or complacency you can choose according to taste/experience/political conviction, but it can hardly be argued that it wasn\u2019t a more easeful one either way.</p> <p>Even if you weren\u2019t a fan the first time round, travelling back there now in the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special feels like an hour\u2019s respite, sorely needed. And fans will find much to enjoy.</p> <p>Gavin and Stacey have three children now and, while familiarity has not bred contempt, they are in a bit of a rut. Stacey particularly feels the lack of excitement \u2013 and sex \u2013 in their lives. Not that she isn\u2019t happy with their decision to get kitchen cupboards in the January sales rather than buy each other Christmas presents, you understand.</p> <p>Neil the baby is now a well-upholstered schoolboy. Nessa is \u2013 as Nessa will forever be \u2013 unchanged. We find her putting the finishing touches to a Che Guevara tattoo on a young man\u2019s back. She\u2019s done him wearing shades because she can\u2019t do eyes. As the young man is in deep sexual thrall to her, as well as presumably host to the normal human instinct for self-preservation, he does not complain about this or about her charging him 50% more than the standard rate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ISz1Ps4qd4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-ISz1Ps4qd4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Official trailer for Gavin and Stacey Christmas special</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Smithy is still a reliable presence in her and Neil\u2019s life, but his and Ness\u2019s casual hookups ceased when he took up with a new girlfriend, Sonia, nearly a year ago. \u201cI\u2019ve had the odd scrag end tossed my way on the island,\u201d she tells Stacey, with the weary contempt of a goddess stuck too long among mortals. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t even touch the sides.\u201d Smithy is on the verge of asking Sonia to marry him. No one has met her yet. Gavin worries.</p> <p>It is the Welsh contingent\u2019s turn to host the family festivities this year. For Gavin\u2019s mother Pam, this is akin to being asked to spend the night in a stable, so she is busy trying to pack the contents of her immaculate Essex home into two small bags, insect spray, mattress topper, towels, Bear Grylls survival kit and all. They have only to deal with Dawn and Peter\u2019s latest marital meltdown \u2013 she has found a spliff in his glovebox and assumed a secret heroin addiction. But because Dawn is played by Julia Davis, the whole scene is invested with such unspoken horrors and suffused with such thick dread before the truth is revealed, it is a wonder we don\u2019t all choke on our own primal fears before it\u2019s done. The woman is a witch.</p> <p>In Barry, Bryn is preparing the meal \u201cfor over 13 people!\u201d and putting final touches to his schedule, checking Gwen\u2019s oven dimensions and tracking down the plate-warmer Glenda claims she never borrowed. It\u2019s all go, but we must maintain our faith in Bryn otherwise we have nothing on this earth.</p> <p>There are the traditional array of minor misadventures: Pam forgets to bring the Christmas puddings with her and the replacements from Morrisons are left in the pub, the kids scupper Stacey and Gavin\u2019s attempt to bone, and Bryn incurs an unfair debt of \u00a35 to Dick Powell regarding some bread sauce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46fbda229855437e68369334858ece3f1ae76eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fbda229855437e68369334858ece3f1ae76eb1/0_33_4321_2767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin and Stacey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Down memory lane \u2026 Gavin and Stacey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jackson/BBC/GS TV Productions Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gavin and Stacey\u2019s rut/lack of rutting problems are quickly solved by a trip down memory lane \u2013 or at least round the island \u2013 because their narrative is the main concern in name only. The beating heart of the show remains, as it was always destined to be when two actors write a show, the characters the creators play: Smithy and Ness. </p> <p>After getting drunk in the pub on Christmas Eve, the pair wake up in bed together the next morning. Sonia is due to arrive shortly. Smithy is stricken. Ness tells him nothing happened. Smithy, relieved, sallies forth. Sonia arrives and is awful. Smithy is unrecognisable around her. Ness tells Stacey that they did in fact sleep together. They\u2019re just one of those couples. \u201cWe\u2019re like Hall and Oates. Morecambe and Wise. Mel and Sue.\u201d </p> <p>Sonia is baffled and uncomfortable around the gang and opts to head to her parents\u2019 house earlier than planned. Smithy opts to stay. Ness comes out to talk to him as Sonia drives off. I won\u2019t spoil what happens next except to say that it\u2019s a crackin\u2019 ending. Tidy, you might say. Depending on Smithy\u2019s response, I\u2019m not going to lie, potentially very tidy indeed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been nearly a decade since we last saw Gavin, Stacey and the rest of the Billericay-Barry massive. It feels like a lifetime ago. James Corden and Ruth Jones\u2019s creation was born in and of a different era. Whether it was of stability or complacency you can choose according to taste/experience/political conviction, but it can hardly be argued that it wasn\u2019t a more easeful one either way. Even if you weren\u2019t a fan the first time round, travelling back there now in the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special feels like an hour\u2019s respite, sorely needed. And fans will find much to enjoy. Gavin and Stacey have three children now and, while familiarity has not bred contempt, they are in a bit of a rut. Stacey particularly feels the lack of excitement \u2013 and sex \u2013 in their lives. Not that she isn\u2019t happy with their decision to get kitchen cupboards in the January sales rather than buy each other Christmas presents, you understand. Neil the baby is now a well-upholstered schoolboy. Nessa is \u2013 as Nessa will forever be \u2013 unchanged. We find her putting the finishing touches to a Che Guevara tattoo on a young man\u2019s back. She\u2019s done him wearing shades because she can\u2019t do eyes. As the young man is in deep sexual thrall to her, as well as presumably host to the normal human instinct for self-preservation, he does not complain about this or about her charging him 50% more than the standard rate. Smithy is still a reliable presence in her and Neil\u2019s life, but his and Ness\u2019s casual hookups ceased when he took up with a new girlfriend, Sonia, nearly a year ago. \u201cI\u2019ve had the odd scrag end tossed my way on the island,\u201d she tells Stacey, with the weary contempt of a goddess stuck too long among mortals. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t even touch the sides.\u201d Smithy is on the verge of asking Sonia to marry him. No one has met her yet. Gavin worries. It is the Welsh contingent\u2019s turn to host the family festivities this year. For Gavin\u2019s mother Pam, this is akin to being asked to spend the night in a stable, so she is busy trying to pack the contents of her immaculate Essex home into two small bags, insect spray, mattress topper, towels, Bear Grylls survival kit and all. They have only to deal with Dawn and Peter\u2019s latest marital meltdown \u2013 she has found a spliff in his glovebox and assumed a secret heroin addiction. But because Dawn is played by Julia Davis, the whole scene is invested with such unspoken horrors and suffused with such thick dread before the truth is revealed, it is a wonder we don\u2019t all choke on our own primal fears before it\u2019s done. The woman is a witch. In Barry, Bryn is preparing the meal \u201cfor over 13 people!\u201d and putting final touches to his schedule, checking Gwen\u2019s oven dimensions and tracking down the plate-warmer Glenda claims she never borrowed. It\u2019s all go, but we must maintain our faith in Bryn otherwise we have nothing on this earth. There are the traditional array of minor misadventures: Pam forgets to bring the Christmas puddings with her and the replacements from Morrisons are left in the pub, the kids scupper Stacey and Gavin\u2019s attempt to bone, and Bryn incurs an unfair debt of \u00a35 to Dick Powell regarding some bread sauce. Gavin and Stacey\u2019s rut/lack of rutting problems are quickly solved by a trip down memory lane \u2013 or at least round the island \u2013 because their narrative is the main concern in name only. The beating heart of the show remains, as it was always destined to be when two actors write a show, the characters the creators play: Smithy and Ness. After getting drunk in the pub on Christmas Eve, the pair wake up in bed together the next morning. Sonia is due to arrive shortly. Smithy is stricken. Ness tells him nothing happened. Smithy, relieved, sallies forth. Sonia arrives and is awful. Smithy is unrecognisable around her. Ness tells Stacey that they did in fact sleep together. They\u2019re just one of those couples. \u201cWe\u2019re like Hall and Oates. Morecambe and Wise. Mel and Sue.\u201d Sonia is baffled and uncomfortable around the gang and opts to head to her parents\u2019 house earlier than planned. Smithy opts to stay. Ness comes out to talk to him as Sonia drives off. I won\u2019t spoil what happens next except to say that it\u2019s a crackin\u2019 ending. Tidy, you might say. Depending on Smithy\u2019s response, I\u2019m not going to lie, potentially very tidy indeed.",

      "bodyText": "Aside from being one of the world\u2019s greatest composers of experimental music, John Cage was a man obsessed with mushrooms who supplied New York restaurants with foraged fungi. Before creating Peter Rabbit, Mrs Puddle-Duck and Timmy Tiptoes, Beatrix Potter\u2019s big passion was looking through microscopes to investigate the germination process of fungal spores and painting mushrooms as accurately as possible. Today, according to the curator of a new art exhibition, artists are more interested in fungi than ever before. Francesca Gavin has gathered together works by 35 artists, designers and musicians to explore the world of mushrooms for a show opening in January at Somerset House in London. She was drawn to the subject because she kept spotting mushrooms in art and wanted to know more. \u201cI just noticed mushrooms popping up everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cI just kept seeing them in art over the past 50 years, but even more in the past three years. I then kind of fell into a mushroom wormhole \u2026 there is so much enthusiasm for mushrooms and so much innovation. \u201cEveryone loves a mushroom, it makes people happy. There is something light-hearted to it and perhaps it\u2019s an antidote to a lot of the conceptualism of contemporary art.\u201d Gavin has unearthed some fascinating stories for the exhibition. For example, Cage\u2019s lifelong interest in mushrooms, which led him to reviving the New York Mycological Society in the 1950s. To make some extra money he also supplied hotels including the Four Seasons with mushrooms he foraged in upstate New York. \u201cHe\u2019s actually better known in Italy for his love of mushrooms than he is for his music, which I think is amazing,\u201d said Gavin. For Cage, it was as much about the foraging as it was the mushroom. \u201cIf you think about the peacefulness and space in his work, I think that was very much connected with his love of foraging,\u201d she said. Going on display will be a rare mushroom book he published with the mycologist Alexander H Smith and illustrator Lois Long, which includes Cage\u2019s poetry and handwritten notes on the the subject. Cage\u2019s passion and interest in mycology will be a surprise to many, as will Potter\u2019s. Over the course of a decade, before she found fame as a writer, Potter completed about 300 fungi and lichen paintings in startling detail. \u201cThey are just so beautiful,\u201d said Gavin. \u201cShe was very young when she was doing them \u2026 you can see her children\u2019s books as an extension of making narratives around that connection to nature.\u201d Potter also studied fungi under a microscope and presented a paper, On the germination of the spores of Agaricineae, to the Linnean Society of London in 1897. Other mushroom-loving artists in the show include Cy Twombly, represented by prints of a quasi-scientific series he made in 1974 called Natural History Part I, Mushrooms. Contemporary works in the show include a three-dimensional papier mache and embroidered sculpture by the textile artist Amanda Cobbett; a William Morris-inspired oil painting by Alex Morrison entitled Mushroom Motif (Black and Ochre); and an autumnal woodland scene by Graham Little, Untitled (Wood) 2019. Work by designers include a biodegradable mushroom burial suit by Jae Rhim Lee, which aims to reduce the environmental cost of the funeral industry, and a mycelium high-heeled shoe by the Belgian shoe designer Kristel Peters. Gavin said she had learned much since she began research for the show and lots of fascinating mushroom facts would be included.

The revelation at the heart of this story \u2013 that extreme heat is compounding these problems and could mean Indigenous people will become Australia\u2019s first \u201cclimate refugees\u201d \u2013 is startling, and should be a wake-up call for state and federal governments.</p> \n<p>But this isn\u2019t the first time these communities have faced forced migration from their home. The Pintupi people, first driven out by the government, are now facing a future where their home is rendered \u201cunliveable\u201d due to extreme heat.</p> \n<p>This really is incredible reporting by Lorena, and a gripping story, where the climate crisis meets poor policy and systemic discrimination.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"37f62a51-4299-48dd-8a63-5721558ee516\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Bridie Jabour, opinion editor: the truth about ageing</h2> \n<p>Narrative journalism is, of course, supposed to make you think \u2013 but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/oct/23/what-is-it-about-ageing-that-is-so-confronting\">episode on ageing</a> with Lucy Clark and Charlotte Wood literally stopped me in the street.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/14/the-weekend-by-charlotte-wood-friendships-fracture-in-moving-feminist-fairytale\">Wood\u2019s new novel, The Weekend</a>, tells the story of three women in their 70s who come together after their mutual friend has died. This book was the jumping-off point for the episode, but the conversation delved much deeper. I haven\u2019t heard women speak so frankly about the small terrors of getting older and how it can change friendships \u2013 but also what there could be to look forward to.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t a traditional \u201cnews\u201d episode but I was so struck by it I stopped walking so I could listen properly.

It begins with a recording of the last phone call between David, a 26-year old Dunghutti man and prisoner in Long Bay jail, and his sister Cynthia.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right but, eh?\u201d Cynthia says.</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m right,\u201d David responds.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeing strong?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah, being strong.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cRing up tomorrow?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201c... alright then sis I\u2019ll ring tomorrow. Love ya.\u201d</p> \n<p>That same day, Corrective Services stormed David\u2019s cell while he was eating a packet of biscuits and, six minutes later, he was dead. The Guardian followed David\u2019s family\u2019s quest for justice for three years, and this episode brings together the most important moments from the Breathless podcast and our reporting on the case.

      "bodyText": "Full Story: Guardian Australia\u2019s tri-weekly podcast was launched in October, featuring the best of Guardian Australia\u2019s reporting \u2013 and the stories behind the scoops. If you\u2019re not sure where to start, or if you\u2019ve missed a few, Guardian staff have picked their favourite episodes for your summer road trips. You can subscribe to Full Story free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or any other podcasting app. Lenore Taylor, editor: Robodebt is preying on the vulnerable In this early episode, Luke Henriques-Gomes was able to clearly explain the human cost of this deeply flawed policy because he had been doggedly pursuing it for years. The episode includes audio tape from one robodebt recipient, Clare, and her Kafkaesque battle with the bureaucracy as she tried to get some answers. Luke\u2019s analysis and explanation and Clare\u2019s recordings combined to allow listeners to really understand the harm this policy was causing. Katharine Murphy, political editor: Facebook is a hate factory As a group of reporters, we\u2019ve done a lot of work this year on Facebook and the impact digital platforms are having on democracy and political discussion. This episode unfurls a forensic investigation \u2013 by Chris Knaus, Michael McGowan and Nick Evershed in Australia, and Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem \u2013 into the commercialisation of hate on Facebook. The episode documents an important story, but what I love about this particular pod is it shows our methods. This is old-fashioned, shoe-leather journalism conducted in the digital age, and listeners are invited along for the ride. Laura Murphy-Oates, Full Story host: Central Australia is becoming too hot for humans This episode \u2013 about extreme heat in the central desert, reported by Indigenous affairs editor Lorena Allam \u2013 is an important explainer on issues that have plagued Indigenous communities in the central desert for decades, such as poor housing, overcrowding and chronic health conditions. The revelation at the heart of this story \u2013 that extreme heat is compounding these problems and could mean Indigenous people will become Australia\u2019s first \u201cclimate refugees\u201d \u2013 is startling, and should be a wake-up call for state and federal governments. But this isn\u2019t the first time these communities have faced forced migration from their home. The Pintupi people, first driven out by the government, are now facing a future where their home is rendered \u201cunliveable\u201d due to extreme heat. This really is incredible reporting by Lorena, and a gripping story, where the climate crisis meets poor policy and systemic discrimination. Bridie Jabour, opinion editor: the truth about ageing Narrative journalism is, of course, supposed to make you think \u2013 but the episode on ageing with Lucy Clark and Charlotte Wood literally stopped me in the street. Wood\u2019s new novel, The Weekend, tells the story of three women in their 70s who come together after their mutual friend has died. This book was the jumping-off point for the episode, but the conversation delved much deeper. I haven\u2019t heard women speak so frankly about the small terrors of getting older and how it can change friendships \u2013 but also what there could be to look forward to. It wasn\u2019t a traditional \u201cnews\u201d episode but I was so struck by it I stopped walking so I could listen properly. It made me look at the people around me differently. Josephine Tovey, associate news editor and columnist: what is it like when someone you love dies in prison? From the opening minutes of this episode about the death in custody of David Dungay Jnr, I could feel my insides start to crumple. It begins with a recording of the last phone call between David, a 26-year old Dunghutti man and prisoner in Long Bay jail, and his sister Cynthia. \u201cYou\u2019re right but, eh?\u201d Cynthia says. \u201cYeah I\u2019m right,\u201d David responds. \u201cBeing strong?\u201d \u201cYeah, being strong.\u201d \u201cRing up tomorrow?\u201d \u201c... alright then sis I\u2019ll ring tomorrow. Love ya.\u201d That same day, Corrective Services stormed David\u2019s cell while he was eating a packet of biscuits and, six minutes later, he was dead. The Guardian followed David\u2019s family\u2019s quest for justice for three years, and this episode brings together the most important moments from the Breathless podcast and our reporting on the case. Sensitively told by reporter Miles Herbert, this story is both deeply intimate \u2013 taking us into the Dungay family\u2019s sorrow and anger - while also tapping into a critical wider global story about the Black Lives Matter movement. Gabrielle Jackson: what\u2019s the big deal about birds? This is my favourite \u2013 not because Bird of the Year is like Christmas to me (only better) but for the surprising emotional journey it took me on. What I love about this episode is that it exposes listeners to real joy \u2013 and sadness \u2013 while maintaining an important message. I loved the listeners who rang in to tell us their bird stories: the woman who saw a magpie flying around with a golf ball in its mouth; the man who got chased by emus; the woman whose bird friend loved shiny things and brought her a carving knife as a gift. The episode made me laugh out loud (listen out for BirdLife Australia editor Sean Dooley\u2019s red-carpet moment) and also cry \u2013 you will never forget the listener who shares a story of a letter written to him by his mother. This episode made me cherish Australia\u2019s natural history \u2013 its abundant, rare and beautiful birdlife \u2013 and showed me how our relationship with these birds could very well be the antidote to the anxious times we live in. Steph Harmon, culture editor: Fatbergs are disgusting \u201cI went underground, deep into Sydney\u2019s wastewater, to try and find a fatberg in the wild,\u201d begins Naaman Zhou. What follows is 15 minutes of fascinating, distressing detail about the giant, congealed balls of filth, fat and wet wipes that are clogging our sewers \u2013 the musk of which Zhou describes using a perplexing intersection of rating systems: \u201c6 our of 10 on the smell scale\u201d or \u201cthree or four dog poos\u201d. I learned a lot: that Will Smith and Will.I.Am are partially responsible; that sewerage staff can be colourfully described as \u201cfatberg spelunkers\u201d; and that normal disposable toilet paper isn\u2019t good enough for precious young men, who have been wiping their butts with moistened fabric instead.",

It\u2019s about \u201chelping Melbourne reconnect to its hidden treasures,\u201d Fletcher says.</p> <p>The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people are the traditional owners of the Bulleen and Heidelberg area, which was connected to Melbourne through the Birrarung river system. The Melbourne area was once so lush with waterways and bushland that palaeontologist and conservationist Tim Flannery likened it to a \u201ctemperate Kakadu\u201d.</p> <p>The billabong off Bulleen Road, now bordered by sporting fields, golf courses and roads, was part of a vast system flowing out from the Birrarung \u2013 the Yarra river.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to conjure what has been lost. Where Crown Casino sits today \u201cwas a giant swamp\u201d, Fletcher says. \u201cThere was a waterfall where Elizabeth Street flows into the Yarra, and where Spencer Street was, there was actually a rock bar across the river.\u201d</p> <p>Yarra \u201cimprovement\u201d works in the late 1800s, at the height of the gold-rush expansion of \u201cmarvellous Melbourne\u201d, severed the Bolin Bolin billabong and others like it from the river. Natural flooding was interrupting day-to-day life as the city grew, Fletcher says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b430c98460e10664ce356d8faec28d590b6b6f34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b430c98460e10664ce356d8faec28d590b6b6f34/0_73_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Michael Fletcher cuts one of the cores with a knife\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Michael Fletcher cuts one of the cores with a knife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Banister</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This billabong is one of five that remain in urban Melbourne.

Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elders including Wandin and Alice Kolasa, and water and land managers from the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung cultural heritage corporation, join the scientists in the field to discuss the coring and analysis.</p> <p>They focus their attention on the first core. A full laboratory analysis will take about six months and involve high-tech geothermal scanning. But this core already tells the story of the billabong\u2019s post-colonial decline.</p> <p>The top section \u2013 containing the most recent sediment \u2013 looks more like tar than earth.

I think this black muck is going to be post-British kind of pollution. It really stinks, and it\u2019s just yuck.\u201d</p> <p>Wandin is a key fire knowledge holder and helped to develop the Victorian traditional owners\u2019 cultural fire strategy. He hopes the analysis of charcoal within the core will provide clues about traditional Indigenous practices in burning and managing the site. This could inform the use of fire to promote natural regeneration around the billabong, rather than relying on chemicals to control weeds.</p> <p>\u201cI look at a landscape and try and imagine what it was \u2026 and that\u2019s going to give me information,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll find out from the charcoal in this the frequency of burning and the type of burning.\u201d</p> <p>Fletcher and Wandin discuss how the area around the billabong has become cluttered with trees and wild undergrowth. They point to one enormous red gum which shows the changes that have played out. It branches outwards, rather than upwards \u2013 a sign it grew in a much more open landscape, not among today\u2019s closely grown \u201cmess\u201d, as Wandin describes it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2019/dec/02/theres-a-new-push-for-the-return-of-looted-aboriginal-artefacts-in-the-name-of-truth-telling\">There's a new push for the return of looted Aboriginal artefacts \u2013 in the name of 'truth telling' | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Listening in on this exchange is Delta Lucille Freedman, project manager for the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung corporation, who is conducting a cultural values study of the Bulleen-Banyule Flats area on behalf of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning.

Because non-Indigenous settlers were already on the land, Nerre Nerre Warren reserve was chosen instead, but the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung continued to live in the area and practiced their traditions on this land until they were moved onto Acheron Station in 1859.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were kicked out, we weren\u2019t allowed to go back down into the city,\u201d Wandin says. \u201cThis is sort of the closest where we felt comfortable, where we weren\u2019t really interfering.\u201d </p> <p>The Bolin Bolin billabong was an important area for ceremonies and dances involving neighbouring clans, a gathering place, and had an ecosystem that could support between 300 and 500 people, he says. The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people would have fished for eels by burning the reeds in the still water here, knowing they would congregate in the warm shallows. They could then be fished with a spear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca6dac55ed460727e8cd02a9aa497588172405f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca6dac55ed460727e8cd02a9aa497588172405f0/0_73_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geographer Dr Michael Shawn Fletcher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geographer Dr Michael Shawn Fletcher at the Bolin Bolin billabong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Banister</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a day spa for an eel,\u201d Wandin jokes. They would have come here to shed fat and then migrated north in their epic journey to the saltwater of the Coral Sea to breed. In running water, the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung would have used stone eel traps, a common practice across Victorian Aboriginal groups.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks beautiful, it looks nice and green \u2013 but it\u2019s not its natural landscape,\u201d Wandin says. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean we just leave it alone and do nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWe call it caring for country today, but it\u2019s caring for our mother \u2026 she nurtured us, she nurtured our ancestors and she\u2019ll continue to nurture us if we look after her in the way that she\u2019s been looked after for tens of thousands of years.\u201d<br></p>",

A team of geographers gather on the shores of the brown and shallow Bolin Bolin billabong, a stone\u2019s throw from modern Melbourne but a world away, where the dull roar of traffic fades behind the warbling of magpies and the rustle of the breeze through the trees. The fragile tranquility is broken as the scientists fire up an electric drill and get to work. Led by Wiradjuri man Dr Michael Fletcher, a renowned geographer from the University of Melbourne, the team constructs a pontoon, which they then float to the centre of the billabong. From there, Fletcher and his crew will drill and extract four sediment cores from beneath the still water. Inside these muddy cores are clues about the hidden, potent history of this place stretching back several millennia. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to really reimagine Melbourne, as it was prior to British invasion and under Aboriginal management,\u201d Fletcher says. By analysing the sediment \u2013 from the traces of pollen, and layers of charcoal and organic matter, to the DNA of lost creatures and micro-organisms \u2013 with the local Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elders and community, Fletcher will add to the collective knowledge of this secluded spot. This coring exercise is phase one of a research program using scientific and Indigenous knowledge to document remnant billabongs across Melbourne. It\u2019s about \u201chelping Melbourne reconnect to its hidden treasures,\u201d Fletcher says. The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people are the traditional owners of the Bulleen and Heidelberg area, which was connected to Melbourne through the Birrarung river system. The Melbourne area was once so lush with waterways and bushland that palaeontologist and conservationist Tim Flannery likened it to a \u201ctemperate Kakadu\u201d. The billabong off Bulleen Road, now bordered by sporting fields, golf courses and roads, was part of a vast system flowing out from the Birrarung \u2013 the Yarra river. It\u2019s hard to conjure what has been lost. Where Crown Casino sits today \u201cwas a giant swamp\u201d, Fletcher says. \u201cThere was a waterfall where Elizabeth Street flows into the Yarra, and where Spencer Street was, there was actually a rock bar across the river.\u201d Yarra \u201cimprovement\u201d works in the late 1800s, at the height of the gold-rush expansion of \u201cmarvellous Melbourne\u201d, severed the Bolin Bolin billabong and others like it from the river. Natural flooding was interrupting day-to-day life as the city grew, Fletcher says. This billabong is one of five that remain in urban Melbourne. With the rest long since filled in or turned into tips by colonisers, this place is all the more precious, providing an \u201cecological window into what the billabong system used to look like\u201d, Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elder Uncle Dave Wandin says. Fletcher has studied many similar sites across Australia, and observes that the removal of Aboriginal land management after colonisation led to ecosystems becoming less diverse and less healthy. By midday, he has collected the first of four cores, after rowing out to the pontoon with his crew and using a two-metre-long metal stick to push a clear plastic tube deep into the earth beneath the metre-deep water. Back on shore, he holds the long-buried treasure. Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elders including Wandin and Alice Kolasa, and water and land managers from the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung cultural heritage corporation, join the scientists in the field to discuss the coring and analysis. They focus their attention on the first core. A full laboratory analysis will take about six months and involve high-tech geothermal scanning. But this core already tells the story of the billabong\u2019s post-colonial decline. The top section \u2013 containing the most recent sediment \u2013 looks more like tar than earth. There\u2019s a distinct change in colour about a third of the way down, from deep, jet black to a lighter, healthier brown. \u201cThere\u2019s a definite change from here,\u201d Fletcher says, pointing to the bottom of the tube, \u201cinto this really black muck. I think this black muck is going to be post-British kind of pollution. It really stinks, and it\u2019s just yuck.\u201d Wandin is a key fire knowledge holder and helped to develop the Victorian traditional owners\u2019 cultural fire strategy. He hopes the analysis of charcoal within the core will provide clues about traditional Indigenous practices in burning and managing the site. This could inform the use of fire to promote natural regeneration around the billabong, rather than relying on chemicals to control weeds. \u201cI look at a landscape and try and imagine what it was \u2026 and that\u2019s going to give me information,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll find out from the charcoal in this the frequency of burning and the type of burning.\u201d Fletcher and Wandin discuss how the area around the billabong has become cluttered with trees and wild undergrowth. They point to one enormous red gum which shows the changes that have played out. It branches outwards, rather than upwards \u2013 a sign it grew in a much more open landscape, not among today\u2019s closely grown \u201cmess\u201d, as Wandin describes it. Listening in on this exchange is Delta Lucille Freedman, project manager for the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung corporation, who is conducting a cultural values study of the Bulleen-Banyule Flats area on behalf of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. What she hears resonates with archival material from Melbourne surveyor Robert Hoddle and pastoral holders, who frequently wrote that this landscape was a thinly wooded grassland. Observations of broader Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung country indicate it was burnt in the warmer months. The grasses are now pasture grasses rather than native ones, which has an impact on insect health. If the seeds of the old vegetation can be sourced, significant replanting could be undertaken by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Narrap rangers, an Indigenous land management team. \u201cFrom an anthropological perspective, it was not a natural landscape but a cultural landscape that was shaped over millennia by Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung beliefs, traditions and land management,\u201d she says. Back in 1840, in the early days of colonisation, Woi Wurrung people made a request to the Port Phillip Aboriginal protectorate for a permanent reserve to be established in this area. Because non-Indigenous settlers were already on the land, Nerre Nerre Warren reserve was chosen instead, but the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung continued to live in the area and practiced their traditions on this land until they were moved onto Acheron Station in 1859. \u201cWhen we were kicked out, we weren\u2019t allowed to go back down into the city,\u201d Wandin says. \u201cThis is sort of the closest where we felt comfortable, where we weren\u2019t really interfering.\u201d The Bolin Bolin billabong was an important area for ceremonies and dances involving neighbouring clans, a gathering place, and had an ecosystem that could support between 300 and 500 people, he says. The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people would have fished for eels by burning the reeds in the still water here, knowing they would congregate in the warm shallows. They could then be fished with a spear. \u201cIt\u2019s like a day spa for an eel,\u201d Wandin jokes. They would have come here to shed fat and then migrated north in their epic journey to the saltwater of the Coral Sea to breed. In running water, the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung would have used stone eel traps, a common practice across Victorian Aboriginal groups. \u201cIt looks beautiful, it looks nice and green \u2013 but it\u2019s not its natural landscape,\u201d Wandin says. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean we just leave it alone and do nothing. \u201cWe call it caring for country today, but it\u2019s caring for our mother \u2026 she nurtured us, she nurtured our ancestors and she\u2019ll continue to nurture us if we look after her in the way that she\u2019s been looked after for tens of thousands of years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stan\u2019s eight-part Australian drama The Commons is based in \u201cthe not-so-distant future\u201d \u2013 a familiar turn of phrase to describe story worlds similar to our own in many respects but strikingly different in others. It is set in a climate crisis-devastated Sydney, where the air is a sickly shade of orange and extreme weather conditions pose all sorts of problems \u2013 making the show\u2019s arrival uncomfortably well-timed, perhaps, given the 2019 bushfires and increased discourse about the relationship between extreme weather and global heating. The first episode opens with a dream sequence in which a heavily pregnant protagonist, Eadie (Joanne Froggatt from Downton Abbey), runs desperately through an empty hospital and into a beautiful garden. There her water breaks, bats fall from the sky and her pregnant belly suddenly disappears; she clutches the ground and howls in pain. The director, Jeffrey Walker, and the writer, Shelley Birse (also the show\u2019s creator), use this moment to establish the protagonist\u2019s complicated feelings towards having a baby \u2013 she is desperate to have one, as we soon discover \u2013 as well as hinting at some of the surreal properties of this not-so-distant environment. The garden is a significant, bittersweet location going forward: a place of tranquility and refuge for the characters, and a reminder of things that have been lost for the audience. With its lush greens and brightly coloured plants, it reminded me of Bruce Dern\u2019s space garden in the classic 1972 film Silent Running and the lovely greenhouse in Claire Denis\u2019s cerebral Robbert Pattinson-led sci-fi High Life. But The Commons\u2019 garden is different in that it merges nature and artifice. When we get a better look at it later we see that plants are combined with digital scaffolding: a huge wall of television screens, projecting footage of a waterfall, which is Baudrillardian conceit: the natural world as a simulation and vice versa. Eadie, a neuropsychologist, takes one of her patients here for treatment. He is Ben (Damon \u201che\u2019s everywhere at the moment\u201d Herriman), a distressed \u201cBorder Authority officer\u201d grappling with traumatic experiences working in what seems to be, in effect, a border control unit dealing with the movement of climate refugees within Australia. Eadie is supposed to be a gifted neuropsychologist, though her techniques seemed a little hokey to me \u2013 involving putting headsets on patients and plonking them on to a black leather chair in front of a large dome-like circular screen that projects visions from inside their heads. With a budget of about $25m (Stan\u2019s most expensive production so far), The Commons engages in a constant process of world-building \u2013 or maybe \u201cworld-altering\u201d is a better way to describe it \u2013 examining what the writers\u2019 (Birse, Matt Ford, Michael Miller and Matt Cameron) envisioned changes to society will mean for our day-to-day lives. One close-up shot early on homes in on a drop of acid rain falling from the sky and into the eyeball of Eadie\u2019s 13-year-old daughter-in-law (Inez Curr\u00f2), whose face turns swollen and red. In this world, rain acidity predictions are a normal part of weather forecasts. Other unsettlingly plausible daily occurrences include drones whizzing around the streets checking on people using facial recognition systems. There are several key narrative threads, including a subplot involving the spread of diseases (such as Chagas disease), which are prospering in a dramatically hotter climate. This thread involves Eadie\u2019s husband, Lloyd (David Lyons), and his best friend, Shay (Ryan Corr), who are lab rats finding ways to combat the diseases. Eadie\u2019s desire to have a child \u2013 having been unable to conceive one with Lloyd \u2013 is the show\u2019s emotional core, with all roads leading back to that intro dream sequence. I found it odd that Birse doesn\u2019t explore the ethics of having a baby in an intensely overpopulated, damaged and diseased-riddled world (the BirthStrike movement is populated by climate-conscious women in our own reality who refuse to have babies). Maybe that comes later; this review only encompasses the first two episodes. This limited view of the series makes it hard to review with any authority, given that The Commons is clearly still configuring its core elements at this point in the narrative. I won\u2019t be surprised if Birse and the directors (Walker, Rowan Woods and Jennifer Leacey) reach some thrilling dramatic conclusions.

Up to 50 convicted New IRA and other violent dissident republicans are incarcerated in Maghaberry. They are segregated in the jail on the outskirts of Belfast from a smaller number of convicted loyalist paramilitaries. The Northern Ireland Humanists group, which is part of Humanists UK, recruited two trained non-religious pastoral carers after gaining permission from the regional Department of Justice this year to enter Maghaberry. A Criminal Justice Inspection report in 2019 into Maghaberry prison found that after Christians, inmates who identify as having \u201cno religion\u201d make up the largest group of the jail\u2019s population. One of the new carers for atheist inmates, Ciaran McWilliams, said his work for two decades as a shop steward in a Belfast factory was \u201cperfect training\u201d for dealing with the prisoners.

Currently, 1m homes in the UK have a higher than 1% chance of flooding in any given year, and recent months have shown the devastating impact of flooding on households and businesses.</p> <p>Looking beyond what the effective emergency response is, we must do more to plan how to adapt to climate change and not continue with the current cycle of reactive funding that typically follows floods.</p> <p>Our National Infrastructure Assessment, published in July 2018, provides a blueprint for a stable, long-term funding programme.

      "bodyText": "The call by leaders from the north and Midlands for an overhaul of how flood defence activity is funded and organised (Report, 23 December) will strike a chord with many across the country. Currently, 1m homes in the UK have a higher than 1% chance of flooding in any given year, and recent months have shown the devastating impact of flooding on households and businesses. Looking beyond what the effective emergency response is, we must do more to plan how to adapt to climate change and not continue with the current cycle of reactive funding that typically follows floods. Our National Infrastructure Assessment, published in July 2018, provides a blueprint for a stable, long-term funding programme. The government\u2019s commitment to increase funding by \u00a34bn over five years is a good start, but we need to be clear about what we want to achieve. To this end, the commission has recommended a nationwide flood resilience standard by 2050, to reduce the likelihood of flooding across the country. Such an approach would avoid the present flood resilience postcode lottery and empower local communities to engage in the decision-making process on what forms of mitigation and adaptation work best in their particular context. The government\u2019s national infrastructure strategy is to be published with the next budget. We call on ministers to use this opportunity to endorse these proposals and ensure the UK is better protected against flood risks. Kate Barker Commissioner, National Infrastructure Commission \u2022 In recent years I have carried out research in New Orleans (post-Hurricane Katrina) and on the Somerset Levels (post-2014), and since then I have read many reports on behalf of residents who have experienced the horrors of being flooded. It is with dismay that I find a simple fundamental fact about rivers being consistently ignored: rivers love to move and wander. At times, and in certain places, they also love to flood. A beautiful benefit we gain from that is the wonderful landscapes we like to live among or visit, and to say things such as \u201cWow! Isn\u2019t that a beautiful sight to behold?\u201d Another benefit is the dispersion of fluvial silts on to agricultural land and the dispersion of essential vegetative seed life. Once we begin to try to control rivers, telling them where we think they should go and restrain their natural course, we are asking for catastrophe \u2013 or at least catastrophe for succeeding generations. So let me add my voice to a growing body of research that calls for the safest and cheapest flood defence policy: namely to respect rainfalls\u2019 and rivers\u2019 natural instincts, to stop building on floodplains, to let homes have gardens as soakaways and to exercise more wisdom and less hubris. In short, cut out political short-termism, curtail the construction industry\u2019s lust for building wherever it can find space, listen to what the climate is screaming at us and implement radical changes to flood prevention that will save lives and livelihoods for generations to come.

The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organisation, has accused Mr Orb\u00e1n of systematically denying food to failed asylum seekers held in detention camps on Hungary\u2019s border \u2013 an action it described as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/hungary-denying-food-to-asylum-seekers-say-human-rights-groups\" title=\"\">an unprecedented human rights violation in 21st-century Europe</a>.\u201d He has also made homelessness a criminal offence.</p> <p>Mr Orb\u00e1n discovered a religious side in his 30s, as the political party he led, Fidesz, moved to the right. In Italy, the leader of the League party, Matteo Salvini, uses Christianity to pursue culture wars relating to migration and national identity. When Mr Salvini, as minister of the interior in Italy\u2019s previous government, proposed in 2018 that crucifixes should be displayed in all Italian public spaces, including ports he had closed to vessels carrying rescued migrants, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/26/pope-francis-adviser-decries-matteo-salvini-policy-on-crucifix\" title=\"\">reprimanded by a close adviser</a> of Pope Francis.

These include those that are unregulated or not registered with Ofsted.</p> <p>MPs, the police, charities and the children\u2019s commissioner warn that children accommodated in these homes are at risk of exploitation from sexual predators and drug gangs.</p> <p>An investigation has found:</p> <p>\u2022 The number of times children were housed in unregulated accommodation \u2013 which means they faced no checks by Ofsted, which typically inspects homes \u2013 rose by 22% between 2016-17 and 2018-19. The number increased from 4,814 to 5,874, according to data obtained from 112 councils through freedom of information requests.</p> <p>\u2022 The number of times children were placed in unregistered homes rose from 129 to 212 in the same period.</p> <p>\u2022 The average annual cost of placements was between \u00a39,714 a year and \u00a3364,980, meaning the total bill across all authorities is likely to run into the millions.</p> <p>\u2022 In Northamptonshire, where a recent <a href=\"https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50096453\">Ofsted report</a> found the Conservative-run county council was failing to keep children safe, 360 young people were placed in semi-independent-living accommodation not subject to children\u2019s homes regulations in 2018-19, up from 348 two years previously.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of children in care are increasingly being placed in homes that are illegal or unregulated, in what critics have labelled a national scandal, a Guardian investigation has found. A lack of places to house vulnerable children in the UK is prompting a surge in placements that are less safe. These include those that are unregulated or not registered with Ofsted. MPs, the police, charities and the children\u2019s commissioner warn that children accommodated in these homes are at risk of exploitation from sexual predators and drug gangs. An investigation has found: \u2022 The number of times children were housed in unregulated accommodation \u2013 which means they faced no checks by Ofsted, which typically inspects homes \u2013 rose by 22% between 2016-17 and 2018-19. The number increased from 4,814 to 5,874, according to data obtained from 112 councils through freedom of information requests. \u2022 The number of times children were placed in unregistered homes rose from 129 to 212 in the same period. \u2022 The average annual cost of placements was between \u00a39,714 a year and \u00a3364,980, meaning the total bill across all authorities is likely to run into the millions. \u2022 In Northamptonshire, where a recent Ofsted report found the Conservative-run county council was failing to keep children safe, 360 young people were placed in semi-independent-living accommodation not subject to children\u2019s homes regulations in 2018-19, up from 348 two years previously. Of the 360, 36 placements were outside of the local authority area. The children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said placing children in unregulated homes was \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d. Referring to unregistered placements, she said despite some providers having good intentions, all \u201cunregistered provision is \u2026 not acceptable as a care package for vulnerable children\u201d. She said: \u201cI understand that there is a serious shortage of accommodation for older children in care but on their behalf we should never accept anything less than genuinely high-quality caring places that would pass appropriate levels of scrutiny. This is another example of managing a crisis not finding a solution to a crisis. These children deserve better from us all.\u201d Her words were echoed by Ann Coffey, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for runaway and missing children. She said: \u201cThe government must act and make it unlawful for local authorities to place children in these illegal settings and Ofsted should take immediate action to close down these homes. \u201cIt cannot be right that they are being placed in care settings with minimum checks on who is providing the accommodation. It\u2019s a national scandal.\u201d Unregulated provision is essentially when children, usually over the age of 16, need support to live independently rather than needing full-time care. It is often called a \u201csemi-independent placement\u201d and is allowed in law, although Ofsted does not regulate it. Unregistered provision that claims to offer any form of \u201ccare\u201d as opposed to just support is illegal. However, there is no legal definition of what care means, which provides a loophole that can be exploited. In some instances, children in these kinds of placements have been placed by councils in accommodation including on boats or in caravans. A recent parliamentary inquiry into the issue of children being used to traffic drugs found that 80% of 41 police forces in England and Wales expressed concern about unregulated accommodation. Issues raised included children being left isolated and targeted by those wishing to exploit them for sex or to sell drugs. One girl who had been sexually exploited was housed with a perpetrator of child sexual exploitation. Iryna Pona, the policy manager from the Children\u2019s Society, said cuts to social services had resulted in many councils not having enough placements available locally. \u201cAnd there is an increasing number of children with complex needs being taken into care,\u201d she said. \u201cVulnerable teenagers placed in unregulated accommodation are at risk of being groomed for sexual and criminal exploitation. Our research has shown that teenagers may be housed with vulnerable adults and be exposed to or groomed with drugs and alcohol, they may also go missing and be subject to physical violence and verbal abuse. \u201cThe quality of accommodation and support provided in these types of placements varies greatly from one place to another and from one area to another. Staff often aren\u2019t sufficiently trained in protecting young people from criminal and sexual exploitation.\u201d Katharine Sacks-Jones, the chief executive of Become, the national charity for children in care and young care leavers, said: \u201cThe rise in children being placed in these homes is deeply concerning \u2026 They can be magnets for criminals, leaving vulnerable children at heightened risk of sexual and criminal exploitation such as county lines.\u201d Sacks-Jones said a comprehensive review of the care system was needed to understand and address why more children were being placed in these homes. Andrew Parry, the portfolio holder for children, education and learning at Dorset council, said it used unregistered provision when there were not sufficient registered placements to support children and young people with very complex needs. He said the placements were generally time-limited, with regular visits made by the authority to monitor care . \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to use unregistered placements and are currently in the process of registering all the provision we\u2019re using.\u201d Of the 109 councils that responded to the Guardian\u2019s freedom of information requests, Kent county council said it used unregulated accommodation the most frequently. It recorded 452 placements in 2016-17, 312 the following year and 326 in 2018-19. Sarah Hammond, the director of children\u2019s social services at Kent county council, said its commissioning team undertook its own inspections of accommodation for looked-after children before contracts were signed. \u201cWe pay for quite a substantial amount of support \u2013 some young people in these places are having upwards of 35 hours of support each week,\u201d she said. In Northamptonshire, where the number of unregulated placements was similarly high, the council said the figures could include those aged 18 waiting for permanent housing. \u201cNorthamptonshire does receive a relatively high number of unaccompanied asylum seeking children because of its location,\u201d it said. \u201cThe county council carries out thorough quality checks on providers.\u201d Yvette Stanley, Ofsted\u2019s national director for social care, said: \u201cOver the last 12 months we\u2019ve investigated 150 places that were not registered with us and when we went out and looked, only 30 need not register with us \u2013 the rest should have done. She added that councils were less likely to run thorough checks on provisions when a child needed to be urgently placed elsewhere, but emphasised that Ofsted had recently improved its system for notifying them about unregistered homes. Stanley also noted that there had been an increase in the use of supported accommodation because of progressive policies \u2013 including that fewer child criminals were being placed in secure units and those who were previously inpatients in mental health hospitals were being cared for in the community. \u201cThe strategic issue at the heart of this very challenging problem is with the lack of supply, some people with good intentions some with bad intentions are opening provisions to meet that need,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see councils doing this to save money, we see councils doing this because they have tried.

      "bodyText": "The royal family was out in force in a public show of Christmas unity as the Queen dwelt on the themes of friendship and reconciliation in her annual message and acknowledged a \u201cquite bumpy\u201d path during a turbulent year for both the monarchy and the nation. The beleaguered Duke of York joined other members of the family for the traditional celebrations at Sandringham in Norfolk in his first appearance since he was forced to step down from official royal duties over his friendship with convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. Hundreds of royal fans gathered outside St Mary Magdalene church on the royal estate to watch the royals arrive and depart the main 11am service. The Queen was driven the short distance to the church, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Andrew did not attend that 11am service. But before the crowds were allowed in, he was seen walking side by side with his brother Prince Charles to an earlier private 9am service also attended by the Queen and other royals. Andrew\u2019s presence was clear acknowledgement of his family\u2019s firm support following his catastrophic TV interview with Emily Maitlis, and that while he may have withdrawn from public life for the foreseeable future, he very much retains his position as a senior member of the royal family. Andrew is understood to have made the personal decision to stay with his father while others attended church. Prince Philip, 98, who was discharged from hospital on Christmas Eve after a four-night stay for treatment for an undisclosed \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d, remained at Sandringham House where the royals would later have Christmas lunch. Andrew\u2019s decision not to attend the main service ensured that the royal family was able to focus attention on images of the Cambridges, attending the Christmas Day service for the first time with their two eldest children, Prince George, six, and Princess Charlotte, four. Before the service, the couple released a new image, showing William with George, Charlotte, and little brother Louis, and taken by Kate at the couple\u2019s Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, earlier this year. After the service, George and Charlotte met members of the crowd, with Charlotte being given a doll by one well wisher. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and their seven-month-old son, Archie, were absent from the royal festivities, having chosen to spend Christmas at a secret location in Canada with Doria Ragland, Meghan\u2019s mother. It has been a tumultuous year for the royals, starting with controversy after Prince Philip was involved in a vehicular collision in which two women were injured, and ending with Andrew\u2019s TV interview on his friendship with Epstein, and his denials over allegations he had sex with one of Epstein\u2019s victims, Virginia Roberts, when she was aged 17. The year also saw the Queen drawn into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over the prorogation of parliament, Meghan\u2019s admission she was struggling with royal life, and Harry appearing to confirm reports the royal brothers were \u201cnow on different paths\u201d. The Sussexes are also taking on the press over privacy. The Queen did not address any of these issues directly in her 68th Christmas broadcast. Rather she cited the example of Jesus, and \u201chow small steps taken in faith and in hope\u201d could often overcome \u201clong-held differences\u201d.

IMRG, the online retailers\u2019 body, said Christmas Day was not only about picking up bargains using vouchers and cash received as a gift. \u201cGifting companies say there is a massive spike in buying an experience, like a hotel break or driving a car, on Christmas morning as people forget to buy a present for people and those gifts are instant.\u201d But for some, Boxing Day remains an opportunity to treat themselves after the hectic buildup is over. \u201cIt is like an oasis after the mayhem and pressure of buying presents for other people,\u201d said Wehrle. \u201cYou can go shopping for a few hours and have something to eat or go to the cinema. I think it\u2019s less about standing in a queue waiting for a department store to open so you can grab a bargain.\u201d While many retailers have been offering discounts for months, household names such as Next, John Lewis, Harrods and Selfridges tend to hold back until Boxing Day or the 27th, creating events that can still draw a crowd. The property firm Intu said it expected more than 1 million people to flock to its shopping centres, which include Lakeside in Essex and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, on Boxing Day. Its commercial director, Trevor Pereira, said: \u201cWe expect it to be one of our busiest shopping days of the year. Going shopping on Boxing Day is a yearly tradition for many and people come to our centres to enjoy a great experience that cannot be matched online.\u201d",

I had to search for the family of the person who was dead. He was an older man, maybe a father, and that was what weighed on me. We worked for six months and it was very frustrating. We were very hard-working, across the Netherlands, north to south and east to west, but we never identified him.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, new technology was used to build an image of the man\u2019s face. He is believed to have have been around 65 years old and to have come from from eastern Europe rather than Turkey, as had been suspected at the time of his discovery.</p> <p>De Wit said: \u201cThe cold case team wanted to go public with it. We thought we could be traditional and do a press release, go to our investigation TV programme. But this was a case with so much information that we can share. Maybe the smallest detail can open the case up. Maybe if we get it out there somebody can help us take the next step.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a big success and we have got a lot of exposure for the case so it is only logical to do it again. There are departments in other regions thinking about it now. With cold cases there is more you can share. But it doesn\u2019t mean it cant be used for new cases too.\u201d</p>",

It was the only lead we had.\u201d Baas said that they spoke to one man in particular who no longer had his ring because he had gone on to sell it to someone in a bar in Amsterdam. But the mystery buyer did not emerge again and no one at the establishment had known his name. He said: \u201cThe facts weren\u2019t there to say \u2018yes or no\u2019 as to whether that was the victim. I had to search for the family of the person who was dead. He was an older man, maybe a father, and that was what weighed on me. We worked for six months and it was very frustrating. We were very hard-working, across the Netherlands, north to south and east to west, but we never identified him.\u201d Two years ago, new technology was used to build an image of the man\u2019s face. He is believed to have have been around 65 years old and to have come from from eastern Europe rather than Turkey, as had been suspected at the time of his discovery. De Wit said: \u201cThe cold case team wanted to go public with it. We thought we could be traditional and do a press release, go to our investigation TV programme. But this was a case with so much information that we can share. Maybe the smallest detail can open the case up. Maybe if we get it out there somebody can help us take the next step. \u201cIt has been a big success and we have got a lot of exposure for the case so it is only logical to do it again. There are departments in other regions thinking about it now. With cold cases there is more you can share. But it doesn\u2019t mean it cant be used for new cases too.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Foxhunting is continuing with impunity across the UK, with police and courts failing to hold those organising and taking part in them accountable, a former senior police officer has said, as the hunting season gears up towards its Boxing Day ceremonial climax.</p> <p>In November, anti-hunting campaigners collected 126 witness reports of foxhunting with hounds, including six confirmed and two suspected killings of foxes. Martin Sims, a former head of the national wildlife crime unit, who is now director of investigations at the League Against Cruel Sports, said that figure was just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s only those [where people have] actually bothered to phone and report it in, and there are lots that don\u2019t get reported,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause obviously when it\u2019s occurring out in rural locations if there isn\u2019t anyone there that\u2019s against it then it will just go on.\u201d</p> <p>Most fox hunts had their first meet on 26 October or 2 November, although two were seen out as early as 19 October, said the League, whose count runs from the opening meet until 30 November. It also counted 15 cases of badger setts being interfered with on the day of a hunt \u2013 either being blocked to prevent a fox from hiding inside, or people digging and using terriers to flush out a fox.</p> <p>Political support for hunting \u2013 long a minority pastime enjoyed by the wealthy \u2013 has fallen away in recent years. Polling carried out earlier this year by Survation on behalf of the League found that 47% of Conservative voters would be less likely to vote for a candidate who backed foxhunting, rising to 65% among the general public.</p> <p>During the recent election campaign, the Conservatives did not indicate any intention to reverse the 2004 Hunting Act. However, unlike Labour, they did not make any proposals to strengthen the ban. As it stands, no offence under the ban carries a custodial sentence and there are a number of exemptions that animal rights activists say hunts use to avoid prosecution.</p> <p>In many cases where foxes have been killed, hunts say they were following a scent \u201ctrail\u201d laid beforehand when a fox happened to run into the path of hounds.</p> <p>As a result, hunting carries on much as it has always done, in spite of the law, Sims said. \u201cWhen you see stickers on hunt followers\u2019 cars \u2013 like \u2018Keep calm carry on hunting\u2019, \u2018Fuck the ban, fight the ban\u2019 \u2013 [it\u2019s clear] they\u2019ve got no intention of stopping as the legislation currently stands,\u201d Sims said. \u201cAnd because of the issues around policing and investigating it, it is just licence to carry on, because very few end up with convictions at court.\u201d</p> <p>Data provided by the League shows that by 2018 \u2013 the most recent year for which figures are available \u2013 497 convictions had been obtained for all offences under the Hunting Act. A further 47 people have received cautions for hunting offences.</p> <p>Not all hunting-related offences are prosecuted under the hunting ban, however. Most recently, two men associated with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/26/men-sentenced-releasing-fox-path-kimblewick-hunt-oxfordshire-animal\">Kimblewick hunt were handed suspended sentences</a> under the Animal Welfare Act after they dragged a fox by its tail out of an artificial earth and released it front of hounds. The most recent Hunting Act conviction involved two members of the Meynell and South Staffordshire hunt who pleaded guilty to hunting fox cubs with dogs. They were each fined \u00a3350.</p> <p>Responding, a spokesperson for the Countryside Alliance said hunts regularly faced \u201cspurious allegations regarding their legal hunting\u201d and that there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence\u201d to suggest that witness reports collated by the League Against Cruel Sports were truthful. The continuation and adaptation of the culture, infrastructure and activities of hunts \u201chas frustrated those who thought hunts would disband following the implementation of the Hunting Act\u201d, the spokesperson said.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been over 250,000 days\u2019 hunting carried out since the Hunting Act was enforced in February 2005, yet less than 30 people associated with registered hunts have been convicted of illegal hunting,\u201d the alliance added.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is any evidence of illegal hunting activity then we would always expect it to be taken to the police to be investigated in the appropriate manner, rather than trying to create publicity through the media.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2020. An earlier version incorrectly said no offence under the fox hunting ban carried the threat of a \u201ccriminal conviction\u201d. This has been changed to \u201ccustodial sentence\u201d.</p>",

Martin Sims, a former head of the national wildlife crime unit, who is now director of investigations at the League Against Cruel Sports, said that figure was just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s only those [where people have] actually bothered to phone and report it in, and there are lots that don\u2019t get reported,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause obviously when it\u2019s occurring out in rural locations if there isn\u2019t anyone there that\u2019s against it then it will just go on.\u201d Most fox hunts had their first meet on 26 October or 2 November, although two were seen out as early as 19 October, said the League, whose count runs from the opening meet until 30 November. It also counted 15 cases of badger setts being interfered with on the day of a hunt \u2013 either being blocked to prevent a fox from hiding inside, or people digging and using terriers to flush out a fox. Political support for hunting \u2013 long a minority pastime enjoyed by the wealthy \u2013 has fallen away in recent years. Polling carried out earlier this year by Survation on behalf of the League found that 47% of Conservative voters would be less likely to vote for a candidate who backed foxhunting, rising to 65% among the general public. During the recent election campaign, the Conservatives did not indicate any intention to reverse the 2004 Hunting Act. However, unlike Labour, they did not make any proposals to strengthen the ban. As it stands, no offence under the ban carries a custodial sentence and there are a number of exemptions that animal rights activists say hunts use to avoid prosecution. In many cases where foxes have been killed, hunts say they were following a scent \u201ctrail\u201d laid beforehand when a fox happened to run into the path of hounds. As a result, hunting carries on much as it has always done, in spite of the law, Sims said. \u201cWhen you see stickers on hunt followers\u2019 cars \u2013 like \u2018Keep calm carry on hunting\u2019, \u2018Fuck the ban, fight the ban\u2019 \u2013 [it\u2019s clear] they\u2019ve got no intention of stopping as the legislation currently stands,\u201d Sims said. \u201cAnd because of the issues around policing and investigating it, it is just licence to carry on, because very few end up with convictions at court.\u201d Data provided by the League shows that by 2018 \u2013 the most recent year for which figures are available \u2013 497 convictions had been obtained for all offences under the Hunting Act. A further 47 people have received cautions for hunting offences. Not all hunting-related offences are prosecuted under the hunting ban, however. Most recently, two men associated with the Kimblewick hunt were handed suspended sentences under the Animal Welfare Act after they dragged a fox by its tail out of an artificial earth and released it front of hounds. The most recent Hunting Act conviction involved two members of the Meynell and South Staffordshire hunt who pleaded guilty to hunting fox cubs with dogs. They were each fined \u00a3350. Responding, a spokesperson for the Countryside Alliance said hunts regularly faced \u201cspurious allegations regarding their legal hunting\u201d and that there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence\u201d to suggest that witness reports collated by the League Against Cruel Sports were truthful. The continuation and adaptation of the culture, infrastructure and activities of hunts \u201chas frustrated those who thought hunts would disband following the implementation of the Hunting Act\u201d, the spokesperson said. \u201cThere have been over 250,000 days\u2019 hunting carried out since the Hunting Act was enforced in February 2005, yet less than 30 people associated with registered hunts have been convicted of illegal hunting,\u201d the alliance added. \u201cIf there is any evidence of illegal hunting activity then we would always expect it to be taken to the police to be investigated in the appropriate manner, rather than trying to create publicity through the media.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2020. An earlier version incorrectly said no offence under the fox hunting ban carried the threat of a \u201ccriminal conviction\u201d. This has been changed to \u201ccustodial sentence\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>I haven\u2019t always hated Christmas; I think I enjoyed it as a kid. Not so much since. It is a little about the food (if turkey and sprouts are such good news, why don\u2019t we eat them on any other day, eh?). It has a little more to do with rampant consumerism. Gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath \u2026 funny how a festival that is supposed to be about the birth of Christ has come to encompass so many Christian sins. But this isn\u2019t about him; it\u2019s about me, my own family and my own insecurities.</p> <p>I think things turned sour in my 30s, when my siblings selfishly started having families of their own. Suddenly there were new people and generations involved; it became more complicated logistically, as what had been a simple family gathering exploded. This lot went here, that lot there \u2026 oh, God, what about Sam? Where\u2019s he going to go? Whose turn is it? I wasn\u2019t involved in these conversations, but I\u2019m sure they happened. They did in my mind, anyway. I had become the grumpy grandad no one wanted, before even being a dad.</p> <p>I could \u2013 and should \u2013 have just spent Christmas alone, for everyone\u2019s sake. But that would have made them feel bad, and I didn\u2019t want that or to be felt sorry for. So I went along, to wherever there was room or I was least unwelcome, to whoever\u2019s turn it was. I ate my sprouts \u2013 mmm \u2013 and I tried to be the fun uncle, and not to disapprove so obviously of the mountains of presents being ripped open (while also, hypocritically, feeling sorry for myself as I strung out the unwrapping of my own pitiful molehill of hastily thrown-together afterthoughts). I don\u2019t think I fooled anyone.</p> <p>And then one year I did fool them \u2013 everyone. Uncharacteristically, and improbably, I found myself in the situation known as having a girlfriend (I had had them before, just not for Christmas). She came with a family of her own, and they asked me if I would like to spend Christmas with them. No, of course I bloody wouldn\u2019t, but it gave me an idea. That\u2019s very kind, I said, but I\u2019m spending it with my family. They\u2019d be devastated if I wasn\u2019t there. (Ha!)</p> <p>See where this is going? I then told my family that I would be spending Christmas with my girlfriend\u2019s family \u2013 I was keen to get to know them better. And my family concealed any relief they may have been feeling.

      "bodyText": "I haven\u2019t always hated Christmas; I think I enjoyed it as a kid. Not so much since. It is a little about the food (if turkey and sprouts are such good news, why don\u2019t we eat them on any other day, eh?). It has a little more to do with rampant consumerism. Gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath \u2026 funny how a festival that is supposed to be about the birth of Christ has come to encompass so many Christian sins. But this isn\u2019t about him; it\u2019s about me, my own family and my own insecurities. I think things turned sour in my 30s, when my siblings selfishly started having families of their own. Suddenly there were new people and generations involved; it became more complicated logistically, as what had been a simple family gathering exploded. This lot went here, that lot there \u2026 oh, God, what about Sam? Where\u2019s he going to go? Whose turn is it? I wasn\u2019t involved in these conversations, but I\u2019m sure they happened. They did in my mind, anyway. I had become the grumpy grandad no one wanted, before even being a dad. I could \u2013 and should \u2013 have just spent Christmas alone, for everyone\u2019s sake. But that would have made them feel bad, and I didn\u2019t want that or to be felt sorry for. So I went along, to wherever there was room or I was least unwelcome, to whoever\u2019s turn it was. I ate my sprouts \u2013 mmm \u2013 and I tried to be the fun uncle, and not to disapprove so obviously of the mountains of presents being ripped open (while also, hypocritically, feeling sorry for myself as I strung out the unwrapping of my own pitiful molehill of hastily thrown-together afterthoughts). I don\u2019t think I fooled anyone. And then one year I did fool them \u2013 everyone. Uncharacteristically, and improbably, I found myself in the situation known as having a girlfriend (I had had them before, just not for Christmas). She came with a family of her own, and they asked me if I would like to spend Christmas with them. No, of course I bloody wouldn\u2019t, but it gave me an idea. That\u2019s very kind, I said, but I\u2019m spending it with my family. They\u2019d be devastated if I wasn\u2019t there. (Ha!) See where this is going? I then told my family that I would be spending Christmas with my girlfriend\u2019s family \u2013 I was keen to get to know them better. And my family concealed any relief they may have been feeling. At least they didn\u2019t need to feel sorry for me because I wouldn\u2019t be alone at home \u2026 Which is exactly what and where I was, of course. By myself, as myself. I had a steak \u2013 with chips, no sprouts \u2013 and a nice bottle of rioja. (I don\u2019t really remember that it was rioja, but in my mind it was a grade or two above the usual. It could have even broken the \u00a310 barrier.) I toasted absent friends and family. Yeah, maybe there was a bit of gluttony involved, but it\u2019s hard to remain sin-free at Christmas.

      "body": "<p>Birmingham-born actor Helen George, 35, is best known as nurse Trixie Franklin in BBC One\u2019s hit drama <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/call-the-midwife\" title=\"\">Call </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/call-the-midwife\" title=\"\">the Midwife</a></em>. She is currently playing the title role in Theatre Royal Bath\u2019s touring production of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s <em>My Cousin Rachel</em>.</p> <p><strong>How was filming </strong><em><strong>Call </strong></em><em><strong>the Midwife</strong></em><strong>\u2019s </strong><strong>festive special in the Outer Hebrides?</strong><br>Pretty spectacular. We shot it on the island of Lewis and Harris, which was so scenic and cinematic. We saw stags and eagles every day. Bloody freezing, though \u2013 I didn\u2019t remove my long johns the whole time, but I\u2019m a southern softie.</p> <p><strong>I hear you saw a ghost as well?</strong><br>[Laughs] We all stayed in an incredible castle, which was supposed to be haunted by the former lady of the house. We had these grand dinners every night, and the waiting staff always left an empty chair for her ladyship at the end of the table. Through a trick of the light, or the wine, you\u2019d sometimes feel someone sitting there. I didn\u2019t sleep at all when we were staying there.</p> <p><strong>Is it frustrating when people underestimate </strong><em><strong>Call the Midwife</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>Slightly, but that\u2019s also key to its success. It lulls people into a warm, cuddly trance, but the subject matter is thought-provoking. If it was purely a hard-hitting drama about social equality and feminism, it probably wouldn\u2019t be as popular. We covered the thalidomide controversy. Our abortion storyline was on air at the same time as laws were being passed in Ireland. The NHS was a big election issue, and our show champions the NHS while also recognising its flaws. It might be wrapped in a cosy blanket and set in the past, but it still reflects modern society.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp52UnccLXM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kp52UnccLXM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp52UnccLXM\">Watch a trailer for the Christmas Day episode of Call the Midwife.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Is it refreshing being part of a female-led mainstream show?</strong><br>Definitely. Since the #MeToo movement, there\u2019s been a real influx of female creatives and female-led casts, but it was much more unusual in 2012, when we first aired. Our mix of younger and older actresses was rare too. It was in the midst of the BBC ageism scandal, but we had Jenny Agutter, Judy Parfitt and Pam Ferris \u2013 all fantastic actresses, back on primetime TV. The likes of <em>Fleabag</em> have come through in the past few years, but we were a step ahead in some ways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a scene at the end of My Cousin Rachel where I channel my inner Brian Cox, and I just love it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>The new series features a fashion show in which Trixie wears the shortest miniskirt ever seen in Poplar\u2026</strong><br>Yeah, the nuns all blush and people walk out. [Laughs] I really enjoy how Trixie is at the forefront of the sociopolitical movements within Poplar, yet she also gets her legs out and pushes fashion boundaries. She wears some interesting costumes this series. One is like a 60s sexy bishop outfit with a multicoloured pleather patchwork cloak. It\u2019s pretty far out.</p> <p><strong>Tell us about your leading role in </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/event/my-cousin-rachel/\" title=\"\">My Cousin Rachel</a></strong></em><strong>.</strong><br>It\u2019s a couple of years since I\u2018ve done stage work, so it\u2019s been bloody lovely. It\u2019s an electricity you just don\u2019t get with screen work. It\u2019s a brilliant, lean adaptation by Joseph O\u2019Connor, and Rachel\u2019s an older character \u2013 well, 35, which doesn\u2019t seem old to me any more but is positively middle-aged for a Victorian heroine. It\u2019s really refreshing not to think: \u2018I need to look younger and thinner\u2019, but to play more mature and concentrate on the text. I wear a dark wig, speak a bit of Italian and have a deeper voice, so it might surprise people who think of me as Trixie.</p> <p><strong>Apparently you compared Rachel\u2019s situation to Meghan Markle</strong><strong>?</strong><br>It\u2019s always helpful to relate period characters to the contemporary world. Meghan Markle came into this ridiculously British family with all these outdated rules \u2013 you know, she got slaughtered by our media for not wearing heels the morning she gave birth. Similarly, Rachel is thrust into this uptight English world, stands her ground and refuses to just quietly fit in. There\u2019s also something of \u201cthe other\u201d about her, a sense of a foreigner invading our small island, so perhaps there are Brexit parallels there too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/15/how-call-the-midwife-secretly-became-tvs-most-subversive-show\">Nun the wiser: how Call the Midwife secretly became TV's most subversive show</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What kind of role are you keen to play next? Comedy or an action heroine maybe?</strong><br>Both those things! I trained in musical theatre, so I\u2019d also love to do a Sondheim or something. As I get older, I\u2019m finding that roles have a depth and weight to them. Even if I looked like the young ing\u00e9nue in the past, that\u2019s never been a happy fit for my personality.

      "bodyText": "Birmingham-born actor Helen George, 35, is best known as nurse Trixie Franklin in BBC One\u2019s hit drama Call the Midwife. She is currently playing the title role in Theatre Royal Bath\u2019s touring production of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s My Cousin Rachel. How was filming Call the Midwife\u2019s festive special in the Outer Hebrides? Pretty spectacular. We shot it on the island of Lewis and Harris, which was so scenic and cinematic. We saw stags and eagles every day. Bloody freezing, though \u2013 I didn\u2019t remove my long johns the whole time, but I\u2019m a southern softie. I hear you saw a ghost as well? [Laughs] We all stayed in an incredible castle, which was supposed to be haunted by the former lady of the house. We had these grand dinners every night, and the waiting staff always left an empty chair for her ladyship at the end of the table. Through a trick of the light, or the wine, you\u2019d sometimes feel someone sitting there. I didn\u2019t sleep at all when we were staying there. Is it frustrating when people underestimate Call the Midwife? Slightly, but that\u2019s also key to its success. It lulls people into a warm, cuddly trance, but the subject matter is thought-provoking. If it was purely a hard-hitting drama about social equality and feminism, it probably wouldn\u2019t be as popular. We covered the thalidomide controversy. Our abortion storyline was on air at the same time as laws were being passed in Ireland. The NHS was a big election issue, and our show champions the NHS while also recognising its flaws. It might be wrapped in a cosy blanket and set in the past, but it still reflects modern society. Is it refreshing being part of a female-led mainstream show? Definitely. Since the #MeToo movement, there\u2019s been a real influx of female creatives and female-led casts, but it was much more unusual in 2012, when we first aired. Our mix of younger and older actresses was rare too. It was in the midst of the BBC ageism scandal, but we had Jenny Agutter, Judy Parfitt and Pam Ferris \u2013 all fantastic actresses, back on primetime TV. The likes of Fleabag have come through in the past few years, but we were a step ahead in some ways. The new series features a fashion show in which Trixie wears the shortest miniskirt ever seen in Poplar\u2026 Yeah, the nuns all blush and people walk out. [Laughs] I really enjoy how Trixie is at the forefront of the sociopolitical movements within Poplar, yet she also gets her legs out and pushes fashion boundaries. She wears some interesting costumes this series. One is like a 60s sexy bishop outfit with a multicoloured pleather patchwork cloak. It\u2019s pretty far out. Tell us about your leading role in My Cousin Rachel. It\u2019s a couple of years since I\u2018ve done stage work, so it\u2019s been bloody lovely. It\u2019s an electricity you just don\u2019t get with screen work. It\u2019s a brilliant, lean adaptation by Joseph O\u2019Connor, and Rachel\u2019s an older character \u2013 well, 35, which doesn\u2019t seem old to me any more but is positively middle-aged for a Victorian heroine. It\u2019s really refreshing not to think: \u2018I need to look younger and thinner\u2019, but to play more mature and concentrate on the text. I wear a dark wig, speak a bit of Italian and have a deeper voice, so it might surprise people who think of me as Trixie. Apparently you compared Rachel\u2019s situation to Meghan Markle? It\u2019s always helpful to relate period characters to the contemporary world. Meghan Markle came into this ridiculously British family with all these outdated rules \u2013 you know, she got slaughtered by our media for not wearing heels the morning she gave birth. Similarly, Rachel is thrust into this uptight English world, stands her ground and refuses to just quietly fit in. There\u2019s also something of \u201cthe other\u201d about her, a sense of a foreigner invading our small island, so perhaps there are Brexit parallels there too. What kind of role are you keen to play next? Comedy or an action heroine maybe? Both those things! I trained in musical theatre, so I\u2019d also love to do a Sondheim or something. As I get older, I\u2019m finding that roles have a depth and weight to them. Even if I looked like the young ing\u00e9nue in the past, that\u2019s never been a happy fit for my personality. Playing fiery, strong-minded women is exciting for me. What\u2019s been your cultural highlight this year? Succession. It\u2019s so Shakespearean and riveting. It\u2019s fascinating how it\u2019s a mainly British writing team. And Brian Cox, my God. There\u2019s a scene at the end of My Cousin Rachel where I channel my inner Brian Cox, and I just love it. Will you make any New Year\u2019s Resolutions? No, it\u2019s normally like: \u201cDon\u2019t drink\u201d, and I last about a day. Because it\u2019s the end of the decade, I\u2019ll reflect on the past 10 years instead. Call the Midwife is on BBC One on Christmas Day, 7pm, and returns for a ninth series on Sunday 5 January, 8pm. My Cousin Rachel tours to Cambridge, Sheffield, Chichester and Richmond until 8 February",

      "body": "<p>Are we living through a golden age of linguistic inventiveness? Buzzwords and neologisms \u2013 from office jargon to the lexicons of democratic chaos in Britain and the US, as well as the ever-expanding culture wars \u2013 rain down on us every day, and can gain global currency at the speed of fibre-optic cable. Many, of course, fail \u2013 like \u201cBrixit\u201d, an early rival to Brexit, or \u201cGeneration Me\u201d, one proposed label for what we now call millennials. Others rapidly become part of the modern conversation. Why, for example, do critics call young, supposedly over sensitive and easily triggered people \u201csnowflakes\u201d? Because in Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/dec/20/first-rule-about-fight-club-no-one-talks-about-the-quality-of-the-writing\" title=\"1\">1996 novel Fight Club</a>, Tyler Durden says: \u201cYou are not special. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.\u201d</p> <p>Palahniuk\u2019s contribution, however, was accidental. He later <a href=\"https://ew.com/books/2017/11/17/chuck-palahniuk-snowflake-insult/\" title=\"\">explained</a>: \u201cBack in 1994, when I was writing my book, I wasn\u2019t insulting anyone but myself\u2026 My use of the term \u2018snowflake\u2019 never had anything to do with fragility or sensitivity.\u201d Instead, he was using it as a means of \u201cdeprogramming himself\u201d, so he didn\u2019t believe in his own praise. But the point is that you can\u2019t control what usage will do once it\u2019s out of your hands: a much wider uptake can shift the meaning. The term \u201cwoke\u201d, for example, is now used mockingly for a kind of overrighteous liberalism; but its first recorded use, by the African-American novelist <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/29/the-lost-giant-of-american-literature\" title=\"\">William Melvin Kelley</a>, was meant to indicate an awareness of political issues, especially those around race, a positive usage that still also persists.</p> <p>Some people coin words for the sheer fun of it \u2013 and if the rhythm and pleasure of the sound are sufficient, they might be lucky enough to see it go viral. This is how we got \u201cfashionista\u201d \u2013 coined by Stephen Freid in a 1993 biography of the supermodel Gia \u2013 and \u201camazeballs\u201d, first used publicly by the fashion blogger Elizabeth Spiridakis Olson in 2008. It\u2019s easy to forget that every word in the English language has had a first use; a language is the record of innumerable creative decisions. Most of those responsible are lost to lexicographical history, but in our online age, it is easier to identify the culprit or heroine.</p> <p>I tracked some of them down. What is it like to see a word you invented get into the dictionary? And how does it feel if it spirals out of control, in ways you never intended?</p> <h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2> <p>The word Brexit was a tragically unintentional success in verbal invention: coined as a warning, it became a rallying call. In early 2012, the possibility that crisis-stricken Greece might have to leave the Eurozone was labelled \u201cGrexit\u201d, for Greek exit. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/12/brexit-will-undermine-londons-legal-standing-barristers-warn\" title=\"\">Peter Wilding</a>, a former adviser to David Cameron, left his job as European director of BSkyB in order to set up a thinktank called British Influence, which was designed to celebrate and encourage Britain\u2019s role as a leader in the EU. On 15 May 2012, he published <a href=\"https://blogactiv.eu/blog/2012/05/15/stumbling-towards-the-brexit/\" title=\"\">an article on a European blog platform</a>, in which he argued that if Britain\u2019s leaders did not set out a positive vision for membership, \u201cthen the portmanteau for Greek euro exit might be followed by another sad word, Brexit.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I said to David Cameron, 'You could be the new Churchill here. You could say Britain is a leader in\u00a0Europe\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Between 2005 and 2008, Wilding had worked in Brussels as media and policy director of the Conservative party in Europe. \u201cI found,\u201d he recalls now, \u201cBritain was running the show. It had all the most powerful portfolios in the European commission. The penny dropped for me: here was Britain as the leading power.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Wilding went to see Cameron in Downing Street, brandishing the results of a poll that showed the majority of Britons wanted the country to lead in Europe. \u201cI said to him, \u2018You could be the new Churchill here: you could say Britain is a leader in Europe and we\u2019ve achieved all these things.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, we just don\u2019t have enough time to roll out this message. We won the Scottish referendum and the general election through fear and the economy, and we\u2019ll win this one the same way.\u2019 I said, \u2018You will lose.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And lose they did. Was part of the problem the sheer energy and brio of the word Brexit itself? In 2012, alternatives had been flying around: both the Economist and the Daily Mail referred to a possible <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/bagehots-notebook/2012/06/21/a-brixit-looms\" title=\"\">\u201cBrixit\u201d</a>, while others suggested <a href=\"https://archive.intereconomics.eu/year/2016/4/what-may-not-happen-in-ukexit/\" title=\"\">UKExit</a>; but Brexit was clearly the most satisfying to pronounce. Wilding says it came to indicate \u201ca stamp of rage: exit, leave, we\u2019ve had enough of it\u201d.</p> <p>Remain is \u201cnot a sexy word\u201d, he points out; it is partly a result of the successful lobbying by anti-Europe conservatives to avoid having a referendum question that invited the positive answer \u201cYes\u201d as to whether Britain should stay in the EU. Brexit is now in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), defined as \u201cThe (proposed) withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the political process associated with it.\u201d</p> <p>When it was named Word of the Year in 2016 by Collins dictionaries, Wilding says, \u201cIt was a surprise. It had only recently gone crazy in public discourse. I felt shocked that that would be my footnote in the Brexit saga.\u201d And now? The word Brexit, he thinks, \u201ccould go down in history, like Vichy or Versailles, as an epitaph for a nation in decline\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Gig economy</strong></h2> <p>For a long time, the \u201cgig economy\u201d sounded like a glamorous euphemism for a world of zero-hours contracts and piecework. Why worry that giant corporations such as Uber don\u2019t want to class their drivers as employees? If we\u2019re all doing \u201cgigs\u201d, we\u2019re all hip jazzers. (The word \u201cgig\u201d \u2013 \u201cetymology unknown\u201d, remarks the OED \u2013 has meant a musical engagement since the 1920s.) But the phrase was originally coined as a criticism.</p> <p>On 12 January 2009, the journalist and editor Tina Brown wrote an <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-gig-economy\" title=\"\">article for the Daily Beast</a> website, observing: \u201cNo one I know has a job anymore. They\u2019ve got Gigs.\u201d</p> <p>Increasingly, people she knew who used to have staff jobs in the media were working in two or three part-time positions, or freelance. \u201cTo people I know in the bottom income brackets, living paycheck to paycheck, the Gig Economy has been old news for years,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat\u2019s new, is the way it\u2019s hit the demographic that used to assume that a college degree from an elite school was the passport to job security.\u201d Now everyone was a member of \u201cthe hustling class\u201d, and company managers were \u201cmesmerised by the notion that everyone can now be hired cheap \u2013 that everyone is slave labour\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d6d67de97416f29d906972aaac20a21ab8e98cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d6d67de97416f29d906972aaac20a21ab8e98cb/0_874_4480_5021/892.jpg\" alt=\"Tina Brown in Nov 2016\" width=\"892\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s my baby\u2019: Tina Brown on \u2018gig economy\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lane/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was 10 years ago, and it looks awfully prophetic. When people began to use the word \u201cgig\u201d in this context, Brown says now, it worked to project \u201ca subterfuge coolness over a predicament caused by an economic downshift. It\u2019s cool to say, \u2018I\u2019ve got these gigs\u2019 rather than to say, \u2018My main job has disappeared.\u2019 Because of its cool sound, it helped to familiarise people with the phenomenon.\u201d</p> <p>Does she regret helping to make precariousness sound cool? She laughs. \u201cMy only regret is that if I\u2019d had a book called The Gig Economy I would have made a lot of money. I feel rather proud when I see conferences called Managing the Gig Economy \u2013 it\u2019s my baby.\u201d Of late, the euphemistic sheen of the phrase seems to have worn off, in any case. When questions are asked in parliament about the gig economy, it is in the context of protecting its vulnerable workers rather than celebrating their freedoms.</p> <p>The gig economy, Brown points out, leaves US workers without healthcare, and might have harmed social cohesion: \u201cI think everybody became so desperate scrabbling around doing their three jobs that the last thing they cared about was other people.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not as though everything was perfect before. \u201cThose jobs people depended on turned out to be treacherous things,\u201d she says, adding that at least these days, \u201cif you get sacked from one gig you still have two others\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Millennials</strong></h2> <p>Millennials, eh? They are everywhere, with their selfies and their avocado toast and their feckless refusal to save for a house deposit. The <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Millennial\" title=\"\">Urban Dictionary</a> has it right that millennial is the \u201cname an old person gives a young person they don\u2019t like\u201d.</p> <p>From the 17th century, \u201cmillennial\u201d could be used as a synonym for \u201cmillenarian\u201d: associated with the belief that the second coming of Christ was imminent and would usher in a 1,000-year era of peace. But it was first used to describe a specific cohort of people \u2013 those who would come of age in the year 2000 \u2013 in a 1991 book by Neil Howe and William Strauss entitled Generations: The History Of America\u2019s Future, 1584 To 2069.</p> <p>Howe explains they were looking for a name for \u201cthe high-school class of 2000, coming of age in the new millennium\u201d, and wanted an upbeat label, so millennials it was. Chuckling, Howe notes that the name for the previous cohort, Generation X, had not yet been coined while they were writing the book. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/26/douglas-coupland-generation-x\" title=\"D\">Douglas Coupland\u2019s novel Generation X </a>was published in the same year.) \u201cSo to make Gen Xers feel even worse about themselves,\u201d he says, \u201cthe generation that came after them was named before they were.\u201d Gen Xers won\u2019t mind, of course, he adds: \u201cThey have that self-deprecating sense of humour.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Naming a generation is like shooting a bullet into a cave and watching it ricochet. You never know where it\u2019ll come out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The term millennials did not really explode in popularity until well into the new millennium. For much of the 1990s, Howe points out, it did battle with rival labels such as Generation Y. That name, he says, \u201cwas almost always the more derogatory alternative. People used it to make the point that this new generation was everything the Xers were, but more extreme. More commercial, more risk-taking, totally over the top. You know, like \u2018Gen Xers are a little bit alienated from family life, but these kids are just off the charts.\u2019\u201d By contrast, he and Strauss were forecasting that millennials would be \u201ccloser to their family, more into community, more optimistic about the future\u201d.</p> <p>Talking about the differences between generations, Howe says now, is \u201clike a Rorschach test. You\u2019re talking about politics, culture, demography, social science, epidemiology. It acquires the colour of the emotion that the person who uses it wants it to have.\u201d If millennials mainly has a mocking or derogatory sense now, that says more about the older generations who use it that way than about millennials themselves.</p> <p>\u201cNaming a generation is like shooting a bullet into a cave and watching it ricochet everywhere,\u201d Howe says. \u201cYou never know where it\u2019s going to come out.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Crowdsourcing</strong></h2> <p>For more than a decade, the hot buzzword for companies who want to profit from people\u2019s talent without paying for it has been crowdsourcing. This is a clever play on outsourcing (moving jobs to external contractors, or overseas), combined with an allusion to James Surowiecki\u2019s 2004 bestseller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/aug/07/highereducation.news2\" title=\"T\">The Wisdom </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/aug/07/highereducation.news2\" title=\"T\">O f Crowds</a>, which celebrated collaborative efforts such as Wikipedia, and the surprising accuracy of prediction markets, where aggregate betting on events such as elections can forecast outcomes better than experts.</p> <p>The word crowdsourcing was coined in June 2006, in an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2006/06/crowds/\" title=\"\">article for Wired by Jeff Howe</a>. \u201cIndustries as disparate as pharmaceuticals and television [are discovering] ways to tap the latent talent of the crowd,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe labour isn\u2019t always free, but it costs a lot less than paying traditional employees. It\u2019s not outsourcing; it\u2019s crowdsourcing.\u201d It was an elegant, snappy introduction to a very successful coinage. Did Howe know he was doing that at the time? \u201cYou know, we actually kind of did, yeah,\u201d he says now.</p> <p>Two years previously, Wired\u2019s editor-in-chief, Chris Anderson, had coined the phrase <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2004/10/tail/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe Long Tail\u201d</a> to describe the potential longterm viability of niche products on services such as Amazon or Netflix (then a DVD-rental business), and that had become a hit book. \u201cSo the term crowdsourcing was, in the very beginning, half meant to parody the emergence of such buzzwords,\u201d Howe says.</p> <p>At the same time, he was interested in the possibilities of the new collaborative model of creativity. \u201cOne thing about being at Wired in those days,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwas that we really did have our ear to the rail in terms of the tech industry and culture. So we knew the timing was right, that there was this thing starting to happen and no one knew what to call it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fc9fd925dc5c54ee292044596012d0e3480d27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fc9fd925dc5c54ee292044596012d0e3480d27a/0_0_5632_3755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald McDonald figure in front of drive through sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even McDonald\u2019s got in on the act, selling \u2018crowdsourced\u2019 burgers in 2014. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: yaoinlove/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The word took off with amazing rapidity. \u201cWithin two weeks, there were 600,000 mentions on Google. And it never slowed down.\u201d He published a bestselling book of the same name in 2008, and is now a journalism professor at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cOne thing I\u2019d say is that we really did need a word at the time,\u201d Howe adds. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one of those bullshit marketing words that get adopted by management-consultant types. There was something really exciting taking place in the mid-2000s, and we didn\u2019t have a language for it yet.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed. Crowdsourcing might have been used since in cynical ways, and appropriated by huge brands such as Starbucks (which, since 2008 has solicited customer improvements through its My Starbucks Idea website) and McDonald\u2019s (which in 2014 sold \u201ccrowdsourced\u201d burgers), but it can also describe the kind of global altruistic effort that only the internet makes possible.</p> <p>According to Google Trends, the word\u2019s peak search popularity occurred in March 2014, when eight million people around the world used their computer skills to search for Malaysia Airlines plane Flight MH370, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/mh370-five-years-of-theories-about-one-of-aviations-greatest-mysteries\" title=\"v\">vanished after </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/mh370-five-years-of-theories-about-one-of-aviations-greatest-mysteries\" title=\"v\">taking off</a> and was presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean. They didn\u2019t find the plane, but this kind of effort, as well as the collaborative news investigations of outlets such as <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/\" title=\"\">Bellingcat</a>, is what gives crowdsourcing a good name.</p> <h2><strong>Binge-watching</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s something about the phrase binge-watching that sums up not only modern modes of media consumption but our whole culture. It\u2019s the perfect metaphor for Netflix-era humans, whom Aristotle would have called \u201cincontinent\u201d in their desires: wanting more and more of the same, with no patience or self-control.

It is first recorded in 1996, when to watch all the episodes of a series in a row meant acquiring a set of VHS tapes. That is what a science graduate student in New England named Bob Donahue was looking for when he posted the following to a local Usenet discussion group that year: \u201cI\u2019ve just become hooked on The X-Files, so I\u2019m a little behind... Does anyone by ANY chance have tapes of this show back to season 1 they\u2019d be willing to lend me so I can effectively catch up? I\u2019d be more than happy to travel out to wherever to get them and then bring them back (actually there are three of us who all got hooked at the same time, so I\u2019d predict that there\u2019d be some MASSIVE binge-watching right away! :-)\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a cool revelation!\u201d Donahue says now, when I tell him that he probably coined the phrase. \u201cBut, to be honest, I have zero recollection as to whether I made up the phrase off-the-cuff, or if I was using something I had heard before. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve had no thoughts about it over the years because, honestly, I don\u2019t remember doing it.\u201d</p> <p>After a career as an astrophysicist and now a web developer for an educational foundation, Donahue still occasionally does the thing he named: \u201cSome shows \u2013 like Game Of Thrones \u2013 are just too irresistible.\u201d</p> <p>After he coined binge-watching as a gerund (or verbal noun), the verb \u201cto binge-watch\u201d followed. It is also first recorded on Usenet, where someone in 1998 asked in a post: \u201cDo you ever binge watch (marathon)?\u201d This was also in the context of The X-Files, so really, it was Scully and Mulder who started it all. In online lexicographical history, the truth is out there. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s one of the cool things about the internet,\u201d Donahue says. \u201cYou never know what sort of reach something you say will have.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Gammon</strong></h2> <p>On 8 June 2017, the <a href=\"http://www.bendavisauthor.com/\" title=\"\">British children\u2019s author Ben Davis</a> was drunkenly hate-watching Question Time on BBC One. Fed up, he tweeted a picture of various red-faced older men who had been speaking from the audience, and wrote: \u201cWhatever happens, hopefully politicians will start listening to young ppl after this. This Great Wall of gammon has had its way long enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I sent out that tweet, even in my drunken state, I had no inkling it would have any impact,\u201d Davis says. \u201cI thought it would get lost in the ether. When I started getting requests from serious news organisations to discuss gammon, my conviction that the world had gone irrevocably insane only deepened.\u201d</p> <p>Gammon, it turned out, had legs: it was joyously adopted by the left to describe flushed, middle-aged white people with reactionary views and, in time, anyone pro-Brexit.

In more sedate corners of the media, some devotees of philology explored the historical context: in 18th-century thieves\u2019 jargon, a gammon was someone who distracted the mark\u2019s attention; in the 19th century, gammon could also mean stuff and nonsense, of the kind a modern gammon might perhaps spout. The journalist Caitlin Moran deserves some share of the originating credit, too, for having described David Cameron in 2012 as <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/caitlin-moran-extract-why-trust-a-failed-journalist-v2jm28vrspt\" title=\"\">\u201ca slightly camp gammon robot\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in two minds about the gammon thing,\u201d Davis says now. \u201cWhen it\u2019s used against genuine bigots, I\u2019m fine with it.

      "bodyText": "Are we living through a golden age of linguistic inventiveness? Buzzwords and neologisms \u2013 from office jargon to the lexicons of democratic chaos in Britain and the US, as well as the ever-expanding culture wars \u2013 rain down on us every day, and can gain global currency at the speed of fibre-optic cable. Many, of course, fail \u2013 like \u201cBrixit\u201d, an early rival to Brexit, or \u201cGeneration Me\u201d, one proposed label for what we now call millennials. Others rapidly become part of the modern conversation. Why, for example, do critics call young, supposedly over sensitive and easily triggered people \u201csnowflakes\u201d? Because in Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s 1996 novel Fight Club, Tyler Durden says: \u201cYou are not special. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.\u201d Palahniuk\u2019s contribution, however, was accidental. He later explained: \u201cBack in 1994, when I was writing my book, I wasn\u2019t insulting anyone but myself\u2026 My use of the term \u2018snowflake\u2019 never had anything to do with fragility or sensitivity.\u201d Instead, he was using it as a means of \u201cdeprogramming himself\u201d, so he didn\u2019t believe in his own praise. But the point is that you can\u2019t control what usage will do once it\u2019s out of your hands: a much wider uptake can shift the meaning. The term \u201cwoke\u201d, for example, is now used mockingly for a kind of overrighteous liberalism; but its first recorded use, by the African-American novelist William Melvin Kelley, was meant to indicate an awareness of political issues, especially those around race, a positive usage that still also persists. Some people coin words for the sheer fun of it \u2013 and if the rhythm and pleasure of the sound are sufficient, they might be lucky enough to see it go viral. This is how we got \u201cfashionista\u201d \u2013 coined by Stephen Freid in a 1993 biography of the supermodel Gia \u2013 and \u201camazeballs\u201d, first used publicly by the fashion blogger Elizabeth Spiridakis Olson in 2008. It\u2019s easy to forget that every word in the English language has had a first use; a language is the record of innumerable creative decisions. Most of those responsible are lost to lexicographical history, but in our online age, it is easier to identify the culprit or heroine. I tracked some of them down. What is it like to see a word you invented get into the dictionary? And how does it feel if it spirals out of control, in ways you never intended? Brexit The word Brexit was a tragically unintentional success in verbal invention: coined as a warning, it became a rallying call. In early 2012, the possibility that crisis-stricken Greece might have to leave the Eurozone was labelled \u201cGrexit\u201d, for Greek exit. Then Peter Wilding, a former adviser to David Cameron, left his job as European director of BSkyB in order to set up a thinktank called British Influence, which was designed to celebrate and encourage Britain\u2019s role as a leader in the EU. On 15 May 2012, he published an article on a European blog platform, in which he argued that if Britain\u2019s leaders did not set out a positive vision for membership, \u201cthen the portmanteau for Greek euro exit might be followed by another sad word, Brexit.\u201d Between 2005 and 2008, Wilding had worked in Brussels as media and policy director of the Conservative party in Europe. \u201cI found,\u201d he recalls now, \u201cBritain was running the show. It had all the most powerful portfolios in the European commission. The penny dropped for me: here was Britain as the leading power.\u201d In 2016, Wilding went to see Cameron in Downing Street, brandishing the results of a poll that showed the majority of Britons wanted the country to lead in Europe. \u201cI said to him, \u2018You could be the new Churchill here: you could say Britain is a leader in Europe and we\u2019ve achieved all these things.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, we just don\u2019t have enough time to roll out this message. We won the Scottish referendum and the general election through fear and the economy, and we\u2019ll win this one the same way.\u2019 I said, \u2018You will lose.\u2019\u201d And lose they did. Was part of the problem the sheer energy and brio of the word Brexit itself? In 2012, alternatives had been flying around: both the Economist and the Daily Mail referred to a possible \u201cBrixit\u201d, while others suggested UKExit; but Brexit was clearly the most satisfying to pronounce. Wilding says it came to indicate \u201ca stamp of rage: exit, leave, we\u2019ve had enough of it\u201d. Remain is \u201cnot a sexy word\u201d, he points out; it is partly a result of the successful lobbying by anti-Europe conservatives to avoid having a referendum question that invited the positive answer \u201cYes\u201d as to whether Britain should stay in the EU. Brexit is now in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), defined as \u201cThe (proposed) withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the political process associated with it.\u201d When it was named Word of the Year in 2016 by Collins dictionaries, Wilding says, \u201cIt was a surprise. It had only recently gone crazy in public discourse. I felt shocked that that would be my footnote in the Brexit saga.\u201d And now? The word Brexit, he thinks, \u201ccould go down in history, like Vichy or Versailles, as an epitaph for a nation in decline\u201d. Gig economy For a long time, the \u201cgig economy\u201d sounded like a glamorous euphemism for a world of zero-hours contracts and piecework. Why worry that giant corporations such as Uber don\u2019t want to class their drivers as employees? If we\u2019re all doing \u201cgigs\u201d, we\u2019re all hip jazzers. (The word \u201cgig\u201d \u2013 \u201cetymology unknown\u201d, remarks the OED \u2013 has meant a musical engagement since the 1920s.) But the phrase was originally coined as a criticism. On 12 January 2009, the journalist and editor Tina Brown wrote an article for the Daily Beast website, observing: \u201cNo one I know has a job anymore. They\u2019ve got Gigs.\u201d Increasingly, people she knew who used to have staff jobs in the media were working in two or three part-time positions, or freelance. \u201cTo people I know in the bottom income brackets, living paycheck to paycheck, the Gig Economy has been old news for years,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat\u2019s new, is the way it\u2019s hit the demographic that used to assume that a college degree from an elite school was the passport to job security.\u201d Now everyone was a member of \u201cthe hustling class\u201d, and company managers were \u201cmesmerised by the notion that everyone can now be hired cheap \u2013 that everyone is slave labour\u201d. That was 10 years ago, and it looks awfully prophetic. When people began to use the word \u201cgig\u201d in this context, Brown says now, it worked to project \u201ca subterfuge coolness over a predicament caused by an economic downshift. It\u2019s cool to say, \u2018I\u2019ve got these gigs\u2019 rather than to say, \u2018My main job has disappeared.\u2019 Because of its cool sound, it helped to familiarise people with the phenomenon.\u201d Does she regret helping to make precariousness sound cool? She laughs. \u201cMy only regret is that if I\u2019d had a book called The Gig Economy I would have made a lot of money. I feel rather proud when I see conferences called Managing the Gig Economy \u2013 it\u2019s my baby.\u201d Of late, the euphemistic sheen of the phrase seems to have worn off, in any case. When questions are asked in parliament about the gig economy, it is in the context of protecting its vulnerable workers rather than celebrating their freedoms. The gig economy, Brown points out, leaves US workers without healthcare, and might have harmed social cohesion: \u201cI think everybody became so desperate scrabbling around doing their three jobs that the last thing they cared about was other people.\u201d It\u2019s not as though everything was perfect before. \u201cThose jobs people depended on turned out to be treacherous things,\u201d she says, adding that at least these days, \u201cif you get sacked from one gig you still have two others\u201d. Millennials Millennials, eh? They are everywhere, with their selfies and their avocado toast and their feckless refusal to save for a house deposit. The Urban Dictionary has it right that millennial is the \u201cname an old person gives a young person they don\u2019t like\u201d. From the 17th century, \u201cmillennial\u201d could be used as a synonym for \u201cmillenarian\u201d: associated with the belief that the second coming of Christ was imminent and would usher in a 1,000-year era of peace. But it was first used to describe a specific cohort of people \u2013 those who would come of age in the year 2000 \u2013 in a 1991 book by Neil Howe and William Strauss entitled Generations: The History Of America\u2019s Future, 1584 To 2069. Howe explains they were looking for a name for \u201cthe high-school class of 2000, coming of age in the new millennium\u201d, and wanted an upbeat label, so millennials it was. Chuckling, Howe notes that the name for the previous cohort, Generation X, had not yet been coined while they were writing the book. (Douglas Coupland\u2019s novel Generation X was published in the same year.) \u201cSo to make Gen Xers feel even worse about themselves,\u201d he says, \u201cthe generation that came after them was named before they were.\u201d Gen Xers won\u2019t mind, of course, he adds: \u201cThey have that self-deprecating sense of humour.\u201d The term millennials did not really explode in popularity until well into the new millennium. For much of the 1990s, Howe points out, it did battle with rival labels such as Generation Y. That name, he says, \u201cwas almost always the more derogatory alternative. People used it to make the point that this new generation was everything the Xers were, but more extreme. More commercial, more risk-taking, totally over the top. You know, like \u2018Gen Xers are a little bit alienated from family life, but these kids are just off the charts.\u2019\u201d By contrast, he and Strauss were forecasting that millennials would be \u201ccloser to their family, more into community, more optimistic about the future\u201d. Talking about the differences between generations, Howe says now, is \u201clike a Rorschach test. You\u2019re talking about politics, culture, demography, social science, epidemiology. It acquires the colour of the emotion that the person who uses it wants it to have.\u201d If millennials mainly has a mocking or derogatory sense now, that says more about the older generations who use it that way than about millennials themselves. \u201cNaming a generation is like shooting a bullet into a cave and watching it ricochet everywhere,\u201d Howe says. \u201cYou never know where it\u2019s going to come out.\u201d Crowdsourcing For more than a decade, the hot buzzword for companies who want to profit from people\u2019s talent without paying for it has been crowdsourcing. This is a clever play on outsourcing (moving jobs to external contractors, or overseas), combined with an allusion to James Surowiecki\u2019s 2004 bestseller The Wisdom O f Crowds, which celebrated collaborative efforts such as Wikipedia, and the surprising accuracy of prediction markets, where aggregate betting on events such as elections can forecast outcomes better than experts. The word crowdsourcing was coined in June 2006, in an article for Wired by Jeff Howe. \u201cIndustries as disparate as pharmaceuticals and television [are discovering] ways to tap the latent talent of the crowd,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe labour isn\u2019t always free, but it costs a lot less than paying traditional employees. It\u2019s not outsourcing; it\u2019s crowdsourcing.\u201d It was an elegant, snappy introduction to a very successful coinage. Did Howe know he was doing that at the time? \u201cYou know, we actually kind of did, yeah,\u201d he says now. Two years previously, Wired\u2019s editor-in-chief, Chris Anderson, had coined the phrase \u201cthe Long Tail\u201d to describe the potential longterm viability of niche products on services such as Amazon or Netflix (then a DVD-rental business), and that had become a hit book. \u201cSo the term crowdsourcing was, in the very beginning, half meant to parody the emergence of such buzzwords,\u201d Howe says. At the same time, he was interested in the possibilities of the new collaborative model of creativity. \u201cOne thing about being at Wired in those days,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwas that we really did have our ear to the rail in terms of the tech industry and culture. So we knew the timing was right, that there was this thing starting to happen and no one knew what to call it.\u201d The word took off with amazing rapidity. \u201cWithin two weeks, there were 600,000 mentions on Google. And it never slowed down.\u201d He published a bestselling book of the same name in 2008, and is now a journalism professor at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cOne thing I\u2019d say is that we really did need a word at the time,\u201d Howe adds. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one of those bullshit marketing words that get adopted by management-consultant types. There was something really exciting taking place in the mid-2000s, and we didn\u2019t have a language for it yet.\u201d Indeed. Crowdsourcing might have been used since in cynical ways, and appropriated by huge brands such as Starbucks (which, since 2008 has solicited customer improvements through its My Starbucks Idea website) and McDonald\u2019s (which in 2014 sold \u201ccrowdsourced\u201d burgers), but it can also describe the kind of global altruistic effort that only the internet makes possible. According to Google Trends, the word\u2019s peak search popularity occurred in March 2014, when eight million people around the world used their computer skills to search for Malaysia Airlines plane Flight MH370, which vanished after taking off and was presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean. They didn\u2019t find the plane, but this kind of effort, as well as the collaborative news investigations of outlets such as Bellingcat, is what gives crowdsourcing a good name. Binge-watching There\u2019s something about the phrase binge-watching that sums up not only modern modes of media consumption but our whole culture. It\u2019s the perfect metaphor for Netflix-era humans, whom Aristotle would have called \u201cincontinent\u201d in their desires: wanting more and more of the same, with no patience or self-control. We are all the toddlers who fail the notorious (and lately disputed) marshmallow test, according to which a child who is able to wait for a sweet at a tender age will turn out to be more self-reliant and successful as an adult. In northern English dialect, to binge meant to soak a wooden barrel, and so a binge came to mean, from the 19th century, a drinking spree, as it is defined in a Northamptonshire dictionary of the time: \u201cA man goes to the alehouse to get a good binge, or to binge himself.\u201d The word binge-watching, too, dates from more innocent times: still long before the advent of online streaming. It is first recorded in 1996, when to watch all the episodes of a series in a row meant acquiring a set of VHS tapes. That is what a science graduate student in New England named Bob Donahue was looking for when he posted the following to a local Usenet discussion group that year: \u201cI\u2019ve just become hooked on The X-Files, so I\u2019m a little behind... Does anyone by ANY chance have tapes of this show back to season 1 they\u2019d be willing to lend me so I can effectively catch up? I\u2019d be more than happy to travel out to wherever to get them and then bring them back (actually there are three of us who all got hooked at the same time, so I\u2019d predict that there\u2019d be some MASSIVE binge-watching right away! :-)\u201d. \u201cWhat a cool revelation!\u201d Donahue says now, when I tell him that he probably coined the phrase. \u201cBut, to be honest, I have zero recollection as to whether I made up the phrase off-the-cuff, or if I was using something I had heard before. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve had no thoughts about it over the years because, honestly, I don\u2019t remember doing it.\u201d After a career as an astrophysicist and now a web developer for an educational foundation, Donahue still occasionally does the thing he named: \u201cSome shows \u2013 like Game Of Thrones \u2013 are just too irresistible.\u201d After he coined binge-watching as a gerund (or verbal noun), the verb \u201cto binge-watch\u201d followed. It is also first recorded on Usenet, where someone in 1998 asked in a post: \u201cDo you ever binge watch (marathon)?\u201d This was also in the context of The X-Files, so really, it was Scully and Mulder who started it all. In online lexicographical history, the truth is out there. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s one of the cool things about the internet,\u201d Donahue says. \u201cYou never know what sort of reach something you say will have.\u201d Gammon On 8 June 2017, the British children\u2019s author Ben Davis was drunkenly hate-watching Question Time on BBC One. Fed up, he tweeted a picture of various red-faced older men who had been speaking from the audience, and wrote: \u201cWhatever happens, hopefully politicians will start listening to young ppl after this. This Great Wall of gammon has had its way long enough.\u201d \u201cWhen I sent out that tweet, even in my drunken state, I had no inkling it would have any impact,\u201d Davis says. \u201cI thought it would get lost in the ether. When I started getting requests from serious news organisations to discuss gammon, my conviction that the world had gone irrevocably insane only deepened.\u201d Gammon, it turned out, had legs: it was joyously adopted by the left to describe flushed, middle-aged white people with reactionary views and, in time, anyone pro-Brexit. A year later, baffled Americans were discussing how Brits were now having a serious debate about whether gammon was a racist word. This was in part because a Northern Irish MP, Emma Little-Pengelly of the DUP, had tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m appalled by the term \u2018gammon\u2019 now frequently entering the lexicon of so many (mainly on the left) &amp; seemingly be [sic] accepted. This is a term based on skin colour &amp; age \u2013 stereotyping by colour or age is wrong no matter what race, age or community. It\u2019s just wrong.\u201d Other commentators retorted that gammon could not possibly be racist and was fine as a word with which to abuse, you know, gammons. In more sedate corners of the media, some devotees of philology explored the historical context: in 18th-century thieves\u2019 jargon, a gammon was someone who distracted the mark\u2019s attention; in the 19th century, gammon could also mean stuff and nonsense, of the kind a modern gammon might perhaps spout. The journalist Caitlin Moran deserves some share of the originating credit, too, for having described David Cameron in 2012 as \u201ca slightly camp gammon robot\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m in two minds about the gammon thing,\u201d Davis says now. \u201cWhen it\u2019s used against genuine bigots, I\u2019m fine with it. When I see it used as shorthand for a working-class person, I\u2019m not so keen. I\u2019m also not exactly proud of creating another weapon in the online culture war, which shows no signs of stopping.\u201d Is there a message in this story, too, about how social media and alcohol are perhaps not the safest bedfellows? \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that was my only foray into drunk-tweeting and I\u2019m certain it will be my last,\u201d Davis says. \u201cIn fact, I think all electronic-communications devices should be fitted with breathalysers.\u201d \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word For Every Day Of The Year is published by Quercus at \u00a314.99.

      "bodyText": "Pacesetters Threatening to runaway with things are West Brom and Leeds. This time last season nine points separated the top six but Slaven Bilic\u2019s free-scoring Albion \u2013 only Manchester City have more league goals across England\u2019s top five tiers \u2013 have established considerably more breathing space at the summit. Bilic has made his first taste of managing in the so-called madhouse look easy, so much so that his side have soared to the 50-point mark without appearing to work up too much of a sweat, and the sense is there is plenty of oomph to come. West Brom are eight points better off than they were last campaign while Leeds are only a point worse off. Not that they should be worried, with Ben White\u2019s form in the division\u2019s best defence and the stealth of Kalvin Phillips major boons. Leeds could be forgiven for not getting too giddy \u2013 they imploded towards the end of last season and this month had to settle for a point after leading a 10-man Cardiff by three goals at Elland Road. Whether Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s stubbornness over Eddie Nketiah comes back to bite remains to be seen; the Arsenal striker is yet to start a league match since joining on loan in August. Play-off chasers Beneath the top two things are splendidly congested between a flurry of teams with clear imperfections, with seven points separating third-placed Sheffield Wednesday and Queens Park Rangers in 14th. For Wednesday, who have made impressive strides since Garry Monk took charge in September, the elephant in the room is the EFL misconduct charge over the sale of Hillsborough, with their fate in the hands of an independent disciplinary commission. Fulham, propelled by the division\u2019s 17-goal leading scorer, Aleksandar Mitrovic, are fourth, level on points with a vibrant Preston, while a slick Brentford are primed for a tilt at the play-offs after tightening up at the back. Not so long ago Tony Mowbray was feeling the heat at Blackburn but they are one of the form teams and unbeaten in seven games. A youthful Swansea have blown hot and cold under Steve Cooper but remain in the mix, largely thanks to Andr\u00e9 Ayew. The Ghanaian is the club\u2019s highest earner, taking home around \u00a380,000 a week but the striker has proved a priceless commodity, hitting double figures in goals to keep them in the hunt. Across the Severn Bridge, Bristol City have wobbled in recent weeks and crave to add that kind of firepower in January. Sabri Lamouchi seemed to have sussed out how to return Nottingham Forest to the big time but a so-far dreadful December \u2013 played four, won none \u2013 has caused panic and they need to ease the goalscoring burden on Lewis Grabban. If Hull can repel interest and cling on to Jarrod Bowen \u2013 51 goals in 118 league games, including 15 in 23 this season, is an extraordinary return for a right-winger \u2013 then they will fancy their chances, while Cardiff have been steady if unspectacular since Neil Harris took the reins, losing only once. Meanwhile 13th-placed Millwall, for whom Jed Wallace is enjoying a fine season, have benefited from an upturn in results since Gary Rowett replaced Harris; they have lost two of Rowett\u2019s 10 matches. Strugglers It is increasingly hard to believe but the bottom club Stoke City have the most expensively assembled squad in the division, weighing in at more than \u00a3140m, and another \u00a350m-worth of talent out on loan. Back-to-back wins in Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s first games in charge perhaps sugar-coated the size of the task, with Stoke taking a measly four points from the past available 18. Luton must shore up the leakiest defence in the division while Middlesbrough have been unconvincing at best under Jonathan Woodgate. Danny Cowley and his brother Nicky were managing Braintree Town three years ago and have injected belief into Huddersfield after they became the first of the six second-tier clubs to change managers this season. The one constant throughout has been the outstanding Karlan Grant, who has scored 16 goals in 36 appearances since joining from Charlton in January. No team have been cut adrift and three consecutive draws have halted that sinking feeling at Wigan, who are a point from safety despite not winning since October. After a promising start Charlton have hit a brick wall but Lee Bowyer\u2019s injury-hit side are six points above the drop zone.

The 22-year-old former Portsmouth striker Conor Chaplin has been central to their mini-revival, having scored seven goals since the Austrian\u2019s arrival in mid-November.

On the one hand, huge amounts of energy are going into reforesting the world. The amount of tree cover <a href=\"https://today.umd.edu/articles/umd-research-finds-more-tree-cover-less-rainforest-02a14410-cafa-4a54-a7f8-bd89ebb08b09\" title=\"\">is actually rising</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.bonnchallenge.org/content/challenge\" title=\"\">2011 Bonn challenge</a> aims to bring 350m hectares (864.5m acres) of degraded land into restoration by 2030, and countries have already signed up 170m hectares. A impressive number of sometimes surprising countries have increased their forest cover by more than 20% over the last 25 years: China, Belarus, Chile, France, Greece, India, Iran, Morocco, the Philippines, Spain, Thailand and Turkey. It can really, at moments, seem like some kind of success story.</p> <p>But the ancient forests, the original, complex, messy forests, continue to disappear, and some of the most enthusiastic signatories to the Bonn challenge have seen some of the <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/qindicators.cshtml\" title=\"\">worst losses</a>. Argentina, for example, has committed to planting 1m hectares, but meanwhile the ancient Gran Chaco in the north continues to vanish, replaced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/soy-destruction-deforestation-in-argentina-leads-straight-to-our-dinner-plates\" title=\"\">huge fields of soy</a> to feed the farm animals of the world.</p> <p>Cameroon, which holds part of the precious Congo basin rainforest, is offering to create 12m hectares of tree cover by 2030, but since 1990 more than 20% of Cameroon\u2019s forests have been cut down to make way for subsistence farmers and now, increasingly, for banana and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/19/palm-oil-ingredient-biscuits-shampoo-environmental\" title=\"\">palm oil plantations</a>, to create products that end up in our supermarket shopping baskets. Nigeria may feel better about itself after pledging to plant a million hectares, but the fact is that over the last 25 years it has lost more than 10 times that amount, more than half its forests. For a number of years it even had the highest deforestation rate in the world, but it was <a href=\"https://www.rainforesttrust.org/ghana-lost-over-half-of-its-rainforest-in-2018-rainforest-trust-refuge-expansion-will-combat-further-deforestation/\" title=\"\">overtaken</a> this year by Ghana, where cocoa bean crops for our chocolate are replacing the rainforests.</p> <p>And let\u2019s not dwell too long on the countries where the rate of loss is just as high and dramatic but are not even bothering to sign up to Bonn such as Bolivia (80,000 square kilometres gone between 1990 and 2015), North Korea (33,000), Paraguay (58,000) and Indonesia (a breathtaking 275,000km\u2072 \u2013 an area larger than New Zealand).</p> <p>Even the apparently cheering news that global tree cover is growing is less than it seems, explains Tim Rayden,who works for the Wildlife Conservation Society, part of the Trillion Trees partnership. \u201cThere is a big difference between tree cover and forests.\u201d A large number of countries, for example, are planning to fill their commitments with commercial plantations \u2013 but plantations, which are harvested every 10 years or more regularly, are very much less effective than tropical forests at capturing carbon. He points to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01026-8\" title=\"\">recent research</a> where scientists worked out the carbon capture potential of three different reforestation scenarios under the terms of the Bonn challenge. If the 350m hectares of reforestation are all natural forest, they can capture as much as 42 petagrams of carbon. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ipcc\" title=\"\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> believes that to keep global warming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">below 1.5C</a> 199 petagrams must be removed from the atmosphere this century, so that is a significant contribution from the world\u2019s forests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5ad807930abd2e6d8a4322e0bc7002d8c5799d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5ad807930abd2e6d8a4322e0bc7002d8c5799d9/171_0_5130_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deforestation in Argentina's Gran Chaco\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Argentina, for example, has committed to planting 1m hectares, but meanwhile the ancient Gran Chaco in the north continues to vanish.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Mighty Earth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, if the trajectory of the plans already submitted carries on, at least 45% of that cover will be commercial plantation. If our natural forests are protected under that scenario, the storage potential will be 16 petagrams. But if we continue to chop into them in the same way that we do at present, the storage potential will dwindle to just three petagrams.</p> <p>We wipe out whatever is complex and other and difficult to manage, and replace it with nice, easy farms and plantations full of monocultures of pigs and corn and wheat and palm oil. We like things nice and simple and symmetrical and easy to control, that\u2019s the problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/amazon-matter-of-life-and-death-for-all-of-us-we-must-fight-for-it\">The Amazon is a matter of life and death for all of us.

Consumers are increasingly aware of the problem, according to Chris West of the Stockholm Environment Institute at the University of York. Politicians know that something has to change. Brazil, for example, came in for serious criticism over the Amazon fires during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-25-un-climate-change-conference\" title=\"\">Madrid climate change talks</a>. In many ways, say campaigners, the terrible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/23/amazon-fires-what-is-happening-anything-we-can-do\" title=\"\">Amazon fires</a> last summer have helped to focus the world\u2019s attention on these incredibly precious living organisms that we take so very much for granted.</p> <p>But, as usual with this environment lark, there is a dangerous time lag between becoming aware of the problem and stopping it from happening.

On the one hand, huge amounts of energy are going into reforesting the world. The amount of tree cover is actually rising. The 2011 Bonn challenge aims to bring 350m hectares (864.5m acres) of degraded land into restoration by 2030, and countries have already signed up 170m hectares. A impressive number of sometimes surprising countries have increased their forest cover by more than 20% over the last 25 years: China, Belarus, Chile, France, Greece, India, Iran, Morocco, the Philippines, Spain, Thailand and Turkey. It can really, at moments, seem like some kind of success story. But the ancient forests, the original, complex, messy forests, continue to disappear, and some of the most enthusiastic signatories to the Bonn challenge have seen some of the worst losses. Argentina, for example, has committed to planting 1m hectares, but meanwhile the ancient Gran Chaco in the north continues to vanish, replaced by huge fields of soy to feed the farm animals of the world. Cameroon, which holds part of the precious Congo basin rainforest, is offering to create 12m hectares of tree cover by 2030, but since 1990 more than 20% of Cameroon\u2019s forests have been cut down to make way for subsistence farmers and now, increasingly, for banana and palm oil plantations, to create products that end up in our supermarket shopping baskets. Nigeria may feel better about itself after pledging to plant a million hectares, but the fact is that over the last 25 years it has lost more than 10 times that amount, more than half its forests. For a number of years it even had the highest deforestation rate in the world, but it was overtaken this year by Ghana, where cocoa bean crops for our chocolate are replacing the rainforests. And let\u2019s not dwell too long on the countries where the rate of loss is just as high and dramatic but are not even bothering to sign up to Bonn such as Bolivia (80,000 square kilometres gone between 1990 and 2015), North Korea (33,000), Paraguay (58,000) and Indonesia (a breathtaking 275,000km\u2072 \u2013 an area larger than New Zealand). Even the apparently cheering news that global tree cover is growing is less than it seems, explains Tim Rayden,who works for the Wildlife Conservation Society, part of the Trillion Trees partnership. \u201cThere is a big difference between tree cover and forests.\u201d A large number of countries, for example, are planning to fill their commitments with commercial plantations \u2013 but plantations, which are harvested every 10 years or more regularly, are very much less effective than tropical forests at capturing carbon. He points to recent research where scientists worked out the carbon capture potential of three different reforestation scenarios under the terms of the Bonn challenge. If the 350m hectares of reforestation are all natural forest, they can capture as much as 42 petagrams of carbon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes that to keep global warming below 1.5C 199 petagrams must be removed from the atmosphere this century, so that is a significant contribution from the world\u2019s forests. However, if the trajectory of the plans already submitted carries on, at least 45% of that cover will be commercial plantation. If our natural forests are protected under that scenario, the storage potential will be 16 petagrams. But if we continue to chop into them in the same way that we do at present, the storage potential will dwindle to just three petagrams. We wipe out whatever is complex and other and difficult to manage, and replace it with nice, easy farms and plantations full of monocultures of pigs and corn and wheat and palm oil. We like things nice and simple and symmetrical and easy to control, that\u2019s the problem. One possible attempt to staunch some of the flow that is being seriously considered in the EU is a due diligence law. France already has a law that places a civil liability on large companies that fail to monitor their supply chains for human rights and environment issues, and support for Europe-wide regulation \u2013 although not necessarily in that form \u2013 is coming from the oddest quarters such as Nestl\u00e9 and Mondelez. There are other green shoots of optimism too. Consumers are increasingly aware of the problem, according to Chris West of the Stockholm Environment Institute at the University of York. Politicians know that something has to change. Brazil, for example, came in for serious criticism over the Amazon fires during the Madrid climate change talks. In many ways, say campaigners, the terrible Amazon fires last summer have helped to focus the world\u2019s attention on these incredibly precious living organisms that we take so very much for granted. But, as usual with this environment lark, there is a dangerous time lag between becoming aware of the problem and stopping it from happening. Trees may quite literally grow on trees (all right, just beneath them). But they grow slowly \u2013 and fall before the axes so quickly. \u2022 Bibi van der Zee is a Guardian journalist This article was amended on 3 January 2020: Tim Rayden currently works for the Wildlife Conservation Society, part of the Trillion Trees partnership, not the Oxford Forestry Institute, as we said in an earlier version.",

      "bodyText": "If you happen to find yourself at Embankment station on the London Underground, pay particular attention to the tannoy: the station\u2019s \u201cMind the Gap\u201d announcement is pronounced in rich, theatrical tones, a voice you won\u2019t hear elsewhere on the network. The reason for that is touching \u2013 a story of love and loss that went viral recently when it was retold in a Twitter thread by John Bull, AKA @garius, erstwhile contributor to this site and editor of the London Reconnections blog that covers transport in impressively entertaining detail, and is well worth following if you\u2019re a fan of the kind of stories we tell at Guardian Cities. Bull writes: \u201cJust before Christmas 2012, staff at Embankment Tube station were approached by a woman who was very upset. She kept asking them where the voice had gone. They weren\u2019t sure what she meant. The Voice? The voice, she said. The man who says \u2018Mind the Gap\u2019.\u201d Staff reassured her that the announcement had simply been updated with a new digital system and new voices. \u201cThat voice,\u201d she explained, \u201cwas my husband.\u201d Sure enough, the voice belonged to Oswald Laurence, a Rada graduate and theatre actor who died in 2007. The recording dates back more than 45 years \u2013 and at one point could be heard along the length of the northbound Northern line before eventually being phased out \u2013 except at Embankment. In her grief, his devastated widow, Margaret McCollum, took comfort in travelling via the station and listening to her beloved husband\u2019s voice. Distressed by the fact she could no longer listen to Oswald\u2019s voice, she asked Transport for London if she could get a copy of the recording. Staff managed to track it down and worked to restore the announcement at Embankment station. \u201cAnd that is why today, even in 2019, if you go down to Embankment station in London, and sit on the northbound platform on Northern Line, you will here a COMPLETELY different voice say Mind the Gap to ANYWHERE else on the Underground. It\u2019s Oswald,\u201d says Bull. Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.<br></p>\n    <p>The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>According to arcane&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc2/pdf/CDOC-106sdoc2.pdf\">Senate rules</a>, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

And on a less grave note, Trump revealed in a video conference with US troops to deliver Christmas greetings that, despite it being the morning of 24 December, he had not yet bought his wife her Christmas present. And as for North Korea\u2019s warning of a \u201cChristmas gift\u201d for America amid stalled nuclear weapons talks, Trump said the US would \u201cdeal with it\u201d. Then he left for his golf course. On Tuesday, Christmas Eve, Trump accused the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, of uncertainty over the articles of impeachment, voted on in Washington last week, that charge the president with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On Monday House lawyers signaled in court filings that they were mulling an additional article of impeachment against Trump relating to obstruction of justice during the Trump-Russia investigation. They demanded that the former White House counsel Don McGahn testify and requested the release of grand jury material from the investigation. The current articles of impeachment center on Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s US political rivals, chiefly 2020 candidate Joe Biden, in return for crucial US military aid to the former Soviet republic. \u201cEverything we\u2019re seeing \u2026 suggests that they\u2019re in real doubt about the evidence they\u2019ve brought forth so far not being good enough, and are very, very urgently seeking a way to find some more evidence,\u201d the president tweeted early on Tuesday.

Not much, but a little time left.\u201d The president also said he and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, will have a signing ceremony for the first phase of the US-China trade deal agreed to this month. \u201cWe will be having a signing ceremony, yes,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWe will ultimately, yes, when we get together. And we\u2019ll be having a quicker signing because we want to get it done. The deal is done, it\u2019s just being translated right now.\u201d Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said both countries were in close contact. \u201cBoth sides\u2019 economic and trade teams are in close communication about detailed arrangements for the deal\u2019s signing and other follow-up work,\u201d Geng told a daily news briefing. He did not elaborate. Beijing has not yet confirmed specific components of the deal that were released by US officials. A spokesman for China\u2019s commerce ministry said last week the details would be made public after the official signing. Pool reporters were invited to Mar-a-Lago to watch the president\u2019s video address and ask questions. Trump said Democrats \u201cought to look back on the last year to see how they\u2019ve hurt this country\u201d. He added: \u201cIf you just go by what you see in the papers, it\u2019s incredible what\u2019s going on. We had dirty cops. We had people spying on my campaign. They did terrible things\u2026it\u2019s very sad.\u201d This despite the report earlier this month of the Department of Justice watchdog Michael Horowitz that said that despite some serious errors along the way, his principal conclusion was that the FBI\u2019s initiation of the Trump-Russia investigation was justified and was not motivated by political bias against Trump, nor involved what the Trump administration has called \u201cillegal spying\u201d. And the president said that in the face of any action over Christmas by North Korea, the US would \u201cdeal with it very successfully\u201d, while joking that maybe any such gift would be \u201ca beautiful vase as opposed to a missile test\u201d. Later, for the third day in a row, Trump travelled by presidential motorcade to the nearby Trump International Golf Club. The Trumps attended Christmas Eve service at a Southern Baptist Convention-affiliated church before celebrating the holiday with dinner in the ballroom of his private club. The pastor of Family Church in West Palm Beach, Florida, Jimmy Scroggins, and his family greeted the Trumps as they arrived and took their reserved seats in the church\u2019s third pew. Attending Family Church was a change of pace for the Trumps, who had attended holiday services in the past at Bethesda-by-the-Sea, the Episcopal Church in Palm Beach at which they were married in 2005. The Trumps then returned to his private club for Christmas Eve dinner. Trump, less than a week after being impeached by the House, did not respond when asked by a reporter if he prayed for Nancy Pelosi at church, but he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a great year.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What\u2019s your favourite Christmas movie? You\u2019ll have an easy answer to this, of course, because at this time of year it suddenly becomes very important to not only tell everyone about your love for one specific Christmas film, but also to defend it no matter what. People have died defending their choice of Christmas film. It has ripped families asunder. It\u2019s like a happier, less pointless Brexit.</p> <p>Your favourite Christmas movie is a defining aspect of who you are. If you like <em>Scrooged</em> then you do your best to disguise your soft centre with acts of practised cynicism. If you like <em>A Charlie Brown </em><em>Christmas</em> you\u2019re a die-hard nostalgist convinced that the world is constantly getting worse. If, like me, your favourite Christmas movie is the 2000 Nicolas Cage romantic comedy-drama <em>The Family Man</em>, then you\u2019re really cool and obscure and all your friends are jealous about your amazing taste.</p> <p>To better illustrate my point, let\u2019s single out six of the most popular Christmas films and explore what they say about the people who love them.</p> <h2>Love, Actually</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f9dbc86b5986957ceed5a070a7a0407e316bc40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f9dbc86b5986957ceed5a070a7a0407e316bc40/0_175_2047_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It makes you laugh, then breaks you\u2019: Hugh Grant, Billy Campbell and Martine McCutcheon in Love, Actually.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It makes you laugh, then breaks you\u2019: Hugh Grant, Billy Campbell and Martine McCutcheon in Love, Actually.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Working Title/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oh, you old romantic. When you think of Christmas, you automatically think of Hugh Grant\u2019s opening speech about the emotional power of airports. You see people hurling themselves at long-lost family members, wrapping themselves in an embrace of unbreakable love.</p> <p>But the part of <em>Love, Actually</em> you most connect with is where Emma Thompson wordlessly realises that her husband has been unfaithful to her. Sure, the rest of it makes you laugh. You chortled when Andrew Lincoln tried to #MeToo Keira Knightley. You guffawed throughout all those weird bits where Martin Freeman and Joanna Page keep dry-humping, even though everyone always seems to forget that they were even in the film. But the Emma Thompson scene reminds you that all humans are ultimately untrustworthy and your heart will be exploded into smithereens the instant you put an ounce of your faith in another person. You are broken beyond repair. All people who like <em>Love, Actually</em> are broken beyond repair.</p> <h2>Miracle on 34th Street</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6823c9ed7ea442cb064281297e4490c04751eb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6823c9ed7ea442cb064281297e4490c04751eb4/0_0_2508_1504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One for the traditionalists: Natalie Wood and Edmund Gween in Miracle on 34th Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One for the traditionalists: Natalie Wood and Edmund Gween in Miracle on 34th Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You know what you are? You\u2019re a traditionalist. You like things to be done the way they\u2019ve always been done. Christmas Day begins at 7am sharp, with a hearty glass of room-temperature tap water. Your presents all come in the form of perfect cubes, wrapped in red or green but definitely no other colour. You cut your sprouts neatly in half with a knife before slowly chewing them. Paxo. Crackers. The Queen. Quick argument with the family and then off to bed. That\u2019s Christmas.</p> <p>So, of course, <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em> is your favourite Christmas film. This is a film as films should be. Compared with almost any other Christmas movie, it comes off as drab and featureless \u2013 \u201cThis is just a courtroom drama!\u201d your grandchildren keep whining, \u201cThe legal process isn\u2019t particularly festive!\u201d \u2013 but you remember that it won three Oscars. That still means something to you. Did <em>Jingle All The Way</em> win three Oscars? Did <em>Christmas </em><em>with </em><em>the Kranks</em>? Hardly. \u201cThey\u2019ll learn one day,\u201d you think as the end credits roll and you joylessly bite down on another dry mouthful of the Christmas cake you only bought out of a sense of grim duty. \u201cThey\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p> <h2>The Muppet Christmas Carol</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"112a8288e0e18fcffe04b3b7c6af96b0cb148520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/112a8288e0e18fcffe04b3b7c6af96b0cb148520/0_51_1605_963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Come for the comedy, stay for the emotion: Kermit in The Muppet Christmas Carol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Come for the comedy, stay for the emotion\u2019: Kermit in The Muppet Christmas Carol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, you miss your childhood. Second, your childhood happened in the 1990s. I know this to be true, because I love <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> and when, a few years ago, I attended a screening of the film, every person there appeared to have been born on the same day as me. There is an entire generation that counts <em>Muppet Christmas Carol</em> as a cornerstone of their upbringing.</p> <p>The fact that you have re-evaluated the film as an adult, and still love it, speaks volumes. You see, this isn\u2019t a very Muppety Muppet movie. There aren\u2019t as many rampant Muppet shenanigans as, say, <em>The Great Muppet </em><em>Caper</em> or <em>The Muppets Take Manhattan</em>. It is, for the most part, a traditional retelling of the Dickens classic underpinned by a surprisingly committed Michael Caine performance. You enjoy the emotion of it rather than the comedy; especially the \u201cTiny Tim, who did NOT die\u201d line, which you count as cinema\u2019s greatest moment of catharsis. There will be one time in your life when, for whatever reason, you will begin crying as soon as this film starts and you won\u2019t stop until 20 minutes after it ends. I think basically you need a hug.</p> <h2>Die Hard</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc7ba57aeffd05117b0e72090df9f77acbc36493\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc7ba57aeffd05117b0e72090df9f77acbc36493/0_111_3114_1869/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s a good film, not a Christmas film\u2019: Bruce Willis in Die Hard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s a good film, not a Christmas film\u2019: Bruce Willis in Die Hard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nobody actually believes that <em>Die Hard</em> is their favourite Christmas film.

Yes, it\u2019s arguably one of the most influential films of all time. And, yes, it happens to take place at Christmas. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a Christmas film. Loads of films are set at Christmas. <em>Iron Man 3</em> is set at Christmas, for crying out loud, but that doesn\u2019t make it a Christmas film. <em>Die Hard</em> lacks the spirit of Christmas, and that\u2019s the most important thing.

It isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s favourite Christmas movie. What you like is the last five minutes of <em>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life</em>, which is so sweet that it makes you forget that you\u2019ve just spent the last two hours watching a man get punched in the face by the universe so hard that he ends up attempting suicide.</p> <p>Oh, wait, you don\u2019t agree? You actually do like the entirety of <em>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life</em>? Which bit do you like best? The bit where James Stewart is constantly punished for doing the right thing in a demonstration that nice guys always finish last? Or do you like the bit where Clarence shows Stewart that his absence would single-handedly cause an entire town to slide into moral and financial ruin? If it\u2019s the first, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019re a men\u2019s rights activist who worships at the temple of <a href=\"https://www.neilstrauss.com/\" title=\"\">Neil Strauss</a>. If it\u2019s the second, you\u2019re a solipsistic egomaniac who grossly overestimates the value of their life. </p> <h2>Elf</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0be624116f70bfe43adbd168dd45b7725f2ced24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0be624116f70bfe43adbd168dd45b7725f2ced24/0_299_1733_1995/869.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This film is perfect; you are perfect\u2019: Will Ferrell in Elf.\" width=\"869\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This film is perfect; you are perfect\u2019: Will Ferrell in Elf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/New Line</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is always an exception to every rule, and I think in this case it might be <em>Elf</em>.

Written when science was being \u201cmastered\u201d, and drawing on concerns about social alienation and the exploitation of nature, Frankenstein was also written when the word loneliness was just emerging. It contains just two references to loneliness (and one of those is a lonely road, reflecting its unemotional origin as a synonym for solitude).

      "body": "<p>Jane Rogers has written some highly regarded literary fiction, not least her fine historical novel <em>Mr Wroe\u2019s Virgins</em> in 1991. But she\u2019s no stranger to science fiction, either: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/03/testament-jessie-lamb-rogers-review\" title=\"\">The Testament of Jessie Lamb</a></em>, about a near future in which a virus is killing off pregnant women, won the 2012 Arthur C Clarke award. Her new novel is another sci-fi dystopia, set in a Britain in which the bulk of the population are stuck in mega \u201cestates\u201d (\u201c81% of children born on estates have never been off them\u201d, we\u2019re told; \u201c90% have never seen the sea or a live animal\u201d), living hardscrabble lives, addicted to immersive virtual reality games and pornography.</p> <p>Into this grimly plausible extrapolation from today, Rogers drops the novel\u2019s main premise. A scientist called Luke Butler has come up with a way of uploading the consciousnesses of dead people into the bodies of the young. This technology has revolutionary potential, although Luke develops it both secretively and recklessly. He is, we\u2019re told, \u201con the spectrum\u201d personality-wise, which seems an odd explanation for his positively Frankensteinian disregard of consequences.</p> <p>Indeed, to get her story moving, Rogers has to indulge in a certain amount of bodging. Despite widespread poverty, it is commonplace for dead people to have their heads frozen. A machine that can upload not just consciousness but all of a dead brain\u2019s memories into a living body is more magic than science. The \u201cbody tourists\u201d enjoy their new life for a mere two weeks before disappearing again into oblivion. Why only a fortnight? Because, is why. Hosts are unaware of the tourists inhabiting them; they are paid \u00a310,000 to go to sleep and wake up two weeks later none the wiser. So rich old men and women get to enjoy again the intensities of life as the young experience it \u2013 adrenaline, sex, every meadow, grove and stream apparelled in celestial light, and so forth.</p> <p><em>Body Tourists</em> is assembled from various first-person narratives: tourists and hosts, rich and poor. There would be no story if things went smoothly, and the plot hits exactly the <em>Black</em><em> Mirror</em>-ish beats that you expect. Rather than return willingly to nothingness at the end of her allotted fortnight, one tourist runs off with her host\u2019s body. People die and Luke covers up the deaths with increasing incompetence. A wealthy rock star pays to have his dead father brought back, only for his trophy wife to start getting overfriendly with the old geezer \u2013 because, of course, said geezer is now wearing a handsome young body.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/03/testament-jessie-lamb-rogers-review\">The Testament of Jessie Lamb by Jane Rogers \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rogers touches on some pressing contemporary issues: body dysmorphia, gay and trans rights, child abuse and social immiseration. But too many targets mean that none gets properly developed. Luke\u2019s backer, an elderly billionaire called Gudrun, is a cartoon villain, blithely unconcerned at the deaths Luke\u2019s clinic keeps having to sweep under the carpet \u2013 \u201cWhoever made an omelette without breaking eggs?\u201d she sneers. Luke himself never comes alive as a character. A good portion of the story is devoted to Paula, a working-class young woman from the estates, and the novel ventriloquises her voice vividly and without condescension. More problematic are the sections narrated by Mary, the African-born mother of one of the hosts (\u201csometimes I think of the mzungu who inhabited my boy\u2019s body for two weeks, eh-eh\u201d), which come uncomfortably close to narrative blackface.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The handling of race seems not only derivative but thin compared with Jordan Peele\u2019s terrifying 2017 movie Get Out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A bigger issue is sheer belatedness: <em>Body Tourists</em>\u2019 premise is an old chestnut of genre SF. This doesn\u2019t have to matter, of course; it\u2019s possible to create a new spin on even the most hackneyed fictive notion, but this novel struggles to find novelty. The handling of race seems not only derivative but thin compared with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/28/get-out-box-office-jordan-peele\" title=\"\">Jordan Peele\u2019s terrifying 2017 movie </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/28/get-out-box-office-jordan-peele\" title=\"\">Get Out</a></em>, for instance. Robert Silverberg\u2019s <em>To Live Again </em>(1969) anticipates much of Rogers\u2019s story. There\u2019s a <em>Red Dwarf </em>episode that plays the premise for laughs. HG Wells was writing the idea into fiction as early as 1896 (\u201cThe Story of the Late Mr Elvesham\u201d). To be clear, the issue is not plagiarism, but the difficulties any creative artist faces working in so heavily overcrowded a field. </p> <p><em>Body Tourists</em> can\u2019t make up its mind whether it\u2019s pitching its story as pathos or satire. Rogers has a surer touch with the former, particularly a moving strand about a woman who dies after being accused of paedophilia, whose wife wants to bring her back to let her know that the law has posthumously cleared her name. But more of the novel is occupied with broad-brush outrage at social inequality, sometimes over-obvious and forced. Readers unfamiliar with SF may enjoy the thought-experimentation, but for SF fans <em>Body Tourists </em>will be more Torremolinos than fantastic voyage.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Body Tourists by Jane Rogers is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a316.99).

      "bodyText": "Jane Rogers has written some highly regarded literary fiction, not least her fine historical novel Mr Wroe\u2019s Virgins in 1991. But she\u2019s no stranger to science fiction, either: The Testament of Jessie Lamb, about a near future in which a virus is killing off pregnant women, won the 2012 Arthur C Clarke award. Her new novel is another sci-fi dystopia, set in a Britain in which the bulk of the population are stuck in mega \u201cestates\u201d (\u201c81% of children born on estates have never been off them\u201d, we\u2019re told; \u201c90% have never seen the sea or a live animal\u201d), living hardscrabble lives, addicted to immersive virtual reality games and pornography. Into this grimly plausible extrapolation from today, Rogers drops the novel\u2019s main premise. A scientist called Luke Butler has come up with a way of uploading the consciousnesses of dead people into the bodies of the young. This technology has revolutionary potential, although Luke develops it both secretively and recklessly. He is, we\u2019re told, \u201con the spectrum\u201d personality-wise, which seems an odd explanation for his positively Frankensteinian disregard of consequences. Indeed, to get her story moving, Rogers has to indulge in a certain amount of bodging. Despite widespread poverty, it is commonplace for dead people to have their heads frozen. A machine that can upload not just consciousness but all of a dead brain\u2019s memories into a living body is more magic than science. The \u201cbody tourists\u201d enjoy their new life for a mere two weeks before disappearing again into oblivion. Why only a fortnight? Because, is why. Hosts are unaware of the tourists inhabiting them; they are paid \u00a310,000 to go to sleep and wake up two weeks later none the wiser. So rich old men and women get to enjoy again the intensities of life as the young experience it \u2013 adrenaline, sex, every meadow, grove and stream apparelled in celestial light, and so forth. Body Tourists is assembled from various first-person narratives: tourists and hosts, rich and poor. There would be no story if things went smoothly, and the plot hits exactly the Black Mirror-ish beats that you expect. Rather than return willingly to nothingness at the end of her allotted fortnight, one tourist runs off with her host\u2019s body. People die and Luke covers up the deaths with increasing incompetence. A wealthy rock star pays to have his dead father brought back, only for his trophy wife to start getting overfriendly with the old geezer \u2013 because, of course, said geezer is now wearing a handsome young body. Rogers touches on some pressing contemporary issues: body dysmorphia, gay and trans rights, child abuse and social immiseration. But too many targets mean that none gets properly developed. Luke\u2019s backer, an elderly billionaire called Gudrun, is a cartoon villain, blithely unconcerned at the deaths Luke\u2019s clinic keeps having to sweep under the carpet \u2013 \u201cWhoever made an omelette without breaking eggs?\u201d she sneers. Luke himself never comes alive as a character. A good portion of the story is devoted to Paula, a working-class young woman from the estates, and the novel ventriloquises her voice vividly and without condescension. More problematic are the sections narrated by Mary, the African-born mother of one of the hosts (\u201csometimes I think of the mzungu who inhabited my boy\u2019s body for two weeks, eh-eh\u201d), which come uncomfortably close to narrative blackface. A bigger issue is sheer belatedness: Body Tourists\u2019 premise is an old chestnut of genre SF. This doesn\u2019t have to matter, of course; it\u2019s possible to create a new spin on even the most hackneyed fictive notion, but this novel struggles to find novelty. The handling of race seems not only derivative but thin compared with Jordan Peele\u2019s terrifying 2017 movie Get Out, for instance. Robert Silverberg\u2019s To Live Again (1969) anticipates much of Rogers\u2019s story. There\u2019s a Red Dwarf episode that plays the premise for laughs. HG Wells was writing the idea into fiction as early as 1896 (\u201cThe Story of the Late Mr Elvesham\u201d). To be clear, the issue is not plagiarism, but the difficulties any creative artist faces working in so heavily overcrowded a field. Body Tourists can\u2019t make up its mind whether it\u2019s pitching its story as pathos or satire. Rogers has a surer touch with the former, particularly a moving strand about a woman who dies after being accused of paedophilia, whose wife wants to bring her back to let her know that the law has posthumously cleared her name. But more of the novel is occupied with broad-brush outrage at social inequality, sometimes over-obvious and forced. Readers unfamiliar with SF may enjoy the thought-experimentation, but for SF fans Body Tourists will be more Torremolinos than fantastic voyage. \u2022 Body Tourists by Jane Rogers is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a316.99).

With a dozen confirmations last Thursday alone, Trump hit an end-of-year tally of 133 district court judges out of 677 total, 50 appeals court judges out of 179 total, and two US supreme court justices out of nine total. \u201cWhile Democrats in the House wasted all their time this week on a partisan impeachment,\u201d Vice-President Mike Pence tweeted jubilantly on Friday morning, \u201cthe Senate confirmed 13 new judges making that a total of 185 amazing judges picked by President @realDonaldTrump!\u201d Legal analysts have blasted Trump and McConnell for allowing an unprecedented number of nominees to advance who have staked out extreme philosophies or been flagged as unqualified by the American Bar Association (ABA), the country\u2019s largest non-partisan coalition of lawyers. Progressive activists additionally express alarm at the relative youth of many Trump nominees, who assume lifelong appointments upon confirmation. \u201cThe American people should be deeply troubled and scared as to the status of their rights and liberties over the next three to four decades,\u201d said Daniel Goldberg, legal director at the progressive Alliance For Justice. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that the next Democratic president prioritize the courts like never before. While Donald Trump has been able to get his judges confirmed, we have never seen progressives as galvanized on the court issue as they are now.\u201d The confirmation this month of Sarah Pitlyk to the district court in St Louis and Lawrence VanDyke to the 9th circuit court of appeals, both of whom were rated unqualified by the ABA, should give Americans cause for alarm, said Goldberg, whose group has produced the report Trump\u2019s Attacks on Our Justice System. Pitlyk \u201cspent her career fighting IVF and surrogacy\u201d and VanDyke \u201chas spent his career fighting environmental protections, women\u2019s rights and LGBTQ rights\u201d, Goldberg said. Trump\u2019s work on the courts would not have been possible without the assistance of McConnell, who blocked Obama judicial nominees and then relaxed Senate rules to accelerate the installation of Trump nominees. Another key Trump partner in the effort is the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group that has vetted judicial candidates and spoon-fed them to the White House. Blackman said that former Senate majority leader Harry Reid\u2019s 2013 decision to take the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d and abolish a rule requiring 60 votes to approve federal judicial appointments \u2013 a decision that followed unprecedented stalling on judicial appointments by then minority leader McConnell \u2013 had made it easier to confirm judges with ideologies outside the mainstream. \u201cI think because the nuclear option is gone, you no longer have to appeal to 60, you can appeal to 50,\u201d said Blackman. \u201cAnd I think with that, you have less of a need to appeal to the moderates, so I definitely think the tilt of the nominees is definitely away from the center.\u201d Tobias said that Trump\u2019s judicial record could help pave the way to his re-election. \u201cI think for many Republicans, who don\u2019t agree with a number of the Trump policies, they are willing to tolerate that in order to influence the judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially Evangelical Christians, who are substantially responsible for his election. \u201cIssues like abortion, LGBTQ rights, religious freedom \u2013 the judges are being chosen to take a particular view on those issues.\u201d",

It\u2019s hanging in her bathroom as a horse-themed towel. It\u2019s decorating her truck floor as muddy boots with spurs attached. It\u2019s her weekends and her escape. As an enrolled member of the more than 5,400-strong Little Shell Chippewa Tribe of Montana \u2013 which was, until recently, federally unrecognized and without a designated reservation \u2013 Simonson often felt removed from the larger Native American community and its culture. But rodeos have become her way of staying connected. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I crave \u2013 to constantly be going to another one,\u201d she says. Top: Simonson and her brother, Buckshot, wait for her run at the Copper Springs Ranch rodeo, just outside of Bozeman, Montana. Below: Details of the rodeo are peppered throughout Simonson\u2019s life. For the more than 400 other federally unrecognized, landless tribes in the US, communal spaces like rodeos have become integral. It\u2019s what Circe Sturm, a professor of anthropology and the co-director of the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Native American and Indigenous Studies program, calls a pan-Indian space. It allows people to come together to experience a sense of being Indigenous. \u201cWhen you have people who have had their land base disrupted, like the Little Shell community, then those spaces become very important,\u201d said Sturm. Simonson, who has been riding since she was three years old, regularly competes in the Indian National Finals Rodeo tour (INFR), the main Native American rodeo organization in the US. Most recently, she won the women\u2019s barrel racing tour championship for the 2019 season. In a barrel race, the rider and their horse burst straight out of the gate, kicking up thick, russet clods of dirt. Next they head for three barrels set up in a cloverleaf pattern around the arena, turning sharply around each before charging for the finish line at breakneck speed. Keira Simonson rides her horse, Diesel, during a rodeo barrel race. The INFR, formed in 1976, sanctions more than 700 rodeos a year across the US for people ages eight to 80. Women and girls\u2019 involvement in Indian rodeo has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s, says a spokesperson for the organization. And while mainstream American rodeo has long been dominated by white contestants, Simonson says that recent years have seen more Native Americans competing at pro rodeos and other open and amateur rodeos not specifically designated for Native Americans. In the remote north-eastern plains of Montana near the Canadian border, more than 30 miles from the nearest incorporated town, Simonson awakens most days around 8am on the family ranch. She shuffles to the stables to feed her beloved horse, Diesel, the first of several chores she and her brother, Buckshot Simonson, complete around the ranch. Simonson, age four, on her father\u2019s horse. Diesel was once described by a rodeo announcer as the fastest black horse he\u2019d ever seen. But in the days leading up to competition, Simonson rests her horse to keep him fresh. The bulk of her preparation lies in the logistics \u2013 travel plans, which she organizes in a color-coordinated calendar, and readying the trailer. Inside the black and silver gooseneck unit, there are hay bales, five-gallon buckets and jugs filled with grain and water, saddles, brushes, combs and clothing. There\u2019s even a bed made of wood chips a foot thick for Diesel to sleep on in the horse stalls. \u201cHe loves it. Some people will walk by and be like, \u2018Is your horse alive?\u2019 recalled Simonson about Diesel\u2019s sleeping arrangements in the trailer. Top and bottom: Keira Simonson readies for competition by resting her horse and prepping her trailer. At the INFR events, Simonson says she\u2019s developed a makeshift family, where she can joke around using \u201cNative humor\u201d \u2013 sarcastic, loud and full of laughter. She can share her Native American experience, and learn about different tribes and practices along the way, including her own. But even at those rodeos, she says she feels white compared with everyone else. Her mother is half Little Shell, half white, while her father is white. At other rodeos, she sometimes feels acutely aware of her darker skin and hair, and the stereotypes that come with her appearance. \u201cThey probably look at me and they think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s just Native\u2019,\u201d said Simonson. Simonson jokes around with her aunt, Billie Jo, and her mother, Judy, while waiting for her brother\u2019s run at the Copper Springs Ranch barrel race. The Little Shell Chippewa, like many Native American tribes, have a complicated relationship with identity due to European colonization. The Little Shell Chippewa are successors of the historical Pembina Band of Chippewa Indians \u2013 a part of the Ojibwe, also known as the Chippewa, tribe \u2013 whose land included more than 60m acres throughout the northern midwestern US and north into Canada. In the early 19th century, French men came from the north and married into many Ojibwe families. Photos from recent races hang on the wall in Simonson\u2019s home. The absence of culture and community are common among Little Shell people as a result of being landless, says Kim McKeehan, a Little Shell Tribal Council member and mental health therapist. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have a place to practice cultural practices or build an economy. Those are the things that really create community,\u201d said McKeehan. McKeehan explains that the lack of community can permeate into individuals\u2019 sense of identity and belonging, too. But she says it\u2019s also made Little Shell people incredibly resilient and independent. \u201cJust because cultural traditions and languages were washed out of the mouths of our grandmothers and beaten out of our communities doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not ours still. We can reach back and get them.\u201d Simonson and Alexis Rose, a close friend, on horseback together at the first University of Montana rodeo team practice of 2019 in February, outside of Lolo, Montana. The Little Shell do not yet have a reservation of their own, having refused to sign a land treaty with the US in the late 19th century that they believed to be unjust. But this state of limbo will soon change. A bill that would provide 200 acres of reservation land was approved by Congress this year as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and was signed into law by Donald Trump just before Christmas. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s surreal,\u201d said the Little Shell chairman, Gerald Gray. \u201cIt was a long, long road for us \u2013 for everybody. It\u2019s a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.\u201d The reservation will still take at least a year to materialize, said Gray. He added that there\u2019s no blueprint for newly recognized tribes, so they want to take their time to do it right. \u201cMy motto has always been the squeaky wheel gets the grease. I will always be loud and proud. I\u2019ll never stop until this actually gets done.\u201d Simonson saddles up her barrel racing horse, Diesel, while her mother gets a bridle from their trailer.",

      "body": "<p>Motsi Mabuse is remembering the rough dance halls of apartheid-era South Africa and the shocking sights she would see as she took her first tentative steps across their floors. \u201cWhen we had competitions,\u201d she says, \u201cwe didn\u2019t have security and people would be drunk and starting fights. We were just kids and we\u2019d watch people with knives running through while we were in the middle of a routine. Compared to that, Strictly isn\u2019t so difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Mabuse, the newest judge on Strictly Come Dancing, first fell for the glitterball world at the age of nine after watching couples waltz, swing and cha-cha-cha while on holiday in Durban. \u201cWhat I love about my parents is that they didn\u2019t say: \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 They found a way. But we had a lot of backlash, being the only black kids. People would laugh at us and call us names. We were bullied, but we just kept on coming back \u2013 and then we beat them.\u201d</p> <p>It is a memory that suggests Mabuse was destined to find her way to Strictly: even before the BBC\u2019s sequinned spectacular started owning Saturday night, she was living its spirit \u2013 if not going beyond it, breaking through the barriers of apartheid, one dance at a time. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t expect black people to be in ballgowns,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe were living in segregation \u2013 we had to get separate buses to school. The doors were never open. We had to fight our way in.\u201d</p> <p>All of which gave her the thick skin you need in order to survive in the cut-throat world of competitive dance. There is certainly no shortage of big personalities on the Strictly judging panel: it\u2019s tough to make your mark when you are up against Craig Revel Horwood\u2019s panto villainy, Bruno Tonioli\u2019s ants-in-his-pants camp and Shirley Ballas\u2019s technical fastidiousness. But 38-year-old Mabuse has swiftly become known for her emotional outpourings \u2013 weeping after the Paralympian Will Bayley\u2019s routine and barely disguising her annoyance when fellow South African professional Johannes Radebe and actor Catherine Tyldesley were voted out. And then there is her penchant for a glamorous ballgown and her sleekly coiffed hair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8334e541df6d8613d08f94f8b89f7bd3014ad020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8334e541df6d8613d08f94f8b89f7bd3014ad020/0_492_2890_3613/800.jpg\" alt=\"Motsi Mabuse: \u2018People said I would be too biased towards my sister.

Minus her glittery nails, she gestures instead with forkfuls of bacon and sausage. \u201cThis is really me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a different person on screen.\u201d</p> <p>Mabuse is no newcomer to judging, having been on the panel of Let\u2019s Dance, Germany\u2019s version of Strictly, for the past 11 years. Her sister, Oti, is one of the pros on Strictly, and the pair joked that Motsi should replace Darcey Bussell when she stepped down last year. And then, just weeks later, Motsi got the call. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>Strictly regularly tops 10 million viewers, so the pressure is on for Mabuse, especially as she admits she doesn\u2019t speak English that well after living in Germany for 20 years. \u201cThe tabloids are intense,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople said I would be too biased towards my sister. But I live in my own bubble.\u201d She has received messages accusing her of being too flamboyant and, when she was first hired, the former Dancing on Ice judge Louie Spence called her a \u201cnobody\u201d, accusing the BBC of \u201cbox-ticking\u201d for diversity.</p> <p>There has also been speculation about rifts between the Mabuse sisters, with papers claiming they \u201cnever\u201d see each other despite being on the same show. Motsi maintains they are still on good terms: \u201cOti has been so supportive. After the first show we were both in tears, so proud of each other.\u201d Similar suggestions have been raised about her relationship with Ballas. \u201cShirley and I have respect for where we come from \u2013 a dance world which is very male-dominated. We\u2019re tough girls.\u201d</p> <p>She may know the drill when it comes to judging, but she finds the British \u201cfar more fast-paced. Working here has taught me the meaning of professionalism.\u201d What about her relationship with the other judges? \u201cEveryone is very nice, but we\u2019re all artists, so we give each other space.\u201d They only really see each other for rehearsals and recording the show.</p> <p>In 2000, Mabuse moved to Germany to dance competitively. She went on to marry her Ukrainian dance partner, Evgenij Voznyuk, and they now live near Hamburg with their 15-month-old daughter. Initially, she didn\u2019t encounter any issues there, but she now feels the country is far more divided. \u201cI don\u2019t get that involved in politics because I\u2019m in my dance bubble,\u201d she says, but she does feel that diversity is treated as a \u201cfad\u201d in Germany. \u201cIn Britain, it feels part of your history. In Germany, it feels as if it\u2019s just fashionable for now. In three years, who knows what the country will look like? I just want my daughter to grow up in a society where she feels accepted being South African, German and Ukrainian.\u201d</p> <p>Mabuse was 18 when she left for Germany. Oti, who was eight at the time, followed her to Hamburg 10 years later, for dance training. \u201cIt was great when she came to me,\u201d says Mabuse, \u201cas I finally had my family closer. In a way, it is easier to be the younger sibling, as the older one has to pave the way.\u201d</p> <p>Breakfast half-finished, Mabuse is warming up, transforming into the high-energy persona we\u2019re used to seeing on TV. \u201cI\u2019m actually very emotional,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I always had to be strong because of my childhood and the competitiveness of the dance world. I learned that by being emotional on screen, people can relate. You end up helping them express themselves. That was something my husband showed me. He said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to be strong all the time.\u2019 So now I\u2019m just me.\u201d</p> <p>Mabuse has been commuting from Germany to London for Strictly each week. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for me leaving my daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to deal with being without her, but I\u2019ve got my mother and my husband\u2019s family looking after her as a team now \u2013 that\u2019s just the reality of being a working woman.\u201d</p> <p>To an outsider, the world of ballroom can seem intensely pressurised, if not brutal, despite all the smiles, spangles and fake tan. Mabuse feels it is harder now than ever. \u201cWe used to travel to dance throughout Europe and spend weeks at a time with each other, so you would make lots of friends. Today, though, the dance world is at war. It\u2019s all egos, money-making and politics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4093cd2920c20a1903348204de90dccb73932339\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4093cd2920c20a1903348204de90dccb73932339/0_74_5519_3310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019re tough girls\u2019 ...

What these people were doing watching the campest show on TV, we\u2019ll never know.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal over nothing,\u201d says Mabuse, who is keen for this breakthrough to filter into the show\u2019s competition side. \u201cIt\u2019s time. There\u2019s no stopping same-sex dancing couples. I don\u2019t understand how people being happy can affect others so much \u2013 just let them be. Can we get rid of all these labels? It\u2019s just people having relationships. I prefer to eat English breakfast today and muesli tomorrow \u2013 but it\u2019s still breakfast. We\u2019re humans. That\u2019s my take on it.\u201d</p> <p>A car arrives to take Mabuse away. \u201cWhen this show started,\u201d she says, with a final flourish of her fork, \u201cpeople thought it was a joke, that no one would be interested in celebrities dancing. But now look. Half of the country is watching me!\u201d</p>",

What these people were doing watching the campest show on TV, we\u2019ll never know. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal over nothing,\u201d says Mabuse, who is keen for this breakthrough to filter into the show\u2019s competition side. \u201cIt\u2019s time. There\u2019s no stopping same-sex dancing couples. I don\u2019t understand how people being happy can affect others so much \u2013 just let them be. Can we get rid of all these labels? It\u2019s just people having relationships. I prefer to eat English breakfast today and muesli tomorrow \u2013 but it\u2019s still breakfast. We\u2019re humans. That\u2019s my take on it.\u201d A car arrives to take Mabuse away. \u201cWhen this show started,\u201d she says, with a final flourish of her fork, \u201cpeople thought it was a joke, that no one would be interested in celebrities dancing. But now look. Half of the country is watching me!\u201d",

You cannot fool them anymore, no revenues are coming whatsoever.\u201d On Beirut\u2019s waterfront, however, the spirit of October has not yet given way to despair for some. \u201cWe all know what\u2019s at stake,\u201d said Amal Haadna, 23, wearing a sombrero emblazoned with the Lebanese flag. \u201cEven the thieves among us know they have to change. We\u2019ll go through heartache, but we\u2019ll get there. The country hinges on this moment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Emma Jane Austen\u2019s tale of misguided matchmaking in the fictional village of Highbury, in early 19th-century England, is reimagined in a new film starring Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma, alongside Johnny Flynn, Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart. Several historic English houses that feature in the film are open to the public for tours and tea: Firle Place in Lewes, in the South Downs national park, a Tudor stately home and garden remodelled in the 18th century; Wilton House and its parkland and rose gardens by the River Nadder in Salisbury; 16th-century Kingston Bagpuize house and gardens in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, which stood in as Lord Merton\u2019s house in Downton Abbey; and Elizabethan Chavenage House in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, where parts of Poldark was also filmed. Also making several appearances as Highbury is the village of Lower Slaughter in the Cotswolds, including the market square, its 16th- and 17th-century cottages, and the village hall. Emma was written in the author\u2019s cottage in Chawton, Hampshire, where she lived from 1809-1817. It\u2019s now home to Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum, a Grade-I listed 17th-century building, with letters, first editions of her book, the table where she wrote and other personal belongings. \u2022 Released on 14 February The Secret Garden Based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, The Secret Garden is being adapted for the big screen once more for 2020, following several adaptations since it was first published in 1911. Set in North Yorkshire at the turn of the 20th century, it\u2019s the story of disagreeable 10-year-old orphan Mary Lennox, who is sent to live with her uncle in brooding Misselthwaite Manor. Her discovery of a hidden garden helps transform her attitude and the lives of those around her. The garden scenes in the 2020 film, with Colin Firth and Julie Walters among the cast, is a composite of several gardens around the UK. The best-known in Yorkshire is Duncombe Park near Helmsley, on the edge of the North York Moors. It has 450 acres of woodland, scented gardens and a national nature reserve home to ancient trees, and rare insects and birds. Also seeing significant screen time are the sub-tropical Trebah Gardens on the south Cornwall coast; Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire and Grade-I listed 19th-century Iford Manor and gardens in Bradford-on-Avon. National Trust locations to keep an eye out for include ruined Fountains Abbey, close to Ripon in North Yorkshire, the Italian-style terraced Bodnant Garden near Colwyn Bay in north Wales; and the Georgian estate of Osterley Park in west London. \u2022 Released on 13 April Last Night in Soho Director Edgar Wright has described his nostalgia for an era he never knew when discussing his new psychological horror, Last Night in Soho. It stars Thomasin McKenzie, Matt Smith and Anya Taylor-Joy, and from what has been seen during filming in London so far, is likely to be set in two eras: modern day and 1960s London. Almost everything about it, including locations, is being kept under wraps. However, filming has been papped in London\u2019s Soho \u2013 around Greek Street, Berwick Street, Old Compton Street, Carnaby Street and Carlisle Street. One scene saw Smith and Taylor-Joy dashing out of retro nightclub Caf\u00e9 de Paris on Haymarket. Some unusual posters have also been spotted in Bateman\u2019s Buildings, an alley that runs south from Soho Square, including misspelt names of iconic 1960s musicians and incorrect corresponding tour dates \u2013 causing a stir online. Further shots of fictional venues are also surfacing, including a jazz and blues club called Creeper Lounge. Real-life venue Ain\u2019t Nothin But The Blues Bar on Kingly Street could recreate that vintage musical spirit, or classic basement club Ronnie Scott\u2019s, which opened in 1959 on Frith Street. \u2022 Released on 18 September Ammonite Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan star in a new romantic drama directed by Francis Lee, set on the Dorset coast in the 19th century. Based on the life of fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anning, it tells of her love affair with Charlotte Murchison \u2013 inspired by real-life characters, but not based on any evidence of events. Dorset\u2019s Jurassic Coast will feature heavily, particularly Anning\u2019s home town of Lyme Regis. The Bell Cliff area of town, on the seafront and close to the South West Coastal Path, had cobbles added and shopfronts stripped back to create an 1840s street. A traditional sailing ship, the Irene, was moored in Lyme Regis harbour \u2013 it offers sailing holidays in various locations around the UK (from \u00a3445pp for three nights). Colourful Coombe Street also features. Elsewhere, beach locations include peaceful Eype, which offers views along the coast from the peak of Golden Cap; Hive beach in Burton Bradstock, where fossils can be found in the limestone boulders; and Charmouth beach, a pretty, unspoiled stretch close to the village and another top fossil-hunting spot. Visitors today can find out more about fossils and fossil walking routes at the Lyme Regis museum, Dinosaurland Fossil museum (also in Lyme Regis), and the Etches Collection Museum of Jurassic Marine Life in Kimmeridge. Also featuring in the film are Hampton Estate in the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty; Chatham Historic Dockyard in Kent; the Georgian Fitzroy Square in London\u2019s Fitzrovia, and the British Museum in Bloomsbury. \u2022 Release date 2020 TBC Blithe Spirit Set in postwar England, a new comedy based on the 1941 No\u00ebl Coward play stars Dan Stevens, Isla Fisher, Leslie Mann and Emilia Fox, with Judi Dench as Madame Arcati, an eccentric medium who holds a s\u00e9ance for a writer and accidentally summons the spirit of his first wife. The film features Grade-II-listed modernist country house Joldwynds in Holmbury St Mary, Surrey, which was built in the 1930s. It was designed by architect Oliver Hill and was previously used as a location for two episodes of ITV\u2019s drama series Agatha Christie\u2019s Poirot. Also appearing are several National Trust locations: 17th-century Cliveden house and gardens in Taplow, Berkshire; Seaford Head nature reserve in East Sussex; and the white cliffs of Cuckmere Haven, where Atonement was also filmed. Richmond Theatre is also said to appear in the film, which is the location of a short-run, live performance of the play in February, starring Jennifer Saunders. Coward wrote Blithe Spirit at 17th-century Goldenhurst Farm in near Ashford in Kent, his home at the time. It\u2019s now the home of comedian Julian Clary and is not open to the public. The nearest village to the house, Aldington, is in the North Downs area of outstanding natural beauty, and close to the North Downs Way national trail. \u2022 Released 1 May Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Police said the crash occurred just after 9am on Wednesday on the Eyre Highway in South Australia, about 10km west of the Nullarbor Roadhouse, 1,610km east of Perth and 1,080km west of Adelaide. The cyclist, a 57-year-old man from Queensland, died at the scene. There was no official word on the truck driver\u2019s condition.

The road would be closed for several hours while major crash investigators travelled to the site from Adelaide, SA police said in a statement. The year-to-date road toll in Australia is 1.3% higher than previous years, according to statistics from the federal bureau of infrastructure, transport, and regional economics. In the 12 months to 30 November, 1,183 people died on Australian roads.

      "bodyText": "In the northern New South Wales town of Wytaliba, one of the areas hardest hit by bushfires that have killed nine people, destroyed a thousand homes and burned 5m hectares of Australia in the past three months, a small team has cooked Christmas lunch for 200 people. Everyone is invited, from the dozens who lost their homes, to the volunteer firefighters, to the Canadian firefighting contingent who have been working to relieve local crews. Among those planning to attend is Carol Sparks, the mayor of the Glen Innes Severn council, who has given her husband the year off cooking Christmas lunch in favour of celebrating with their community. \u201cThis is a little respite and a chance for the community to get together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a matter of trying to relax too, which is hard \u2013 we keep getting hit by natural disasters.\u201d First she has to get through the Gwydir Highway, which was closed on Christmas morning for the third time since the fires began. \u201cWe have had some rain \u2013 it fell very heavily and washed out the road down at Wytaliba again,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cIt comes very quickly and it\u2019s torrential and then it goes away. So it\u2019s washed the road out.\u201d The rain was patchy: Glen Innes got just 2mm, but in Wytaliba it was 30mm, enough to fill up a few water tanks and maybe flush the ash out of the creek \u2013 both desperately needed in Wytaliba and surrounding communities such as Tenterfield, which have been without clean water for weeks. Unfortunately, it has also washed away the topsoil which is no longer protected by groundcover. \u201cIt washed down a lot of the earth that has been exposed since the fire,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cThe mountain is basically leaking sand every time it rains.\u201d Sparks\u2019s house at Wytaliba suffered severe damage in the 8 November fire but she counts herself among the lucky ones: she has a place to stay, adequate insurance and a home that is still standing even if the walls are blackened. She misses the trees more every time she returns home. It is one thing to lose a house, Sparks said, but another to have your whole community transformed into an unrecognisable landscape. Familiar landmarks offer no comfort if they no longer look familiar. \u201cEveryone keeps saying the trees will come back, but how can you come back from being a charcoal stick?\u201d Sparks said. \u201cAll I am thinking about is the environment \u2026 All the trees are going to fall over. It is very sad for everybody who has lost their houses and their environment and their trees.\u201d Two thousand firefighters worked through Christmas Eve to strengthen containment lines around 73 fires that are burning across NSW. Almost 700km south of Wytaliba, in the small Blue Mountains town of Colo under the shadow of the Gospers Mountain megafire, the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, the emergency management minster David Elliott and the fire commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons had breakfast with volunteer firefighters who had given up their Christmas to keep those communities safe. Nine people \u2013 including two volunteer firefighters \u2013 have died, and dozens more, including many volunteer firefighters, have been injured in fires in NSW, South Australia and Queensland. Milder temperatures brought some respite on Christmas Day, with fires downgraded to advice level in every state except South Australia, where watch and act warnings remained in place in some areas of the Cudlee Creek fire in the Adelaide Hills. The Bureau of Meteorology warned that hot, windy weather would bring a return to dangerous fire conditions, starting in South Australia this weekend and working across to Victoria on Monday and NSW on Tuesday.",
