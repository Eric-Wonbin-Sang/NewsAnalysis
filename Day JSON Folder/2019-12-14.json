If Trump is impeached, as is likely as Democrats hold the chamber, a trial will be held in the Senate in January. Republicans are in control there, few if any defections are likely and the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/mcconnell-there-s-no-chance-trump-removed-office-n1101286\">the president will not be convicted</a> and removed.</p> <p>The Kentuckian caused further anger among Democrats this week, when he said he was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/us/politics/mcconnell-white-house-impeachment-trial.html\">taking my cues</a>\u201d from the White House regarding strategy for the trial.</p> <p>In response, the Democratic minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said in a statement: \u201cIf articles of impeachment are sent to the Senate, every single senator will take an oath to render \u2018impartial justice\u2019.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Making sure the Senate conducts a fair and honest trial that allows all the facts to come out is paramount</p> <footer> <cite>Chuck Schumer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMaking sure the Senate conducts a fair and honest trial that allows all the facts to come out is paramount.\u201d</p> <p>Graham disagrees.</p> <p>\u201cThis thing will come to the Senate,\u201d he said on Saturday, \u201cand it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Graham is familiar with the impeachment process and how the Senate stages a trial, having been a House manager for the Republicans in the impeachment of Bill Clinton.</p> <p>Asked if it was appropriate for him as a prospective juror to be discussing the case in such terms, he said: \u201cWell, I must think so because I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cPersonally I think President Trump will come out of this stronger and the good news is that everybody in politics in America needs to prove to the American public we\u2019re not all completely crazy. So there may be a spirit of compromise coming post-impeachment, born of political necessity, if anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Graham said Joe Biden, a target of Trump\u2019s alleged scheming, was a friend and would \u201cdo very well\u201d in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. But he also implied that Biden\u2019s son\u2019s involvement with a Ukrainian energy company was corrupt.</p> <p>There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden, as there is no evidence of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, the other hobby horse pushed by Trump and his Republican backers.</p> <p>Witnesses in impeachment hearings held by the House intelligence committee outlined the scheme which Trump and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, are alleged to have orchestrated the withholding of nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting.</p> <p>The House judiciary panel heard from legal scholars on the constitutional grounds for impeachment, before producing the articles to be voted on in a process subject to Republican protest and obstruction.</p> <p>\u201cI think the best thing for America to do is get this behind us,\u201d Graham said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like President Trump, you can vote against him in less than a year. It\u2019s not like a politician is unaccountable if you don\u2019t impeach them. So I think impeachment is going to end quickly in the Senate.

      "bodyText": "Lindsey Graham will not try to \u201cpretend to be a fair juror\u201d should Donald Trump face an impeachment trial in the US Senate. Speaking at the Doha Forum in Qatar on Saturday, the South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally said he was \u201ctrying to give a pretty clear signal I have made up my mind. I\u2019m not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here. What I see coming, happening today, is just a partisan nonsense.\u201d Trump faces two articles of impeachment arising from his attempts to have Ukraine carry out investigations favourable to his re-election campaign: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. A House vote is expected next week. If Trump is impeached, as is likely as Democrats hold the chamber, a trial will be held in the Senate in January. Republicans are in control there, few if any defections are likely and the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said the president will not be convicted and removed. The Kentuckian caused further anger among Democrats this week, when he said he was \u201ctaking my cues\u201d from the White House regarding strategy for the trial. In response, the Democratic minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said in a statement: \u201cIf articles of impeachment are sent to the Senate, every single senator will take an oath to render \u2018impartial justice\u2019. \u201cMaking sure the Senate conducts a fair and honest trial that allows all the facts to come out is paramount.\u201d Graham disagrees. \u201cThis thing will come to the Senate,\u201d he said on Saturday, \u201cand it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly.\u201d Graham is familiar with the impeachment process and how the Senate stages a trial, having been a House manager for the Republicans in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Asked if it was appropriate for him as a prospective juror to be discussing the case in such terms, he said: \u201cWell, I must think so because I\u2019m doing it.\u201d He added: \u201cPersonally I think President Trump will come out of this stronger and the good news is that everybody in politics in America needs to prove to the American public we\u2019re not all completely crazy. So there may be a spirit of compromise coming post-impeachment, born of political necessity, if anything else.\u201d Graham said Joe Biden, a target of Trump\u2019s alleged scheming, was a friend and would \u201cdo very well\u201d in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. But he also implied that Biden\u2019s son\u2019s involvement with a Ukrainian energy company was corrupt. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden, as there is no evidence of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, the other hobby horse pushed by Trump and his Republican backers. Witnesses in impeachment hearings held by the House intelligence committee outlined the scheme which Trump and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, are alleged to have orchestrated the withholding of nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting. The House judiciary panel heard from legal scholars on the constitutional grounds for impeachment, before producing the articles to be voted on in a process subject to Republican protest and obstruction. \u201cI think the best thing for America to do is get this behind us,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like President Trump, you can vote against him in less than a year. It\u2019s not like a politician is unaccountable if you don\u2019t impeach them. So I think impeachment is going to end quickly in the Senate. I would prefer it to end as quickly as possible.\u201d Graham was also asked about his own past opposition to Trump, when both men were running for the Republican presidential nomination. Then, Graham famously called Trump a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d. \u201cI said all of those things,\u201d he said in Doha. \u201cClearly, I wasn\u2019t a fan of his campaign, right? But here\u2019s the way it has to work. When you lose, accept it. The American people didn\u2019t believe that. They made him their president.\u201d In other developments, multiple sources told news outlets Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Democrat opposed to impeachment, met Trump at the White House and was set to switch parties. A vulnerable representative from a swing seat, his defection would not affect the chances of impeachment being improved by the House. It was also reported that Trump, who attended the Army v Navy football game in Philadelphia, was still mulling who would represent him at the Senate trial. The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, \u201cis expected to take lead\u201d, Maggie Haberman of the New York Times tweeted, citing \u201ca person familiar with the talks\u201d. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t done yet. Trump has still been quizzing people about who should do it, and has wondered about Cipollone\u2019s lack of experience on TV.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn and shape the future direction of the Labour party is under way as potential successors set out their leadership stalls for the first time, amid bitter recriminations after the party\u2019s worst general election defeat since 1935. Two of the likely candidates in what will be a 12-week contest that is expected to begin in January \u2013 Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy \u2013 break cover with articles in the Observer, expressing their anger and dismay at the party\u2019s crushing defeat, and calling for a far-reaching post-mortem to ensure Labour reconnects with the millions of working people who rejected it. Seven MPs, six of them women \u2013 Phillips, Nandy, Emily Thornberry, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner and Yvette Cooper \u2013 are understood to be thinking of joining the contest, making it likely that Labour will for the first time elect a female leader. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is also likely to join the race. In the early hours of Friday, when the scale of Labour\u2019s defeat was known, Corbyn announced that he would not lead Labour into another election but would stay to allow the party a period of \u201creflection\u201d until a new leader was elected. While many MPs have attacked him for refusing to go sooner, and for his initial refusal to apologise personally for the crushing loss, others argue that the party should avoid a bitter blame game. In what appears to be a pitch for the top job, Phillips argues that the party must broaden its appeal so it can once again attract a coalition of support from both the working class and middle classes. But she goes out of her way to insist that she is not advocating a return to the approach of New Labour. \u201cSome call me a Blairite because I\u2019m evangelical about the difference Sure Start and tax credits made to my life. But I marched against Iraq, I didn\u2019t even become an MP until eight years after he\u2019d left parliament, so how does that fit?\u201d She is severely critical of the way Corbyn and his supporters have seized control of the party machine and excluded those with different views. \u201cThe truth is there are corners of our party that have become too intolerant of challenge and debate,\u201d she writes. \u201cThere is a clique who don\u2019t care if our appeal has narrowed as long as they have control of the institutions and ideas of the party. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to discover the courage to ask the difficult questions about the future of our party and the future of the working class communities who need a Labour government.\u201d Nandy also argues that the party has \u201clost touch with the day-to-day lived experience of many of the people we want to represent\u201d and must reconnect with them by listening and becoming more \u201crooted in our communities\u201d. Only that way could Labour understand the practical needs of working people and respond to them. Also writing in the Observer today, Corbyn says there is \u201cno doubt\u201d about the popularity of Labour\u2019s policies. However, Nandy says that some of the manifesto made little sense. \u201cNationalising rail is a good, sound policy, but should we have staked so much of our campaign on that policy when so many of the towns we lost have no train station and rely on buses anyway? Should we really be rejecting nuclear power when it is one of the best sources of good jobs outside of London?\u201d On Saturday senior Labour figures said that Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was already being promoted by the Corbyn circle as his favoured successor. Sharp differences of view were expressed over whether Corbyn should continue as leader for the next few months or go sooner. Peter Kyle, who held his Hove and Portslade seat comfortably, said action to purge the entire Corbyn leadership was needed immediately. Writing in the Observer, he accuses Corbyn and his inner circle of betraying Labour members with a \u201cculture of authoritarianism, bullying, and organisational incompetence\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe must move forward, fast. Tom Watson has gone, Jeremy is going, and Len McCluskey [the Unite general secretary] must follow.\u201d Other MPs said Labour had to have a new leader in place before campaigning starts in Spring ahead of May\u2019s local elections.

It\u2019s a two hour non-stop glitter cannon of a show, heavily padded with pro dances, montages, recaps and musical interludes, so buckle your dancing shoes for a final spin around the Strictly dancefloor. This has been a difficult week for many, so let\u2019s envelop ourselves in warm hug of Strictly sparkle and joy. </p> <p>Kick off is at 7.05pm \u2013 see you then! </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T08:44:00.774Z\">at 8.44am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

It\u2019s been many years in the making with newcomers joining every year, and it feels like a very special corner of the internet. You are all amazing, and I hugely appreciate your wit and wisdom every week. A massive thank you to everyone. That\u2019s me done with liveblogging for 2019, but as usual we\u2019ll open a blog on Christmas Day for the Strictly Christmas Special so you can put the comment box to good use. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you\u2019d like to swing by and say hello (or goodbye). Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy 2020 \u2013 see you next September for another spin around the Strictly dancefloor. Keeeeeep dancing! The series plays out to \u2018We Are Family\u2019 with Kelvin on Graziano\u2019s shoulders, which is a workout he may regret later. Everyone\u2019s crying, there\u2019s flooding in Elstree. Aside from Kelvin am delighted for Oti, a glitterball win has been a long time coming. Oh thank goodness it\u2019s time for the results. So much tension. And the winners of this year\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing are\u2026KELVIN AND OTI. Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a huge surprise, and on the night they were my favourite. But all tonight\u2019s performances were pretty special, my favourite final in years. Time for a final word from our judges, featuring a montage (drink). FOR THE LOVE OF DANCE JUST CROWN A WINNER. Love Claudia to Dev: \u2018You left too soon and we\u2019re still grumpy about it\u2019. YES WE ARE. Christmas Special plug \u2013 DRINK. Time for a final dance from our Strictly stars \u2013 James Cracknell literally stands there with an arm out, human canoe 4eva. Nice to see Dev back, and Johannes and Catherine were good times. Great to see Will back on the dancefloor, with everyone dancing round him holding table tennis bats. Out comes Michelle for some final vogueing, and Saffron is giving it all the hair. Chris and Karen do a final bit of Uptown Funk, and that was all rather joyful. What a fab line-up this year, I\u2019ve really enjoyed this series. If this montage goes on much longer we\u2019ll be seeing in the New Year. The voting is closed! Time for a montage from all this year\u2019s competitors, including the ones we\u2019ve all forgotten about. DRINK. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of megastar pop royalty Taylor Swift. She\u2019s singing \u2018Lover\u2019 from her number one album, wearing one of Tess\u2019s bacofoil cast-offs. It\u2019s a Christmas song, but it\u2019s really quiet. Maybe that\u2019s how Tay likes her Christmas. On the upside, no out-of-time audience clapping. I like to think Taylor demanded it in the contract. Dance-wise, it\u2019s Aljaz and Janette looking dreamy, accompanied by AJ and Dianne and Graziano and Luba. Graziano\u2019s trousers are unfeasibly tight. The dancing is over but there are still 40 minutes to go, so it\u2019s time to wheel out the filler. First up, the general public and a recap of their favourite bits. DRINK. Also spot the famouses, just spotted the lovely Marian Keyes saying nice things about Motsi, and Mel Giedroyc loved Michelle\u2019s Blackpool Vogue. Recap! DRINK. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Kelvin and Oti. But none of this matters, because the judges\u2019 scores mean NOTHING this evening. Shirley is speechless, there are no bits of Kelvin\u2019s body that don\u2019t move. Bruno thought Kelvin\u2019s bum and hips were mesmerising, it was the crowning glory of a great night. Craig had a small problem with the bounce, but it was a brave choice to dance a Rumba and a Samba in the final and Kelvin smashed it. Motsi points out that this series has been death by Samba, but Kelvin put his heart on the dancefloor. Kelvin got 8s for this in Week One, and it\u2019s clear to see how much he\u2019s improved in the details. I think this was the only Samba this season that wasn\u2019t a one-way ticket to the exit \u2013 still not as good as Danny and Oti\u2019s Samba from a few years ago, but not far off. And finally tonight (and for this series, blub) It\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their favourite dance is their Samba from from Week One, to \u2018La Vida Es Un Carnival\u2019. This scored a casual 32 points from the judges and gave us that classic shot of poor Jamie Laing in the audience doing some Oscar-winning fake joy. Emma\u2019s parents in the audience! DRINK. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39. Craig is NOT getting his ten out for Anton. Motsi thought it was beautiful and Shirley agrees \u2013 soft, slow, quiet and stunning. Bruno loved the storytelling, and the dancing was stylish and elegant. Craig thought Emma missed a couple of heels on her pivot turns, but otherwise beyond class. I loved Emma\u2019s dress in this dance, and it really was a beautiful Viennese Waltz. Danced beautifully once again, but maybe a bit low tempo for a final dance. Really glad I didn\u2019t put crying in the bingo. We\u2019d all be face down by now. Next it\u2019s ANTON AND EMMA! Their favourite dance is their Week Four Viennese Waltz to \u2018Send In the Clowns\u2019 by Barbra Streisand. I remember this being quite dreamy, and danced in the same week that Michelle wore that dress that looked like rainbow testicles and Dev went home. Still not over it, they should both be here this evening. Scores: tens all round, obviously. I\u2019ve run out of drink. Craig thought Karim reminded him of himself, and gets all giddy. Motsi thought there was nothing they could do to make that better, and Shirley was inspired by how much joy and talent Karim has brought to the show, he\u2019s an inspiration. Bruno still thinks it\u2019s the best Strictly Jive ever, and as good as anything the pro dancers could deliver. This really was an incredible Jive, undoubtedly the best of the series and my favourite dance from Karim and Amy. I like it better without the superfluous backing dancers too. Fabulous stuff. First up it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their favourite dance is their Musicals Week Jive to \u2018You Can\u2019t Stop The Beat\u2019 from Hairspray. This got the first 40 of the series, how could they not dance it again? Mum and sister in the VT! DRINK. Time for the final dance of the show \u2013 where our couples get to choose their favourite dance of the series. They are all EXCELLENT choices, in my humble opinion. Boyfriend and daughter are making pizza in the kitchen and it smells incredible. Hurry up, I\u2019m starving* *I\u2019m not starving, ate a load of cheese about half an hour ago. Time for a recap! DRINK. Scores: 10,10,10,10 \u2013 a full house for Kelvin and Oti. DRINK. Also Kelvin\u2019s wife and dad, DRINK. Bruno\u2019s world was rocked, shaken and stirred \u2013 it was 13 weeks condensed into one dance. Craig loved every single moment, and Motsi has no words (but she has a few tears). Shirley thought they pushed the limits and it had everything. This whole dance is a montage, so DRINK. Kelvin\u2019s got his guns out in a pink shirt - it\u2019s got a bit of everything going on, and Kelvin is giving it both barrels, plus bonus flying press-ups. The \u2018best of\u2019 format makes it feel a bit all over the place, but it\u2019s a masterclass in changing tempo and that final lift was incredible. One of my favourite Strictly partnerships ever. Finally it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their Showdance is to \u2018Shout\u2019 by The Isley Brothers \u2013 the original version of the Lulu banger. This is perfect for the kind of high-tempo dance Kelvin and Oti are great at, am very much looking forward to this. Scores: 8,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 38 for Emma and Anton. Shirley loved the immaculate choreography and she totally enjoyed it. Bruno loved the classic Hollywood style, and they got it right. Craig thought there was some hesitation at the beginning, but he loved the dance. Motsi thought there were some nerves, but it was classy and glamorous. This has a lovely classic Hollywood feel, and all the glitz and glitter you\u2019d expect from Emma and Anton. Nice cane work in the middle, but feels a bit stiff in places and a few timing issues. They definitely put the show into showdance, so good work. Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON!. Their Showdance is to \u2018Let Yourself Go\u2019 by Irving Berlin. I listened to this earlier as I\u2019d never heard of it \u2013 safe to say it\u2019s the essence of 1930s jazz hands, so right up Emma\u2019s street. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Karim and Amy. Motsi thought it was the perfect dance for Karim, she felt it to the core of her heart. Shirley thought it was moving and had a wonderful sense of expression and freedom. Bruno thought it was honest and true, and Craig loved the marriage of theatre, storytelling and emotion despite the loss of sync at one point. Oh Tess, stop it. He\u2019s not a puppy, and this whole \u2018you\u2019re crying on both cheeks!\u2019 thing is incredible patronising. I love you, but no. It\u2019s barefoot contempo-waft along the lines of their couples\u2019 choice, which is very much Karim\u2019s thing. It\u2019s beautiful and uplifting, but if I\u2019m honest I\u2019d have preferred to see what Karim has learned on Strictly, rather than from his time at Sylvia Young. But maybe that\u2019s just me, I definitely don\u2019t want to take away from the fact that Karim is an incredible dance talent and he\u2019s been a pleasure to watch. First up it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their Showdance is to the Pink version of \u2018A Million Dreams\u2019 from The Greatest Showman. This is a gorgeous song, and I have every confidence that Karim will give us something pretty special. It\u2019s Showdance time! Essentially this dance is anything goes \u2013 any genre, as many tricks and lifts as you like, just show us what you\u2019ve learned over the past twelve weeks. History tells us that they are occasionally amazing and often baffling. The voting is open! Personally I\u2019m going to wait until after the Showdance, but you crack on. Karim and Amy are at the top of the irrelevant leaderboard, and the Ts&amp;Cs are being read by someone called Tom Allen. The daughter tells me he\u2019s a comedian who does Bake Off Extra Slice, which I\u2019ve never watched. He\u2019s funny, I like him. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Kelvin and Oti. Craig is rather hot under the collar \u2013 he thought it was absolutely tremendous. Motsi loved the way Kelvin moved his body, and she\u2019s very glad she saw the dance twice because the first time was a bit much. Shirley thought Kelvin was \u2018oily\u2019 and fabulous. Bruno has reached his melting point \u2013 it was sensual and romantic and the chemistry was sizzling. This rumba is absolute filth and I\u2019m very much here for it. Lovely movement and hip action from Kelvin, and Oti is just mesmerising. Gorgeous. Finally for this round it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their Judges\u2019 Pick is their Week Four Rumba to \u2018Ain\u2019t No Sunshine\u2019, which scored 36 from the judges. Not going to lie, I\u2019ve watched this quite a few times since week four, but very happy to see them do it again. Bet Kelvin has lubed up his hips this afternoon; those cod liver oil contracts are lining up. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Emma and Anton. Nothing matters any more, it\u2019s all madness. Bruno thought Emma absolutely sold it, and Craig thought it was fantastic despite the syncing issues. Motsi loved the energy, and Emma\u2019s eyes were sparkling more than Motsi\u2019s outfit. Shirley thought Emma didn\u2019t disappoint, and the dance was fabulous. So this had lots of superfluous backing dancers two weeks ago, which means Anton might have to do the lifts himself. Quite a few timing issues in this, and all but one of the lifts are gone. But still enjoyed that very much. Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! Their Judges\u2019 Pick is the Charleston to \u2018Thoroughly Modern Millie\u2019 from Musicals Week. This also scored 39 points from the judges two weeks ago, Again really not sure what Emma and Anton could do to improve it, other than maybe Anton being better at the Charleston. Scores: 10,10,10,10. Drink everything in sight. Shirley thought it was incredible and Karim is a star. Bruno thought it was pure ballroom bliss, with great musicality. Craig couldn\u2019t see any gapping (just me then) and Motsi thought it was electrifying. Very much enjoying Motsi and Shirley\u2019s Swan Lake outfits. Motsi is the swan, Shirley is the lake. This really was a very good Quickstep, but there is still some gapping and a couple of minor timing issues. Karim is so much happier out of hold; the minute he lets go of Amy he\u2019s a new man. Still a cracking Quickstep, mind. Let the dancing begin! First up tonight it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their Judges\u2019 Pick is their Week Seven Quickstep to \u2018Mr Pinstripe Suit\u2019 by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. This scored 39 despite the somewhat alarming colour scheme; Craig wants them to get rid of the gapping so they can get a perfect score. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH (GRAND FINAL SPECIAL EDITION): Tess in her final bacofoil frock of the year, Claudia in black trousers and a white shirt that I think is from Zara. They both look fabulous, I\u2019m so happy. Time for an opening pro dance! Giovanni is in a box, looking like Sergey the Russian entry from Eurovision. Niche reference, never mind. Karim, Emma and Kelvin are all standing on plinths, having a freestyle boogie. This definitely has an end-of-term party feel about it. And we\u2019re off! Let\u2019s get this Grand Final underway. We start with our couples standing in the Strictly studio, watching their first interviews and their journey to the final. Pretty sure this counts as a montage. DRINK. Ran my usual unscientific poll on Twitter this week, the people are pretty confident that Kelvin and Oti are going to win this. I\u2019d like to think the Showdance will make a difference, but Stacy didn\u2019t have a great final last year and still won. The daughter is keeping me company this evening \u2013 she\u2019s still feeling a bit rubbish after her tonsil op on Monday, but very much on the mend. Also don\u2019t forget this week\u2019s FINAL Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 have a slug of something festive for any occurrence of the following: Plugs for the Christmas Special Recaps and montages Relatives being proud Four tens Anton announcing his departure from the show just before voting opens, winning the glitterball off the back of a swansong vote, then coming back next year like a sequinned Nigel Farage. Evening all, and a very warm and glitter-fuelled welcome to the 2019 Strictly Come Dancing Grand Final liveblog! We\u2019ve been here every weekend for three months, and all that remains is to crown our winning couple from Karim and Amy, Kelvin and Oti and Emma and Anton. My money\u2019s on Kelvin and Oti, but this series has been full of surprises so I\u2019m not counting my sequinned chickens just yet. The plan for tonight\u2019s show is as follows: all three couples will dance three routines back-to-back \u2013 the one the judges want to see again, a do-what-you-like Showdance, and then finally each couple\u2019s favourite dance of the series. It\u2019s a two hour non-stop glitter cannon of a show, heavily padded with pro dances, montages, recaps and musical interludes, so buckle your dancing shoes for a final spin around the Strictly dancefloor. This has been a difficult week for many, so let\u2019s envelop ourselves in warm hug of Strictly sparkle and joy. Kick off is at 7.05pm \u2013 see you then!",

      "body": "<p>In the end, fears of a Corbyn government and disdain for Jo Swinson\u2019s election campaign combined to defeat tactical voting. Over the past four weeks, the <em>Observer</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/poll-models-fail-spot-voting-variation-london-marginal-seats\" title=\"\">has reported on constituency polls</a> designed to assist voters wanting to oppose the Conservatives and stop Brexit. Last Sunday, we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/tactical-voting-guide-2019-keep-tories-out-remain-voter-general-election\" title=\"\">recommended candidates in 50 seats</a>. Our results were not great. Non-Conservatives won only 13 of these seats; of these, nine were SNP gains in Scotland. In England, our preferred candidates triumphed in only four seats: Putney and Portsmouth South (Labour) and Richmond Park and St Albans (Liberal Democrat).</p> <p>Why so few successes? It was not the fault of Deltapoll\u2019s data. Almost everywhere, they identified the correct challenger. Most dramatically, they showed rightly that the Liberal Democrats were snapping at Dominic Raab\u2019s heels, despite the foreign secretary\u2019s apparently impregnable 23,000 majority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/lib-dems-warned-not-to-back-december-election-vince-cable-tim-farron\">Key Lib Dems warned party not to back December election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a number of our 50 seats, the candidate we showed running third saw their vote squeezed. Examples were Labour in Wimbledon and the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Lib Dems in Putney and Hendon. In some places, divisions in the tactical voting community helped the Conservatives.</p> <p>Three high-profile defectors to the Lib Dems suffered from local voters receiving conflicting, and sometimes changing, advice: Luciana Berger (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/luciana-berger-lib-dems-finchley-golders-green-remain-voters\" title=\"\">in Finchley and Golders Green</a>), Chuka Umunna (Cities of London and Westminster) and Sam Gyimah (Kensington).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaace205b70b1ce9db78470951251d536902a6f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaace205b70b1ce9db78470951251d536902a6f4/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Gyimah came third in Kensington, after initially looking the main danger to the Conservatives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Gyimah came third in Kensington, after initially looking the main danger to the Conservatives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Taylor/Echoes Wire/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Kensington, judgement was particularly tricky. We backed Gyimah when our survey showed him well-placed to win. A later survey by the same pollster showed Emma Dent Coad, who gained the seat for Labour in 2017, overtaking Gyimah. This trend proved to be more powerful than the contested tactical advice: Gyimah ended up third, and Dent Coad lost the seat narrowly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/labour-voices-on-election-result\">The big debate: \u2018The only response is humility and utterly frank reflection\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Deltapoll\u2019s data showed what tactical voting was up against. Lib Dem supporters were reluctant to help Corbyn become prime minister. Likewise, Tory Remainers feared voting for a badly led Lib Dem party that might support Corbyn. These Tories preferred a Brexit Britain governed by Johnson to a stop-Brexit government led by Corbyn.</p> <p>The big lesson is that tactical voting needs not just a common enemy, but a broadly common vision, shared by the Labour and Lib Dem leaders. This was the case with Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown in 1997; it was not with Corbyn and Swinson last week.</p> <p>In all this, one success deserves to be recognised. Seven of the 11 national eve-of election surveys, including Opinium, the <em>Observer\u2019</em>s Britain-wide pollsters, predicted the support for every party to within two percentage points. One cannot reasonably ask for a better performance.</p> <p><em>Peter Kellner is a polling expert and former president of YouGov</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the end, fears of a Corbyn government and disdain for Jo Swinson\u2019s election campaign combined to defeat tactical voting. Over the past four weeks, the Observer has reported on constituency polls designed to assist voters wanting to oppose the Conservatives and stop Brexit. Last Sunday, we recommended candidates in 50 seats. Our results were not great. Non-Conservatives won only 13 of these seats; of these, nine were SNP gains in Scotland. In England, our preferred candidates triumphed in only four seats: Putney and Portsmouth South (Labour) and Richmond Park and St Albans (Liberal Democrat). Why so few successes? It was not the fault of Deltapoll\u2019s data. Almost everywhere, they identified the correct challenger. Most dramatically, they showed rightly that the Liberal Democrats were snapping at Dominic Raab\u2019s heels, despite the foreign secretary\u2019s apparently impregnable 23,000 majority. In a number of our 50 seats, the candidate we showed running third saw their vote squeezed. Examples were Labour in Wimbledon and the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Lib Dems in Putney and Hendon. In some places, divisions in the tactical voting community helped the Conservatives. Three high-profile defectors to the Lib Dems suffered from local voters receiving conflicting, and sometimes changing, advice: Luciana Berger (in Finchley and Golders Green), Chuka Umunna (Cities of London and Westminster) and Sam Gyimah (Kensington). In Kensington, judgement was particularly tricky. We backed Gyimah when our survey showed him well-placed to win. A later survey by the same pollster showed Emma Dent Coad, who gained the seat for Labour in 2017, overtaking Gyimah. This trend proved to be more powerful than the contested tactical advice: Gyimah ended up third, and Dent Coad lost the seat narrowly. Deltapoll\u2019s data showed what tactical voting was up against. Lib Dem supporters were reluctant to help Corbyn become prime minister. Likewise, Tory Remainers feared voting for a badly led Lib Dem party that might support Corbyn. These Tories preferred a Brexit Britain governed by Johnson to a stop-Brexit government led by Corbyn. The big lesson is that tactical voting needs not just a common enemy, but a broadly common vision, shared by the Labour and Lib Dem leaders. This was the case with Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown in 1997; it was not with Corbyn and Swinson last week. In all this, one success deserves to be recognised. Seven of the 11 national eve-of election surveys, including Opinium, the Observer\u2019s Britain-wide pollsters, predicted the support for every party to within two percentage points. One cannot reasonably ask for a better performance. Peter Kellner is a polling expert and former president of YouGov",

Two-and-a-half years ago, in the first general election I contested as Labour leader, our party increased its share of the popular vote by 10 percentage points. On Thursday, on a desperately disappointing night, we fell back eight points.</p> \n<p>I have called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/devastating-exit-poll-triggers-bitter-blame-game-within-labour\" title=\"\">a period of reflection in the party</a>, and there is no shortage of things to consider. I don\u2019t believe these two contrasting election results can be understood in isolation.</p> \n<p>The last few years have seen a series of political upheavals: the Scottish independence campaign, Labour\u2019s transformation, Brexit, the Labour electoral surge, and now Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d victory. None of that is a coincidence.</p> \n<p>The political system is volatile because it is failing to generate stable support for the status quo following the financial crash of 2008. As Labour leader I\u2019ve made a point of travelling to all parts of our country and listening to people, and I\u2019ve been continually struck how far trust has broken down in politics.</p> \n<p>The gap between the richest and the rest has widened. Everyone can see that the economic and political system is not fair, does not deliver justice, and is stacked against the majority.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/corbyn-takes-share-responsibility-defeat\">I take my share of responsibility for this defeat, says Jeremy Corbyn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That has provided an opening for a more radical and hopeful politics that insists it doesn\u2019t have to be like this, and that another world is possible. But it has also fuelled cynicism among many people who know things aren\u2019t working for them, but don\u2019t believe that can change.</p> \n<p>I saw that most clearly in the former industrial areas of England and Wales where the wilful destruction of jobs and communities over 40 years has taken a heavy toll. It is no wonder that these areas provided the strongest backlash in the 2016 referendum and, regrettably for Labour, in the general election on Thursday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"552dfdf4-676d-48d6-93d3-025c582213a8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yFHvyYHT1GE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In towns where the steelworks have closed, politics as a whole wasn\u2019t trusted, but Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 sold as a blow to the system \u2013 was. Sadly that slogan will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is, shattering trust even further.</p> \n<p>Despite our best efforts, and our attempts to make clear this would be a turning point for the whole direction of our country, the election became mainly about Brexit.</p> \n<p>A Conservative party prepared to exploit divisions capitalised on the frustration created by its own failure to deliver on the referendum result \u2013 to the cost of a Labour party seeking to bring our country together to face the future.</p> \n<p>The polarisation in the country over Brexit made it more difficult for a party with strong electoral support on both sides. I believe we paid a price for being seen by some as trying to straddle that divide or re-run the referendum.</p> \n<p>We now need to listen to the voices of those in Stoke and Scunthorpe, Blyth and Bridgend, Grimsby and Glasgow, who didn\u2019t support Labour. Our country has fundamentally changed since the financial crash and any political project that pretends otherwise is an indulgence.</p> \n<p>Progress does not come in a simple straight line. Even though we lost seats heavily on Thursday, I believe the manifesto of 2019 and the movement behind it will be seen as historically important \u2013 a real attempt at building a force powerful enough to transform society for the many, not the few. For the first time in decades, many people have had hope for a better future.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea54c358bef27cd458e3df4dda7bcfb4ba6954ff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea54c358bef27cd458e3df4dda7bcfb4ba6954ff/0_46_1213_728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn leaves the Labour party\u2019s headquarters in the early hours of Friday morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn leaves the Labour party\u2019s headquarters in the early hours of Friday morning.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That experience, shared by hundreds of thousands of people, cannot be erased. Our task as a movement, and a party that has more than doubled in size, is not over: it now has the urgent task of defending the communities that will come under sustained assault from Boris Johnson\u2019s government and the toxic deal he wants with Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>And it must set about ensuring that sense of hope spreads and deepens. As socialists we seek to raise people\u2019s expectations. People in our country deserve so much more \u2013 and they can have it, if we work together to achieve it.</p> \n<p>I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate. But I regret that we did not succeed in converting that into a parliamentary majority for change.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions.

      "bodyText": "We are living in highly volatile times. Two-and-a-half years ago, in the first general election I contested as Labour leader, our party increased its share of the popular vote by 10 percentage points. On Thursday, on a desperately disappointing night, we fell back eight points. I have called for a period of reflection in the party, and there is no shortage of things to consider. I don\u2019t believe these two contrasting election results can be understood in isolation. The last few years have seen a series of political upheavals: the Scottish independence campaign, Labour\u2019s transformation, Brexit, the Labour electoral surge, and now Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d victory. None of that is a coincidence. The political system is volatile because it is failing to generate stable support for the status quo following the financial crash of 2008. As Labour leader I\u2019ve made a point of travelling to all parts of our country and listening to people, and I\u2019ve been continually struck how far trust has broken down in politics. The gap between the richest and the rest has widened. Everyone can see that the economic and political system is not fair, does not deliver justice, and is stacked against the majority. That has provided an opening for a more radical and hopeful politics that insists it doesn\u2019t have to be like this, and that another world is possible. But it has also fuelled cynicism among many people who know things aren\u2019t working for them, but don\u2019t believe that can change. I saw that most clearly in the former industrial areas of England and Wales where the wilful destruction of jobs and communities over 40 years has taken a heavy toll. It is no wonder that these areas provided the strongest backlash in the 2016 referendum and, regrettably for Labour, in the general election on Thursday. In towns where the steelworks have closed, politics as a whole wasn\u2019t trusted, but Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d \u2013 sold as a blow to the system \u2013 was. Sadly that slogan will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is, shattering trust even further. Despite our best efforts, and our attempts to make clear this would be a turning point for the whole direction of our country, the election became mainly about Brexit. A Conservative party prepared to exploit divisions capitalised on the frustration created by its own failure to deliver on the referendum result \u2013 to the cost of a Labour party seeking to bring our country together to face the future. The polarisation in the country over Brexit made it more difficult for a party with strong electoral support on both sides. I believe we paid a price for being seen by some as trying to straddle that divide or re-run the referendum. We now need to listen to the voices of those in Stoke and Scunthorpe, Blyth and Bridgend, Grimsby and Glasgow, who didn\u2019t support Labour. Our country has fundamentally changed since the financial crash and any political project that pretends otherwise is an indulgence. Progress does not come in a simple straight line. Even though we lost seats heavily on Thursday, I believe the manifesto of 2019 and the movement behind it will be seen as historically important \u2013 a real attempt at building a force powerful enough to transform society for the many, not the few. For the first time in decades, many people have had hope for a better future. That experience, shared by hundreds of thousands of people, cannot be erased. Our task as a movement, and a party that has more than doubled in size, is not over: it now has the urgent task of defending the communities that will come under sustained assault from Boris Johnson\u2019s government and the toxic deal he wants with Donald Trump. And it must set about ensuring that sense of hope spreads and deepens. As socialists we seek to raise people\u2019s expectations. People in our country deserve so much more \u2013 and they can have it, if we work together to achieve it. I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate. But I regret that we did not succeed in converting that into a parliamentary majority for change. There is no doubt that our policies are popular, from public ownership of rail and key utilities to a massive house-building programme and a pay rise for millions. The question is, how can we succeed in future where we didn\u2019t this time? There is no quick fix to overcome the distrust of many voters. Patronising them will not win them over. Labour has to earn their trust. That means the patient work of listening and standing with communities, especially as the government steps up its assault. And it means ensuring that the working class, in all its diversity, is the driving force within our party. The media attacks on the Labour party for the last four and a half years were more ferocious than ever \u2013 and of course that has an impact on the outcome of elections. Anyone who stands up for real change will be met by the full force of media opposition. The party needs a more robust strategy to meet this billionaire-owned and influenced hostility head-on and, where possible, turn it to our advantage. We have suffered a heavy defeat, and I take my responsibility for it. Labour will soon have a new leader. But whoever that will be, our movement will continue to work for a more equal and just society, and a sustainable and peaceful world. I\u2019ve spent my life campaigning for those goals, and will continue to do so. The politics of hope must prevail.",

No one bats an eye at the intermittent shrieks. It\u2019s business as usual at this Christmas networking meeting in the country that has come closer than perhaps anywhere else to making \u201chaving it all\u201d a feminist reality, rather than an impossible goal to torment exhausted, overstretched women. Finland is so proud of its commitment to gender equality, and its achievements, that it has even made a quirky international campaign out of its gender-neutral pronoun \u201ch\u00e4n\u201d \u2013 trying to export its linguistic commitment to a world where no one is defined as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d. But last week the Nordic nation found a far more potent ambassador for gender equality, when 34-year-old Social Democrat Sanna Marin was sworn in as prime minister, heading a coalition and a cabinet dominated by women. She is the youngest serving premier in the world, mother to a toddler, and heads a coalition of four other parties that are all led by women. Three of them, like her, are under 40. \u201cIt\u2019s great we have these young women taking leadership roles. Sanna Marin is the same age as me, and she is a really big role model for all of us working mothers,\u201d said Susanna Mikkonen, vice-chair of the Mothers in Business group that organised the networking event.

Since the start of this century it has had two female prime ministers \u2013 though both served only brief terms \u2013 and a widely liked female president who served for 12 years. But this government feels to some in Finland and beyond like a new landmark; the coming of age of a generation that grew up with gender equality as a reality rather than an ideal. \u201cIf I look at how it has been for me growing up, it was the time when Finland had Tarja Halonen as female president, she was quite an important icon, at least in terms of people doing politics,\u201d said Li Andersson, who at 32 heads the Left Alliance in the coalition and serves as education minister. \u201cThere are all these stories in Finland about children who were asking their parents if a man can be president because they were so used to seeing the female president.\u201d Generous parental leave policies, subsidised childcare and a commitment to work-life balance mean young working mothers are the norm here rather than the exception.

I love the people I grew up among, and I think that they can tell, even when we might have just had a bit of a barney. I guess it\u2019s about trust \u2013 you don\u2019t have to agree with every word someone says if you have good faith in their intentions.</p> <p>Everywhere I campaigned, I heard the same thing. It was less about Brexit and more about belief. In these places of generations of Labour voting, they did not believe a Labour government would or could deliver for them. They didn\u2019t trust us. They didn\u2019t trust the Tories either, but then they never expected to, so that letdown was lesser. I spoke to people in my constituency and others who were distressed that they couldn\u2019t vote Labour, visibly angry because they felt we, our leader and what we were presenting to them had put them in this position. They were not shy Tories of the 2015 election \u2013 they were sad and disappointed Tory voters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/labour-voices-on-election-result\">The big debate: \u2018The only response is humility and utterly frank reflection\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There will be a thousand hot takes on where the Labour party went wrong.

I\u2019m searing with anger that in the UK today people have got used to accepting the idea that things will probably get worse. I am apoplectic that people no longer expect progress because for so long they have worn the clothes of decline. But that anger can\u2019t be directed towards the activists who gave everything, or, worse, towards the voters who we let down.

But if there are still those who think victory relies on digging out New Labour strategies, they are just as delusional as those who have spent the last two days trying to explain away the scale of the defeat.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Labour needed to bring middle-class voters into a coalition with a working-class base. Today we have the opposite problem. The more working-class a constituency was, the worse the result was for Labour. The problem isn\u2019t just that working-class people will be hurt by the Tories \u2013 it\u2019s that too many don\u2019t believe we\u2019re better than the Tories. Belief matters, and we failed the test. That is an existential problem for the party that is named for working people.</p> <p>Lots of politicians have spoken about the need to reflect since the gut-punch of that exit poll. But reflection suggests looking backwards. The period of reflection so many are talking about cannot be a mirror of past battles. Since we lost a decade ago, the debate about the party has focused on what your view is of a leader who, at the time of the next general election, won\u2019t have fought an election in 20 years. Some call me a Blairite because I\u2019m evangelical about the difference Sure Start and tax credits made to my life.

      "bodyText": "The blame game isn\u2019t particularly dignified and is self-indulgent. The average person on pretty much any street, either in Canterbury or Grimsby, cares very little for our soul-searching. They just want good schools, safe streets, a doctor\u2019s appointment and for everyone to have enough. When you\u2019re left on the floor of a hospital gasping for breath, or you can\u2019t get your kid a school place, the simplest things are your idea of radical. I decided early on in the campaign that I was going to try to help in the difficult seats of the Midlands and the north. We are not a red wall, we are not an angry mob, we are not your helpful TV buzzword, we are a delightfully varied bunch. I represent a Leave seat (60% Leave) and have never found it difficult to engage with my constituents on Brexit. My constituents don\u2019t mind that we might disagree \u2013 they appreciate above all else a straightforward approach. I can\u2019t help but think that the fact that we saw only a tiny swing away from Labour in my seat was because of our ability to disagree well, with good humour and a shared vernacular. I love the people I grew up among, and I think that they can tell, even when we might have just had a bit of a barney. I guess it\u2019s about trust \u2013 you don\u2019t have to agree with every word someone says if you have good faith in their intentions. Everywhere I campaigned, I heard the same thing. It was less about Brexit and more about belief. In these places of generations of Labour voting, they did not believe a Labour government would or could deliver for them. They didn\u2019t trust us. They didn\u2019t trust the Tories either, but then they never expected to, so that letdown was lesser. I spoke to people in my constituency and others who were distressed that they couldn\u2019t vote Labour, visibly angry because they felt we, our leader and what we were presenting to them had put them in this position. They were not shy Tories of the 2015 election \u2013 they were sad and disappointed Tory voters. There will be a thousand hot takes on where the Labour party went wrong. Lots of them will be more about those who are defensive rather than what we need to be \u2013 determined to crack on and do something about it. Thousands of people who were inspired to activism by Jeremy Corbyn are angry that it has ended in tears. Telling them \u201cI told you so\u201d will do nothing to deal with that anger. Telling them everything has been crap won\u2019t encourage the honest self-criticism we badly need. Those of us who warned we were heading for defeat are angry. I\u2019m angry that a generation will now be scarred, their whole lives governed by a party that\u2019s done nothing to help lift them up. I\u2019m searing with anger that in the UK today people have got used to accepting the idea that things will probably get worse. I am apoplectic that people no longer expect progress because for so long they have worn the clothes of decline. But that anger can\u2019t be directed towards the activists who gave everything, or, worse, towards the voters who we let down. Instead, we need to turn our hot anger at this defeat into cold, clear anger that will inspire us to do everything we need to win again. To get a majority at the next election, we would need to gain as many seats as we did in the landslide of 1997. But if there are still those who think victory relies on digging out New Labour strategies, they are just as delusional as those who have spent the last two days trying to explain away the scale of the defeat. In the 1990s, Labour needed to bring middle-class voters into a coalition with a working-class base. Today we have the opposite problem. The more working-class a constituency was, the worse the result was for Labour. The problem isn\u2019t just that working-class people will be hurt by the Tories \u2013 it\u2019s that too many don\u2019t believe we\u2019re better than the Tories. Belief matters, and we failed the test. That is an existential problem for the party that is named for working people. Lots of politicians have spoken about the need to reflect since the gut-punch of that exit poll. But reflection suggests looking backwards. The period of reflection so many are talking about cannot be a mirror of past battles. Since we lost a decade ago, the debate about the party has focused on what your view is of a leader who, at the time of the next general election, won\u2019t have fought an election in 20 years. Some call me a Blairite because I\u2019m evangelical about the difference Sure Start and tax credits made to my life. But I marched against Iraq, and I didn\u2019t even become an MP until eight years after he\u2019d left parliament, so how does that fit? That label is as meaningless as labelling people Gaitskellite or Bennite. Are we going to allow another label attached to a former leader to keep us in the past? Surely we can do better than define ourselves in relation to the men who led us in the past? I genuinely met a bloke on the doorstep in Yardley who told me he would never vote Labour because he blamed Ramsay McDonald for the fact that his dad lost his job. You won\u2019t see that in any of the post-election analysis, because 100-year grudges or 20-year grudges or even grudges of the last four years do naff all to actually change people\u2019s opinions or their lives. That\u2019s the goal, right? If we are to find a way to reconnect with those working-class voters, we have to be brave. It\u2019s time to try something different, rather than re-enacting old battles.

In truth, once the group of the Big had grown beyond the number of sides who could qualify for the Champions League, it was never likely to be as self-perpetuating as it had been.

      "bodyText": "There is a danger always in football, perhaps in life more generally, to assume certain attributes, certain virtues, certain values are eternal. They are not. We talk now of a Big Six in the Premier League but it\u2019s not so long ago it was a Big Four. In truth, once the group of the Big had grown beyond the number of sides who could qualify for the Champions League, it was never likely to be as self-perpetuating as it had been. That particular hegemony was broken by Sheikh Mansour\u2019s investment in Manchester City and the remarkable rise of Tottenham \u2013 for which Daniel Levy deserves enormous credit, whatever responsibility he must take for the wobble of the last few months. The Big Six were the top six last season and four of them, notably not the champions nor the wealthiest team in the country by revenue, reached European finals, but these things are not set in stone. English football has never had an eternal elite in the way that German football has Bayern plus the rest, Scottish or Spanish football has a big two, or Italy has (or at least had) a big three of Juventus and the two Milan clubs. The English big two of 20 years ago aren\u2019t even the best teams in their own cities any more. But football is changing. For the first time, all the sides in the Champions League last 16 are from the wealthiest five European leagues. It is true Atalanta cannot by any reasonable assessment be considered part of the elite, but it\u2019s equally true that one anomaly, no matter how heartwarming, cannot obscure the overall trend. This is not a super\u2011league, yet, but it\u2019s beginning to look an awful lot like one. And that means there is an urgency for teams outside the Champions League to get back into it as soon as possible. That is not just an immediate economic imperative. Football increasingly rewards its biggest clubs and it\u2019s entirely possible \u2013 probable, even \u2013 that at some point in the not too distant future, a line will be drawn, the ladder will be pulled up and a group of super\u2011clubs will arrange a closed or semi-closed competition that reifies their financial status. Arsenal may have been able to blag their way into the First Division ahead of Spurs in 1919, but would anybody back Stan Kroenke to be as persuasive as Sir Henry Norris was back then? But even beyond those specific concerns, Arsenal have drifted badly. Mediocrity came on first gradually and then suddenly.

Since when the policy seems to have been to eschew addressing weaknesses in the squad in favour of spaffing whatever money is available on occasional exciting attacking players, fan appeasement prioritised above squad building. Ah, yes. The fans. This is the other irony of the Emirates. It is a luxurious arena. The seats are padded and comfortable. The press facilities are unimpeachable. And the ticket prices are high. All of that seemed reasonable when work began on the new stadium in 2004, as Arsenal competed their Invincibles season, but it also created a sense of expectation to which the following 15 years have failed to live up. Grumbling has become a way of life at the Emirates and that ambient dissatisfaction has been a factor in the decline, a feedback loop there is no obvious means of breaking. Arsenal fans have become trapped in a self-fulfilling cycle by which their own anger creates the condition to justify that anger, as though Sophocles were producing Arsenal Fan TV.

The advantage time for the Saints was minimal and they felt Ringrose\u2019s third try should not have been allowed because the ball had been spilled forward. But there was no doubting his second. A lineout move saw Lowe come into the midfield to take an inside pass from Robbie Henshaw and free Ringrose on his outside. Leinster\u2019s third try came after another throw, although it was more prosaic, with Tadhg Furlong finishing off a driving maul. Their fourth, scored by Dave Kearney, followed Ringrose again tormenting the defence before timing his pass. \u201cWe did not have much luck but, when you bring a side with a lot of inexperience against a team full of internationals, there will be a gulf,\u201d said the Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd. \u201cWe never thought the result would have an influence on our position in the tournament but it was disappointing not to get the bonus point which we were really chasing.\u201d",

But the truth is he found Labour a rightwardly drifting shell and will leave it a mass movement that could yet transform Britain.

      "bodyText": "Michael Chessum Former member of the Momentum steering committee In the coming days, two Labour tribes will put forward two simple narratives about the election. One will argue that Labour\u2019s mistake was to offer a second referendum. The other will pin the blame squarely on the left \u2013 not just on Corbyn, but on Labour\u2019s radical programme. Stuck in the middle will be the party membership, the overwhelming majority of whom are both opposed to Brexit and firmly on the left of Labour. Both narratives are wrong. In the end Labour did not do enough to persuade people of the policy, but had it failed to back a final say on Brexit, it would have faced oblivion as the Remain vote split even more evenly with the Lib Dems. And while Labour\u2019s manifesto might have been inadequately communicated, its headline policies were overwhelmingly popular. Without either, Labour would never have been able to inspire the biggest ground operation in British political history. Jeremy Corbyn will now face a whirlwind of recrimination, and it is undeniable he was unpopular on the doorstep. But the truth is he found Labour a rightwardly drifting shell and will leave it a mass movement that could yet transform Britain. As an internally unifying figure with a democratic mandate, there is no reason why he, or someone he appoints, should not stay to ensure an orderly transition. Corbyn\u2019s mistakes came when he held back. On issues like immigration and party reform, he was forced to balance the radicalism of the mass movement with the conservatism of key institutional allies like Len McCluskey. On the crucial issue of the day, Brexit, Labour\u2019s strategy was a protracted series of handbrake turns and triangulations, not principled stands. The result is, for now, both Remainers and Corbynites have lost. To win again, they will need each other. MPs Lucy Powell and Shabana Mahmood Members of Labour Together Labour candidates and activists worked hard in all weathers, to try to achieve a transformative Labour government with energy, enthusiasm and dedication. We promised real, radical change that we thought the country needed, but it\u2019s clear our offer to the electorate was resoundingly rejected. We don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers as to why we lost, but we campaigned across the north and the Midlands, and understand the challenges we faced in our heartland and marginal seats. Our starting point for a Labour recovery can\u2019t be to pick the things we like and blame the things we don\u2019t. Some want to say our defeat was all about Jeremy Corbyn; others that it was only Brexit. Both are wrong. Our losses were about both and much, much more. We must now undertake a real, meaningful review with everything on the table, and no no-go areas. It must start from a place of humility which acknowledges Labour got it wrong rather than the voters, with a process that involves the whole of our movement, and those who feel we\u2019ve left them behind. There\u2019s no quick fix. Nor would a quick leadership election defined by the same factional infighting that\u2019s plagued us for the past three years move us forward. It would probably do the opposite. Whether you\u2019re the leader, an MP, a defeated candidate or a party member, we\u2019ve all got a lot to face up to here. It\u2019s not easy but every one of us must face truths we\u2019ve been ducking, accept our preferred path isn\u2019t working or that we\u2019ve lost touch with those we think we are in politics to help and represent. Until we collectively go through this reconciliation and contrition together, we can\u2019t start the long road back to winning elections again. Stephen Doughty Labour and Cooperative MP for Cardiff South and Penarth Hundreds of thousands of Labour activists put their hearts and souls into trying to stop Boris Johnson and offer a new direction \u2013 and the sense of despair and outright fear of what the Tories might do now is stark. In the face of such a huge defeat, the only response must be humility, honesty and utterly frank reflection \u2013 urgently \u2013 on the part of everyone from the leadership down. Anyone who spoke to former Labour voters on the doorstep knows that the reason for our defeat started first with their views on the leadership \u2013 and went well beyond Brexit \u2013 into a much wider set of fears about our credibility on everything from national security to spending. We cannot afford to linger on for months in mourning delusion, or brush the reasons for our defeat under the carpet \u2013 we must reorganise swiftly and radically for the sake of those who will need us more than ever to stand up for them in the difficult years ahead. Peter Kyle Labour MP for Hove Brexit isn\u2019t a natural disaster to which we were innocent bystanders. It is a political crisis that brutally exposed the failings of our party leadership. Policy development was never rooted in the reality of Leave or Remain communities, nor the aspirations and anxieties of Leave or Remain voters. Hence we landed in the absurd position where Leavers thought we were a Remain party and Remainers thought we were a Leave party. We didn\u2019t get here by accident, we were led here. Similarly, confusion reigned in a plethora of other areas, from our response to Russia\u2019s attack on Salisbury to climate change targets, and voters were watching. Beyond policy, Brexit shone the brightest of lights on those at the top of our movement and found them constantly warring, incapable of basic managerial competence. New members flocked towards a kinder, gentler politics but were betrayed by a culture of authoritarianism, bullying and organisational incompetence. If we end the nastiness in our party and root ourselves in the realities of a 21st-century economy, we have a chance. Labour failed to win more support than the Tories in any socioeconomic group, including the working class. We\u2019re a divided country yearning for a patriotic party that values wealth creation as well as social justice. Voters also said we needed to look more competent, questioning how a party that can\u2019t manage antisemitism out of its own party could possibly run the Home Office. We must move forward, fast. Tom Watson has gone, Jeremy is going, and Len McCluskey must follow. They\u2019ve been waging an ideological and personal war for decades and must now leave others to build a movement fit for the future, rooted in the future, and capable of carrying Labour to power in order to shape the future. Lisa Nandy Labour MP for Wigan We\u2019ve lost touch with the day-to-day lived experience of many of the people we want to represent. Taken individually, so many of the policies in Labour\u2019s manifesto were popular with the public, but as a package, failed to touch the sides of what people feel is really needed.

      "bodyText": "West Ham deserve their victory. Sebastien Haller scored the only goal, while his strike partner Michail Antonio was immense for the first hour of the game. Southampton put them under increasing pressure in the last half an hour, with Danny Ings hitting the bar and having a fine goal disallowed, but the West Ham keeper David Martin barely had a save to make. Thanks for your company - goodnight! Peep peep! Manuel Pellegrini should still have a job at Christmas thanks to this excellent victory. 90+5 min Martin is going to continue, though he is clearly struggling. Southampton should shoot from anywhere if they get the chance. 90+4 min Now Martin is down with what looks like a thigh injury. West Ham have used all their subs, so an outfield player may have to go in goal for the last few seconds. 90+4 min Martin is booked for timewasting. 90+3 min Nothing happens from the corner. Southampton are running out of time. 90+2 min Djenepo wins a corner for Southampton. Just before that, Adams dithered in the area and allowed Ogbonna to stab the ball to safety. 90+1 min There will be four added minutes. 90 min Ward-Prowse\u2019s free-kick goes straight into the loving embrace of David Martin 89 min Balbuena is penalised for a challenge on Djenepo just outside the area on the left. I\u2019m not sure there was any contact, and West Ham will be fuming if this leads to an equaliser. 88 min Another West Ham change: Issa Diop replaces Mark Noble. I\u2019m surprised Antonio is still on the pitch, because he ran himself into the ground in a blistering first hour. 87 min Southampton\u2019s last chance - Cedric off, Che Adams on. 86 min Cedric\u2019s cross flashes across the face of goal before being half cleared to Hojbjerg, who screws a half-volley just wide from 12 yards. Martin had it covered. Southampton have been much better in the last 20 minutes. The improvement has probably been fuelled by desperation as much as anything. 84 min Southampton make their second change, with Stuart Armstrong replacing Shane Long. 81 min Another chance for Southampton. Stephens, picked out nicely by Hojbjerg\u2019s cut-back, slices miles wide from 15 yards. 80 min The goalscorer Sebastien Haller is replaced by Carlos Sanchez. 79 min Yarmolenko misses an excellent chance, lobbing over the bar with his right foot after a neat West Ham move. 77 min This game has come to life. McCarthy makes a brilliant save, plunging to his left to tip Haller\u2019s smart header round the post. 76 min: Ings has a goal disallowed! He was penalised for fouling Yarmolenko moments before he lashed a spectcular long-range shot past Martin. That looks a bit soft, though VAR can\u2019t intervene in such incidents. 74 min This is Southampton\u2019s best spell of the match, with West Ham looking a bit rattled for the first time all night. 73 min Andriy Yarmolenko replaces Robert Snodgrass for West Ham. 72 min: Now Ings hits the post! He had been flagged offside, though it looked very tight and might have been overturned by VAR had he scored. 70 min: Ings hits the underside of the bar! That was the closest Southampton have come. He pulled down a cross from Djenepo, waited for the ball to bounce up and slammed a left-footed shot that beat Martin and clattered off the underside of the bar. It rebounded to Long, who slammed the loose ball into the side-netting. He should have got it on target, though I suspect Cresswell would have blocked it had he done so. 69 min Although Southampton have dominated possession in the second half, West Ham still look the more threatening side. 67 min If West Ham win they will move up to 15th - but they would be only six points behind Sheffield United in fifth place. I can\u2019t remember the last time the middle of the Premier League table was so tight. 66 min Djenepo curls over the bar from 23 yards. 65 min \u201cNo lack of energy and effort from Southampton,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cSerious lack of a plan to produce a goal.\u201d Yes, they do look a wee bit witless. 64 min Djenepo, who looks Southampton\u2019s biggest threat in open play, wins a corner. It\u2019s headed away to Hojbjerg, who splatters a long-range half-volley into Row O. 62 min \u201cWhen it\u2019s cold, you can wrap up, McMahon,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cLast night, S4C showed a glamour tie from the Welsh Premier League, Barri v Y Seintiau Newydd. I honestly can\u2019t remember the last time I saw such a wet game of football. The fact that it was played on a 3G pitch prevented it from becoming a mud bath, but it gave the pitch a surreal bright green sheen. Proper football.\u201d I\u2019ll show you proper football. Wait for the kick-off. 60 min Snodgrass\u2019s corner is flicked on at the near post and flashes across goal. 59 min Antonio rampages down the left wing, leaving Cedric in his slipstream, and hits a cross that is put behind for a corner by Stephens. Snodgrass will take it... 56 min Fredericks is booked for a late tackle on Djenepo. 54 min It would have been a memorable goal from Antonio. He rumbled straight through two defenders and whistled a half-volley into the bottom corner. He has been immense today, the perfect personification of the phrase \u201con one\u201d. That\u2019s fair enough, as he accidentally controlled the ball with his hand as he ran through. VAR check I think this will be disallowed for handball. If ever a man deserved a goal... 49 min Cedric\u2019s booming cross from the right is headed up in the air by Ward-Prowse and reaches Djenepo beyond the far post. His attempted cross is put behind for a corner. Nothing comes of it, but that was more promising for Southampton. 46 min: Fine save from McCarthy! Fornals almost makes it 2-0 after 31 seconds of the second half. Haller lobbed the ball towards the edge of the box, where Fornals ran round the ball and swished a rising half-volley towards goal. McCarthy thrust out his left hand to tip it over the bar. 46 min Peep peep! West Ham begin the second half. Southampton have made a half-time change, with Oriel Romeu replacing Nathan Redmond. That means a switch to 4-2-3-1, with Djenepo on the left wing and Long on the right. Half-time reading Peep peep! West Ham have been the better team and deserve to lead through Sebastien Haller\u2019s goal. The star has been his strike partner Michail Antonio, who has embodied West Ham\u2019s greater intensity and desire. See you soon for the second half. 45+2 min Snodgrass is booked for pulling back Bertrand. 45 min Two minutes of added time. 43 min A decent chance for Hojbjerg, who heads well over the bar from Cedric\u2019s cross. He was unmarked, 12 yards from goal, and should probably halve done better. 42 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI see JR\u2019s Southampton v West Ham anti-glamour tie, and I raise him an Arbroath v Dundee United at Gayfield this afternoon. It was what I imagine football would be like if they dropped in a pitch at the North Pole and had polar bears up against arctic foxes, with a wolverine as referee. But colder. And the North Pole has better toilets.\u201d 39 min Michail Antonio looks like he\u2019s on a one-man mission to keep Poppa Pellegrini in a job. He is roaming the green with furious, almost deranged intent. That was a fine move. The outstanding Antonio zipped past Bednarek on the right and just managed to keep the ball in play before guiding it back to Snodgrass. He stood up a deep cross to Fornals, who cushioned a careful header back towards Haller, 12 yards from goal. He didn\u2019t connect cleanly with his left-footed shot, but it bounced past McCarthy and went into the net off the far post. West Ham take a deserved lead! 37 min Hojbjerg is booked for a foul on Haller. 35 min \u201cThe amount of pointless running about is extraordinary,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the players would notice if there wasn\u2019t a ball on the pitch.\u201d 34 min Antonio is getting very frustrated with the refereeing. I\u2019m not surprised - three or four decisions, including the penalty appeal, have gone against him for no apparent reason. 33 min A nice bit of play from Southampton. Djenepo slides a pass infield from the right towards Ings, who slides to scoop a cross from the byline that is just too close to Martin. 28 min \u201cSo the ol\u2019 MBM is bringing people together now is it?\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cThought that was what Soulmates was for. Let\u2019s try Pawmates. Since my dear border collie Stella passed away I\u2019ve been looking to re-home similar to no avail. If any doggy devoted MBM readers want to make an only slightly eccentric writer happy, send said pooch. Extra-long walks on holiday mornings and every Saturday is sausage day. Cheers!\u201d 27 min The more you see that appeal, the more it looks like a penalty. It\u2019s precisely the kind of foul that defenders won\u2019t be able to get away with when video technology is introduced. VAR decision: no penalty West Ham aren\u2019t happy. I thought the appeal was for the challenge on Haller, but replays suggest West Ham had a far better claim for a foul by Bednarek, who had his arm round the neck of Antonio. 25 min Cresswell crosses deep towards Haller, who goes flying after a little shove from Bertrand. Martin Atkinson says no penalty, but this may be given by VAR. 25 min Cedric cuts infield onto his left foot but lashes high over the bar from 25 yards. 20 min \u201cYup I like Antonio up front in a two, or on his own with two behind,\u201d says Ian Sargeant. \u201cHe\u2019s been likened for a fully loaded shopping trolley heading downhill with a broken wheel. No one knows what\u2019s going to happen - least of all him - but more often than not he comes off.\u201d 18 min Nothing much to report at the moment. West Ham certainly don\u2019t look like a team who want a change of manager. 14 min \u201cA different look at this match,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cHigh quality? Probably not. High drama? I say yes. Two managers fighting for their job. Do the players match this desperation or do they prefer a new gaffer? Relegation battles always have a car crash quality to them. You can\u2019t help but stare.\u201d 13 min After a slow start, Southampton are starting to have more of the ball. Hojbjerg crosses from the left towards Long, whose looping header is comfortably saved by Martin. 9 min A question for West Ham fans. Whenever I see Antonio play up front he is really impressive, an unpleasant handful for defenders. Have I just caught him on a few good days or should he start at centre-forward more often? 8 min West Ham have started really well and almost took the lead a moment ago. The impressive Antonio drove a speculative low cross on the turn from the right. It reached Fornals, whose stabbed shot on the run deflected off Cedric and dribbled just wide of the far post. 7 min ... and bugger all will eventuate from it. 6 min It\u2019s rare to see a match in which both teams are playing with a front two. Michail Antonio, who has started with considerable intent, wins a corner for West Ham. Snodgrass will take it... 3 min \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says JR in Illinois. \u201cI\u2019m not really intending to insult anyone but this game wouldn\u2019t be referred to by anyone as a \u2018glamour tie\u2019, would it? In fact, I\u2019d say this game is the opposite of a glamour tie, whatever that is called. Ah well, maybe I\u2019ll watch a bit. It will help pass the time until the second session of the darts is on.\u201d I trust you saw Humphries v Wattimena this afternoon? Blistering stuff. 2 min: Disallowed goal for West Ham! Antonio turns smartly on the left wing and is fouled by Stephens. Snodgrass\u2019s excellent free-kick is headed in confidently by Rice - but he\u2019s fractionally offside. The assistant raises the flag, and VAR confirms it was the correct decision 1 min Peep peep! Southampton kick off from right to left. The players emerge from the tunnel, all looking ready for business. It\u2019s a glorious night on the South Coast. Little brisk. Pre-match reading Felipe Anderson is out with a stomach problem, so Sebastian Haller returns to the West Ham side. Southampton are unchanged.

We will see how the one pitch will be.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have one game more when we play West Ham, I\u2019m not sure when that is yet. Until then we try to sort it as well as possible for us. With the Gini [Wijnaldum] injury today, Dejan [Lovren] four days ago, our squad is not getting bigger. But that would be the same problem if we went to Villa and played the Carabao Cup quarter-final. The fixtures are like they are. You all like watching us suffering. That is how it is. Maybe you look concerned but in the end nobody really cares, to be 100% honest. We have to deal with it, we speak about it and nobody else really speaks about it.

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has condemned plans to expand the Champions League group stage as \u201cabsolute bollocks\u201d and Fifa\u2019s organisation of the Club World Cup, as Liverpool prepare to participate in the tournament. The leading Premier League clubs, including Liverpool, are reported to support proposals to turn the group stage of the Champions League into a 32-team league from the 2024-25 season. FA Cup replays and the second leg of the League Cup semi-final would be abolished as a consequence. Klopp has long argued for a reduction in the number of games for top players but the proposed expansion of the Champions League has prompted disbelief from the Liverpool manager. He is also angered at the use of one stadium for the Club World Cup after the Education City Stadium in Qatar, where Liverpool were scheduled to play two matches, was not finished in time for the competition. Asked about the demands on his players after their hard-fought 2-0 Premier League win against Watford on Saturday, he replied: \u201cIf we wouldn\u2019t go to Qatar we would play midweek Aston Villa [in the Carabao Cup quarter-final] and then West Ham. \u201cThe only difference is we fly for seven hours and then it is warmer. I think it is raining there, too. It doesn\u2019t help the one pitch we are all now playing on \u2026 sensationally good organising, all the games on the one pitch. We will see how the one pitch will be. \u201cWe have one game more when we play West Ham, I\u2019m not sure when that is yet. Until then we try to sort it as well as possible for us. With the Gini [Wijnaldum] injury today, Dejan [Lovren] four days ago, our squad is not getting bigger. But that would be the same problem if we went to Villa and played the Carabao Cup quarter-final. The fixtures are like they are. You all like watching us suffering. That is how it is. Maybe you look concerned but in the end nobody really cares, to be 100% honest. We have to deal with it, we speak about it and nobody else really speaks about it. When you discuss it, we don\u2019t know exactly what they want. \u201cToday I read an article that the top clubs want more games in the Champions League, I am absolutely not involved in these plans. That is absolute bollocks as well. We can talk about everything but we have to cut off games, not put more in. \u201cIt is clear we need each point we can get because it is a tough and long season. You can make early judgments [on the season] but we can\u2019t, we just have to recover and play the next game.\u201d Wijnaldum was forced off against Watford with a muscle injury and will be assessed by Liverpool\u2019s medical staff on Sunday before a decision is taken on whether the midfielder will travel to Qatar.",

Stu is on a carer\u2019s pension; his wife Heather is on a disability support pension. She was in hospital when the fire went through. They spent their savings on a house for their 31-year-old autistic son, Dylan, in Grafton, and could not afford insurance.</p> <p>\u201cMum doesn\u2019t know where she is going to go when she comes out of hospital,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing living in a bush house that\u2019s been built to what her mobility needs, but it is another thing to face months of camping. They lived in a tent for a year when they put the roof on, but they were younger then and mum wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p> <p>Stu is now couch-surfing in between sorting through the rubble to salvage bits of the house that can be reused. He saved his musical instruments when he evacuated but forgot to bring any clothes. The bush around the house, which Ross says once needed a machete to walk through, has been replaced with charcoal and ash.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s apocalyptic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had fires before, we have had bad fires before. We have seen what it looks like when fires go through, and it\u2019s not like this \u2026 it\u2019s like something out of a doomsday movie.</p> <p>\u201cBlack trees, no topsoil \u2013 the topsoil is gone, it\u2019s just rock.

Her home, a mud brick house built by her parents 32 years ago, which she is renting from them, was among those lost at Nymboida on 8 November.</p> <p>\u201cMy [nine-year-old] daughter is experiencing it too,\u201d Jongen says. \u201cShe is really angry and she is hurting.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an anger Ross Mackay shares. He wrote an open letter to former prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott, who he says bear responsibility for turning the climate emergency into a political football in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cAs a family, we hold them responsible for their part in creating the situation where the risk of a bushfire taking our home has become a reality,\u201d Ross says. \u201cWe are not stupid, we know that fire is a risk if you live in the bush, but I do feel it has gone from being a risk to an inevitability. If you live in the bush, at some point you are going to lose your house.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10d80045194990cccffb33857c1e16b4a1eaae09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10d80045194990cccffb33857c1e16b4a1eaae09/0_0_1440_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The remnants of Nina Jongen\u2019s 32-year-old mud brick family home at Nymboida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The remnants of Nina Jongen\u2019s 32-year-old mud brick family home at Nymboida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Jongen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bushfires have burned 2.7m hectares in NSW since the fire season began in August, and 122 fires are still burning.

Her home at Wytaliba, 65km west of Nymboida on the other side of the Nymboida National Park, was badly damaged: the roof is gone but the double-brick shell remains. Her neighbours were also burned out.</p> <p>Two of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/nsw-and-queensland-fires-fourth-person-confirmed-dead-in-bushfires-near-kempsey\">four people who died in the NSW bushfires</a> were at Wytaliba.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of offers of help but basically we can\u2019t do much yet,\u201d Sparks says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a waiting game at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Sparks is staying in a cottage owned by her daughter while she waits for updates from her insurance company.</p> <p>Insurers have received more than 2,000 claims for bushfire damage in NSW and south-east Queensland, with estimated losses of more than $165m. That does not cover all of the damage. Many homes were uninsured or severely underinsured.</p> <p>In lower socioeconomic areas like Taree, where 124 homes were destroyed and 67 damaged, almost no one had appropriate insurance.</p> <p>\u201cPeople do not insure their property to its value,\u201d says David West, mayor of the MidCoast Council. \u201cThey insure it to what they can afford.\u201d</p> <p>West was forced to flee his home at Brimbin, 10km outside Taree, and expected to lose the house. He plugged the gutters with expanding foam \u2014 not a good idea unless you remember to put down clingfilm first, he says \u2014 and drove away with a few valuables.</p> <p>They were saved by a wind change. The fire was capricious, destroying some homes while sparing others.</p> <p>\u201cThis fire has been such a terrible, terrible bastard of a thing,\u201d West says. \u201cIt chose to destroy what it chose to destroy, and the community could not defend themselves.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The future is pretty bleak\u2019</h2> <p>More than 500 people spent that first Friday night at the Taree evacuation centre. Most have now found somewhere to stay: in caravans, garages, and spare rooms, all via the generosity of neighbours.</p> <p>St Vincent de Paul is handing cash to those affected so they can buy new clothes and Christmas presents.</p> <p>A generous benefactor from Sydney has bought deliveries of water for Wytaliba, supplying 50 people whose tanks were destroyed. The surrounding rivers and creeks are dry.</p> <p>Sparks says her community is worried about the rest of the summer.</p> <p>\u201cWe have still got lots of dry trees sitting there,\u201d she says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had that good rain that will see us through. The future is looking pretty bleak to me.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Spears is praying for a specific type of rain. A heavy downpour would see the hills around his banana plantation at Taylors Arm lose what little topsoil remained.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/13/australias-bushfires-have-emitted-250m-tonnes-of-co2-almost-half-of-countrys-annual-emissions\">Australia's bushfires have emitted 250m tonnes of CO2, almost half of country's annual emissions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we can organise it, it really needs to come nice and gently, or it will be that much soil and that much ash washed out to sea,\u201d Spears says.</p> <p>Spears lost most of his banana plantation and his packing shed and equipment in the fires.

      "bodyText": "One month after a bushfire burned the home they built from scratch in the northern New South Wales town of Nymboida, Stu Mackay is sifting through the rubble to find cast-iron tools. The tools are heirlooms, and the Mackays will need them to rebuild. Theirs is one of 632 houses lost in NSW since Friday 8 November, when deadly weather conditions sent fast-moving bushfires through communities along the state\u2019s north coast. Guardian Australia spoke to four people who lost their home or business on that first day. \u2018Just ash\u2019 The Mackays built their house from scratch using recycled materials. It started as a double garage and grew steadily, with rooms added according to need and the overarching, never fully realised vision of its creator: a Sagrada Familia on an Australian bush block. \u201cEvery beam and panel had a story, of how we did it and what went wrong and what we were trying to do,\u201d Stu\u2019s son Ross Mackay says. The loss is devastating. Stu is on a carer\u2019s pension; his wife Heather is on a disability support pension. She was in hospital when the fire went through. They spent their savings on a house for their 31-year-old autistic son, Dylan, in Grafton, and could not afford insurance. \u201cMum doesn\u2019t know where she is going to go when she comes out of hospital,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing living in a bush house that\u2019s been built to what her mobility needs, but it is another thing to face months of camping. They lived in a tent for a year when they put the roof on, but they were younger then and mum wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d Stu is now couch-surfing in between sorting through the rubble to salvage bits of the house that can be reused. He saved his musical instruments when he evacuated but forgot to bring any clothes. The bush around the house, which Ross says once needed a machete to walk through, has been replaced with charcoal and ash. \u201cIt\u2019s apocalyptic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had fires before, we have had bad fires before. We have seen what it looks like when fires go through, and it\u2019s not like this \u2026 it\u2019s like something out of a doomsday movie. \u201cBlack trees, no topsoil \u2013 the topsoil is gone, it\u2019s just rock. No animals. No insects. Just ash.\u201d \u2018Angry and hurting\u2019 The loss of the forest has created a sense of \u201chuge ecological grief\u201d on top of more personal losses, says Nina Jongen. Her home, a mud brick house built by her parents 32 years ago, which she is renting from them, was among those lost at Nymboida on 8 November. \u201cMy [nine-year-old] daughter is experiencing it too,\u201d Jongen says. \u201cShe is really angry and she is hurting.\u201d It\u2019s an anger Ross Mackay shares. He wrote an open letter to former prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott, who he says bear responsibility for turning the climate emergency into a political football in Australia. \u201cAs a family, we hold them responsible for their part in creating the situation where the risk of a bushfire taking our home has become a reality,\u201d Ross says. \u201cWe are not stupid, we know that fire is a risk if you live in the bush, but I do feel it has gone from being a risk to an inevitability. If you live in the bush, at some point you are going to lose your house.\u201d Bushfires have burned 2.7m hectares in NSW since the fire season began in August, and 122 fires are still burning. Total property losses are 741 homes destroyed and 288 damaged. Jongen was working in Lismore when the fire went through Nymboida. She asked her family to save a photo album, but in the rush they grabbed the wrong one. She is now staying at the Nymboida Canoe Centre, which has made its cabins available to bushfire victims. \u201cI feel really proud of our community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were absolutely bowled over with help, it was almost too much. We quite quickly realised we needed to coordinate it.\u201d \u2018A terrible bastard of a thing\u2019 Coordinating donations and offers of assistance has been one of the jobs of Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glenn Innes shire council. Her home at Wytaliba, 65km west of Nymboida on the other side of the Nymboida National Park, was badly damaged: the roof is gone but the double-brick shell remains. Her neighbours were also burned out. Two of the four people who died in the NSW bushfires were at Wytaliba. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of offers of help but basically we can\u2019t do much yet,\u201d Sparks says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a waiting game at the moment.\u201d Sparks is staying in a cottage owned by her daughter while she waits for updates from her insurance company. Insurers have received more than 2,000 claims for bushfire damage in NSW and south-east Queensland, with estimated losses of more than $165m. That does not cover all of the damage. Many homes were uninsured or severely underinsured. In lower socioeconomic areas like Taree, where 124 homes were destroyed and 67 damaged, almost no one had appropriate insurance. \u201cPeople do not insure their property to its value,\u201d says David West, mayor of the MidCoast Council. \u201cThey insure it to what they can afford.\u201d West was forced to flee his home at Brimbin, 10km outside Taree, and expected to lose the house. He plugged the gutters with expanding foam \u2014 not a good idea unless you remember to put down clingfilm first, he says \u2014 and drove away with a few valuables. They were saved by a wind change. The fire was capricious, destroying some homes while sparing others. \u201cThis fire has been such a terrible, terrible bastard of a thing,\u201d West says. \u201cIt chose to destroy what it chose to destroy, and the community could not defend themselves.\u201d \u2018The future is pretty bleak\u2019 More than 500 people spent that first Friday night at the Taree evacuation centre. Most have now found somewhere to stay: in caravans, garages, and spare rooms, all via the generosity of neighbours. St Vincent de Paul is handing cash to those affected so they can buy new clothes and Christmas presents. A generous benefactor from Sydney has bought deliveries of water for Wytaliba, supplying 50 people whose tanks were destroyed. The surrounding rivers and creeks are dry. Sparks says her community is worried about the rest of the summer. \u201cWe have still got lots of dry trees sitting there,\u201d she says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had that good rain that will see us through. The future is looking pretty bleak to me.\u201d Stephen Spears is praying for a specific type of rain. A heavy downpour would see the hills around his banana plantation at Taylors Arm lose what little topsoil remained. \u201cIf we can organise it, it really needs to come nice and gently, or it will be that much soil and that much ash washed out to sea,\u201d Spears says. Spears lost most of his banana plantation and his packing shed and equipment in the fires. The heat melted the plastic banana covers to the fruit and destroyed his fledgling avocado trees. His brother Michael, whose plantation is next door, was also burned out. Their houses, further along the ridge line, were spared. The surrounding forest was destroyed: if you\u2019re quiet in the bush you can hear the trees falling to the ground, says Spears. The plantation is the brothers\u2019 livelihood. It will be 18 months before it is profitable again. \u201cThe first thing I did after the fire was go to my local credit union and ask for no repayments on the principal of my mortgage for 12 months,\u201d Spears says. \u201cThey have agreed to that, luckily, but it will be a rough year.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Kurnell is a no-fuss, unpretentious place given that it\u2019s supposed to be the cradle of the nation. Stretching along a promontory that looks like a witch\u2019s finger pointing west from the southern shore of Botany Bay, opposite Sydney airport, Kurnell is a hotchpotch sprawl of fibro modesty and glass-and-steel ambition, where trailered speedboats rest on the verges and Aussie flags snap on front-yard poles. Nestled in Kamay Botany Bay national park, Kurnell overlooks a mass of water lacking the frenetic beauty of luminous sails and green and gold ferries, and of some of the international signature structures of modernity, that characterise that other vast nearby inlet that the colonists instead chose as the harbour for their penal settlement.</p> <p>Its cross-bay vista, more Jeffrey Smart than Brett Whiteley, is of the big jets levitating over the ever-frantic north\u2013south runways, the containers, cargo ships, break-waters, piers and giant straddle cranes of Port Botany and, off to the right, the breakers foaming on the cliffs about La Perouse, home to two French naval ships for six weeks in 1788 and still Sydney\u2019s most enduring Indigenous settlement. As you enter Kurnell along Captain Cook Drive you\u2019ll pass the monolithic tanks of Sydney\u2019s seawater desalination plant, exemplar of 21st-century engineering built in anticipation of Sydney\u2019s now-extant twin perils of over-population and climate emergency, and, close by, the local community, sports and rec club with its Endeavour Chinese restaurant (a nearby cafe\u0301 has the same name) offering Australian, Thai and Malay cuisine.</p> <p>And just up on the left is the sign, cemented in the ground on a rusting fixture as unambiguously as the claim it stakes for Kurnell\u2019s place in Australian history:</p> <p><em>Welcome to Kurnell the Birthplace of Modern Australia</em></p> <p>It is a bold, hotly contested proposition, notwithstanding what happened on the rocks a few hundred metres away from here on 29 April 1770. That is when HM Bark Endeavour, in the charge of Yorkshireman Lieutenant James Cook, the most talented and celebrated British navigator of his epoch, anchored in the bay and sent ashore two longboats in the afternoon. There is no denying the historic character of this day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6da38768f9b8988414106567a0ad2de47274d0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6da38768f9b8988414106567a0ad2de47274d0d/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A replica of Captain James Cook\u2019s HM Bark Endeavour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A replica of Captain James Cook\u2019s HM Bark Endeavour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Graham/CAG Photography Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the first recorded landing of a European vessel on the east coast of what was already mapped by the Dutch to the north, west and partial-south as New Holland.</p> <p>It was also the moment of initial contact between a civilisation stretching well beyond 60,000 years and another with its roots in an altogether different \u201cold world\u201d \u2013 one intent on further expanding its colonial claims in the name of the Enlightenment.</p> <p>That welcome sign has its own complex evolutionary history. We will come to that. But its continued use, as non-Indigenous Australia plans a $50m-plus jamboree for the sestercentennial of the Endeavour\u2019s anchoring, is a reminder of just how exclusive of Aboriginal sentiment, history, culture and achievement has been \u2013 and remains \u2013 so much of Australia\u2019s civic celebrations about Cook.

Yet Cook, the \u201cdiscoverer\u201d, as non-Indigenous historiography cast him for so long \u2013 though not as the invader, occupier or settler \u2013 still manages to divide Australia along black and white lines with a passion and hatred that evades those who later oversaw colonialism\u2019s worst violent excesses.</p> <p>In an essay to accompany East Coast Encounter, a 2014 National Maritime Museum art exhibition exploring Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives on 1770, Worimi man John Maynard, a professor of history at Newcastle University, writes how Cook has evolved into \u201ca time-travelling bogeyman to Aboriginal Australia\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cook transcends time and space to wreak havoc across the continent upon the Aboriginal inhabitants over the course of the past 243 years.

It reflects the pervasiveness of Cook in Aboriginal story and bequeathed memory, his centrality to the spoken history of Indigenous people the continent over \u2013 including in places he never ventured anywhere near but where there are nonetheless enduring stories of Cook and his men raping and murdering.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cook, the usher of the colonial land grab, is an understandable theme of much modern Australian Indigenous art.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Among the most evocative recent works themed on Cook the evil swindler is Jason Wing\u2019s bronze Captain James Crook<em> </em>(2013), the statue\u2019s face covered with a black balaclava. It riffs off the ubiquity in the Australian psyche and geographic/cultural landscape of Cook\u2019s statuary shape. Even with his face covered like that of a cat burglar or bank robber, Cook\u2019s head and shoulders are unmistakable. I returned to this work over and again when I first saw Defying Empire, the third National Indigenous Art Triennial at the National Gallery of Australia in 2017. In an exhibition electric with provocation about land rights, massacres, deaths in custody and every other colonial Indigenous injustice, Wing\u2019s was, for me, the in-your-face work that most arrestingly exposed the deep, enduring Australian racial fissure on the white national foundation story.</p> <p>Indigenous experiences of colonisation and its generational legacies have varied, of course. But there is doubtless a deep Indigenous emotional affinity with, and understanding of, Wing\u2019s explanation of<em> </em>the work. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I attended high school I was taught that Australia was discovered by Captain James Cook. This colonial lie is further reinforced by a huge bronze sculpture in Hyde Park, Sydney, which is situated on a massacre site. Etched in stone are the words \u2018Captain James Cook Discovered Australia 1770\u2019. I feel physically ill every time I see this monument so I decided to create my own monument to Captain Cook, who personifies colonisation, in Captain James Crook 2013. There are many politically correct terms such as colonised, peacefully settled, occupied, discovered etc. The truth is that Australia was stolen by armed robbery. History is often written and erased by the victors, so I decided to challenge the colonial history of Australia from an Aboriginal perspective and simply tell the truth. As a result of my subversive Captain Cook bust I received many personal attacks on social media ... personal attacks on my physical appearance and Aboriginality, their disgust at my disrespectful and inaccurate version of Australia\u2019s history and my alleged defamation of Captain Cook\u2019s great name.</p> </blockquote> <h2> \u2018Welcome to Kurnell: Where Cultures Meet\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019d passed low over Kurnell on that southern approach while flying into Sydney hundreds of times. It\u2019s easy to miss the grassy expanse of Monument Terrace that meanders down to the landing place amid the more eye-catching discs, as they appear from above, of the desalination tanks, and the verdant carpet of national park that ends with the plummeting blond-sandstone cliffs at Cape Solander, named after Daniel Solander, the Swedish naturalist on Cook\u2019s first Pacific voyage.</p> <p>This part of the Sutherland Shire \u2013 or just \u201cthe shire\u201d, as New South Wales knows it \u2013 where Cook stepped ashore looms large in Australian history and national memory.</p> <p>Australia knows it emotionally, mythically. But not physically. When I visit with historian Mark McKenna it\u2019s a mild, late winter\u2019s day with little of the breeze that so frequently buffets Botany Bay \u2013 a good arvo for sightseeing, yet few people are wandering Monument Terrace or the shore with its dimpled sandstone plateaus, upon one of which Cook first set foot. It\u2019s just after three o\u2019clock and the visitor centre is closed. This is not a well-frequented place.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like such a long way away, but the story attached to it has become part of us, in all its various interpretations,\u201d McKenna says. We laugh while watching a bloke on Prince Charles Parade use a leaf blower to blast the ever-encroaching sand back towards the beach from the big expanse of grass outside his house. Modernity pushing back against the elements. We drive around and look for that welcome sign. We can\u2019t find it, even though it turns out we\u2019ve driven past it perhaps two or three times.</p> <p>It is McKenna who writes of Cook in his 2018 Quarterly Essay, Moment of Truth: History and Australia\u2019s Future: \u201cWe stand forever on the beach with him [Cook].\u201d It\u2019s an incisive metaphor. McKenna explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wanted to leave the door open on Cook. All too often, we expect history to be definitive, to pass judgement and announce a verdict. But understanding Cook is about much more than apportioning praise or blame. We can\u2019t escape him, and we can\u2019t deny him. For better or worse, we\u2019re entangled with his legacy.

That tribute belonged to Kurnell, he said. Sutherland shire eventually settled on a sign reading, \u201cWelcome to Kurnell, birthplace of the nation\u201d.</p> <p>In late 1993, with growing awareness of Indigenous land rights amid the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and the high court\u2019s Mabo decision, Sutherland Shire \u2013 \u201cconscious of the fact that the term currently used by Council, \u2018Birthplace of the Nation\u2019, causes offence to many Aboriginal Australians\u201d \u2013 came up with the existing sign.</p> <p>Cook commemorations at this place had long been conducted without deference to either Indigenous sensibility or desire, for 70 years from Federation in 1901 often involving the anchoring of a replica Endeavour, the dispatching of the long-boats and the recreation of shootings of resisting Indigenous people \u2013 who were brought from interstate to play the local Gweagal (although sometimes the role was given to whites in blackface). It wasn\u2019t until 2000 before council decided, in consultation with an Aboriginal Advisory Committee, officially to change the tenor of the commemorations, consistent with their new title, \u201cMeeting of Two Cultures\u201d.</p> <p>Bruce Howell, a former high school teacher of Wiradjuri descent, has served on the shire\u2019s Aboriginal advisory committee since retiring seven years ago. He has read the diaries of both Cook and Joseph Banks from the Endeavour<em> </em>voyage and he believes the navigator has been \u201cmythologised and oversimplified in Australia\u201d by those who, on one side, have cast him as a flawless hero and, on the other, as Maynard\u2019s \u201cbogeyman\u201d.</p> <p>He is adamant Australia, as it prepares for the 250th anniversary of Cook\u2019s arrival, can learn from the shire\u2019s annual Meeting of Two Cultures commemorations. Speaking in a personal capacity, he says:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"475c621d973892c82741578941bc4417308c4c9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/475c621d973892c82741578941bc4417308c4c9f/186_0_995_1464/680.jpg\" alt=\"Meanjin\u2019s  summer cover\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that the way to do it is to firstly ensure that both sides of the 1770 story are told ... warts and all, and that it be placed into the proper context of the times. This is what ... [happens with] the Meeting of Two Cultures ceremonies ... right where the first meetings took place, in Kamay Botany Bay national park. The premise is that proper respect and acknowledgement should be given not only to all those aboard the Endeavour, but equally to the local people ... who were confronted with both the Endeavour<em> </em>and then the landing party on the afternoon of April 29th 1770. One hurdle is that for so many Australians, myself included, they\u2019ve never been taught our foundational history \u2013 many will conflate the events of 1770 and 1788, and will generally know little about either.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Sutherland shire and the state and federal governments plan the 250th anniversary celebrations of Cook\u2019s arrival \u2013 replete with yet another monument \u2013 the days of that Welcome to Kurnell sign may be numbered.

      "bodyText": "Kurnell is a no-fuss, unpretentious place given that it\u2019s supposed to be the cradle of the nation. Stretching along a promontory that looks like a witch\u2019s finger pointing west from the southern shore of Botany Bay, opposite Sydney airport, Kurnell is a hotchpotch sprawl of fibro modesty and glass-and-steel ambition, where trailered speedboats rest on the verges and Aussie flags snap on front-yard poles. Nestled in Kamay Botany Bay national park, Kurnell overlooks a mass of water lacking the frenetic beauty of luminous sails and green and gold ferries, and of some of the international signature structures of modernity, that characterise that other vast nearby inlet that the colonists instead chose as the harbour for their penal settlement. Its cross-bay vista, more Jeffrey Smart than Brett Whiteley, is of the big jets levitating over the ever-frantic north\u2013south runways, the containers, cargo ships, break-waters, piers and giant straddle cranes of Port Botany and, off to the right, the breakers foaming on the cliffs about La Perouse, home to two French naval ships for six weeks in 1788 and still Sydney\u2019s most enduring Indigenous settlement. As you enter Kurnell along Captain Cook Drive you\u2019ll pass the monolithic tanks of Sydney\u2019s seawater desalination plant, exemplar of 21st-century engineering built in anticipation of Sydney\u2019s now-extant twin perils of over-population and climate emergency, and, close by, the local community, sports and rec club with its Endeavour Chinese restaurant (a nearby cafe\u0301 has the same name) offering Australian, Thai and Malay cuisine. And just up on the left is the sign, cemented in the ground on a rusting fixture as unambiguously as the claim it stakes for Kurnell\u2019s place in Australian history: Welcome to Kurnell the Birthplace of Modern Australia It is a bold, hotly contested proposition, notwithstanding what happened on the rocks a few hundred metres away from here on 29 April 1770. That is when HM Bark Endeavour, in the charge of Yorkshireman Lieutenant James Cook, the most talented and celebrated British navigator of his epoch, anchored in the bay and sent ashore two longboats in the afternoon. There is no denying the historic character of this day. It was the first recorded landing of a European vessel on the east coast of what was already mapped by the Dutch to the north, west and partial-south as New Holland. It was also the moment of initial contact between a civilisation stretching well beyond 60,000 years and another with its roots in an altogether different \u201cold world\u201d \u2013 one intent on further expanding its colonial claims in the name of the Enlightenment. That welcome sign has its own complex evolutionary history. We will come to that. But its continued use, as non-Indigenous Australia plans a $50m-plus jamboree for the sestercentennial of the Endeavour\u2019s anchoring, is a reminder of just how exclusive of Aboriginal sentiment, history, culture and achievement has been \u2013 and remains \u2013 so much of Australia\u2019s civic celebrations about Cook. For modernity has been, from the dedication of the first Australian monument to Cook in 1822, the celebrated purported consequence of the clash of civilisations on Terra Australis that followed Cook. Never mind that this supposed civilising modernism found expression in the attempted annihilation of people from nations tens of thousands of years old \u2013 and a dogged denialism about it that would imbue Australian historiography for generations. NSW premier Robert Askin, voicing a pervading sentiment of the 1970 Cook bicentenary that endures in some quarters today, said: \u2018The Aborigines made some resistance and suffered from their contact with our culture. We are now trying to restore what they inevitably lost from moving out of the Stone Age and into the machine age.\u201d The words of today\u2019s mainstream political leaders about Cook and what he represents to them have tempered. But their sentiments about his arrival, hinging as most do on the purported improvement of continental life for it, do not diverge greatly. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is a big Cook booster. Since his re-election Morrison has appeared in television interviews alongside a small replica of the Endeavour. Morrison, the member for Cook (named after the navigator and incorporating Kurnell), said, when announcing that $50m would be spent on 29 April 2020, commemorations including an aquatic monument in Botany Bay and the circumnavigation of Australia by the Endeavour replica (Cook never sailed such a route but the facts rarely impede his mythology): \u201cAs the 250th anniversary nears we want to help Australians better understand Captain Cook\u2019s historic voyage and its legacy for exploration, science and reconciliation. That voyage is the reason Australia is what it is today and it\u2019s important we take the opportunity to reflect on it.\u201d Many Indigenous people and promoters of their rights scoff at Morrison\u2019s asserted potential for federal Cook commemorations to further \u201creconciliation\u201d \u2013 especially at a moment when his government has rejected the central tenets of the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart and its wish that \u201cancient sovereignty ... shine through as a fuller expression of Australia\u2019s nationhood\u201d. \u2018White Australia in all of its guises\u2019 Cook \u2013 Captain Cook, though he never officially held that naval rank \u2013 is the behemoth of national non-Indigenous foundation imagination, the venerated hero and white-hatted Columbus of Australia. As a nation we\u2019ve never been good at parsing the moral and human shortcomings of our most prominent colonial leaders such as governors Phillip, Macquarie and Brisbane, all of whom did appalling things to the continent\u2019s Indigenes. Yet Cook, the \u201cdiscoverer\u201d, as non-Indigenous historiography cast him for so long \u2013 though not as the invader, occupier or settler \u2013 still manages to divide Australia along black and white lines with a passion and hatred that evades those who later oversaw colonialism\u2019s worst violent excesses. In an essay to accompany East Coast Encounter, a 2014 National Maritime Museum art exhibition exploring Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives on 1770, Worimi man John Maynard, a professor of history at Newcastle University, writes how Cook has evolved into \u201ca time-travelling bogeyman to Aboriginal Australia\u201d: Cook transcends time and space to wreak havoc across the continent upon the Aboriginal inhabitants over the course of the past 243 years. In this manifestation he represents white Australia in all of its guises including invasion, occupation, dispossession and the conducting of a symphony of violence. Does Cook deserve this label as the navy grim reaper? In a counterpoint Cook remains in settler colonial history both misrepresented and mythologised. In 2018 Maynard again tackled Cook \u2013 the man, his legacy and the myth \u2013 for the National Library of Australia\u2019s Cook and the Pacific exhibition. Here Maynard, I think, nails the Cook conundrum, writing: \u201cWhether he deserves this monster mantle is open to conjecture and challenge from wider non-Indigenous Australia, but from an Aboriginal perspective Cook remains the scapegoat for white invasion.\u201d Cook, the usher of the colonial land grab \u2013 the doorman for British invasion in 1788, for dispossession and for all of the shootings, massacres, poisonings and stolen children that followed colonisation \u2013 is an understandable theme of much modern Australian Indigenous art (and that sympathetic to Aboriginal sentiment). It reflects the pervasiveness of Cook in Aboriginal story and bequeathed memory, his centrality to the spoken history of Indigenous people the continent over \u2013 including in places he never ventured anywhere near but where there are nonetheless enduring stories of Cook and his men raping and murdering. Among the most evocative recent works themed on Cook the evil swindler is Jason Wing\u2019s bronze Captain James Crook (2013), the statue\u2019s face covered with a black balaclava. It riffs off the ubiquity in the Australian psyche and geographic/cultural landscape of Cook\u2019s statuary shape. Even with his face covered like that of a cat burglar or bank robber, Cook\u2019s head and shoulders are unmistakable. I returned to this work over and again when I first saw Defying Empire, the third National Indigenous Art Triennial at the National Gallery of Australia in 2017. In an exhibition electric with provocation about land rights, massacres, deaths in custody and every other colonial Indigenous injustice, Wing\u2019s was, for me, the in-your-face work that most arrestingly exposed the deep, enduring Australian racial fissure on the white national foundation story. Indigenous experiences of colonisation and its generational legacies have varied, of course. But there is doubtless a deep Indigenous emotional affinity with, and understanding of, Wing\u2019s explanation of the work. He writes: When I attended high school I was taught that Australia was discovered by Captain James Cook. This colonial lie is further reinforced by a huge bronze sculpture in Hyde Park, Sydney, which is situated on a massacre site. Etched in stone are the words \u2018Captain James Cook Discovered Australia 1770\u2019. I feel physically ill every time I see this monument so I decided to create my own monument to Captain Cook, who personifies colonisation, in Captain James Crook 2013. There are many politically correct terms such as colonised, peacefully settled, occupied, discovered etc. The truth is that Australia was stolen by armed robbery. History is often written and erased by the victors, so I decided to challenge the colonial history of Australia from an Aboriginal perspective and simply tell the truth. As a result of my subversive Captain Cook bust I received many personal attacks on social media ... personal attacks on my physical appearance and Aboriginality, their disgust at my disrespectful and inaccurate version of Australia\u2019s history and my alleged defamation of Captain Cook\u2019s great name. \u2018Welcome to Kurnell: Where Cultures Meet\u2019 I\u2019d passed low over Kurnell on that southern approach while flying into Sydney hundreds of times. It\u2019s easy to miss the grassy expanse of Monument Terrace that meanders down to the landing place amid the more eye-catching discs, as they appear from above, of the desalination tanks, and the verdant carpet of national park that ends with the plummeting blond-sandstone cliffs at Cape Solander, named after Daniel Solander, the Swedish naturalist on Cook\u2019s first Pacific voyage. This part of the Sutherland Shire \u2013 or just \u201cthe shire\u201d, as New South Wales knows it \u2013 where Cook stepped ashore looms large in Australian history and national memory. Australia knows it emotionally, mythically. But not physically. When I visit with historian Mark McKenna it\u2019s a mild, late winter\u2019s day with little of the breeze that so frequently buffets Botany Bay \u2013 a good arvo for sightseeing, yet few people are wandering Monument Terrace or the shore with its dimpled sandstone plateaus, upon one of which Cook first set foot. It\u2019s just after three o\u2019clock and the visitor centre is closed. This is not a well-frequented place. \u201cIt feels like such a long way away, but the story attached to it has become part of us, in all its various interpretations,\u201d McKenna says. We laugh while watching a bloke on Prince Charles Parade use a leaf blower to blast the ever-encroaching sand back towards the beach from the big expanse of grass outside his house. Modernity pushing back against the elements. We drive around and look for that welcome sign. We can\u2019t find it, even though it turns out we\u2019ve driven past it perhaps two or three times. It is McKenna who writes of Cook in his 2018 Quarterly Essay, Moment of Truth: History and Australia\u2019s Future: \u201cWe stand forever on the beach with him [Cook].\u201d It\u2019s an incisive metaphor. McKenna explains: I wanted to leave the door open on Cook. All too often, we expect history to be definitive, to pass judgement and announce a verdict. But understanding Cook is about much more than apportioning praise or blame. We can\u2019t escape him, and we can\u2019t deny him. For better or worse, we\u2019re entangled with his legacy. He\u2019s one of those figures in our history to whom we\u2019ll always return; ceaselessly searching for new ways to see him and ourselves in one and the same field of vision. In the essay McKenna explores the provenance of that \u201cWelcome to Kurnell\u201d sign. With the help of local historians, including Sutherland Shire\u2019s research librarian Stephanie Bailey, McKenna recounts how from about 1954, when Captain Cook Drive was opened (an unmade, potholed track, littered with industrial and household garbage, alongside the oil refineries, had previously linked Cronulla and Kurnell), a roadside sign had claimed it was \u201cThe Birthplace of Australia\u201d. In June 1981, after lobbying from the council and local members of state parliament, NSW premier Neville Wran ordered all plaques in The Rocks describing it as \u201cAustralia\u2019s birthplace\u201d to be removed. That tribute belonged to Kurnell, he said. Sutherland shire eventually settled on a sign reading, \u201cWelcome to Kurnell, birthplace of the nation\u201d. In late 1993, with growing awareness of Indigenous land rights amid the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and the high court\u2019s Mabo decision, Sutherland Shire \u2013 \u201cconscious of the fact that the term currently used by Council, \u2018Birthplace of the Nation\u2019, causes offence to many Aboriginal Australians\u201d \u2013 came up with the existing sign. Cook commemorations at this place had long been conducted without deference to either Indigenous sensibility or desire, for 70 years from Federation in 1901 often involving the anchoring of a replica Endeavour, the dispatching of the long-boats and the recreation of shootings of resisting Indigenous people \u2013 who were brought from interstate to play the local Gweagal (although sometimes the role was given to whites in blackface). It wasn\u2019t until 2000 before council decided, in consultation with an Aboriginal Advisory Committee, officially to change the tenor of the commemorations, consistent with their new title, \u201cMeeting of Two Cultures\u201d. Bruce Howell, a former high school teacher of Wiradjuri descent, has served on the shire\u2019s Aboriginal advisory committee since retiring seven years ago. He has read the diaries of both Cook and Joseph Banks from the Endeavour voyage and he believes the navigator has been \u201cmythologised and oversimplified in Australia\u201d by those who, on one side, have cast him as a flawless hero and, on the other, as Maynard\u2019s \u201cbogeyman\u201d. He is adamant Australia, as it prepares for the 250th anniversary of Cook\u2019s arrival, can learn from the shire\u2019s annual Meeting of Two Cultures commemorations. Speaking in a personal capacity, he says: I believe that the way to do it is to firstly ensure that both sides of the 1770 story are told ... warts and all, and that it be placed into the proper context of the times. This is what ... [happens with] the Meeting of Two Cultures ceremonies ... right where the first meetings took place, in Kamay Botany Bay national park. The premise is that proper respect and acknowledgement should be given not only to all those aboard the Endeavour, but equally to the local people ... who were confronted with both the Endeavour and then the landing party on the afternoon of April 29th 1770. One hurdle is that for so many Australians, myself included, they\u2019ve never been taught our foundational history \u2013 many will conflate the events of 1770 and 1788, and will generally know little about either. As Sutherland shire and the state and federal governments plan the 250th anniversary celebrations of Cook\u2019s arrival \u2013 replete with yet another monument \u2013 the days of that Welcome to Kurnell sign may be numbered. McKenna writes that it ought to \u201cbe pulled down before it falls down. A new sign should be erected in keeping with the spirit of the annual commemoration of Cook\u2019s landing: \u2018Welcome to Kurnell: Where Cultures Meet\u2019.\u201d This is an edited extract from On Cook, by Paul Daley, Meanjin summer 2019 edition.",

And it\u2019s nuts.\u2019 When it comes to global warming, it seems it\u2019s now virtuous to tell untruths and evil to counter them with facts. And the ABC is on the side of untruth. Jane Fonda leads the world into the grip of anti-human hysteria over climate change \u2013 the Daily Telegraph, 10 December Kevin Donnelly: Environmental extremists like Fonda also refuse to acknowledge that the science of climate change is far from settled. In the scientific world the links between climate change and man-made fossil fuels is far from unanimous. Not only do many scientists argue carbon is an essential part of the atmosphere ensuring plant growth but they also argue such is the complexity involved in analysing cause and effect that it is simplistic and wrong to only focus on one cause.",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has announced its response to the competition regulator\u2019s massive report on Facebook and Google, agreeing to new powers and funding for the consumer watchdog to monitor the digital giants. But what will it actually mean? What did the ACCC recommend? In its landmark digital platforms report released in July, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission made 23 recommendations including: a new digital division within the ACCC with the power to hold public inquiries and compel companies to provide information giving users the option to choose a different default browser than Chrome and Google search on Android devices a code of conduct to ensure news businesses on digital platforms are treated fairly and transparently updating merger law and requiring the large tech companies to inform the ACCC about potential mergers that would lessen competition a code for how companies handle complaints about the spread of misinformation updating the Privacy Act to give users more control over their personal data including data porting and a greater level of consent before information is collected a statutory tort for serious invasions of privacy taxpayer funding for local journalism and media literacy organisations, and making donations to media companies engaged in public interest journalism tax-deductible. What has the government decided to do? The biggest announcement is $27m over four years to be announced in Myefo on Monday for the ACCC\u2019s new digital division. The new division will monitor and report twice a year on digital platforms, with the power to conduct inquiries when the treasurer directs it to undertake, and to take enforcement action. The division\u2019s first inquiry will be to look at the competition for ad tech services and online advertising. That announcement aside, the government is largely responding by announcing more reviews or voluntary codes. The government will consult on more changes to the Privacy Act, including expanding the definition of personal information to include personal information collected by tech companies, strengthening notice and consent requirements, and the tort of privacy allowing people to take court action for compensation when their privacy is interfered with. The review will also consider a recommendation that consumers be allowed to request to delete personal information companies hold on them. In response to fake news, the government will ask the big companies like Facebook and Google to develop a voluntary code of conduct for disinformation and news quality, with oversight by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. There will be a voluntary code developed between the news companies and the digital platforms to be more transparent over the news feed algorithms and ad placement by November next year. The government has said if it isn\u2019t satisfied with the code, it will consider a mandatory code. There will also be a pilot scheme for people to lodge complaints about issues with the digital platforms, and this pilot will determine whether the government should bring in a digital platforms ombudsman to resolve complaints and disputes. What has the government not adopted? There will be no immediate changes to merger law, with the government promising \u201cbroad consultations\u201d on the ACCC\u2019s proposal next year. The ACCC will also be asked to monitor the EU\u2019s efforts to force Google to offer alternatives to Chrome and Google search on Android devices, but there\u2019s no plans to proceed with that for now. There\u2019s also no move on banning unfair contract terms, with the government proposing to consult more on protecting people. The biggest rejection was the proposal to make funding journalism tax deductible. The government said it wasn\u2019t going to act on that recommendation. \u201cThere are a number of existing ways in which organisations that produce public interest journalism can seek deductible gift recipient (DGR) status and the government\u2019s current focus is on implementing the DGR reforms announced in December 2017 before considering further changes,\u201d the response states. The government also rejected a proposal for a mandatory takedown code that would force Facebook and Google to remove material that was claimed to be infringing copyright. The government said there was the potential for unintended consequences. What will it mean for people using Facebook and Google and other platforms? Assuming changes to the Privacy Act get introduced and pass parliament, people will have more control over their own data, and if they\u2019ve had their privacy breached, will be able to take the company to court over it to get compensation. What will it mean for the media? They will participate in more inquiries, and regional publishers will have access to more money, but in the immediate term there won\u2019t be much of a difference for the media sector. The government is also consulting on changes to make media regulation technology neutral. This would mean the same rules that apply to broadcast TV, for example, around local content, could also apply to services like Netflix. Should the tech companies be worried? Google and Facebook will likely be breathing a sigh of relief. There\u2019s no immediate new regulation on them, just more reviews. The ACCC\u2019s new digital division will likely cause some headaches for them in the immediate term but Google has already been taken to court by the ACCC, and it is expected more of these cases will pop up in the near future. What are other countries doing? A lot of the privacy changes proposed by the ACCC bring Australia closer to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) but because more reviews are taking place, it is going to be a long time before we get there. The Australian government is consulting with New Zealand about its unfair trading provision, with a view to try to adopt something similar in the future. In new Android devices from early 2020, Google will offer European users the option of choosing a different default browser other than Chrome, and Google search. It will present users with options for different browsers and search engines. The EU Commission fined Google \u20ac4.34bn last year for blocking rivals on Android, and having an unfair advantage in pre-installing Chrome and Google search in Android. 2020 US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has also proposed breaking up the big tech companies.",

Wilder says creating markets for climate adaptation and resilience will require coming up with financial solutions that could, for example, protect a reef or a mangrove, support a new technology that improves soil fertility or better manage water use.</p> <p>He says an increasing number of corporate players are talking about the climate emergency, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/08/corporations-told-to-draw-up-climate-rules-or-have-them-imposed\">not moving quickly enough</a>. Referring to the work of the <a href=\"https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/\">task force on climate-related financial disclosures</a> (TCFD), a global body that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/04/mark-carney-unveils-global-taskforce-to-educate-business-on-climate-change\">aims to highlight companies\u2019 exposure to risks related to the climate crisis</a>, Wilder says many companies are attempting what he describes as \u201cTCFD light\u201d \u2013 acknowledging the issue, not yet matching it with action. But he believes the movement is in the right direction and picking up pace.</p> <p>\u201cAny board anywhere in the world that thinks in 2019 that it should not be assessing climate risk will put its directors at significant exposure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is just no longer tenable for a board not to do that.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Sullivan, a former Australian head of investment banking at Lazard, says there is evidence investors, businesses and governments are increasingly turning their mind to what net-zero emissions means, pointing to a warning by the governor of the Bank of England that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/08/corporations-told-to-draw-up-climate-rules-or-have-them-imposed\">major corporations have two years to agree to rules for reporting climate risks</a> before global regulators make them compulsory. He says the solution has to be more than \u201cjust building another solar farm\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you come out, as a lot of governments have done, with a deadline that says, \u2018I\u2019ve got 30 years to turn around an economy which has been based on fossil fuels for the last 200 years\u2019, how do you transform an entire economy in that period?\u201d O\u2019Sullivan says from his base in London. \u201cWe really feel the advice we\u2019re giving is going to transform governments and corporates.\u201d</p> <p>Pollination\u2019s management team includes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/nov/01/i-was-australias-ambassador-for-the-environment-i-know-how-we-can-fight-climate-change\">Patrick Suckling</a>, who until recently was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/australia-only-nation-to-join-us-at-pro-coal-event-at-cop24-climate-talks\">Australia\u2019s environment ambassador</a>, and Rob Jesudason, the former chief financial officer of the Commonwealth Bank.

      "bodyText": "A growing number of governments, including of every Australian state, Britain and the European Union, have set targets of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Few have mapped how to get there. It is a similar story in the corporate sector. Businesses are under increasing pressure from investors and shareholders to back up claims they are committed to the goals of the Paris agreement. Take BHP, one of the world\u2019s 20 big emitters: it has set a mid-century net-zero emissions target but is yet explain how it will reach it, and plans to invest more in oil and gas than climate solutions. Martijn Wilder, long-time head of Baker &amp; McKenzie\u2019s global climate law and sustainable-finance practice and a founding board member of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, has seen up close the divide between the decision-making that goes into setting targets and establishing rules at United Nations climate talks and that drives spending decisions. Having moved in both diplomatic and investment circles, he found people in each who wanted to tackle the climate crisis but had little comprehension of how the other worked. The gap prompted him to leave a guaranteed stable future at the law firm, where he spent two decades, to set up Pollination, an ambitious \u2013 and, he and fellow founder Tony O\u2019Sullivan say, unique \u2013 global climate advisory and investment firm. They say they will work across five areas: infrastructure investment, merchant banking, venture capital, non-profit work and an advisory arm. Two months after starting operation, the client list of their advisory business includes BHP, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, New Zealand\u2019s a2 Milk Company and the NSW government. Wilder says the firm\u2019s goals are to bring together experts who can break down barriers to the transition to a clean future, and redirect capital that has been committed but not to climate solutions. \u201cClimate change is the central issue of our generation, but we\u2019ve got this funding problem,\u201d he says. \u201cFamilies don\u2019t know where to go [with their money], big investment funds can only write cheques of $1bn \u2013 what do you do with that? \u2013 and governments either don\u2019t want to invest or it takes a lot of time, and are often restricted by legal barriers.\u201d Beyond infrastructure, they say they want to back investments that protect natural capital and water security. Wilder says creating markets for climate adaptation and resilience will require coming up with financial solutions that could, for example, protect a reef or a mangrove, support a new technology that improves soil fertility or better manage water use. He says an increasing number of corporate players are talking about the climate emergency, but not moving quickly enough. Referring to the work of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD), a global body that aims to highlight companies\u2019 exposure to risks related to the climate crisis, Wilder says many companies are attempting what he describes as \u201cTCFD light\u201d \u2013 acknowledging the issue, not yet matching it with action. But he believes the movement is in the right direction and picking up pace. \u201cAny board anywhere in the world that thinks in 2019 that it should not be assessing climate risk will put its directors at significant exposure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is just no longer tenable for a board not to do that.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan, a former Australian head of investment banking at Lazard, says there is evidence investors, businesses and governments are increasingly turning their mind to what net-zero emissions means, pointing to a warning by the governor of the Bank of England that major corporations have two years to agree to rules for reporting climate risks before global regulators make them compulsory. He says the solution has to be more than \u201cjust building another solar farm\u201d. \u201cIf you come out, as a lot of governments have done, with a deadline that says, \u2018I\u2019ve got 30 years to turn around an economy which has been based on fossil fuels for the last 200 years\u2019, how do you transform an entire economy in that period?\u201d O\u2019Sullivan says from his base in London. \u201cWe really feel the advice we\u2019re giving is going to transform governments and corporates.\u201d Pollination\u2019s management team includes Patrick Suckling, who until recently was Australia\u2019s environment ambassador, and Rob Jesudason, the former chief financial officer of the Commonwealth Bank. Senior advisors include Sam Mostyn, chairwoman of Citi Australia, James Cameron, the founder of green merchant bank Climate Capital, and Christof Kutscher, the global chairman of AXA Investment Managers. The firm has offices in Sydney, London, New York, Chicago and Paris. Wilder says they want to extend into Singapore, Tokyo, Mumbai and, eventually, China.",

This is mostly because the main media company in this country, from its editors through to its leading columnists, has an approach to climate change denial that is impervious to logic, reason and basic maths. This week the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, stated the obvious when he noted the link between increased severity of bushfires and climate change. On Friday the Daily Telegraph responded by smearing him on its front page. A conservative stating reality on climate change is now considered a betrayal, and a progressive stating reality is portrayed as an extremist. And you can thus see why the Labor party has chosen to largely dissociate itself from the climate change movement, a movement which saw 20,000 people take to the streets this week in Sydney despite next to no notice. Labor has instead decided it is more sensible for Anthony Albanese to pick this week when his own electorate has been covered in smoke from bushfires and the UN is holding a climate conference at which Australia has been declared the pariah of the world, to tour rural Queensland to visit coalmines and aluminium smelters and talk up \u201cpractical\u201d solutions. It\u2019s pretty horrific when you think about it that the main strategy to doing something on climate change is to pretend that any change will have a minimal impact on people\u2019s lives. It is also pretty horrific when you think that a progressive party has decided it does not need to use the mass support of people desperate for action. Surely some form of progressive populism should actually involve trying to be popular? Because the problem is at some point we are going to need to do more than just the \u201cpractical\u201d solutions, and doing that will require a lot of support. The latest projections show that in 2030 Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions will be 99 megatonne (Mt) lower than in 2005 (the base year for Paris agreement targets). And all of it is accounted for by a drop in land use: ie less land-clearing and a few more trees being planted. Of actual emissions there is no change. And yet by 2030 we are projected to get 50% of our electricity from renewables. The problem is while electricity is the biggest producer of emissions, it only accounts for 30% of the total. By 2030 other areas such as direct combustion from industries, transport and fugitive emissions (which occur during the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels) all will have risen by enough to offset the fall in electricity emissions. This is the crux of climate change: if it was as easy to solve as politicians would have us believe then it would not actually be a problem. Yes, people love renewables, but we are going to need to do more \u2013 and any political party that wishes to actually do real action will at some point need to be honest with the public that the change is not going to be pleasant for many and it will be costly. We are for a start going to need to keep coal in the ground \u2013 even our glorious cleaner-than-others coal. The government\u2019s fraudulent Paris target of 28% below 2005 levels, which includes land use, would require actual emissions to fall from the current level of 551Mt to 440Mt. But that target is a complete joke. The science requires cuts of at least 45% in actual emissions by 2030, not a reduction through offsets, or by counting things we are are no longer doing. To achieve a 45% cut in actual emissions we would need to reduce our annual emissions to 287Mt by 2030. Or to put it another way, in 2030 we would need to remove the equivalent of all emissions produced this year from direct combustion, transport, fugitive emissions and waste (ie landfill). That is a scale well beyond anything that current policies will achieve. It is an amount that will require changes in how and what we consume and produce. In effect, a change in how we live.

I see something that\u2019s been alive hundreds of years before me and will be there hundreds of years after me.

It was awe-inspiring and, in a small patch saved from logging in a region where almost no other ancient forest had survived, it was a reminder of the sheer grandeur of the island\u2019s original forests. These forests are also the habitat of rare and endangered wildlife that the government promotes as \u201cmust see\u201d for tourists, such as Tasmanian devils, masked owls and the world\u2019s only pure white raptor, the white goshawk.<br><br>That tree and its patch had been saved from logging after entreaties by the ornithologist Matt Webb who has campaigned long and hard for the flowering giants which are also both the food source and nesting sites for migratory swift parrots which fly to and from mainland Australia to Tasmania each summer to breed. \u201cAnodised\u201d green with blue, yellow and red features, and not much larger than budgerigars, swift parrots cross Bass Strait, which takes the vehicular ferries all night, in just three hours. They are the world\u2019s fastest parrots. But facing introduced predators and the loss of their nectar trees and nesting hollows, which only trees more than a century old afford, they are listed as critically endangered. Only 1,000 breeding pairs remain.<br><br>Now the giant bluegum they so favoured also lies in burnt ruins on the forest floor. In Pearce\u2019s photographs there are smaller adjacent green trees which obviously escaped the fire. \u201cIt is possible only a corner of the great bluegum caught fire and it smouldered for weeks before finally succumbing,\u201d he says. I ask if the fire could have been put out. \u201cOf course, but the giants are quite simply not a priority.\u201d</p>",

This year a 100.7-metre (Yellow meranti) flowering giant was discovered in the Borneo rainforests, topping the tallest of Tasmania\u2019s trees by just 20cm. The Kermandie Queen, which rivalled the Arve Giant in volumetric size, was also severely damaged by the fires and has shed large branches which themselves are the size of regular trees. The tallest tree in the southern hemisphere, a 100.5-metre eucalyptus regnans called the Centurion, near the Huon River, was badly scorched but has clung to life. However, it suffered a crown failure and had its top reduced. It does not look well at all. Several neighbouring giants have died. Then there was El Grande, previously Australia\u2019s largest tree, in the Florentine Valley 100km from Hobart, standing 79 metres high with a girth of 19 metres and a volume of 439 cubic metres. It was, at the turn of the century, the world\u2019s biggest-stemmed flowering plant. Approximately 350 years old, it burned in April 2003 after catching fire in a deliberate burn-off of the debris remaining after the clear-felling of old-growth forest in the tree\u2019s immediate vicinity by Sustainable Timbers Tasmania (SST), then called Forestry Tasmania. STT is the custodian of the public forests and says it does not log trees taller than 85 metres or more than 280 cubic metres in volume. It lists some 150 such giants. However, the state premier, Will Hodgman, has authorised it to log stands of the next generation of the world\u2019s tallest flowering trees. The younger giant eucalypts are being trucked out of the southern forests, which are among the world\u2019s most carbon-dense forests. The national environment minister, Sussan Ley, backs the logging. Referring to Earth\u2019s climate emergency, Pearce says: \u201cThese trees are at the limit of physics, the greatest expression of nature possible given their environment. They evolved to grow under the conditions we had but don\u2019t have any more. We will never see such trees again.\u201d Describing himself as a \u201ctree nerd\u201d, Pearce, 40, says of his days seeking out the big trees in Tasmania\u2019s forests: \u201cI love it. It fulfils me greatly. Every time you go to a giant tree you see something new in it and yourself. I see something that\u2019s been alive hundreds of years before me and will be there hundreds of years after me. It\u2019s humbling to consider all the years of my life are merely a small chapter of theirs. Climbing these trees is where I started. Up a tree you see things from a perspective no one else has ever seen.\u201d I asked him about last summer\u2019s bushfire which resulted from lightning strikes in the adjacent Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area. Like most other places, Tasmania\u2019s average temperatures have risen 1C in the last century and the heatwaves are more frequent and the air drier, a potent fire mix. \u201cThe big trees just copped it. The tiny reserves for big trees that remain after 100 years of clearfell logging didn\u2019t stand a chance,\u201d says Pearce. I had recently visited a giant Tasmanian bluegum (eucalyptus globulus) near the logging town of Geeveston. It was awe-inspiring and, in a small patch saved from logging in a region where almost no other ancient forest had survived, it was a reminder of the sheer grandeur of the island\u2019s original forests. These forests are also the habitat of rare and endangered wildlife that the government promotes as \u201cmust see\u201d for tourists, such as Tasmanian devils, masked owls and the world\u2019s only pure white raptor, the white goshawk. That tree and its patch had been saved from logging after entreaties by the ornithologist Matt Webb who has campaigned long and hard for the flowering giants which are also both the food source and nesting sites for migratory swift parrots which fly to and from mainland Australia to Tasmania each summer to breed. \u201cAnodised\u201d green with blue, yellow and red features, and not much larger than budgerigars, swift parrots cross Bass Strait, which takes the vehicular ferries all night, in just three hours. They are the world\u2019s fastest parrots. But facing introduced predators and the loss of their nectar trees and nesting hollows, which only trees more than a century old afford, they are listed as critically endangered. Only 1,000 breeding pairs remain. Now the giant bluegum they so favoured also lies in burnt ruins on the forest floor. In Pearce\u2019s photographs there are smaller adjacent green trees which obviously escaped the fire. \u201cIt is possible only a corner of the great bluegum caught fire and it smouldered for weeks before finally succumbing,\u201d he says. I ask if the fire could have been put out. \u201cOf course, but the giants are quite simply not a priority.\u201d",

Of the many stereotypes about Italians, one that refuses to die is that they are loud, and even many Italians doubt that a \u201cquiet carriage\u201d will ever remain so.</p> <p>Frecciarossa\u2019s quiet carriages were previously only available for business passengers, but they proved so popular that they will now be available to passengers in economy class too. They will be called \u201cStandard Silenzio\u201d.</p> <p>In some ways, Italy has earned its reputation as a rowdy country. A 2015 survey of global noise pollution placed Italy second for racket. \u201cNoise music\u201d \u2013 replacing classical harmonies with modern clanking \u2013 was pioneered by the Italian futurist Luigi Russolo. And no self-respecting pizzeria is without a loud TV in the corner. As Francesco De Gregori once sang: \u201cPoor me \u2013 I\u2019m scared of the silence but can\u2019t stand the noise.\u201d</p> <p>Yet many Italians feel the stereotype is absurd. Italians are only perceived to be loud because of their language: it\u2019s vowel-based, requiring the vibration of vocal chords \u2013 hence its melodious quality and aptness for opera. Unlike English, Italian has no reduced vowels (called \u201cschwa\u201d in linguistics), so nothing is diminished or squashed. It\u2019s a syllable-timed language, whereas English is stress-timed: we eat words, they say \u2013 we cluster consonants and elide; they don\u2019t. Italian isn\u2019t necessarily louder, it just sounds so to an Anglo-Saxon ear because we\u2019re simply unused to so many syllables.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7e2057b5b0b5f313b92532abdb07e4ff62de415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7e2057b5b0b5f313b92532abdb07e4ff62de415/0_143_1876_1126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti: Italian has a melodious quality, making it ideal for opera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walter Pontes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent research has also suggested that Italian is a high-speed, low-density language. The amount of information communicated per syllable is lower than in English, meaning it\u2019s spoken faster and, as all musicians know, when you pick up speed you sometimes, inadvertently, go loud.</p> <p>There are also historical reasons why Italian is, or appears to be, voluminous. Stefano Jossa, author of a brilliant book on the language, says that \u201cin Italy a linguistic act is always performance\u201d. Because the language was invented by writers \u2013 from Dante to Alessandro Manzoni \u2013 it is \u201cartificial, artful, made for the purpose of beauty. It\u2019s cunningly and cleverly constructed.\u201d You only need to watch a few minutes of the country\u2019s TV talkshows to appreciate how much admiration there is for what writer Luigi Pirandello called \u201cthe wardrobe of eloquence\u201d where \u201cnaked ideas\u201d get dressed.</p> <p>That performative element means that the acoustics are important. A friend always says that \u201cItalian is spoken for the sounds, not the meaning\u201d and in his book Jossa writes that Italian is \u201clike a harpsichord\u201d. That centrality of sound is the reason that rhyme \u2013 much outmoded elsewhere \u2013 endures in Italian poetry, advertising and football banners. Lexical chiming is all part of that aestheticism about which Lord Byron got so soppy: Italian, he said, \u201csounds as if it should be writ on satin\u201d.</p> <p>Because Italian has never been a language of the streets but of the salons, many Italians \u2013 according to writer Italo Calvino \u2013 feel a \u201csemantic terror\u201d. It\u2019s often been suggested that the peninsula\u2019s high volume is the revenge of the streets, a verbal insurgency against that refined and erudite language. It\u2019s a drum to drown out that harpsichord.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s been suggested that the peninsula\u2019s high volume is the revenge of the streets, a drum to drown out that harpsichord</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s also a different attitude to noise. Glen, a friend and applied linguist who has lived in Italy for 40 years, believes that noise here \u201cis perceived as convivial and inviting. It lends a sense of sharing and participation and means that something is working OK.\u201d But noise is also admitted when it\u2019s evidence of unease. <a href=\"http://www.walliswilde-menozzi.com/\" title=\"\">Wallis Wilde-Menozzi</a>, a writer in Parma whose next book is <em>Silence and Silences</em>, says that \u201chigh volume is accepted or understood when it\u2019s a response to stress and anxiety. I don\u2019t find this tolerance exists in middle-class Anglo-Saxon culture.\u201d That tolerance extends to children: eating out with kids is a dream in Italy because they\u2019re always welcomed, tantrums and all.</p> <p>If anything, quietness is often perceived to be more unsettling than noise. \u201cA quiet pizzeria full of people,\u201d jokes Glen, \u201cwould be very suspicious.\u201d People relish exuberance. Perhaps that\u2019s why Frecciarossa\u2019s new carriages are called \u201csilent\u201d: according to Jossa, \u201ca \u2018quiet carriage\u2019 would make Italians think it\u2019s a dead place, a wasteland, a desert \u2013 basically inhospitable\u201d. And, my Italian wife laughs, the absolutism of that \u201csilence\u201d is very necessary: \u201ctranquillo\u201d suggests unagitated, or chilled out, which is probably, for our fellow travellers, an insufficiently forthright injunction against noise.</p> <p>That appreciation of vivacity also means that conversation is very different: voices overlap because there\u2019s no social disapproval of interruption. Often, the only way to get a conversational look-in (or \u201cto take the word\u201d, as they say) is to raise your voice. Etiquette about phone use does not exist. Irene, an Italian who lives in London, doesn\u2019t think Italians are any louder than other nationalities. \u201cBut there is something,\u201d she says, \u201cabout Italians and mobile phones. It\u2019s not just the lack of consideration for other people that amazes me. Italians on the phone on a train seem to be oblivious that whoever sits near them will listen to everything. Maybe we are so committed to the conversation we forget about everything else.\u201d</p> <p>That, perhaps, is key to understanding the stereotype. It\u2019s not that Italians are loud; just that they\u2019re rarely hushed in situations where foreigners expect it: in church, classrooms, business meetings or on public transport. There\u2019s an authenticity to that refusal to change register just to suit the surroundings, but it doesn\u2019t bode well for the train carriage battle between sound and silence.</p> <p><em>\u2022Tobias Jones\u2019s new book is </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/13/ultra-by-tobias-jones-review-the-underworld-of-italian-football\" title=\"\">Ultra: The Underworld of Italian Football</a></p>",

Of the many stereotypes about Italians, one that refuses to die is that they are loud, and even many Italians doubt that a \u201cquiet carriage\u201d will ever remain so. Frecciarossa\u2019s quiet carriages were previously only available for business passengers, but they proved so popular that they will now be available to passengers in economy class too. They will be called \u201cStandard Silenzio\u201d. In some ways, Italy has earned its reputation as a rowdy country. A 2015 survey of global noise pollution placed Italy second for racket. \u201cNoise music\u201d \u2013 replacing classical harmonies with modern clanking \u2013 was pioneered by the Italian futurist Luigi Russolo. And no self-respecting pizzeria is without a loud TV in the corner. As Francesco De Gregori once sang: \u201cPoor me \u2013 I\u2019m scared of the silence but can\u2019t stand the noise.\u201d Yet many Italians feel the stereotype is absurd. Italians are only perceived to be loud because of their language: it\u2019s vowel-based, requiring the vibration of vocal chords \u2013 hence its melodious quality and aptness for opera. Unlike English, Italian has no reduced vowels (called \u201cschwa\u201d in linguistics), so nothing is diminished or squashed. It\u2019s a syllable-timed language, whereas English is stress-timed: we eat words, they say \u2013 we cluster consonants and elide; they don\u2019t. Italian isn\u2019t necessarily louder, it just sounds so to an Anglo-Saxon ear because we\u2019re simply unused to so many syllables. Recent research has also suggested that Italian is a high-speed, low-density language. The amount of information communicated per syllable is lower than in English, meaning it\u2019s spoken faster and, as all musicians know, when you pick up speed you sometimes, inadvertently, go loud. There are also historical reasons why Italian is, or appears to be, voluminous. Stefano Jossa, author of a brilliant book on the language, says that \u201cin Italy a linguistic act is always performance\u201d. Because the language was invented by writers \u2013 from Dante to Alessandro Manzoni \u2013 it is \u201cartificial, artful, made for the purpose of beauty. It\u2019s cunningly and cleverly constructed.\u201d You only need to watch a few minutes of the country\u2019s TV talkshows to appreciate how much admiration there is for what writer Luigi Pirandello called \u201cthe wardrobe of eloquence\u201d where \u201cnaked ideas\u201d get dressed. That performative element means that the acoustics are important. A friend always says that \u201cItalian is spoken for the sounds, not the meaning\u201d and in his book Jossa writes that Italian is \u201clike a harpsichord\u201d. That centrality of sound is the reason that rhyme \u2013 much outmoded elsewhere \u2013 endures in Italian poetry, advertising and football banners. Lexical chiming is all part of that aestheticism about which Lord Byron got so soppy: Italian, he said, \u201csounds as if it should be writ on satin\u201d. Because Italian has never been a language of the streets but of the salons, many Italians \u2013 according to writer Italo Calvino \u2013 feel a \u201csemantic terror\u201d. It\u2019s often been suggested that the peninsula\u2019s high volume is the revenge of the streets, a verbal insurgency against that refined and erudite language. It\u2019s a drum to drown out that harpsichord. But there\u2019s also a different attitude to noise. Glen, a friend and applied linguist who has lived in Italy for 40 years, believes that noise here \u201cis perceived as convivial and inviting. It lends a sense of sharing and participation and means that something is working OK.\u201d But noise is also admitted when it\u2019s evidence of unease. Wallis Wilde-Menozzi, a writer in Parma whose next book is Silence and Silences, says that \u201chigh volume is accepted or understood when it\u2019s a response to stress and anxiety. I don\u2019t find this tolerance exists in middle-class Anglo-Saxon culture.\u201d That tolerance extends to children: eating out with kids is a dream in Italy because they\u2019re always welcomed, tantrums and all. If anything, quietness is often perceived to be more unsettling than noise. \u201cA quiet pizzeria full of people,\u201d jokes Glen, \u201cwould be very suspicious.\u201d People relish exuberance. Perhaps that\u2019s why Frecciarossa\u2019s new carriages are called \u201csilent\u201d: according to Jossa, \u201ca \u2018quiet carriage\u2019 would make Italians think it\u2019s a dead place, a wasteland, a desert \u2013 basically inhospitable\u201d. And, my Italian wife laughs, the absolutism of that \u201csilence\u201d is very necessary: \u201ctranquillo\u201d suggests unagitated, or chilled out, which is probably, for our fellow travellers, an insufficiently forthright injunction against noise. That appreciation of vivacity also means that conversation is very different: voices overlap because there\u2019s no social disapproval of interruption. Often, the only way to get a conversational look-in (or \u201cto take the word\u201d, as they say) is to raise your voice. Etiquette about phone use does not exist. Irene, an Italian who lives in London, doesn\u2019t think Italians are any louder than other nationalities. \u201cBut there is something,\u201d she says, \u201cabout Italians and mobile phones. It\u2019s not just the lack of consideration for other people that amazes me. Italians on the phone on a train seem to be oblivious that whoever sits near them will listen to everything. Maybe we are so committed to the conversation we forget about everything else.\u201d That, perhaps, is key to understanding the stereotype. It\u2019s not that Italians are loud; just that they\u2019re rarely hushed in situations where foreigners expect it: in church, classrooms, business meetings or on public transport. There\u2019s an authenticity to that refusal to change register just to suit the surroundings, but it doesn\u2019t bode well for the train carriage battle between sound and silence. \u2022Tobias Jones\u2019s new book is Ultra: The Underworld of Italian Football",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has long been a familiar face in British politics, so why does his ideology remain, in the words of his role-model Winston Churchill, \u201ca riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma\u201d? It\u2019s a puzzle to which there are two, and possibly three solutions, none of which are necessarily mutually exclusive.</p> <p>The first possibility \u2013 and probably the one that holds most sway, even among many of his admirers \u2013 is that when it comes to Johnson and his principles, there is, to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-gertrude-steins-no-there-there-is-everywhere-1517589198\" title=\"\">borrow from Gertrude Stein</a>, simply no \u201cthere\u201d there. According to this take, the prime minister is no more and no less than an amalgam of ambition and ego.

It\u2019s a puzzle to which there are two, and possibly three solutions, none of which are necessarily mutually exclusive. The first possibility \u2013 and probably the one that holds most sway, even among many of his admirers \u2013 is that when it comes to Johnson and his principles, there is, to borrow from Gertrude Stein, simply no \u201cthere\u201d there. According to this take, the prime minister is no more and no less than an amalgam of ambition and ego. Having conquered the dizzy (and for him, anyway, increasingly well-remunerated) heights of broadsheet column-writing, Johnson simply turned to politics as a glutton turns to dessert. The second possibility \u2013 almost as widely canvassed as the first and clearly highly compatible with it \u2013 is that it suits Johnson\u2019s essentially Machiavellian purposes to defy definition and to keep everyone guessing.

Now, this may seem a strange place to start an article about the <em>BBC Sports Personality of the Year</em> awards when the show has come up with its strongest shortlist since the 2012 Olympics and, in all honesty, even Bob himself seemed a bit surprised when I called him up this past week to talk about it. \u201cYou can probably guess why I\u2019m calling,\u201d I started. \u201cNo,\u201d he stopped. \u201cIs it something to do with the election?\u201d Not the election Bob, but the other big vote.

And then, so the story goes, the BBC realised he was going to win. So it disqualified him on the grounds that orchestrated block votes were against the rules. Was Bob robbed? The BBC never confirmed or denied it. Asked about it at the time, it said: \u201cWe have received votes for Bob Nudd but he has never finished in the top three.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/13/ben-stokes-overwhelming-favourite-to-win-sports-personality-of-the-year\">Ben Stokes overwhelming favourite to win Sports Personality of the Year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Well, Spoty\u2019s always been a peculiar sort of popularity contest, one in which you have to be liked in just the right way. More royals have won it (two, Princess Anne and Zara Phillips) than rugby players (one, across both codes, Jonny Wilkinson). The F1 drivers (Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart, Nigel Mansell, twice, Damon Hill, twice again, and Lewis Hamilton) have done better than the footballers (Bobby Moore, Paul Gascoigne, Michael Owen, David Beckham, Ryan Giggs), and the figure skaters (John Curry, Robin Cousins, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean) have done exactly as well as the cricketers (Jim Laker, David Steele, Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff).</p> <p>Even by these curious standards, this year\u2019s contest seems particularly unusual since at least three of the people on the shortlist, Hamilton, Ben Stokes and Raheem Sterling, have, for large parts of their careers, hardly seemed that popular at all. At least in certain quarters. Sterling and Hamilton have both heard more boos than anyone that talented and successful ought to.</p> <p>It was only three months ago that Hamilton was complaining, after he was jeered in Melbourne, Monza and Montreal, that he\u2019s \u201cthe most booed in the history of all drivers\u201d. He gets it in the press, too, though not nearly so badly as the other two.</p> <p>Like them, Hamilton has sometimes deserved it; like them, he has more often not done so, especially when it\u2019s the sort of front-page coverage that\u2019s gone well beyond criticism into the kind of gleeful vilification that strains of the English media seem to revel in. Build \u2019em up, cast \u2019em down, build \u2019em up again, sell us their ruin, sells us their redemption.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a new trick. It\u2019s the way the game has been played for years. Ask Botham (1981) or Gascoigne (1990), who both know all about it. Their careers, the way they played and were packaged and sold, were both prototypes in their own way for what Stokes, Sterling and Hamilton find themselves going through today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d51ae99ed8f2ffe43af47617f270c2b7edb7fc62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51ae99ed8f2ffe43af47617f270c2b7edb7fc62/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton can bask in the glory of a sixth world title but has faced criticism over his lifestyle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Hamilton can bask in the glory of a sixth world title but has faced criticism over his lifestyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there\u2019s a big difference. Botham and Gascoigne won Spoty before the fall: Botham, in \u201981, had failed as captain but was still England\u2019s swashbuckling hero \u2013 high, wide and handsome \u2013 and Gascoigne in \u201990 was the knockabout savant with a heart of gold. The worst was all ahead of them.</p> <p>Stokes, Sterling and Hamilton have already had to face the same sort of BS, but the way they have dealt with it is very different and belongs much more distinctively to the era they are playing in. They have found a way to confront that hate and, by opposing it, to turn it to their own ends. Whether that\u2019s Sterling\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/09/raheem-sterling-newspapers-fuelling-racism-alleged-abuse-chelsea\" title=\"\">game-changing Instagram posts</a> calling out racial bias in the press, or Stokes\u2019s Twitter notes criticising the <em>Sun</em> for invading his family\u2019s right to privacy. Social media is the tool that they, their agents and managers have used skilfully to take control of their own stories by talking directly to their supporters. Hamilton\u2019s decision to walk out of his press conferences and his threat to cut back access because of \u201cdisrespectful coverage\u201d is another way around the traditional media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/16/black-footballers-publicly-reacting-racist-abuse\">How football is reframing the way we think about race | Johny Pitts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They are athletes, and, in their ways, they are activists too, advocates for their beliefs and (this is the bit their agents love) their brands. This is the same game, played on the athletes\u2019 terms rather than the editors\u2019. It is still sport as soap opera, the stuff of heroes and villains, only these days everyone\u2019s writing their own scripts.</p> <p>You will need to squint a bit here, but I swear if you look back with the right kind of eyes you can see the day Bob Nudd was stitched up as one of the tipping points along the way in all this. The show really flipped, though, at the far end of the decade, when they rebranded it from <em>Sports Review of the Year</em> into <em>Sports Personality of the Year</em>. It stopped being a show for people who like sport, and became a show for people who don\u2019t. And so, what was a highlights show, 90 minutes of clips of the good bits, became a text-in celebration, instead, of celebrity hashtag culture.</p> <p>As for Nudd, he\u2019s not bitter. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many voted for me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know it was a lot, because the magazine had 50,000 readers, they were a pretty loyal lot and well, to be honest, I\u2019m not really sure how many people voted for <em>Sports Personality</em> in those days. But I knew full well an angler could never win it, because we didn\u2019t have the exposure. And besides, it allowed someone a lot more deserving to win instead.\u201d (Liz McColgan, who won the 10,000m at the World Athletics Championships, if you were wondering.) And by the way, he\u2019s going to vote for Stokes. \u201cI\u2019m a huge cricket fan, you see. I love Lewis Hamilton, too, but he\u2019s already got one, hasn\u2019t he? And I reckon everybody who deserves it should win the thing at least once. Shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p>",

More royals have won it (two, Princess Anne and Zara Phillips) than rugby players (one, across both codes, Jonny Wilkinson). The F1 drivers (Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart, Nigel Mansell, twice, Damon Hill, twice again, and Lewis Hamilton) have done better than the footballers (Bobby Moore, Paul Gascoigne, Michael Owen, David Beckham, Ryan Giggs), and the figure skaters (John Curry, Robin Cousins, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean) have done exactly as well as the cricketers (Jim Laker, David Steele, Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff). Even by these curious standards, this year\u2019s contest seems particularly unusual since at least three of the people on the shortlist, Hamilton, Ben Stokes and Raheem Sterling, have, for large parts of their careers, hardly seemed that popular at all. At least in certain quarters. Sterling and Hamilton have both heard more boos than anyone that talented and successful ought to. It was only three months ago that Hamilton was complaining, after he was jeered in Melbourne, Monza and Montreal, that he\u2019s \u201cthe most booed in the history of all drivers\u201d. He gets it in the press, too, though not nearly so badly as the other two. Like them, Hamilton has sometimes deserved it; like them, he has more often not done so, especially when it\u2019s the sort of front-page coverage that\u2019s gone well beyond criticism into the kind of gleeful vilification that strains of the English media seem to revel in. Build \u2019em up, cast \u2019em down, build \u2019em up again, sell us their ruin, sells us their redemption. This isn\u2019t a new trick. It\u2019s the way the game has been played for years. Ask Botham (1981) or Gascoigne (1990), who both know all about it. Their careers, the way they played and were packaged and sold, were both prototypes in their own way for what Stokes, Sterling and Hamilton find themselves going through today. But there\u2019s a big difference. Botham and Gascoigne won Spoty before the fall: Botham, in \u201981, had failed as captain but was still England\u2019s swashbuckling hero \u2013 high, wide and handsome \u2013 and Gascoigne in \u201990 was the knockabout savant with a heart of gold. The worst was all ahead of them. Stokes, Sterling and Hamilton have already had to face the same sort of BS, but the way they have dealt with it is very different and belongs much more distinctively to the era they are playing in. They have found a way to confront that hate and, by opposing it, to turn it to their own ends. Whether that\u2019s Sterling\u2019s game-changing Instagram posts calling out racial bias in the press, or Stokes\u2019s Twitter notes criticising the Sun for invading his family\u2019s right to privacy. Social media is the tool that they, their agents and managers have used skilfully to take control of their own stories by talking directly to their supporters. Hamilton\u2019s decision to walk out of his press conferences and his threat to cut back access because of \u201cdisrespectful coverage\u201d is another way around the traditional media. They are athletes, and, in their ways, they are activists too, advocates for their beliefs and (this is the bit their agents love) their brands. This is the same game, played on the athletes\u2019 terms rather than the editors\u2019. It is still sport as soap opera, the stuff of heroes and villains, only these days everyone\u2019s writing their own scripts. You will need to squint a bit here, but I swear if you look back with the right kind of eyes you can see the day Bob Nudd was stitched up as one of the tipping points along the way in all this. The show really flipped, though, at the far end of the decade, when they rebranded it from Sports Review of the Year into Sports Personality of the Year. It stopped being a show for people who like sport, and became a show for people who don\u2019t. And so, what was a highlights show, 90 minutes of clips of the good bits, became a text-in celebration, instead, of celebrity hashtag culture. As for Nudd, he\u2019s not bitter. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many voted for me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know it was a lot, because the magazine had 50,000 readers, they were a pretty loyal lot and well, to be honest, I\u2019m not really sure how many people voted for Sports Personality in those days. But I knew full well an angler could never win it, because we didn\u2019t have the exposure. And besides, it allowed someone a lot more deserving to win instead.\u201d (Liz McColgan, who won the 10,000m at the World Athletics Championships, if you were wondering.) And by the way, he\u2019s going to vote for Stokes. \u201cI\u2019m a huge cricket fan, you see. I love Lewis Hamilton, too, but he\u2019s already got one, hasn\u2019t he? And I reckon everybody who deserves it should win the thing at least once. Shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d",

Can Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Leicester keep winning? Those are the key, obvious questions of this Saturday afternoon after Liverpool\u2019s game with Watford is completed. <br><br><strong>Chelsea v Bournemouth</strong><br><br>Neither team is in particularly good nick at the moment, with Bournemouth on a horrible run, having lost their five matches since beating Manchester United on November 2. Frank\u2019s men have slowed up, having been Big Dunk-ed by Everton; they have won just one of their last five league matches. <br><br><strong>Sheffield United v Aston Villa</strong><br><br>Two promoted teams from last season have had converging campaigns. Blades have been the surprise package, and are yet to be worked out in the Premier League. Aston Villa, in 18th, struggle badly for goals, and have won just one of their last six matches. Much relies on the individual talent of Jack Grealish while Chris Wilder\u2019s team operate as a unit. Having said that, last week\u2019s defeat of Norwich was a first win in five. <br><br><strong>Leicester v Norwich</strong> <br><br>A team that cannot stop scoring goals against another that cannot stop conceding, a 0-0 is almost guaranteed, though Jamie Vardy is looking to make it nine matches in a row in which he has scored. Norwich are second-bottom, Leicester are top and anything but a home win would be a surprise. <br><br><strong>Burnley v Newcastle</strong><br><br>One for the purists, almost certainly. Burnley are on a poor run, having lost their last three and having been dismantled last week by Tottenham. A Sean Dyche rocket has surely been launched in the Lancashire area. That defending for Son Heung-min\u2019s goal was horrendous. Meanwhile, Newcastle are defying expectation and xG, and are in 11th. </p> \n  <p>All that and the latest news from the EFL, in which Leeds v Cardiff is the pick of the day. League Two leaders Wycombe host Burton, and in League Two, it\u2019s Swindon v Oldham in which Eoin Doyle looks to add to his huge total of 18 goals so far this season. <br><br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/13/burnley-newcastle-match-preview-premier-league\">Burnley v Newcastle: match preview</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/13/chelsea-bournemouth-match-preview-premier-league\">Chelsea v Bournemouth: match preview</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/13/leicester-norwich-match-preview-premier-league\">Leicester v Norwich: match preview</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/13/sheffield-united-aston-villa-match-preview-premier-league\">Sheffield United v Aston Villa: match preview</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll wrap things up with the report from Leeds 3-3 Cardiff: Eddie Howe speaks I am so pleased for all the players. We tried to frustrate them and frustrate their creative players and be a threat on the break. I Gos [Dan Gosling] and I had a feeling he would be on. It\u2019s the good side of VAR as it would have been disallowed. A good win for Burnley and a poor show from Newcastle. Frank Lampard speaks A home loss, not too good from us, which has been the story of us this season; a similar story to that which has been happening recently. They were very organised and we had to make it more difficult for them but we didn\u2019t. We had a really good patch and now we have lost three of four games and you say, \u201cwoah, that\u2019s reality, lads\u201d. Jacob Steinberg was at Stamford Bridge to see a shock victory for Bournemouth. Brendan Rodgers speaks I have got a number of players that can come and play. We started with the same eleven from last week that played very well. I needed to make a change and we played with two wingers the second half and we couldn\u2019t quite make the final breakthrough. #Lampardout seems to be trending on Twitter which seems harsh to say the very least. After all, he is Frank Lampard. Paul Doyle was at Bramall Lane to see Blades beat Villa 2-0. Here\u2019s Nick Ames\u2019 report on Leicester 1-1 Norwich. Rather damning stats here. League Two scores and standings. League One scores and standings. Championship scores and standings. Here\u2019s some J\u00fcrgen Klopp press conference action from before. Liverpool have had another good day. Euro news: Barcelona could only draw 2-2 with Real Sociedad, and Bayern Munich won 6-1 defeat of Werder Bremen with a Philippe Coutinho hat-trick. Robert Lewandowski got two. Should Manchester United beat Everton tomorrow then they will be just two points behind Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea. It\u2019s a funny old game. Two John Fleck goals, and a Jack Grealish penalty miss. That\u2019s a fine day for the Blades and Villa are in real danger of the drop; they could really, really do with a goalscorer. Macclesfield Town\u2019s austerity XI drew 1-1 at Walsall, if you were wondering. I certainly was. It\u2019s all over and that\u2019s probably that for Leicester\u2019s title challenge. They could not find a winner and Jamie Vardy could not find his goal. Liverpool ten points clear at the top. It finished Leeds 3-3 Cardiff, which is something of a choke from Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s team. As predicted, it wasn\u2019t a classic and the goal came via a mistake. Sean Dyche\u2019s team continue their trend of beating teams around them. Chelsea\u2019s slide continues on another day when the Frank Lampard revolution stalled. Looks like spending in January definitely needs to happen. The winning goal was very odd indeed, but Bournemouth deserved their win, having defended so well. Leicester had three minutes of time added on to find a winner and to stop Jamie Vardy\u2019s scoring run in its tracks. Newcastle have been poor today, it seems. Burnley\u2019s three-game losing streak is at its end, with Nick Pope not having to get through much work at Turf Moor. Chelsea pushing on with Kovacic having a shot saved by Aaron Ramsdale. Oh Leeds! Cardiff have scored their third. Robert Glatzel has got it and West Brom will finish the day top of the Championship. Is this where the Leeds choke begins once more? Chelsea have five minutes of time added on to chase their equaliser. They seem imbalanced by having so many forwards on the pitch. Cardiff\u2019s surge may be at an end as goalscorer Sean Morrison has been sent off. It seemed harsh, perhaps an orange card. Relief for Leeds, and they needed it. Chelsea\u2019s wobble has continued, and they\u2019ve been poor today against an opponent who had lost their last six matches. That Gosling goal was chaotic, and with defending not dissimilar to the chaos for Everton\u2019s first goal last week. And Leeds have an edgy last eight minutes to play as Sean Morrison has scored for Cardiff. It\u2019s 3-2. Controversy at Stamford Bridge. Has the ball crossed the line? There is a VAR check to see if anyone was offside. They were not. Oh dear, Frank. Chelsea are now piling forward, with Batshuayi on as a sub to make it two strikers on the field. Bournemouth are sat deep and in numbers. There seems to be a VAR for a retake of that Grealish penalty but it stands as a miss for the bleach-haired musketeer of the Midlands. Dean Henderson is sent the wrong way but Jack Grealish has hit the bar! Handball shout at Bramall Lane, as the ball hits Blades\u2019 John Egan. The referee missed it and VAR has intervened. It takes an age to come up with the decision. And the penalty is given. Swansea are 3-1 up on Middlesbrough now, and Macclesfield have conceded to Walsall. It\u2019s 1-1. Dominic Solanke is on as a sub for Bournemouth against his old club Chelsea, and the away team are continuing to create chances. David McGoldrick is the silky link man, a one-two and Fleck scores his fourth goal in four matches. Middlesbrough pay the price for being down to ten men as Andre Ayew scores his second, and puts Swansea 2-1 up. Leicester miss a golden chance to lead through Wilfred Ndidi. By the way, Barcelona are locked at 2-2 with Real Sociedad. Luis Suarez put Barca 2-1 up but then came an equaliser from Alexander Isak. Leeds have conceded a goal to Cardiff, it\u2019s 3-1 now after Lee Tomlin scored. Bournemouth go close, the ball spilling to Lewis Cook and Chelsea had to scrabble to get the ball clear. Middlesbrough, having pulled level, are down to ten men, as Marcus Browne has been dismissed. Andy Carroll might have been sent off, having forearm-smashed Ben Mee. He only got a yellow but got a bit lucky. Chelsea required to do some last-ditch defending as Kurt Zouma slides in to tackle Josh King with Kepa scrabbling. Still 0-0 at Stamford Bridge. Middlesbrough have just equalised at Swansea, a much-needed goal for Jonathan Woodgate as Marcus Tavernier scores. A goalkeeping howler from Martin Dubravka allows Chris Wood to score from close range, just as Burnley were listing. Let\u2019s see if this afternoon\u2019s action affects his place in the standings. Did he have John Fleck? Wesley, Aston Villa\u2019s not exactly firing striker, hits the side-netting with a header at Sheffield United. Leeds are 3-0 up now on Cardiff, with Patrick Bamford getting his second of the day. Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s team are going to the top. Close for Leicester: Jamie Vardy kills a ball stone-dead, but cannot steer his shot goalwards. NB: Brenand has made another change. A nice build-up sees Lundstram supply John Fleck for the opener. Villa caught cold. Sheffield United v Aston Villa was a non-event in the first half, but Blades have come out fighting after one of those Chris Wilder half-time team talks, cups and blue language flying everywhere, no doubt. In Germany, Philippe Coutinho and Robert Lewandowski have just scored their second goals as Bayern lead Werder Bremen 4-1. Jadon Sancho has scored for Borussia Dortmund who are 2-0 up on Mainz. This is the big story from the EFL. Oh dear, Forest, and Jordan Rhodes comes in from the cold to score a hat-trick for Sheff Wed. The latest scores from across the divisions can be found here. So, not exactly eventful in the Premier League so far, but the game at Leicester has had a few twists with Kelechi Iheanacho at the centre of matters. Burnley 0-0 Newcastle Chelsea 0-0 Bournemouth Leicester 1-1 Norwich Sheffield United 0-0 Aston Villa Simon McMahon emails in from the land of the SNP: \u201cAfternoon John. Scottish Championship runaway leaders Dundee United are 1-0 up at Arbroath, Sam Stanton\u2019s early goal the difference. I can confirm that, as required by law for every fixture at Gayfield, which is virtually in the North Sea, it is blowing a gale, and freezing.\u201d Ouch, it\u2019s 4-0 to Sheffield Wednesday at Nottingham Forest, with Steven Fletcher getting the latest goal. Luton equalise against Preston with a James Collins penalty. (Not that James Collins.) It\u2019s 1-1. Taken out of the firing line? Decisive management from Brendan Rodgers in making a tactical sub a couple of minutes before half-time. He bloody loves a big gesture. That Vardy goal or no goal might end up being like Harry Kane v Stoke a couple of seasons ago... it\u2019s been awarded to Norwich goalie Tim Krul for an own-goal. It\u2019s...not Jamie Vardy. Over in Spain, Antoine Griezmann has just scored to equalise for Barcelona at old club Real Sociedad. It\u2019s 1-1 and he didn\u2019t celebrate. Vardy has scored nine in a row, and his header from James Maddison\u2019s cross goes in via a deflection. But is it an own-goal off Buendia? Let\u2019s see what the dubious goals committee says... Controversy at Leicester, as the home team play on after the ball was kicked out for a Norwich player to receive treatment, then Zimmerman brings down Iheanacho. It\u2019s a free-kick, a melee and VAR is taking a look as Cantwell had a swipe at Iheanacho. He escapes with a yellow card. And the referee Andy Madley has returned the ball to Norwich, as the ball should have gone back to them in the first place. Iheancho made quite a bit of the foul on him. As predicted, Burnley v Newcastle hasn\u2019t been a classic so far. Burnley are really out of nick and Steve Bruce\u2019s team are functional at best, if effective at the moment. That Pukki goal puts real pressure on Leicester and is great news for Liverpool. Norwich had been the better team at the King Power, just as Everton were a couple of weeks ago before a Brendan masterclass switched things around. The flying Finn scores something of a pea-roller of a strike, and perhaps its lack of venom confused Kasper Schmeichel, who was rocking on his heels a little. Brentford are leading Fulham 1-0 in the West London derby, with Bryan Mbuemo scoring a header. Joshua Reynolds calls in: \u201cWatching the Stoke/Reading game which has a Charlie Adam revenge wondergoal written all over it. But my real question is, was Sam Vokes ever good? I know he gets picked for Wales, but...\u201d It\u2019s a great question I don\u2019t have an answer to. Bayern Munich were drawing 1-1 with Werder, and needed a Philippe Coutinho equaliser on the stroke of half-time to equalise...but here\u2019s Robert Lewandowski has the ball in the net. There\u2019s a VAR check and that\u2019s a goal. FC Hollywood are 2-1 up! Chelsea are in the ascendancy, with Tammy Abraham going close as the pressure is piled on Bournemouth. Norwich miss a golden chance; Teemu Pukki had an open goal against Leicester but it stays at 0-0. Sheff Wed now 2-0 up on Nottingham Forest, with Jordan Rhodes scoring a second. He hadn\u2019t scored since January until now. Penalty shout for Burnley against Newcastle for a Paul Dummett handball but VAR has waved that away. Leeds are now 2-0 up, and heading back to the top of the Championship after a Patrick Bamford screamer. Sheffield Wednesday, another crisis club, lead Nottingham Forest after a goal from Jordan Rhodes. Crisis club Macclesfield Town are 1-0 up on Walsall through Miles Welch-Hayes, a good Maxonian name. Come on Silkmen! Chelsea have gone close through Mason Mount, which has gone against the run of play against Bournemouth. Leeds United are 1-0 through Helder Costa against Cardiff. They are trying to keep pace with West Brom. Sunderland\u2019s season in hell continues as they go 1-0 down to Blackpool in League One through Matty Virtue. And Preston are 1-0 up on Luton as Paul Gallagher slots in a rebounded penalty. Andy Carroll, who has started for Newcastle up front with Joelinton, has just headed wide against Burnley. First goal in the EFL comes as Blackburn go 1-0 up on Bristol City; Bradley Johnson is the scorer. Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s report from Anfield on yet another Liverpool win. Worth mentioning West Brom\u2019s 3-2 win at Birmingham, after being 1-0 and 2-1 down, and that puts them clear at the top of the Championship. And away we go in the Premier League and EFL.... Ryan Grubb emails in, and he\u2019s a Football Weekly listener. \u201cHello John. Happened to catch Nigel\u2019s pre-match interview before the early kickoff and I have to say your impression from this weeks pod was spot on. It felt like an eternity between words. That 20 second interview took about a year and a half. Must make for interesting training sessions...Have a good one!\u201d Thanks, Ryan. Kick-off is approaching in the 3pm kick-offs, and all the games will be played in exceedingly cold temperatures. Word reach the desk that it is \u201cfreezing at Leicester\u201d. The team news below on Chelsea omitted to mention that Willy Caballero will the back-up goalkeeper. Looks like Leicester fans have been given some free mince pies. Some Opta stats for the afternoon\u2019s Premier League matches. Newcastle\u2019s average possession figure this season is just 32.8%, the lowest in the Premier League. The Magpies are the only side yet to have more possession than their opponents in a single Premier League match this season. Bournemouth have lost each of their last six Premier League games in London, conceding 20 goals in the process. Aston Villa have won only one of their last 26 Premier League away games (D4 L21). (Sweet memories of Tim Sherwood and Remi Garde) No side has conceded the first goal in more Premier League games this season than Norwich (10), with the Canaries going on to lose every single one of those. Meanwhile, Leicester have won their last 19 Premier League games when scoring first. Liverpool are absolutely cruising it. Poor, poor Pep. Over in Germany, Bayern Munich, back in seventh and looking for a new boss, have just kicked off against Werder Bremen. They\u2019ve been made to work for this by Nigel Pearson\u2019s Watford but Liverpool are now 11 points clear at the top after a 2-0 win. Bit of pressure on Leicester, then. His Tottenham team don\u2019t play until tomorrow when they face Wolves, but Mourinho is the focus for this week\u2019s column from Andrew Anthony. After their game against Crewe last week was postponed after a players\u2019 strike because of unpaid wages, Macclesfield do play today at Walsall in League Two after authorities stepped in to make sure they got paid. The headline team news there is that Kurt Zouma is given another go by Frank Lampard after a harrowing day at Goodison Park last weekend. Leicester are unchanged from last week\u2019s defeat of Aston Villa.

Referee: Peter Bankes (Merseyside) Things on a bit of a knife-edge at Anfield, with VAR playing its part. Burnley\u2019s star man will be in action this afternoon, and he spoke to Paul Wilson. Can Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea stop the rot? Can Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Leicester keep winning? Those are the key, obvious questions of this Saturday afternoon after Liverpool\u2019s game with Watford is completed. Chelsea v Bournemouth Neither team is in particularly good nick at the moment, with Bournemouth on a horrible run, having lost their five matches since beating Manchester United on November 2. Frank\u2019s men have slowed up, having been Big Dunk-ed by Everton; they have won just one of their last five league matches. Sheffield United v Aston Villa Two promoted teams from last season have had converging campaigns. Blades have been the surprise package, and are yet to be worked out in the Premier League. Aston Villa, in 18th, struggle badly for goals, and have won just one of their last six matches. Much relies on the individual talent of Jack Grealish while Chris Wilder\u2019s team operate as a unit. Having said that, last week\u2019s defeat of Norwich was a first win in five. Leicester v Norwich A team that cannot stop scoring goals against another that cannot stop conceding, a 0-0 is almost guaranteed, though Jamie Vardy is looking to make it nine matches in a row in which he has scored. Norwich are second-bottom, Leicester are top and anything but a home win would be a surprise. Burnley v Newcastle One for the purists, almost certainly. Burnley are on a poor run, having lost their last three and having been dismantled last week by Tottenham. A Sean Dyche rocket has surely been launched in the Lancashire area. That defending for Son Heung-min\u2019s goal was horrendous. Meanwhile, Newcastle are defying expectation and xG, and are in 11th. All that and the latest news from the EFL, in which Leeds v Cardiff is the pick of the day. League Two leaders Wycombe host Burton, and in League Two, it\u2019s Swindon v Oldham in which Eoin Doyle looks to add to his huge total of 18 goals so far this season.",

      "body": "<p>There are bigger issues on Saracens\u2019 minds these days but they remain just about in contention for one competition, at least, of which they are the champions. An ugly, bad-tempered win over Munster keeps them on the shoulders of the Irishmen in Pool Four, albeit seven adrift of Racing 92. Two tries in the last quarter did for the province, who for most of the match had resisted manfully a rather lacklustre Saracens.</p> <p>Lacklustre, that is, until a brawl broke out involving virtually every player on the pitch 10 minutes into the second half. The Munster doctor is alleged to have made a comment regarding Jamie George\u2019s weight. Whatever it was, the normally jovial George really did not like it. All hell broke loose. This may not be the last to be heard of the incident, with Sarries considering whether to make a formal complaint.</p> <p>\u201cI think we need to decide what we are going to do,\u201d said Mark McCall. \u201cFrom what I know something pretty bad was said to Jamie. Clearly it shouldn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think what was said was good at all.\u201d</p> <p>Owen Farrell, captain for the day, engaged with particular feeling, squaring off with his fellow Lions half-back Conor Murray. Should Farrell suffer from a persecution complex, it would have deepened, as he was penalised for the incident. He had a one-in-30 chance. But the desired effect of a more energised home team was achieved. \u201cI think the team we were in the last 25 minutes is the team we want to be,\u201d said McCall.</p> <p>They should keep the Munster doctor\u2019s comment on a loop because they needed the hurry-up, despite a more familiar line-up for the home return of this double-header against Munster.

      "bodyText": "There are bigger issues on Saracens\u2019 minds these days but they remain just about in contention for one competition, at least, of which they are the champions. An ugly, bad-tempered win over Munster keeps them on the shoulders of the Irishmen in Pool Four, albeit seven adrift of Racing 92. Two tries in the last quarter did for the province, who for most of the match had resisted manfully a rather lacklustre Saracens. Lacklustre, that is, until a brawl broke out involving virtually every player on the pitch 10 minutes into the second half. The Munster doctor is alleged to have made a comment regarding Jamie George\u2019s weight. Whatever it was, the normally jovial George really did not like it. All hell broke loose. This may not be the last to be heard of the incident, with Sarries considering whether to make a formal complaint. \u201cI think we need to decide what we are going to do,\u201d said Mark McCall. \u201cFrom what I know something pretty bad was said to Jamie. Clearly it shouldn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think what was said was good at all.\u201d Owen Farrell, captain for the day, engaged with particular feeling, squaring off with his fellow Lions half-back Conor Murray. Should Farrell suffer from a persecution complex, it would have deepened, as he was penalised for the incident. He had a one-in-30 chance. But the desired effect of a more energised home team was achieved. \u201cI think the team we were in the last 25 minutes is the team we want to be,\u201d said McCall. They should keep the Munster doctor\u2019s comment on a loop because they needed the hurry-up, despite a more familiar line-up for the home return of this double-header against Munster. After the alternative line-up Saracens fielded in Limerick last week, they elected to go more or less full bore here.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from today\u2019s politics live blog. Here\u2019s a little summary of today\u2019s developments. John McDonnell has said he will leave the shadow cabinet. \u201cThe new leader will come in place, appoint the shadow cabinet. I won\u2019t be part of the shadow cabinet,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cI\u2019ve done my bit.\u201d He was seen by some as a possible interim leader, but, as a key figure in Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a second referendum, he has also faced criticism from those who think the party\u2019s Brexit position was a key reason for its defeat. McDonnell said the current shadow cabinet would stay in place for the interim period, and would respond to the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. The shadow chancellor also said that the NEC officers \u2013 a sub-group of senior members of Labour\u2019s ruling body \u2013 would meet next week and decide the timetable for a leadership election in the new year. \u201cIt will be the usual time \u2013 a couple of months or something,\u201d he said. Members of the wider NEC \u2013 who said that they had only been contacted by the party\u2019s leadership to be told not to speak to the media about the election results \u2013 argued on Twitter that they would expect the leadership election timetable to be decided by a meeting of all of the committee\u2019s members. Boris Johnson told an audience of supporters in the now Tory seat of Sedgefield, Country Durham, that the UK has \u201cembarked on a wonderful adventure\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to recover our national self-confidence, our mojo, our self-belief, and we\u2019re going to do things differently and better as a country,\u201d he said. He thanked voters across Labour\u2019s former heartlands: I can imagine people\u2019s pencils hovering over the ballot paper and wavering, before coming down for us and the Conservatives. And I know that people may have been breaking the voting habits of generations to vote for us and I want the people of the north-east to know that we in the Conservative party, and I, will repay your trust. Charities helping the most vulnerable in society have reported an increase in support after the Conservative victory in the general election, reports Georgina Hayes. Shelter, Refuge, the Trussell Trust and the Biscuit Fund have all confirmed they have seen a sharp increase in donations and/or registered supporters as a result of the election outcome. While unable to give exact numbers, the UK homelessness and housing charity Shelter said it had seen an increase in the number of people signing up as supporters since the result. EU leaders would take the initiative and request an extension to the transition period, keeping the UK under Brussels regulations beyond 2020, under a plan mooted for dealing with Boris Johnson refusing to seek a delay \u2013 reports Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey. The move is being considered by EU officials as a way out of the problem posed by the short time available to negotiate a new relationship and the prime minister\u2019s insistence that he will not seek an extension beyond 11 months. With a majority of 80 secured by the prime minister, the UK is expected to leave the EU on 31 January \u2013 in fewer than 50 days. At the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the UK is set to exit the EU\u2019s customs union and single market and enter newly-negotiated arrangements. Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said that negotiating a future relationship in such a timeframe would be very challenging. Speaking on Friday at the end of a two-day leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels, she said the negotiations would have to prioritise key EU issues, such as trade in goods and fisheries, and leave others for after 2020. Such a \u201csequencing\u201d could leave arrangements for the UK\u2019s financial services sector and the landing rights of British air carriers out of an initial deal, among other issues. Read the full story here: More concerns from NEC members that the timetable for selecting a new Labour leader will be taken out of their hands. The Observer journalist Tim Adams has been in the former Labour safe seat (and Tony Blair\u2019s old constituency) of Sedgefield today, where the prime minister gave a triumphant speech to activists this morning. The new Tory MP in Sedgefield, Paul Howell, a retired accountant, is the unlikely latest heir to Blair. He had watched hope harden into expectation a week into the campaign. He had walked down a street in the former mining village of Cornforth, north of Trimdon, knocking on doors. He went through a dozen without finding a Labour voter; the 13th was an ex-Labour councillor who also pledged him a vote. There were so many following winds here: but the Brexit factor and the Corbyn factor were the big ones, while Boris was seen as someone who can deliver. Personally, I think people only ever lend you their votes. It\u2019s up to you to make them trust you again to give it again. The talk in the air is of a new Thatcherism, but \u201cwithout the tribal connotations\u201d. Oliver Peeke, who works in admin for the council, admits he is one of those referred to by Johnson whose grandparents would be spinning in their grave to see him wearing a Tory rosette. A lot of our family were Labour, but I\u2019m desperate that this time it will stick. I don\u2019t want to go back to the dark old days when people would just scream Thatcher at you when you walk up the drive with a Tory leaflet. There has to be more to politics that that. The defeated Labour candidate, Phil Wilson, told the Observer that \u201cif Johnson was going to park his tanks on any lawn this morning it was going to be here. He wants to say to the world that New Labour is history.\u201d Wilson puts his defeat squarely at the door of the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. He is angry that his party has proved itself \u201cunable to connect with people who are not in London\u201d, and presented a manifesto \u201cthat was an essay about the past\u201d with \u201cnothing to say about the future\u201d. Members of Labour\u2019s NEC saying on Twitter they haven\u2019t been told about a possible meeting next week. (McDonnell said this morning that Labour\u2019s ruling body would meet next week.) The Huffington Post\u2019s Rachel Wearmouth reports that the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, plans to run for the deputy leadership. The hashtag #backburgon was trending this morning, after what appeared to be a parody campaign page was created on Twitter called \u201cBack Burgon\u201d. The editor of Labour List reports that NEC members are concerned the leader\u2019s office is trying to \u201ccling on to power\u201d. This is from Sky News\u2019s political correspondent Rob Powell: Boris Johnson has told an audience of supporters in the now Tory seat of Sedgefield, Country Durham, that the UK has \u201cembarked on a wonderful adventure\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to recover our national self-confidence, our mojo, our self-belief, and we\u2019re going to do things differently and better as a country,\u201d he said. He thanked voters across Labour\u2019s former heartlands: I can imagine people\u2019s pencils hovering over the ballot paper and wavering, before coming down for us and the Conservatives. And I know that people may have been breaking the voting habits of generations to vote for us and I want the people of the north-east to know that we in the Conservative party, and I, will repay your trust. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said he will leave the shadow cabinet. \u201cThe new leader will come in place, appoint the shadow cabinet. I won\u2019t be part of the shadow cabinet,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done my bit.\u201d He was seen by some as a possible interim leader, but, as a key figure in Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a second referendum, he has also faced criticism from those who think the party\u2019s Brexit position was a key reason for its defeat. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s three sons have condemned the \u201cdespicable attacks\u201d their father has faced hours after he said he would stand down following the party\u2019s historic defeat. The Labour leader\u2019s youngest son, Tommy, shared a statement on Twitter on Friday night lamenting the loss but adding that it was wrong to assume the \u201cideologies\u201d their father stood for were outdated. Michael Heseltine, the Europhile Tory grandee who urged voters to back the Liberal Democrats in the election, has admitted that the remain position on European Union membership has lost and declared that he thinks the debate is over for at least a generation. \u201cWell, we have lost,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cLet\u2019s not muck about with the language. We have lost. Brexit is going to happen and we have to live with it.\u201d The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has been doorstepped by the BBC, heading out to a constituency surgery. She is one of those tipped as a possible candidate for Labour leader. Frankly there\u2019s going to be an awful lot of work to do over the next five years given we\u2019ve got this terrible Tory government coming. I fear that my surgery is going to be very full indeed with people who are getting their benefits cut. Asked if she would run for Labour leader, she said: \u201cI\u2019m still in a period of mourning. We need to be able to have a chance to stop and think.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of Johnson\u2019s speech in Sedgefield. Speaking to activists and new MPs, he said: Nobody wanted this election in the run-up to Christmas, but what an incredible thing you have done. You have changed the political landscape. You have changed the Conservative party for the better and you\u2019ve changed the future of our country for the better. I want to thank all the people of Sedgefield, of Bishop Auckland, of Stockton South, of Darlington \u2013 where my ancestors come from, it turns out \u2013 north-west Durham, Blyth Valley and Redcar. I want to thank all of you for the trust that you have placed in the Conservative party and in me. I know how difficult it was, and it can be, to make that kind of decision. And I can imagine people\u2019s pencils hovering over the ballot paper and wavering, before coming down for us and the Conservatives. And I know that people may have been breaking the voting habits of generations to vote for us and I want the people of the north-east to know that we in the Conservative party, and I, will repay your trust. He said the Tories had \u201cgone over the timetable\u201d and that it was definitely possible to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament before Christmas. He said that after that they would get on with delivering other manifesto commitments. \u201cHow many more hospitals?\u201d he asked the crowd, referring to the dubious manifesto pledge. \u201cForty,\u201d they responded. \u201cHow many more nurses?\u201d he asked (another controversial pledge), with the response \u201c50,000\u201d. He said the new government was \u201cgoing to do some fantastic things\u201d. \u201cOur country has now embarked on a wonderful adventure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to recover our national self-confidence, our mojo, our self-belief, and we\u2019re going to do things differently and better as a country.\u201d Johnson says its time for the UK to recover its \u201cmojo\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a wonderful, wonderful time in the country,\u201d he says. He says to new Tory MPs: \u201cRemember, we are not the masters, we are the servants now.\u201d Boris Johnson is speaking to a crowd of supporters in Sedgefield, County Durham, Tony Blair\u2019s former seat which fell to the Tories for the first time since the 1930s. You can watch the live stream at the top of the blog. He says he will take the UK out of the EU by 31 January. He repeats his questionable pledge to deliver \u201c50,000 more\u201d nurses and says his new government will hire more police. Some reaction to that McDonnell news (see last post). He was seen by some as a possible interim leader, but, as a key figure in Labour\u2019s shift towards supporting a second referendum, he has also faced criticism as one of the masterminds behind the party\u2019s election campaign. John McDonnell has said he will not be returning to the shadow cabinet. The shadow chancellor denied that he had backed the wrong Labour leader, saying Corbyn was \u201cone of the most principled, honest, sincere, committed, anti-racist politicians\u201d. The new leadership coming in, I think, will enable us to move forward on the key issues \u2013 getting a Brexit deal that works for all of us, tackling these grotesque levels of inequality. But the big one ... is climate change and my fear is five years of a fossil fuel-backed government under Boris Johnson means we will miss this five-year opportunity of saving our planet. ... I didn\u2019t back the wrong person because Jeremy was the right leader. We could have won in 2017. Things moved on, Brexit dominated everything and that was the horns of a dilemma we were on. The new leader will come in place, appoint the shadow cabinet. I won\u2019t be part of the shadow cabinet. I\u2019ve done my bit. We need to move on at that stage, with that new leader, and I think we will be in a position [to be] learning lessons, listening to people and constructing a broad coalition right the way across the country. McDonnell said there needed to be a debate about how \u201csomeone \u2013 who I think is one of the most principled, honest, sincere, committed, anti-racist politicians \u2013 [was] demonised by a smear campaign\u201d. \u201cI think we have a wider debate here about the role of social media and the media overall,\u201d he said. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks writes that there is an excellent inside story from the Herald\u2019s political editor Tom Gordon, which explains how the SNP managed to exceed its own expectations thanks to high turnout. While turnout was down in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, it was up in Scotland, rising 1.6 points to 68.1%. Across the UK it fell 1.5 points to 67.7%. According to Gordon, SNP strategists believe this is what pushed their final tally to 48 MPs \u2013 actually 47 plus one suspended member who still appeared on the ballot as SNP. Meanwhile, the Telegraph Scotland reports that Boris Johnson is planning a major charm offensive in Scotland after accepting that his personal unpopularity contributed to his party losing seven of their 13 seats. Apparently he has already spoken to senior Scottish Tories to pledge he will visit Scotland more often in the new year in the hope of winning over sceptical Scots with a one nation agenda. Johnson and the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have already clashed over the SNP\u2019s insistence that the results are a mandate for a second independence referendum, with the prime minster immediately reiterating that he will not grant the necessary powers for Holyrood to hold one. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s three sons have condemned the \u201cdespicable attacks\u201d their father has faced hours after he said he would stand down following the party\u2019s historic defeat. The Labour leader\u2019s youngest son, Tommy, shared a statement on Twitter on Friday night lamenting the loss but adding that it was wrong to assume the \u201cideologies\u201d their dad stood for were outdated. He described the manifesto his father produced as the \u201cmost wonderful this country has ever seen\u201d. His statement read: \u201cLast night hurt, today hurts a bit more, tomorrow it will hurt even more. \u201cJeremy has dedicated each day of his political life for the less fortunate amongst us. Unwaveringly, he has fought and campaigned for people who suffer and people in hardship. \u201cBeing honest, humble and good natured in the poisonous world of politics has meant that he has endured the most despicable attacks filled with hatred for the duration of his 36 years in public life.\u201d It continued: \u201cTo say we are proud is a vast understatement. To assume the ideologies he stands for are now outdated is so wrong. In the coming years we will see that they are more important than ever. \u201cThank you to every person who saw his vision and supported it and supported him. From the three proudest sons on the planet, please continue the fight.\u201d The former Labour MP, Anna Turley, who lost her seat in Redcar, has written for the Independent, describing the election result for Labour as \u201ca disgrace\u201d. Her twitter bio now reads simply: \u201cFree\u201d. To blame Brexit is to miss the point. There would be no Brexit if Labour had had credible leadership in the 2016 referendum, standing up for our party\u2019s values of cooperation, internationalism and partnership. Instead, we had a guy who dressed up in a fur coat to go on The Last Leg and give the EU \u201cseven and a half out of ten\u201d. No one put forward an argument to working-class Labour communities about why the EU mattered to them, because the leader didn\u2019t believe that it did. Ever since, instead of strong leadership and a clear position, we have had three years of U-turns, triangulation and dancing on pinheads. I have never been able to tell my constituents what Labour\u2019s Brexit position truly was \u2013 only my own. And so to this disgrace. Despite 10 years of Tory austerity that has led to Dickensian levels of poverty, and the end of 175 years of steel-making in my constituency, people didn\u2019t believe Labour would be any better. This is a failure on an epic scale, and a betrayal of those communities that need Labour most. The BBC\u2019s director general has expressed his exasperation with \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d about the broadcaster\u2019s election news coverage, although some of its journalists privately fear that errors during the campaign may have hit public trust in the corporation. The Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, reports that Tony Hall emailed staff on Friday to thank them for their work on the BBC\u2019s coverage, which came under intense online scrutiny. This followed criticism of the editing out of laughter aimed at Boris Johnson in a news bulletin, reporters uncritically repeating Conservative sources, such as when a Labour activist was erroneously accused of punching a Tory aide, and the prime minister escaping scrutiny after dodging a one-on-one interview with Andrew Neil. Hall said the BBC\u2019s critics were often seeing bias in what were genuine human errors: \u201cIn a frenetic campaign where we\u2019ve produced hundreds of hours of output, of course we\u2019ve made the odd mistake and we\u2019ve held up our hands to them. Editors are making tough calls every minute of the day. But I don\u2019t accept the view of those critics who jump on a handful of examples to suggest we\u2019re somehow biased one way or the other.\u201d You can read the full story here: Former Labour MPs who lost their seats in Thursday\u2019s election have been speaking to the BBC. They blamed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and the party\u2019s alienation of its northern voters for the loss, PA Media reports. The former Bishop Auckland MP Helen Goodman told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme \u201cthe biggest factor was obviously the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader\u201d. The fact of the matter is that Jeremy Corbyn failed as a communicator, whatever his good personal qualities, and he undoubtedly has good personal qualities, he failed as a communicator. The ex-shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman, who lost her seat in Darlington, said: You can\u2019t run a political party that wants to be a party of government but only really appeals to about a third of the electorate and those are people that live in cities who are fairly well-off people. The real question we have to ask ourselves now is do we want the Tories, do we want to give them another five years or another 15 years, because if we get this wrong now as a party, this could very well be the end of the Labour movement. The former Labour MP Anna Turley, who lost her seat in Redcar, said: I think it\u2019s quite overwhelming. You have to listen to the people, that\u2019s the first thing that we have to do. And for me, when you\u2019re getting four doors in a row of lifelong Labour voters saying: \u2018I\u2019m sorry Anna, I\u2019m a lifelong Labour voter, I like what you\u2019ve done, but I just can\u2019t vote for that man to be prime minister\u2019, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a fundamental barrier that we just couldn\u2019t get across. Turley said Corbyn was more of a reason than Brexit for her constituents voting for another party. In my constituency, even though it was a 67% leave constituency, it was four-to-one the leadership over Brexit. I mean obviously the issues run deeper than that, the Labour party is bigger than just one person, but the reality is there were issues around our perception around competence. The Labour MP for York Central, Rachael Maskell, who retained her seat, insisted it wasn\u2019t just Corbyn who should take responsibility for Labour\u2019s defeat. We\u2019ve all got to take responsibility but I don\u2019t think apportioning blame to a complex situation in a simplistic way is really the way to approach this, we\u2019ve got to understand what is really happening across our political system. The Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme a little earlier. He said that whether or not the Tories can achieve a political declaration with zero tariffs on goods between the UK and the EU \u201cdepends on whether the Tory party is, again, able to face up to its own contradictions\u201d. They want the deepest possible access to the European single market, yet they want to undercut significantly EU legislation, and you can\u2019t have both. So either you want total regulatory freedom and you do whatever you like \u2013 and if you want to undercut EU legislation then you do it, but then you lose access. Or you want access and you have basically to remain aligned with EU legislation. That will be the decision that Boris Johnson will need to make. Raoul Ruparel, who was Theresa May\u2019s special adviser on Europe during her time as prime minister, told the programme it would be possible to reach a deal with the EU next year but \u201cthe short time frame does limit the level of ambition\u201d. I think it is possible to get a free trade agreement in place that looks at quite standard provisions on level playing fields, such as the type that the EU have done with other countries, and also offers zero tariffs. But I think what it\u2019s harder to do, is what Philippe Lamberts was alluding to, is removing the regulatory barriers and the checks behind the border which would require some level of alignment of rules. And I think at the moment, despite his large majority, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the sort of deal that Boris Johnson envisages, and it\u2019s something that he\u2019s consistently fought against. On the possibility of a no-deal Brexit if the UK fails to reach an agreement by the end of next year, he said: I think it is possible to get something done in the next year but I think the short time frame does limit the level of ambition potentially, because you would be looking at a narrower and shallower deal than you might have otherwise envisaged given the speed needed. Here is what the European papers had to say yesterday about the election result: Michael Heseltine, the Europhile Tory grandee who urged voters to back the Liberal Democrats in the election, has admitted that the remain position on European Union membership has lost and declared that he thinks the debate is over for at least a generation. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the remain cause was over, Lord Heseltine answered: Well, we have lost. Let\u2019s not muck about with the language. We have lost. Brexit is going to happen and we have to live with it. I\u2019ve made my views pretty clear and there will now be a long period of uncertainty, but you can\u2019t escape from that so we must do the best we can. Asked if he would ever campaign for the UK to rejoin the EU, Heseltine said no. I don\u2019t think that battle has gone, but it won\u2019t be my generation, it will be 20 years or something before the thing is once again raised as an issue. And, of course, you can\u2019t escape the devastating results on Scotland and Northern Ireland, so the agenda is not going away. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has written in today\u2019s Telegraph, saying he will \u201cnot [be] too far away from the action\u201d, after his party failed to win any seats in the general election. He said the Conservative party\u2019s 80-seat majority was an \u201coverwhelming mandate ... to get Brexit done\u201d, and that he was now concerned with the form of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc, rather than whether it would happen at all. The truth is that the threat from the Brexit party, together with the influence of the European Research Group in parliament, has disappeared for the time being. Questions over the future shape of Brexit and Britain\u2019s place in the world are now entirely in the hands of Johnson. With half of his cabinet having voted remain, and substantial global pressures on him, it will be tempting for him to pursue the easy option of a soft Brexit. The Brexit party contested 273 seats in this election. They took 2% of votes but won no seats. Farage continued: Having endured three elections in the last 30 months, let us hope the country can look forward to a prolonged period of political stability and certainty. Whatever happens over the coming months, I will make sure I am not too far away from the action. The fact is that if Brexit does not \u2018get done\u2019, as Johnson has promised repeatedly over the last six weeks, pressure will have to be reapplied. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s politics live blog. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be bringing you all of the day\u2019s political news in the wake of yesterday\u2019s general election result. Boris Johnson is set to embark on a whirlwind tour of northern seats taken by the Conservatives in the election, in which he secured an 80-seat majority. It\u2019s been reported that he could visit Tony Blair\u2019s former seat of Sedgefield in the north-east, which had been held by Labour since 1935 prior to the poll. In a speech outside No 10 on Friday, Johnson said he would \u201cwork round the clock\u201d to repay the trust of those who voted Conservative for the first time, including those whose \u201cpencils may have wavered over the ballot and who heard the voices of their parents and their grandparents whispering anxiously in their ears\u201d. Appearing on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight last night, the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the government would look to redirect investment towards those communities that felt they were not being heard.

The story goes that \u201cTed\u201d, the presumed alter ego of company founder Ray Kelvin, got the idea for a global brand \u201cwhile fishing\u201d in 1987. And he never looked back.</p> <p>UK consumers were drawn to his quirky sense of humour and style, and wanted to buy his sexy dresses and dapper suits. One store in Glasgow became two, with a listing in the late 1990s leading to global stardom and product spinoffs ranging from homewares to perfume and sunglasses.</p> <p>But now Ted is in trouble. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/04/ted-baker-boss-ray-kelvin-quits\" title=\"\">Kelvin is gone</a> \u2013 forced out after being accused of presiding over<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/02/ted-baker-staff-complain-forced-hugs-company-founder-ray-kelvin\" title=\"\"> a regime of \u201cforced hugs\u201d and harassment</a>, which he denies \u2013 and last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/10/ted-baker-chief-quits-profits-fashion-retailer#img-1\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/10/ted-baker-chief-quits-profits-fashion-retailer#img-1\" title=\"\">chairman and chief executive quit too </a>after a dramatic plunge in profits. Now a City investor whose nickname is \u201cthe Rottweiler\u201d is on Ted\u2019s case.</p> <p>So where did it all go wrong? The brand was once an unusually reliable British growth story, cracking the difficult US market and appealing almost equally to both men and women. It has 200 shops and department store concessions in the UK and more than 350 others dotted around the world.</p> <p>The company, which had been Kelvin\u2019s fiefdom, is now rudderless. Its chairman, David Bernstein, has quit and chief executive Lindsay Page \u2013 the founder\u2019s long-time lieutenant, who stepped up when he left \u2013 is also going. The situation is made worse by other senior departures, including retail director Chris Browne and womenswear boss Catherine Scorey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-13T16:58:18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Ted Baker share price\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-13T16:58:18/embed.html\">Ted Baker share price</a> </figure>  <p>Those who have followed Ted Baker\u2019s fortunes closely say the brand was misfiring at home before the complaints about Kelvin were revealed in the<em> Observer</em> last year. Sales in its established UK and European stores began falling in 2017 and sales of this year\u2019s spring and summer womenswear collections \u2013 which 64-year-old Kelvin had overseen \u2013 were particularly bad. A new design team then took over but its winter ranges are judged to have missed the mark in important areas such as coats.</p> <p>John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, said: \u201cIt was not a case of Ray left and suddenly the wheels fell off. This was absolutely happening under his watch. The whole team had been there for decades and so there was not much injection of new blood to change their thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Ted Baker is also accused of failing to adapt quickly enough to the vogue for casual dressing, sticking with its formula of graphic floral prints and dressy office- and occasionwear.</p> <p>Emily Salter, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cThe brand has a very distinctive style that has not necessarily been keeping up with the latest fashions, such as Scandi minimalism.\u201d It would not be able to make a radical shift towards casual dressing, given its focus on tailoring, but she suggested more subtle changes on price and range could work: \u201cThey could attract shoppers from Karen Millen and Coast, which are now only trading online. Some people are not willing to buy expensive occasionwear from a website.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7720e6cfd2e71b6657496b6e0581a55a62eb63f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7720e6cfd2e71b6657496b6e0581a55a62eb63f6/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Ray Kelvin\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camera-shy founder Ray Kelvin, who invented \u2018Ted Baker\u2019 as an alter ego.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A senior fashion industry insider said the departure of Kelvin only accelerated the brand\u2019s difficulties, as he left both a power vacuum and a creative vacuum. \u201cThe business was Ray. Ted was his alter ego and for a long time they have done everything brilliantly. If you take Ray out, you take the essence of the business out. I don\u2019t think Ray could have stopped it, but perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have collapsed as it quickly as it has.\u201d</p> <p>At a time when cheap online fashion brands such as Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing are riding high, Ted Baker\u2019s prices \u2013 with most dresses and suit trousers priced at over \u00a3100 and jackets at over \u00a3200 \u2013 look dangerously out of kilter. Another criticism is that a brand famed for inventive marketing campaigns \u2013 which included a Guy Ritchie-produced film \u2013 has not capitalised on social media.</p> <p>The dire trading means Ted Baker could be close to maxing out its \u00a3180m of borrowings and may have to raise funds by selling new shares or assets. Its London HQ is on the market, as the company thinks a sale and leaseback deal could raise \u00a360m.</p> <p>Last week, in what was the company\u2019s fourth profit warning of the year, the retailer warned it could make as little as \u00a35m this year, which is a tenth of 2018\u2019s haul. The profits collapse has had a dramatic impact on the company\u2019s stock market value, with the shares \u2013 which were changing hands for \u00a321 in January \u2013 now worth less than \u00a34.</p> <p>The low share price is now attracting opportunistic investors. Last week, Toscafund \u2013 whose founder, Martin Hughes, is nicknamed the \u201cRottweiler\u201d for his tenacity and strongarm tactics with target companies \u2013 doubled its stake in the company to nearly 12%. The multimillion-pound gamble is a bet on the brand, which many investors hope can weather this crisis. Ted Baker is now very closely held, with Kelvin owning 35% and more than a quarter of the rest of the shares split between three investors \u2013 Schroders, Threadneedle and Toscafund.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People say there is nothing toxic about the brand itself. It\u2019s just simply lost its way</p> <footer> <cite>John Stevenson, analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not clear if these players would be willing to back a takeover. But any buyer would have to have a management team ready to parachute in, and a clear turnaround plan after a period of massive upheaval. One experienced dealmaker says a lot depends on whether investors believe the retail sector will have a better year in 2020: \u201cIf things are going to improve, then it looks cheap.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes likes to invest in companies \u201cin times of trouble\u201d and \u201cprovide advisory support\u201d. His presence could add to pressure for swift change. While his shareholder activism has mostly gone on behind closed doors, he\u2019s not afraid of open conflict.</p> <p>Stevenson says investors are prepared to give the company time: \u201cPeople say there is nothing toxic about the brand itself. It\u2019s just simply lost its way. The business has historically generated a lot of profit. The attraction is the potential for a turnaround. Even after all the problems there\u2019s still a solid underlying business. People are not anti the brand.\u201d</p> <p>One former employee said: \u201cIt is definitely redeemable. I think the City underestimates how tough this market is. The volatility has hit everyone and it was Ted\u2019s turn.\u201d</p> <p>But the fashion industry insider believes turning Ted Baker around in the public eye will be very tricky without the inspiration of its founder. With all retailers under pressure from low consumer confidence and rising costs, there is little room for mistakes: \u201cIn this environment it will be bloody hard.\u201d</p>",

Kelvin is gone \u2013 forced out after being accused of presiding over a regime of \u201cforced hugs\u201d and harassment, which he denies \u2013 and last week the chairman and chief executive quit too after a dramatic plunge in profits. Now a City investor whose nickname is \u201cthe Rottweiler\u201d is on Ted\u2019s case. So where did it all go wrong? The brand was once an unusually reliable British growth story, cracking the difficult US market and appealing almost equally to both men and women. It has 200 shops and department store concessions in the UK and more than 350 others dotted around the world. The company, which had been Kelvin\u2019s fiefdom, is now rudderless. Its chairman, David Bernstein, has quit and chief executive Lindsay Page \u2013 the founder\u2019s long-time lieutenant, who stepped up when he left \u2013 is also going. The situation is made worse by other senior departures, including retail director Chris Browne and womenswear boss Catherine Scorey. Those who have followed Ted Baker\u2019s fortunes closely say the brand was misfiring at home before the complaints about Kelvin were revealed in the Observer last year. Sales in its established UK and European stores began falling in 2017 and sales of this year\u2019s spring and summer womenswear collections \u2013 which 64-year-old Kelvin had overseen \u2013 were particularly bad. A new design team then took over but its winter ranges are judged to have missed the mark in important areas such as coats. John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, said: \u201cIt was not a case of Ray left and suddenly the wheels fell off. This was absolutely happening under his watch. The whole team had been there for decades and so there was not much injection of new blood to change their thinking.\u201d Ted Baker is also accused of failing to adapt quickly enough to the vogue for casual dressing, sticking with its formula of graphic floral prints and dressy office- and occasionwear. Emily Salter, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cThe brand has a very distinctive style that has not necessarily been keeping up with the latest fashions, such as Scandi minimalism.\u201d It would not be able to make a radical shift towards casual dressing, given its focus on tailoring, but she suggested more subtle changes on price and range could work: \u201cThey could attract shoppers from Karen Millen and Coast, which are now only trading online. Some people are not willing to buy expensive occasionwear from a website.\u201d A senior fashion industry insider said the departure of Kelvin only accelerated the brand\u2019s difficulties, as he left both a power vacuum and a creative vacuum. \u201cThe business was Ray. Ted was his alter ego and for a long time they have done everything brilliantly. If you take Ray out, you take the essence of the business out. I don\u2019t think Ray could have stopped it, but perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have collapsed as it quickly as it has.\u201d At a time when cheap online fashion brands such as Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing are riding high, Ted Baker\u2019s prices \u2013 with most dresses and suit trousers priced at over \u00a3100 and jackets at over \u00a3200 \u2013 look dangerously out of kilter. Another criticism is that a brand famed for inventive marketing campaigns \u2013 which included a Guy Ritchie-produced film \u2013 has not capitalised on social media. The dire trading means Ted Baker could be close to maxing out its \u00a3180m of borrowings and may have to raise funds by selling new shares or assets. Its London HQ is on the market, as the company thinks a sale and leaseback deal could raise \u00a360m. Last week, in what was the company\u2019s fourth profit warning of the year, the retailer warned it could make as little as \u00a35m this year, which is a tenth of 2018\u2019s haul. The profits collapse has had a dramatic impact on the company\u2019s stock market value, with the shares \u2013 which were changing hands for \u00a321 in January \u2013 now worth less than \u00a34. The low share price is now attracting opportunistic investors. Last week, Toscafund \u2013 whose founder, Martin Hughes, is nicknamed the \u201cRottweiler\u201d for his tenacity and strongarm tactics with target companies \u2013 doubled its stake in the company to nearly 12%. The multimillion-pound gamble is a bet on the brand, which many investors hope can weather this crisis. Ted Baker is now very closely held, with Kelvin owning 35% and more than a quarter of the rest of the shares split between three investors \u2013 Schroders, Threadneedle and Toscafund. It\u2019s not clear if these players would be willing to back a takeover. But any buyer would have to have a management team ready to parachute in, and a clear turnaround plan after a period of massive upheaval. One experienced dealmaker says a lot depends on whether investors believe the retail sector will have a better year in 2020: \u201cIf things are going to improve, then it looks cheap.\u201d Hughes likes to invest in companies \u201cin times of trouble\u201d and \u201cprovide advisory support\u201d. His presence could add to pressure for swift change. While his shareholder activism has mostly gone on behind closed doors, he\u2019s not afraid of open conflict. Stevenson says investors are prepared to give the company time: \u201cPeople say there is nothing toxic about the brand itself. It\u2019s just simply lost its way. The business has historically generated a lot of profit. The attraction is the potential for a turnaround. Even after all the problems there\u2019s still a solid underlying business. People are not anti the brand.\u201d One former employee said: \u201cIt is definitely redeemable. I think the City underestimates how tough this market is. The volatility has hit everyone and it was Ted\u2019s turn.\u201d But the fashion industry insider believes turning Ted Baker around in the public eye will be very tricky without the inspiration of its founder. With all retailers under pressure from low consumer confidence and rising costs, there is little room for mistakes: \u201cIn this environment it will be bloody hard.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Two goals by John Fleck and a botched penalty by Jack Grealish decided this match and, more broadly, encapsulated the different paths these clubs have taken since promotion. Ten months ago they met in the Championship but now Chris Wilder\u2019s men are in the early jostling for European qualification while Villa are in danger of dropping back into the second tier.</p> <p>Villa have lost six of their last eight games and need to reverse that form quickly. After Tuesday\u2019s Carabao Cup quarter-final against an improvised Liverpool team they will resume their quest for Premier League survival by facing Southampton, Norwich and Watford before New Year. They had better not play like they did here.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m annoyed because we\u2019re better than we showed,\u201d said Dean Smith. \u201cWe never managed the ball as well as we could have with the cultured players we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>One reason why United have coped better in the top flight is that Wilder has had to make fewer changes than Smith since promotion. Villa, after a summer of heavy investment, began here with only two of the players who featured in the draw between these sides in February, whereas United started with eight survivors from that game. Not all of Villa\u2019s recent additions have thrived, with Wesley, low both on confidence and useful service, looking forlorn here before being withdrawn in the 70th minute when Villa were in urgent need of a goal. \u201cHe took a whack in the lower back and I thought Jonathan Kodjia deserved an opportunity,\u201d Smith said.</p> <p>United, by contrast, are a team with exceptional cohesion and no obvious shortcomings. For all that, the first half here was appalling, like a re-creation of some skirmish from the nether leagues. Neither goalkeeper had a shot to save.</p> <p>John Lundstram did poke an effort towards goal before the break but it was blocked by Kortney Hause.

      "bodyText": "Two goals by John Fleck and a botched penalty by Jack Grealish decided this match and, more broadly, encapsulated the different paths these clubs have taken since promotion. Ten months ago they met in the Championship but now Chris Wilder\u2019s men are in the early jostling for European qualification while Villa are in danger of dropping back into the second tier. Villa have lost six of their last eight games and need to reverse that form quickly. After Tuesday\u2019s Carabao Cup quarter-final against an improvised Liverpool team they will resume their quest for Premier League survival by facing Southampton, Norwich and Watford before New Year. They had better not play like they did here. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed because we\u2019re better than we showed,\u201d said Dean Smith. \u201cWe never managed the ball as well as we could have with the cultured players we\u2019ve got.\u201d One reason why United have coped better in the top flight is that Wilder has had to make fewer changes than Smith since promotion. Villa, after a summer of heavy investment, began here with only two of the players who featured in the draw between these sides in February, whereas United started with eight survivors from that game. Not all of Villa\u2019s recent additions have thrived, with Wesley, low both on confidence and useful service, looking forlorn here before being withdrawn in the 70th minute when Villa were in urgent need of a goal. \u201cHe took a whack in the lower back and I thought Jonathan Kodjia deserved an opportunity,\u201d Smith said. United, by contrast, are a team with exceptional cohesion and no obvious shortcomings. For all that, the first half here was appalling, like a re-creation of some skirmish from the nether leagues. Neither goalkeeper had a shot to save. John Lundstram did poke an effort towards goal before the break but it was blocked by Kortney Hause. That intervention may not have been necessary because it was questionable whether the shot from 16 yards had enough power to make it as far as the goal but at least the defender was well positioned, which was worth noting as the 24-year-old was making his Premier League debut in the absence of the injured Tyrone Mings. Given how Villa were torn apart by Leicester last week, Smith took a measure of satisfaction from how few chances his team gave up in the first half here, even if that was partly down to United being uncharacteristically slipshod. Villa\u2019s attacking was lamentable. Henri Lansbury, making his first league start of the season, made little impact while Grealish and John McGinn were unusually quiet.

It is no surprise that the notion, never entirely convincing given Liverpool\u2019s steely excellence, of another title-winning fairytale has come to seem too far-fetched but they might have expected the dream to perpetuate for at least another week. Instead their winning run was halted by a Norwich side who completely deserved their draw and arguably had the better opportunities to win, retaining a threat even when Leicester found some sort of stride after half-time.</p> <p>Norwich had taken the lead through Teemu Pukki\u2019s latest ice-cool finish and, in a strange way, even the manner of the home side\u2019s equaliser spoke to their afternoon\u2019s frustration. Jamie Vardy had scored in eight consecutive league games, a burst of form in line with that streak of Leicester victories, and thought he had made it nine when he met James Maddison\u2019s corner and saw his header flash into the net via Tim Krul\u2019s hand. But the Norwich keeper had actually made the crucial touch, diverting the ball goalwards when it had been heading wide, and Vardy\u2019s hopes of nearing his 11-game record from 2015-16 disappeared despite a number of subsequent efforts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ve ever spoken about,\u201d Brendan Rodgers said when asked about the receding prospect of challenging Liverpool, now 10 points clear, for first place. \u201cI think everyone else has. The players have been brilliant; it says everything that we\u2019ve drawn a game and everyone\u2019s disappointed. We weren\u2019t quite at our level today but we\u2019ve still managed to get a point.\u201d</p> <p>They were so far short in the first half that by the interval Rodgers had ripped up his gameplan and turned a narrow 4-3-1-2 formation into a 4-3-3. Norwich were much the better side over the first half-hour, once they had got over an early scare in which Krul fumbled Youri Tielemans\u2019 shot against an upright, and they should have scored when Pukki could not quite make decisive contact with Max Aarons\u2019 delivery after a slick move had sliced Leicester open.</p> <p>Pukki did get it right in the 26th minute although Rodgers will have been perplexed by the way a simple pass from Tom Trybull cut through their entire midfield, giving Emi Buend\u00eda all the space he needed in front of the back four. His slide-rule ball for Pukki was a peach, weighted just well enough to meet the striker\u2019s run past Caglar Soyuncu. The finish, rolled across a rooted Kasper Schmeichel, was customarily outstanding.</p> <p>It turned out Pukki, who could have scored a winner in the dying minutes had Soyuncu and Ricardo Pereira not made last-ditch challenges when he twice got away, finished the game nursing a broken toe. \u201cHe\u2019s from Finland so I\u2019m not too concerned,\u201d said Daniel Farke, who does not expect Pukki to miss any matches and cannot afford him to. Pukki has nine Premier League goals this season and it is hardly outlandish to suggest his smart runs and precise shooting may be the difference between relegation and a successful campaign.</p> <p>Norwich may need him less if they could kick their habit of undoing so much work with maddeningly simple concessions. Maddison, their former player, may be an outstanding operator at set-plays but his delivery and Vardy\u2019s peeled run were hardly intricate stuff and at that point it seemed Leicester would clear their heads and push on. Immediately after the equaliser Rodgers replaced Kelechi Iheanacho, abruptly ending the forward\u2019s mini-renaissance, and introduced Demarai Gray. Being hauled off in the first half is never a good look and Rodgers insisted it was a tactical move, to facilitate the formation switch, rather than a response to a flashpoint that occurred shortly before Vardy scored.</p> <p>Norwich felt entitled to receive the ball back when Tom Trybull, aware Buend\u00eda was down, knocked it out for a Leicester throw-in. But Iheanacho, failing to get the memo on receiving possession, surged towards the penalty area and was halted only by Christoph Zimmermann\u2019s foul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf7053faecdce270901b96168990fd50f2d69020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf7053faecdce270901b96168990fd50f2d69020/0_0_2710_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norwich City\u2019s Teemu Pukki fires home to open the scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norwich City\u2019s Teemu Pukki fires home to open the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that the danger had passed, half of Norwich\u2019s players piled in furiously on Iheanacho.

The tagline that literally no one was talking about was: \u201cIt\u2019s time for real change.\u201d To be fair to Labour, it was a promise clearly delivered, with the party helping to achieve the once impossible spectacle of a Tory MP in Blyth Valley. Real change indeed! Strategy of the night It\u2019s that point in the political cycle when all decisions taken by the winning side are reinterpreted as being works of strategic genius. According to this logic, Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to use a mop, confiscation of a journalist\u2019s phone and recourse to hiding in a fridge suddenly became inspired moves that captured the zeitgeist. Expect more MPs to opt to shelter in white goods next time around. Indeed, several Labour MPs have already offered Jeremy Corbyn a place in their freezer.

While it could not yet give an exact figure, a spokesperson confirmed that hundreds of people have got in touch to set up a monthly donation or make a one-off payment.</p> <p>The boost in support comes as many across the country have expressed despair at the Conservatives, who have overseen nearly a decade of deep cuts to public services since they came to power in 2010, winning the election.</p> <p>The impact of austerity has been clear and well-documented: latest figures show that a child becomes homeless in Britain <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_releases/articles/a_child_becomes_homeless_in_britain_every_eight_minutes\">every eight minutes</a>, and the estimated number of people who died homeless has increased by 51% between 2013 and 2018. Furthermore, 800,000 more children from working households are living in poverty since 2010, and food bank use has risen by 23% in the last year.</p> <p>Emma Revie, the chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said: \u201cWe\u2019re overwhelmed by the wave of support we\u2019ve seen. Thank you so much to everyone who has been donating \u2013 we\u2019re incredibly grateful. We know we can reach a future where no one needs a food bank, but we can\u2019t do it alone. We must work together \u2013 this can change.\u201d</p> <p>Sandra Horley CBE, the chief executive of Refuge, said: \u201cNow that the general election is behind us, we implore the incoming Conservative government to work on addressing violence against women and girls. The government needs to make this a priority and commit funds and resources to doing so.</p> <p>\u201cSurvivors have waited too long already. The domestic abuse bill, which was lost due to the snap election, needs to be quickly reinstated and strengthened to be a truly transformative piece of legislation.</p> <p>\u201cWe need an immediate commitment to new funds for refuges, which face closure up and down the country. No woman or child should be turned away when they seek help, survivors need to know that help and support is there for them.\u201d</p>",

Shelter, Refuge, the Trussell Trust and the Biscuit Fund have all confirmed they have seen a sharp increase in donations and/or registered supporters as a result of the election outcome. While unable to give exact numbers, the UK homelessness and housing charity Shelter said it had seen an increase in the number of people signing up as supporters since the result. Refuge, which helps victims of domestic abuse, said there had been a 52% increase in donations since polling closed, from \u00a3144 an hour to \u00a3220 an hour. The Biscuit Fund, which raises money to provide in-need families with supplies ranging from fridges to food hampers amid welfare cuts, said it had also had a considerable boost in support. Between Friday and Saturday, the charity has received almost \u00a33,000 in donations \u2013 a number that a spokesperson has described as \u201csignificant and very welcome\u201d. The UK\u2019s largest food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, said it had been \u201coverwhelmed\u201d following a huge uplift in donations. While it could not yet give an exact figure, a spokesperson confirmed that hundreds of people have got in touch to set up a monthly donation or make a one-off payment. The boost in support comes as many across the country have expressed despair at the Conservatives, who have overseen nearly a decade of deep cuts to public services since they came to power in 2010, winning the election. The impact of austerity has been clear and well-documented: latest figures show that a child becomes homeless in Britain every eight minutes, and the estimated number of people who died homeless has increased by 51% between 2013 and 2018. Furthermore, 800,000 more children from working households are living in poverty since 2010, and food bank use has risen by 23% in the last year. Emma Revie, the chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said: \u201cWe\u2019re overwhelmed by the wave of support we\u2019ve seen. Thank you so much to everyone who has been donating \u2013 we\u2019re incredibly grateful. We know we can reach a future where no one needs a food bank, but we can\u2019t do it alone. We must work together \u2013 this can change.\u201d Sandra Horley CBE, the chief executive of Refuge, said: \u201cNow that the general election is behind us, we implore the incoming Conservative government to work on addressing violence against women and girls. The government needs to make this a priority and commit funds and resources to doing so. \u201cSurvivors have waited too long already. The domestic abuse bill, which was lost due to the snap election, needs to be quickly reinstated and strengthened to be a truly transformative piece of legislation. \u201cWe need an immediate commitment to new funds for refuges, which face closure up and down the country. No woman or child should be turned away when they seek help, survivors need to know that help and support is there for them.\u201d",

In 1966, she became headmistress of Oxford High School for girls, which is a very striking thing for an academic who really loves her subject, and wrote more than 20 books on it, to take on. Later, she went back into the university world. Her career was constrained, not in any way that she resented, by the fact that her husband, Geoffrey Warnock, was also a prominent philosopher, who later became vice chancellor of Oxford University, so she felt that he needed quite a lot of support, and I suspect some of her moves and reversals reflected that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are many people who would not be alive today, but for the approach it took to IVF</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The next I became aware of Mary was when she chaired the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology in the 1980s. It\u2019s difficult now to remember how fraught this was. The key moral issue in many people\u2019s minds was that the early embryo is a person, so you can\u2019t be complicit in its destruction. But it\u2019s not very easy to see how you do IVF without first doing the experimental work, and then the further work that\u2019s needed with each procedure to discover whether a particular embryo is viable. These were the most delicate moral questions, and what Mary is rightly celebrated for is that she took them so seriously, listened well \u2013 that was her great gift, I think \u2013 and conducted a very long, slow and effective process which ended up in the human fertilisation and embryology system that we now have. It\u2019s been amended a couple of times, but it\u2019s a piece of legislation that has stood the test of time and is widely envied.</p> <p>I next met her in the House of Lords where she was a fellow crossbencher and we would always have a good chat.

While a lot of Oxford philosophy in that generation was extremely influenced by AJ Ayer and logical positivism, Mary Warnock, like Iris Murdoch, wrote on existentialism. They were interested in the virtues, in the imagination, in what we now call action theory, and were very removed from the positivistic culture that dominated in Oxford at the time.</p> <p>What Mary will be most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/22/mary-warnock-britain-ruling-class-thatcher-patriotism-serving-society\">remembered for</a>, though, is her contribution to public life. Most public reports have limited effect, but her report on fertilisation and embryology has had a profound influence. There are many people who would not be alive today, but for the approach it took to IVF. It is fascinating to think that one person, by being reasonable and a good listener, can have such an impact.</p>",

While a lot of Oxford philosophy in that generation was extremely influenced by AJ Ayer and logical positivism, Mary Warnock, like Iris Murdoch, wrote on existentialism. They were interested in the virtues, in the imagination, in what we now call action theory, and were very removed from the positivistic culture that dominated in Oxford at the time. What Mary will be most remembered for, though, is her contribution to public life. Most public reports have limited effect, but her report on fertilisation and embryology has had a profound influence. There are many people who would not be alive today, but for the approach it took to IVF. It is fascinating to think that one person, by being reasonable and a good listener, can have such an impact.",

When Larry met Sergey Nick Carr\u2019s blog Larry and Sergey: A Valediction is a living obituary of Google\u2019s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who have stepped down from managing the monster they created. Go slow, wunderkinds Guess what? Young people don\u2019t make the best entrepreneurs. A heartening article, for oldies anyway, by Jeffrey Tucker on the website of the American Institute for Economic Research.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1. Tesla\u2019s cybertruck will not ship</strong></h2> <p>This is an easy prediction to make, because even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla\" title=\"\">Tesla</a> isn\u2019t claiming that its eye-catching <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck\" title=\"\">angular steel beast</a> will be available for sale in 2020. The company\u2019s own pitch is that production won\u2019t even begin until 2021, with owners receiving their first shipments in 2022. But the gap is relevant to Tesla\u2019s future: where the company was once genuinely ahead of the curve, in making beautiful electric cars that people wanted to buy, it has increasingly relied on beating its competitors to announcements, rather than actually shipping. The list of Elon Musk\u2019s as-yet-unfulfilled promises grows every year \u2013 but the electric fleets of BMW, Ford, General Motors and others grow faster.</p> <h2><strong>2. Google\u2019s Duplex won\u2019t come to Europe</strong></h2> <p>One of the most impressive, and futuristic, products to have come from Google in recent years, <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html\" title=\"\">Duplex</a> is an AI assistant that can make calls to local businesses on your behalf to do things like book appointments and find out opening times. The tool was criticised when the company first revealed it, for being so good that its use could plausibly be described as \u201cdeceptive\u201d: the AI assistant even injects \u201cum\u201d and \u201cer\u201d into speech to sound more human. That, combined with the difficulties of gaining consent for receiving an automated cold call, means that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/what-is-gdpr-and-how-will-it-affect-you\" title=\"\">GDPR</a> might well keep the technology from European shores for years to come.</p> <h2><strong>3. Advertising will come to smart speakers</strong></h2> <p>Amazon and Google comfortably dominate the smart speaker landscape, but neither has yet answered an important question: what\u2019s the advantage of getting all these devices in homes? Aggressive price cuts mean that neither is making a substantial amount of income from sales, and the absence of paid services means that they aren\u2019t taking a glorious 30% cut of revenue either. Amazon has long experimented with using Alexa as a retail channel, but the only way to really make millions is by delivering sweet, sweet advertising to the ears of your customers. Expect the dial to be turned up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1cf7df50b694c0b702cfe0e19bc31c85ae8444a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1cf7df50b694c0b702cfe0e19bc31c85ae8444a/0_391_4352_2611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social media star Noen Eubanks records a video for TikTok - one of the few apps to break through to the mainstream in recent years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Social media star Noen Eubanks records a video for TikTok - one of the few apps to break through to the mainstream in recent years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexis Gross/New York Times/Redux/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4. 5G will be meaningful</strong></h2> <p>For Brits, 5G is technically here already, with multiple networks offering the ultrafast mobile standard in denser urban areas. But there are few devices that support the new standard yet \u2013 and fewer still that are acceptable to the gadget-obsessed early adopters who would otherwise be first on board, since the flagship devices from manufacturers such as Samsung, Google and Apple continue to be 4G only. That will change in 2020, when you can expect hardware like the Pixel 5, iPhone 12 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S11 to support the faster connections.</p> <h2><strong>5. Your home</strong><strong>screen will still look the same</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been years since any consumer app broke through into the mainstream \u2013 with an honourable exception for <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\" title=\"\">TikTok</a> among the under-25s \u2013 and that trend shows no real sign of curving upwards in 2020. Between the dominance of default apps from Apple and Google, and the ability of the major platforms to acquire, clone or kill upstart competitors, it\u2019s a hard time to be a consumer software company. Harder still to become one of the 28 who get a coveted spot on a typical user\u2019s homescreen, rather than being buried in a folder.</p> <h2><strong>6. Facebook will kill Portal</strong></h2> <p>It was always hubristic for Facebook to release an Echo competitor. The company had no real expertise in building hardware, nor an obvious strategy for getting its products to market: it may own the world\u2019s most valuable advertising real estate, but it\u2019s not a store. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica broke</a>, and Portal went from a bold idea to a bad one. Who would want to put an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/12/would-you-have-a-facebook-portal-camera-in-your-house-me-neither\" title=\"\">always-on microphone</a> connected directly to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Facebook-HQ-166793820034304/\" title=\"\">Menlo Park</a> in their homes? The answer, it seems, is \u201cnot many people\u201d, because Portal sales have reportedly been minuscule. A second iteration was squeezed out earlier this year; don\u2019t expect a third.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6a94165816994c95672eb6de1370dfd388bf9f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a94165816994c95672eb6de1370dfd388bf9f2/10_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gameplay from Half-Life: Alyx.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gameplay from Half-Life: Alyx.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Half Life Alyx</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7. VR will have a second mini-boom \u2013 thanks to one game</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/virtual-reality\" title=\"\">Virtual </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/virtual-reality\" title=\"\">reality</a> has been the \u201cnext big thing\u201d for five years, and has been a big thing for precisely none of those. But just when it was on its way out, there\u2019s the potential for one last flurry of attention, thanks to the work of PC gaming company Valve. The company announced <a href=\"https://www.half-life.com/en/home\" title=\"\">a new edition</a> of its beloved <em>Half-Life</em> series, the first since 2007, would be exclusive to its VR headset. There have been few titles that can encourage non-believers to spend the thousands required to get high-quality VR at home, but <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/22/valve-reveals-vr-exclusive-game-half-life-alyx\" title=\"\">Half-Life: Alyx</a></em> is one. Whether it sparks a lasting resurgence, or just a final flash in the pan, remains to be seen.</p> <h2><strong>8. Amazon\u2019s Alexa expansion will slip</strong></h2> <p>Alexa has been coming to new products at an impressive clip. Amazon has incorporated its voice assistant into almost every gadget it makes, and a good few it doesn\u2019t. But, even though voice assistants remain popular among their devotees, privacy concerns are only growing among the cohort of refuseniks who want nothing to do with always-on microphones. If Ford, for instance, starts losing out on sales because of an overly ambitious plan to put Alexa in everything, you can be certain they\u2019ll reassess that integration rapidly.</p> <h2><strong>9. We won\u2019t hear about Apple\u2019s </strong><strong>smart </strong><strong>glass or </strong><strong>car</strong></h2> <p>The two worst-kept secrets in technology are Apple\u2019s biggest experimental projects: a pair of augmented-reality glasses and a self-driving car, both being developed in Cupertino. The glasses have a path to release, and references to them in the code for Apple products have started showing up in beta tests and other leaks. The car, for now, has no existence outside of a few offices in Sunnyvale and some suspicious hires from companies like Tesla. But, at the earliest, the glasses won\u2019t hit shelves until 2021, and Apple is always wary about pre-announcing things.</p> <h2><strong>10. The console wars will restart with a vengeance</strong></h2> <p>Video gaming has been quiet for the past few years. With Xbox Ones and PlayStation 4s in houses across the nation, Microsoft and Sony turned their attention to intra-generational upgrades and cheaper models designed to be a second console. Nintendo took a different path, releasing the Switch and upending what a home console could be. And <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\" title=\"\">Fortnite</a></em> rendered the whole thing moot anyway, as the most popular game in the world worked on every console, PCs, and even mobile phones. But 2020 will see the launch of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/dec/13/microsoft-names-its-new-games-console-xbox-series-x\">new Xbox</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/16/playstation-5-sony-ps5-first-details-of-its-next-generation-console\">new Playstation</a>, a new <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/halo\" title=\"\">Halo</a></em> and a new <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/09/the-last-of-us-review\" title=\"\">Last of Us</a></em> \u2013 and the return to playgrounds nationwide of tiresome debates about which is better.</p> <h2><strong>11. Google could gain from article 13</strong></h2> <p>While the European Union was hammering out the details of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market\" title=\"\">2019\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market\" title=\"\">copyright </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market\" title=\"\">directive</a>, Google began one of its largest lobbying efforts to date. The company was incensed by two proposals \u2013 articles 13 and 15 of the draft bill \u2013 which it dubbed the \u201cupload filter\u201d and the \u201clink tax\u201d. Passage of the directive, it implied, could result in the end of YouTube in Europe for good. It mobilised thousands of YouTubers in opposition, and sparked group hysteria among tween fandoms on Instagram and elsewhere. While individual nations ratify the legislation, expect more protest and legal challenges, but ultimately Google may gain from article 13: after all, they are well placed to build and license the content filters required to police copyrighted material.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"291cdb35f8919946e94c3cd36928675b28cbc8fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/291cdb35f8919946e94c3cd36928675b28cbc8fc/25_0_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyber warfare specialists in the US Air Force run a test mission.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyber warfare specialists in the US Air Force run a test mission.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Air Force/Capt Carrie Kessler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>12. AI will be mobilised in cyberwar</strong></h2> <p>Simon Shooter, a partner at law firm Bird &amp; Bird, predicts that 2020 will see \u201cthe escalation of the cyberwar, with AI in use on both sides of the divide\u201d. Hackers have long been experimenting with automatic tools for breaking into and exploiting corporate and government networks, but the need to stay undetectable has limited the use of AI in practice. As the cyber cold war heats up, however, that could change.</p> <h2><strong>13. Cool China</strong></h2> <p>The rise of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\" title=\"\">TikTok</a> may have concerned the adults in the room, who see the company\u2019s role in exporting Beijing\u2019s censorship and slow adoption of child protection standards as reasons for caution. But among the younger generation, it could have the opposite effect, cementing a perception of China as the home of cool products and services. Who would win if that happened? \u201cThe success of TikTok will not have gone unnoticed by Tencent, which owns WeChat,\u201d says <a href=\"https://thesocialelement.agency/our-people/\" title=\"\">Tamara Littleton</a>, CEO at social media agency the Social Element. \u201cIt has struggled to gain traction in other countries\u2026 but I predict they will make a play for the UK and US audience with a slightly tailored version.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b8dbd7b8ec80f63edc9c92f11eb876186c2ae654\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8dbd7b8ec80f63edc9c92f11eb876186c2ae654/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon workers protest outside Jeff Bezos\u2019s apartment in New York City, July this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon workers protest outside Jeff Bezos\u2019s apartment in New York City, July this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Hagen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>14. Apple will experience worker activism</strong></h2> <p>The only people with the power to change how Silicon Valley works are inside Silicon Valley. Employee activism burst through in a big way in 2018, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/01/google-walkout-global-protests-employees-sexual-harassment-scandals\" title=\"\">Google workers walking out over sexual harassment</a> and plans to open up a censored search engine in China, Microsoft workers campaigning against <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/22/18236290/microsoft-military-contract-augmented-reality-ar-vr\" title=\"\">working with the US Department of Defense</a> and Amazon workers joining in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/11/amazon-ice-protest-immigrant-tech\" title=\"\">protests against working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>. But Apple, the largest of them all, has so far kept its staff from expressing public dissent. Whether that\u2019s through the carrot or the stick is unknown \u2013 but with the company coming under increasing pressure for its craven stance towards both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, it surely cannot last.</p> <h2><strong>15. Digital wellbeing on the statute books</strong></h2> <p>Both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/04/apple-ios12-screen-time-apps-how-much-spent-phone-digital-wellbeing\" title=\"\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/08/google-digital-wellbeing-tools-tech-addiction\" title=\"\">Google</a> launched their screen time controls in 2018, and upgraded them this year. Ross Sleight, chief strategy officer at tech accelerator Somo, thinks this trend will continue \u2013 and will start to impact on regulation. \u201cMany people are now very aware of their addictive habits and are trying to disengage,\u201d he says. \u201cA shared responsibility for wellbeing falls on to each one of us: the companies designing applications and user interfaces that play on our psychology, but also on policy makers.\u201d How that would look in practice is likely to be the result of years of legal wrangling \u2013 but watch the proposals bubble up over the next year.</p> <h2><strong>16. Google v Nike for wearable tech\u2019s second place</strong></h2> <p>When it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\" title=\"\">bought Fitbit</a> towards the end of 2019, Google signalled a renewed desire to succeed in wearable technology, a space where it has previously struggled. The company\u2019s Android <a href=\"https://wearos.google.com/#hands-free-help\" title=\"\">Wear</a> operating system bombed against competition from the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-series-5/?afid=p238%7CsHnbI0oKa-dc_mtid_20925xua42643_pcrid_381833494747_pgrid_80855703347_&amp;cid=wwa-uk-kwgo-watch-Bran-slid--productid--\" title=\"\">Apple Watch</a>, and its decision not to engage in hardware directly looks short-sighted in a sector where elegant pairing of software and design is table stakes. But, says Jim Prior, global CEO of brand consultancy Superunion, challengers may come from leftfield: \u201cThe bulk of these gadgets and garments lack an emotional narrative to differentiate themselves, connect with consumers and drive purchase.

The </strong><strong>loot box bans spread</strong></h2> <p>Loot boxes, treasure crates, card packs \u2013 whatever they\u2019re called, the practice of offering randomised rewards for real money has gained an increasingly bad reputation.

The continued death of new media</strong></h2> <p>In the past decade, hundreds of small sites were launched with venture capital cash, riding a wave of social media distribution and programmatic adverts to a peak of bubbly excess, before it burst in 2016 and they dropped like flies. In the US, consolidation has seen some outlets close, others merge, and still more lay off hundreds of employees in total, and the trend shows no sign of abating. The biggest scalps have already been claimed, but 2020 could be a time when smaller sites start to lose out, like the hyper-partisan news outlets that so shaped the 2017 election, or the few remaining independent blogs that have eked out a living on reader support and savings.</p> <h2><strong>19. The next iPhone will have four rear cameras</strong></h2> <p>The smartphone industry seems to be following the trend set by Gillette and one-upping itself on an annual basis. Other phones already have four cameras, so why not Apple? The company would have a good reason for adding another lens: while the iPhone 11 Pro is perhaps the best smartphone camera on the market, it falls far short in one specific area, with just a 2x optical zoom at the highest level. So a bigger zoom lens would be well received by any users who like shooting big things far away or small things nearby.</p> <h2><strong>20.

      "bodyText": "1. Tesla\u2019s cybertruck will not ship This is an easy prediction to make, because even Tesla isn\u2019t claiming that its eye-catching angular steel beast will be available for sale in 2020. The company\u2019s own pitch is that production won\u2019t even begin until 2021, with owners receiving their first shipments in 2022. But the gap is relevant to Tesla\u2019s future: where the company was once genuinely ahead of the curve, in making beautiful electric cars that people wanted to buy, it has increasingly relied on beating its competitors to announcements, rather than actually shipping. The list of Elon Musk\u2019s as-yet-unfulfilled promises grows every year \u2013 but the electric fleets of BMW, Ford, General Motors and others grow faster. 2. Google\u2019s Duplex won\u2019t come to Europe One of the most impressive, and futuristic, products to have come from Google in recent years, Duplex is an AI assistant that can make calls to local businesses on your behalf to do things like book appointments and find out opening times. The tool was criticised when the company first revealed it, for being so good that its use could plausibly be described as \u201cdeceptive\u201d: the AI assistant even injects \u201cum\u201d and \u201cer\u201d into speech to sound more human. That, combined with the difficulties of gaining consent for receiving an automated cold call, means that GDPR might well keep the technology from European shores for years to come. 3. Advertising will come to smart speakers Amazon and Google comfortably dominate the smart speaker landscape, but neither has yet answered an important question: what\u2019s the advantage of getting all these devices in homes? Aggressive price cuts mean that neither is making a substantial amount of income from sales, and the absence of paid services means that they aren\u2019t taking a glorious 30% cut of revenue either. Amazon has long experimented with using Alexa as a retail channel, but the only way to really make millions is by delivering sweet, sweet advertising to the ears of your customers. Expect the dial to be turned up. 4. 5G will be meaningful For Brits, 5G is technically here already, with multiple networks offering the ultrafast mobile standard in denser urban areas. But there are few devices that support the new standard yet \u2013 and fewer still that are acceptable to the gadget-obsessed early adopters who would otherwise be first on board, since the flagship devices from manufacturers such as Samsung, Google and Apple continue to be 4G only. That will change in 2020, when you can expect hardware like the Pixel 5, iPhone 12 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S11 to support the faster connections. 5. Your homescreen will still look the same It\u2019s been years since any consumer app broke through into the mainstream \u2013 with an honourable exception for TikTok among the under-25s \u2013 and that trend shows no real sign of curving upwards in 2020. Between the dominance of default apps from Apple and Google, and the ability of the major platforms to acquire, clone or kill upstart competitors, it\u2019s a hard time to be a consumer software company. Harder still to become one of the 28 who get a coveted spot on a typical user\u2019s homescreen, rather than being buried in a folder. 6. Facebook will kill Portal It was always hubristic for Facebook to release an Echo competitor. The company had no real expertise in building hardware, nor an obvious strategy for getting its products to market: it may own the world\u2019s most valuable advertising real estate, but it\u2019s not a store. Then Cambridge Analytica broke, and Portal went from a bold idea to a bad one. Who would want to put an always-on microphone connected directly to Menlo Park in their homes? The answer, it seems, is \u201cnot many people\u201d, because Portal sales have reportedly been minuscule. A second iteration was squeezed out earlier this year; don\u2019t expect a third. 7. VR will have a second mini-boom \u2013 thanks to one game Virtual reality has been the \u201cnext big thing\u201d for five years, and has been a big thing for precisely none of those. But just when it was on its way out, there\u2019s the potential for one last flurry of attention, thanks to the work of PC gaming company Valve. The company announced a new edition of its beloved Half-Life series, the first since 2007, would be exclusive to its VR headset. There have been few titles that can encourage non-believers to spend the thousands required to get high-quality VR at home, but Half-Life: Alyx is one. Whether it sparks a lasting resurgence, or just a final flash in the pan, remains to be seen. 8. Amazon\u2019s Alexa expansion will slip Alexa has been coming to new products at an impressive clip. Amazon has incorporated its voice assistant into almost every gadget it makes, and a good few it doesn\u2019t. But, even though voice assistants remain popular among their devotees, privacy concerns are only growing among the cohort of refuseniks who want nothing to do with always-on microphones. If Ford, for instance, starts losing out on sales because of an overly ambitious plan to put Alexa in everything, you can be certain they\u2019ll reassess that integration rapidly. 9. We won\u2019t hear about Apple\u2019s smart glass or car The two worst-kept secrets in technology are Apple\u2019s biggest experimental projects: a pair of augmented-reality glasses and a self-driving car, both being developed in Cupertino. The glasses have a path to release, and references to them in the code for Apple products have started showing up in beta tests and other leaks. The car, for now, has no existence outside of a few offices in Sunnyvale and some suspicious hires from companies like Tesla. But, at the earliest, the glasses won\u2019t hit shelves until 2021, and Apple is always wary about pre-announcing things. 10. The console wars will restart with a vengeance Video gaming has been quiet for the past few years. With Xbox Ones and PlayStation 4s in houses across the nation, Microsoft and Sony turned their attention to intra-generational upgrades and cheaper models designed to be a second console. Nintendo took a different path, releasing the Switch and upending what a home console could be. And Fortnite rendered the whole thing moot anyway, as the most popular game in the world worked on every console, PCs, and even mobile phones. But 2020 will see the launch of a new Xbox, a new Playstation, a new Halo and a new Last of Us \u2013 and the return to playgrounds nationwide of tiresome debates about which is better. 11. Google could gain from article 13 While the European Union was hammering out the details of 2019\u2019s copyright directive, Google began one of its largest lobbying efforts to date. The company was incensed by two proposals \u2013 articles 13 and 15 of the draft bill \u2013 which it dubbed the \u201cupload filter\u201d and the \u201clink tax\u201d. Passage of the directive, it implied, could result in the end of YouTube in Europe for good. It mobilised thousands of YouTubers in opposition, and sparked group hysteria among tween fandoms on Instagram and elsewhere. While individual nations ratify the legislation, expect more protest and legal challenges, but ultimately Google may gain from article 13: after all, they are well placed to build and license the content filters required to police copyrighted material. 12. AI will be mobilised in cyberwar Simon Shooter, a partner at law firm Bird &amp; Bird, predicts that 2020 will see \u201cthe escalation of the cyberwar, with AI in use on both sides of the divide\u201d. Hackers have long been experimenting with automatic tools for breaking into and exploiting corporate and government networks, but the need to stay undetectable has limited the use of AI in practice. As the cyber cold war heats up, however, that could change. 13. Cool China The rise of TikTok may have concerned the adults in the room, who see the company\u2019s role in exporting Beijing\u2019s censorship and slow adoption of child protection standards as reasons for caution. But among the younger generation, it could have the opposite effect, cementing a perception of China as the home of cool products and services. Who would win if that happened? \u201cThe success of TikTok will not have gone unnoticed by Tencent, which owns WeChat,\u201d says Tamara Littleton, CEO at social media agency the Social Element. \u201cIt has struggled to gain traction in other countries\u2026 but I predict they will make a play for the UK and US audience with a slightly tailored version.\u201d 14. Apple will experience worker activism The only people with the power to change how Silicon Valley works are inside Silicon Valley. Employee activism burst through in a big way in 2018, with Google workers walking out over sexual harassment and plans to open up a censored search engine in China, Microsoft workers campaigning against working with the US Department of Defense and Amazon workers joining in protests against working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Apple, the largest of them all, has so far kept its staff from expressing public dissent. Whether that\u2019s through the carrot or the stick is unknown \u2013 but with the company coming under increasing pressure for its craven stance towards both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, it surely cannot last. 15. Digital wellbeing on the statute books Both Apple and Google launched their screen time controls in 2018, and upgraded them this year. Ross Sleight, chief strategy officer at tech accelerator Somo, thinks this trend will continue \u2013 and will start to impact on regulation. \u201cMany people are now very aware of their addictive habits and are trying to disengage,\u201d he says. \u201cA shared responsibility for wellbeing falls on to each one of us: the companies designing applications and user interfaces that play on our psychology, but also on policy makers.\u201d How that would look in practice is likely to be the result of years of legal wrangling \u2013 but watch the proposals bubble up over the next year. 16. Google v Nike for wearable tech\u2019s second place When it bought Fitbit towards the end of 2019, Google signalled a renewed desire to succeed in wearable technology, a space where it has previously struggled. The company\u2019s Android Wear operating system bombed against competition from the Apple Watch, and its decision not to engage in hardware directly looks short-sighted in a sector where elegant pairing of software and design is table stakes. But, says Jim Prior, global CEO of brand consultancy Superunion, challengers may come from leftfield: \u201cThe bulk of these gadgets and garments lack an emotional narrative to differentiate themselves, connect with consumers and drive purchase. In comparison, sportswear brands are highly engineered and technical but have mastered this \u2013 in particular Nike, which has woven a strong narrative around the brand driven by its creative vision.\u201d 17. The loot box bans spread Loot boxes, treasure crates, card packs \u2013 whatever they\u2019re called, the practice of offering randomised rewards for real money has gained an increasingly bad reputation. Stories of children spending hundreds of pounds of their parents money \u2013 and adults spending thousands of pounds of their own \u2013 back up the perception of the offerings as closer to unregulated gambling than a fun aspect of video games in the 21st century. Self-regulation might be on the cards if the industry showed the slightest interest in doing it, but the billions it rakes in from the practice (Fifa loot boxes resulted in more than half of EA\u2019s 2017 revenue from game add-ons) makes a voluntary change unlikely. 18. The continued death of new media In the past decade, hundreds of small sites were launched with venture capital cash, riding a wave of social media distribution and programmatic adverts to a peak of bubbly excess, before it burst in 2016 and they dropped like flies. In the US, consolidation has seen some outlets close, others merge, and still more lay off hundreds of employees in total, and the trend shows no sign of abating. The biggest scalps have already been claimed, but 2020 could be a time when smaller sites start to lose out, like the hyper-partisan news outlets that so shaped the 2017 election, or the few remaining independent blogs that have eked out a living on reader support and savings. 19. The next iPhone will have four rear cameras The smartphone industry seems to be following the trend set by Gillette and one-upping itself on an annual basis. Other phones already have four cameras, so why not Apple?

So a bigger zoom lens would be well received by any users who like shooting big things far away or small things nearby. 20.

He may have moved from South Norwood to leafy Kingston in southwest London. He may be the most famous former pupil of Stanley Tech, a man who has played the world\u2019s biggest stages. But he still returns to Bluejay to eat. There\u2019s a table reserved for us, up against a wall plastered with photographs of their regulars, of which he is one. So no, not a standard review. They knew both of us were coming. Instead it\u2019s a snapshot of a particular slice of south London culture; the culture which made him.</p> <p>Joy and Dave Blake, both of whose families are Jamaican, opened Bluejay Caf\u00e9 in 2008. Places like this are familiar to me; I\u2019ve lived a couple of miles up the road in Brixton for almost 30 years, which has its own version, their windows steamed, the air crackling with easy chatter. They\u2019re much more than just restaurants. They are a focus for community; a way of reasserting cultural identity, one heaving plateful of the familiar at a time. Rarely do they shout about themselves. They don\u2019t need to because their customers know exactly where they are. They are an extension of the domestic, which means they can be unfairly overlooked and underestimated. The other customers here at Bluejay today are almost entirely black British, though you make assumptions about where their families are from, at your peril.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a0a985b348f5926709ebc050ad7457787a8b166\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a0a985b348f5926709ebc050ad7457787a8b166/0_0_5520_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Deep, rich and sustaining\u2019: glossy oxtail stew.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Deep, rich and sustaining\u2019: glossy oxtail stew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSouth London communities are seriously complicated,\u201d Stormzy says. \u201cI\u2019m very Ghanaian, very West African.\u201d At home his mum cooked jollof rice and okra stew and peanut soup. \u201cAs a kid I don\u2019t ever remember eating vegetables. It was always big carbs \u2013 rice or yam or fufu \u2013 and then a stew.\u201d But the Jamaican food here at Bluejay roots him, too. \u201cIf you\u2019re African around here you know so much about Jamaican culture, and if you\u2019re Jamaican you know so much about African culture.\u201d</p> <p>He orders us both a fizzing glass of Mighty Malt. It is dark, and batters you around the head with huge caramel flavours. It\u2019s like cola, in knuckle dusters. I admit that, despite three decades living around here, I\u2019ve never before had one. \u201cIt\u2019s an acquired taste,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, you know, good after a heavy night out.\u201d I leave him in charge of over-ordering.

Come off stage at 11pm and go for a McDonald\u2019s. Get up the next morning and have a fry-up.\u201d Eventually he concluded it was slowing him down for his full-on performance. \u201cDuring my 2017 tour we had catering. We looked after ourselves.\u201d And then there was the diet he went on ahead of his headline spot at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. \u201cIt was 12 weeks, working with a nutritionist and a trainer. A lot of fish. There was mackerel and spinach in the morning, then I\u2019d carb up until 5pm, then just protein and vegetables. It was gruelling. I was hungry all the time.\u201d I ask if that was how he came to be so ripped when he performed with his top off at Glastonbury? He grins. \u201cYeah, that was it.\u201d I tell him I\u2019m relieved; that I thought he was just built like that.</p> <p>Joy starts delivering the food. First up a bowl of glossy oxtail stew, in a deep sauce made rich from the melting gelatine, after many, many hours of heat and care. It is sweet and salty and rich and sustaining on an afternoon with more than a hint of winter about it. You tug at the meat with knife and fork and then set about the bones with your hands.

      "bodyText": "Bluejay Caf\u00e9, 2 Market Parade, Portland Road, South Norwood, London SE25 4PP (020 8656 9050). Breakfast \u00a33.50-\u00a37; main dishes \u00a36-\u00a310; desserts \u00a32-\u00a34.25 Licensed A decade ago, when he was in his teens, Michael Owuo would come to Bluejay Caf\u00e9 in London\u2019s South Norwood after a heavy night out. \u201cThe Caribbean breakfast was the thing,\u201d he says, stabbing at the laminated menu. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic. Perfect for hangovers.\u201d It looks like a substantial plateful for \u00a37, perfectly engineered for a surfeit of booze: chicken or beef sausages, eggs, ackee and saltfish, fried dumpling, plantain and beans. \u201cBut get here too late in the morning and you\u2019d never find a table,\u201d he says. That\u2019s not a problem these days, not now he\u2019s traded Michael for Stormzy. He may have moved from South Norwood to leafy Kingston in southwest London. He may be the most famous former pupil of Stanley Tech, a man who has played the world\u2019s biggest stages. But he still returns to Bluejay to eat. There\u2019s a table reserved for us, up against a wall plastered with photographs of their regulars, of which he is one. So no, not a standard review. They knew both of us were coming. Instead it\u2019s a snapshot of a particular slice of south London culture; the culture which made him. Joy and Dave Blake, both of whose families are Jamaican, opened Bluejay Caf\u00e9 in 2008. Places like this are familiar to me; I\u2019ve lived a couple of miles up the road in Brixton for almost 30 years, which has its own version, their windows steamed, the air crackling with easy chatter. They\u2019re much more than just restaurants. They are a focus for community; a way of reasserting cultural identity, one heaving plateful of the familiar at a time. Rarely do they shout about themselves. They don\u2019t need to because their customers know exactly where they are. They are an extension of the domestic, which means they can be unfairly overlooked and underestimated. The other customers here at Bluejay today are almost entirely black British, though you make assumptions about where their families are from, at your peril. \u201cSouth London communities are seriously complicated,\u201d Stormzy says. \u201cI\u2019m very Ghanaian, very West African.\u201d At home his mum cooked jollof rice and okra stew and peanut soup. \u201cAs a kid I don\u2019t ever remember eating vegetables. It was always big carbs \u2013 rice or yam or fufu \u2013 and then a stew.\u201d But the Jamaican food here at Bluejay roots him, too. \u201cIf you\u2019re African around here you know so much about Jamaican culture, and if you\u2019re Jamaican you know so much about African culture.\u201d He orders us both a fizzing glass of Mighty Malt. It is dark, and batters you around the head with huge caramel flavours. It\u2019s like cola, in knuckle dusters. I admit that, despite three decades living around here, I\u2019ve never before had one. \u201cIt\u2019s an acquired taste,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, you know, good after a heavy night out.\u201d I leave him in charge of over-ordering. We start with golden fingers of salt fish fritter, both crisp and soft, sliced up into batons to be eaten with our hands. I ask him about food on tour. \u201cBack in the early days,\u201d he says, \u201cit was a shit-show. Come off stage at 11pm and go for a McDonald\u2019s. Get up the next morning and have a fry-up.\u201d Eventually he concluded it was slowing him down for his full-on performance. \u201cDuring my 2017 tour we had catering. We looked after ourselves.\u201d And then there was the diet he went on ahead of his headline spot at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. \u201cIt was 12 weeks, working with a nutritionist and a trainer. A lot of fish. There was mackerel and spinach in the morning, then I\u2019d carb up until 5pm, then just protein and vegetables. It was gruelling. I was hungry all the time.\u201d I ask if that was how he came to be so ripped when he performed with his top off at Glastonbury? He grins. \u201cYeah, that was it.\u201d I tell him I\u2019m relieved; that I thought he was just built like that. Joy starts delivering the food. First up a bowl of glossy oxtail stew, in a deep sauce made rich from the melting gelatine, after many, many hours of heat and care. It is sweet and salty and rich and sustaining on an afternoon with more than a hint of winter about it. You tug at the meat with knife and fork and then set about the bones with your hands. There\u2019s also a bowl of curry goat (never goat curry). It is an earthy yellow, presumably from turmeric, and has a powerful kick of allspice and Scotch bonnet. \u201cDon\u2019t drop that down your shirt,\u201d Stormzy says, as if he\u2019s my mum. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get the stain out.\u201d These are the ingredients others might leave behind, pushed firmly to the centre of the stage. Naturally enough there is rice and peas. He also orders a bowl of jerk chicken broken into penne pasta. It feels like a nostalgic act, a reminder of the younger man in search of food to soak up the excesses of the night before.

The science tells us that there is no time for this. The election of a prime minister who did not think a crucial television debate on the climate crisis worth his time, and a government whose environmental manifesto promises were described by <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/general-election/election-manifestos-labour-tops-friends-earths-climate-and-nature-league-table\" title=\"\">Friends of the Earth</a> as \u201cin sector after sector\u2026 invariably weaker than the other parties, entirely absent or just plain bad\u201d, tells us there is no time for this. Thunberg is right to be furious.</p> <p>Her anger is what seems to most trigger the sensitive snowflakes of far-right politics. Trump, a man whose whole state of being is so nuclear-head-emoji that he actually looks like one, uses her fury as his default starting point for insults. When she tweeted about anti-indigenous violence in the Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/10/greta-thunberg-jair-bolsonaro-brazil-indigenous-amazon\" title=\"\">Jair Bolsonaro called Thunberg \u201c<em>pirralha</em>\u201d, a little brat</a>. She changed her Twitter bio then, too. Her ability to contain her rage for the moments when it counts, rather than throwing it away on a hostile response to bullying babies, is remarkable. She doesn\u2019t need anger management.

      "bodyText": "If only we could bottle (reusables) and distribute Greta Thunberg\u2019s ability to neutralise the ire of men who should know better. In an attempt to divert attention from the House judiciary committee debating his impeachment, Trump threw a \u201ccalm down dear\u201d in the direction of the 16-year-old climate emergency activist who has been named Time magazine\u2019s Person of the Year for 2019. (Let us never forget that Trump had to mock up his own Time cover to hang on the wall, like a Moonpig card for someone whose birthday you forgot about until the very last minute.) \u201cGreta must work on her Anger Management problem,\u201d he tweeted, showing as little regard for the correct use of capital letters as he does for the peril the planet finds itself in. Thunberg, perpetually unfazed, responded by changing her Twitter bio to \u201cA teenager working on her anger management problem\u2026\u201d Please note the lower case. Obviously, Thunberg is angry. Her speeches are about how angry she is. She is livid that she is the one to have to keep telling the world about the crisis it is facing. \u201cPeople are underestimating the force of angry kids,\u201d she told reporters on her arrival back in Europe at the start of December. Even Jeremy Clarkson, who called her a \u201cspoilt brat\u201d in September, offered his congratulations on the Time cover, \u201cfrom the old dinosaur\u201d, though he did manage to state that her dreams were unrealistic at the same time. It is striking that Thunberg has achieved so much, so quickly, at such an age, but framing this as an intergenerational war is a distraction. The science tells us that there is no time for this. The election of a prime minister who did not think a crucial television debate on the climate crisis worth his time, and a government whose environmental manifesto promises were described by Friends of the Earth as \u201cin sector after sector\u2026 invariably weaker than the other parties, entirely absent or just plain bad\u201d, tells us there is no time for this. Thunberg is right to be furious. Her anger is what seems to most trigger the sensitive snowflakes of far-right politics. Trump, a man whose whole state of being is so nuclear-head-emoji that he actually looks like one, uses her fury as his default starting point for insults. When she tweeted about anti-indigenous violence in the Amazon, Jair Bolsonaro called Thunberg \u201cpirralha\u201d, a little brat. She changed her Twitter bio then, too. Her ability to contain her rage for the moments when it counts, rather than throwing it away on a hostile response to bullying babies, is remarkable. She doesn\u2019t need anger management. She\u2019s managing it perfectly well. Greta Gerwig, a top-class talent treated like a little woman When Natalie Portman presented the best director award at the Golden Globes in 2018, she announced: \u201cAnd here are the all-male nominees.\u201d As they did last year, voters seem to have taken this as an instruction, rather than a rebuke. In this year of great Gretas, the actor, writer and director Greta Gerwig has been snubbed once again for a best director nomination, even though her adaptation of Little Women has won the kind of five-stars-all-round critical bear-hug that would usually ensure a look-in. The same happened in 2018 with the wonderful Lady Bird. Saoirse Ronan, who did win a Golden Globe for acting in the latter, and who has been nominated for Little Women, was compelled to say: \u201cMy performance in this film belongs to Greta as much as it does myself and I share this recognition completely with her.\u201d There may still be consolation from the Oscars. Gerwig was nominated for best director for Lady Bird. She was the first woman to be nominated, simply nominated, in that category since Kathryn Bigelow (who won) in 2009 for The Hurt Locker, who was the first woman nominated since Sofia Coppola in 2003, who was the first woman since Jane Campion in 1993, who was the first woman since Lina Wertm\u00fcller in 1976. That\u2019s five nominations, and just one winner, in more than 80 years. Usually, we are told that there simply aren\u2019t enough women making films. But while Gerwig\u2019s absence from the directing category at the Golden Globes is perplexing, that of Olivia Wilde, Lulu Wang, Alma Har\u2019el, Celine Sciamma and Melina Matsoukas is equally baffling. Here are the annual all-male nominees, indeed. Juice WRLD, tragedy of a death foretold When Jarad Anthony Higgins, better known as the rapper Juice WRLD, died last weekend, he had just turned 21. Every thoughtful piece I read about his life and work expressed despair at the wasted potential of an entire generation of rappers, particularly SoundCloud rappers, who are overdosing or being incarcerated at a rate that suggests far more needs to be done by those profiting from their music. In his biggest hit, Lucid Dreams, he laid out his existential despair: \u201cI take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay,\u201d he sang. \u201cYou were my everything / thoughts of a wedding ring / now I\u2019m just better off dead.\u201d When writing his obituaries, many have noted that he seemed to have been writing his own. The opioid crisis, prescription drugs, depression and mental healthcare are all factors, but the music industry is hardly known for taking its pastoral responsibilities seriously. When Kurt Cobain died at 27 in 1994, his mother, Wendy, was reported to have said, \u201cHe\u2019s gone and joined that stupid club.

Now Ireland\u2019s former children\u2019s laureate, Eoin Colfer, will delight fans worldwide by appearing as an extra in Artemis Fowl, Disney\u2019s forthcoming feature film directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh and starring Dame Judi Dench. Describing his one scene, filmed in the north of Ireland, Colfer said: \u201cI walked across a field with a lot of other people. It wasn\u2019t too taxing \u2013 although I did manage to get it wrong a few times.

      "bodyText": "John McDonnell has said he will not return to the shadow cabinet after Labour\u2019s worst general election result in a generation. The shadow chancellor, seen as one of the architects of Labour\u2019s shift to the left, has been a major figure at the top of the party since Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s surprise 2015 leadership victory. But he had been criticised for his influence on Labour\u2019s decision to support a second Brexit referendum, which alienated many voters in the party\u2019s once solid heartlands who had voted to leave the European Union. McDonnell said on Saturday he had \u201cdone his bit\u201d and it was time for the party to move on. \u201cThe new leadership coming in, I think, will enable us to move forward on the key issues \u2013 getting a Brexit deal that works for all of us, tackling these grotesque levels of inequality,\u201d he told BBC News. \u201cBut the big one \u2026 is climate change, and my fear is five years of a fossil fuel-backed government under Boris Johnson means we will miss this five-year opportunity of saving our planet.\u201d McDonnell denied that he had backed the wrong Labour leader, saying Corbyn could have won in 2017. But this time, he said: \u201cThings moved on, Brexit dominated everything, and that was the horns of a dilemma we were on. \u201cThe new leader will come in place, appoint the shadow cabinet,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cI won\u2019t be part of the shadow cabinet. I\u2019ve done my bit. We need to move on at that stage, with that new leader, and I think we will be in a position [to be] learning lessons, listening to people and constructing a broad coalition right the way across the country.\u201d He said the current shadow cabinet would stay in place for the interim period, and would respond to the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. \u201cMy fear is that we\u2019re in for a long haul now, possibly five years,\u201d he said. McDonnell said there needed to be a debate about how \u201csomeone [Corbyn] \u2013 who I think is one of the most principled, honest, sincere, committed, anti-racist politicians \u2013 [was] demonised by a smear campaign\u201d. \u201cI think we have a wider debate here about the role of social media and the media overall,\u201d he said. Positioning in the race to become the next Labour leader has already started, with the ardent remainer David Lammy confirming he was considering putting his name forward. Others being touted to take over include Lisa Nandy, who represents leave-voting Wigan, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner, Sir Keir Starmer, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry. McDonnell named the shadow business secretary, Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, Rayner, and the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, as part of a \u201cnew generation\u201d who could be expected to take leading positions. John McDonnell said that the NEC officers \u2013 a sub-group of senior members of Labour\u2019s ruling body \u2013 would meet next week and decide the timetable for a leadership election in the New Year. \u201cIt will be the usual time \u2013 a couple of months or something,\u201d he said. Members of the wider NEC \u2013 who said that they had been contacted by the party\u2019s leadership only to be told not to speak to the media about the election results \u2013 argued on Twitter that they would expect the leadership election timetable to be decided by a meeting of all of the committee\u2019s members. \u201cAny decisions on the future of the party and the leadership must be made by the full NEC, not the small officer\u2019s group,\u201d wrote NEC member James Asser. An NEC meeting is scheduled for the end of January, but members said they would expect to be called to an emergency meeting before then. Several former Labour MPs who lost their seats in the election have blamed Corbyn for the party\u2019s defeat. Helen Goodman, the former Labour MP for Bishop Auckland, said Corbyn had \u201cfailed as a communicator\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe biggest factor was obviously the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn as leader. The fact of the matter is that Jeremy Corbyn failed as a communicator, whatever his good personal qualities \u2013 and he undoubtedly has good personal qualities \u2013 he failed as a communicator.\u201d Anna Turley, who lost her seat in Redcar in the north-east, described Corbyn\u2019s leadership as a barrier. She said: \u201cFor me, when you\u2019re getting four doors in a row of lifelong Labour voters saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Anna, I\u2019m a lifelong Labour voter, I like what you\u2019ve done, but I just can\u2019t vote for that man to be prime minister,\u2019 I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a fundamental barrier that we just couldn\u2019t get across.\u201d She said Corbyn was \u201cabsolutely\u201d more of a reason than Brexit for her constituents choosing to vote for another party, adding: \u201cIn my constituency, even though it was a 67% leave constituency, it was four to one the leadership over Brexit.\u201d She said former Labour voters \u201cdidn\u2019t trust him to put our country first\u201d because of \u201chis history and his baggage around security and terrorism\u201d. But the Labour MP for York Central, Rachael Maskell, who retained her seat and is a longtime Corbyn supporter, said it was not just the leader who should take responsibility for defeat. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to take responsibility, but I don\u2019t think apportioning blame to a complex situation in a simplistic way is really the way to approach this. We\u2019ve got to understand what is really happening across our political system,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Post-match reaction James Milner \u201cIt was one of those days. The wind was difficult and it was tough to play. We went long more than we\u2019d have liked \u2013 you have to play the conditions sometimes. Watford were always gonna be up for it and we knew it would be tough. It\u2019s an important result.\u201d Mo Salah \u201cI\u2019ve been practising with my right foot! I had good luck with the first goal \u2013 we scored at the right time. They are a tough team and they should be in a better position than they are. Sometimes the crowd get a bit panicky but we have more experience now \u2013 we have been together for 3-4 years. We\u2019ve won a few games 1-0 so it\u2019s fine.\u201d Peep peep! Liverpool move 11 points clear with an uncomfortable victory over Watford in a very strange game. Mo Salah, who played up front in a 4-2-3-1 system, scored two classy goals to punish Watford for a number of missed chances. Liverpool were sloppy, nervous, unconvincing ... and they still won. The goal itself was a beauty. Liverpool split Watford open with two fine passes from Alexander-Arnold and then Oxlade-Chamberlain, who slid the ball down the inside-right channel to release Mane. He cut it back carefully to Origi, who made a hopeless mess of his first-time shot. It was bobbling wide of goal when Salah improvised to flick the ball behind his standing leg and into the net. It looked like it was going to be disallowed for offside, but eventually the VAR folk decided his heel was level with Kabasele\u2019s. GOAL GIVEN! Liverpool 2-0 Watford I have no idea. VAR check I think Salah is offside. Mo Salah seals victory with a lovely bit of improvisation. 89 min Here\u2019s David Nevin. \u201cYou hear so much rubbish from all that want the reds to fail chelski prawn sandwich brigade accept you\u2019re all 2nd rate.\u201d Nice one David, keep it up. 88 min A substitution apiece. Liverpool bring on Origi for Firmino; Watford introduce Quina for Doucoure. 87 min Alexander-Arnold wastes 20 seconds before taking a Liverpool corner. This time there are no boos. 86 min \u201cThe pessimism is a result of the gap since the last league title,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cLike England fans didn\u2019t really believe they\u2019d won the Ashes in 2005 until the umpires came out &amp; knocked the bails off at the Oval. Just like the England fans thought that somehow Shane Warne could come out in the gloaming and win it for the Aussies so Liverpool fans imagine that the lovechild of Federico Macheda &amp; Demba Ba will inevitably thwart us.\u201d Ah yeah, I get that, but I still think it applies to most teams. For example, I remember being unsure when Man Utd were 14 points clear in 1993-94. And I was bloody right to be pessimistic, because Blackburn almost reeled them in. 85 min This is one of the oddest games of 2019. 84 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s imaginative through pass to Mane is just intercepted by the sliding Kabasele. He has had a blinder. At the other end, Doucoure shots high over the bar from inside the D. Watford deserve at least a point in this game. At this rate, Liverpool could drop to fifth in the xG table by tomorrow night. 83 min Sarr belts a volley well wide from inside the D. 82 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Mike MacKenzie. \u201cI can stop this festive goodwill ... the refereeing sucks big time! Not just this match but in most of them. Way too many fouls missed and bad calls on out of bounds. I know it\u2019s not easy but too many obvious calls aren\u2019t made.\u201d Each his own and all, but I think they do a pretty amazing job in the circumstances, especially as it has become so much harder since the advent of social media and VAR. 81 min The resulting corner from Deulofeu hits the outside of the near post! Alisson was scrambling across his line, and I\u2019m not certain he had it covered. Liverpool have been so sloppy today. 80 min Van Dijk almost scores an own goal! He was under no pressure when he slid the ball past the outrushing Alisson and, thankfully for Liverpool, just wide of the near post. 78 min \u201cRichard Curtis has optioned the script for OBO The Lonely, starring Rafe Spall as a KP nut and Emily Blunt as a keen fan of The Hundred,\u201d says James Debens. \u201cMusic by Roy Orbison and The Hoosiers.\u201d I\u2019m not sure about casting Danny Dyer as Andy Bull, though. 77 min Watford break promisingly through Hughes and then Gray, who finds Sarr in the inside-left channel. He overruns the ball just enough for Gomez to make a strong interception. Watford have had so many opportunities in attack today. 76 min Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s excellent cross is nutted over his own bar by Mariappa. Watford have defended admirably today. 75 min Andre Gray replaces Troy Deeney, who looks shattered. 74 min Robertson plays a slick one-two with Mane and picks out Firmino with an immaculate low cross. He takes too long to get his shot away, and it hits Hughes before dribbling through to Foster. 73 min This has been a peculiar game. Liverpool have been both fortunate and in almost complete control. 70 min Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replaces Xherdan Shaqiri, who had a 6/10 kind of game. (It would have been 7/10 but for that pesky VAR.) 70 min \u201cAs a Chelsea fan, it\u2019s funny to listen to the pessimism from Liverpool fans,\u201d says Alexander Scrutton. \u201cIf any other team was this far ahead, playing this well, at this stage of the season, we would have them nailed for the title.\u201d Isn\u2019t the point that we\u2019d have them nailed on unless it was our own team? But really, Jose Mourinho said it best the other week in the Sky studio, something along the lines of: \u201cWhen I know I have the best team, and we have a lead, goodbye.\u201d 69 min Henderson wallops over from distance. 66 min \u201cI\u2019m watching all the football today and tomorrow in a cafe in Laayoune, Western Sahara,\u201d says Sarah Saunders. \u201cAnyone keen for a tea and some footy?\u201d What\u2019s with all the sociability and goodwill today? Didn\u2019t you all get the memo? 65 min A second Liverpool goal is imminent. Andy Robertson\u2019s introduction has changed the game and energised them. 64 min Firmino, put clear by Salah, overruns the ball. Jurgen Klopp is baring his teeth at allcomers, because he wanted play brought back for an earlier foul on Salah. 63 min Salah, put through by Milner, dithers and is eased off the ball by Kabasele. He wants a penalty but, as with the Sarr appeal at the other end, there was nothing in it. Moments later, Salah drives miles wide with his right foot. 62 min Firmino\u2019s sharp low drive from the left side of the box is well held by the plunging Foster. Mane and Salah were waiting for a rebound. 60 min Sarr surges past van Dijk in the area and falls over. It will be checked but it\u2019s not a penalty. Van Dijk did lean into him, but not with enough force for it to be a foul. 60 min It looks like Wijnaldum\u2019s knee rather than his hamstring. He\u2019s leaving the field a little gingerly, to be replaced by Andy Robertson. That means James Milner will go into midfield. 59 min \u201cHey Rob,\u201d says Kristof K\u00fcnssler-McIlwain. \u201cHas it ever happened that a couple actually found each other over MBM? What a story that would be!\u201d It certainly did with the cricket OBO - the thoroughly lovely couple of Lynn Bashforth and Jeremy Theobald met that way. 58 min Gini Wijnaldum is down with what might be a hamstring injury. Liverpool are falling apart. Has Jurgen Klopp taken them as far as he can? 57 min Milner is booked for a foul on Sarr, who, that one hideous miskick aside, has been pretty impressive today. 56 min It\u2019s no exaggeration to say Watford could be two goals ahead, yet there is still no real doubt - to the neutral - that Liverpool will win. It\u2019s been a strange game. 54 min: Fine save! Alisson makes an excellent block to deny Deulofeu, who was through one on one. Deulofeu appealed for a shove from behind by Alexander-Arnold, but there was nothing in it. He hit the shot well but it was too close to Alisson, who is brilliant in one-on-one situations. He reminds me a little of Peter Schmeichel in the way his presence unsettles attackers as they run through on goal. Mane was a millimetre offside. Shame as it was a lovely goal - a fierce cross from Shaqiri on the left, and an emphatic flicked header from Mane at the near post. VAR check Mane may be offside here. The best attacker in the world scores another superb goal. 48 min Another chance for Watford! Sarr plays a one-two with Doucoure and slides a close-range shot from a tight angle that is smothered by Alisson. Deeney was screaming for a ball into the six-yard box. 47 min \u201cDavid, I am in the Irish American sports bar,\u201d says Keith Dugdale. \u201cLooks like I need a half-time taxi. Thanks to the Guardian for providing the Vietnam blind-dating service.\u201d It\u2019s what we do best. 46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half. Half-time reading Peep peep! Well, that was a bit odd. Liverpool lead through Mo Salah\u2019s splendid goal, but Watford had the two clearest chances of the game either side of that. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min \u201cRob,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cI think it\u2019s lovely that the Guardian is bringing people like Keith Dugdale and David Baines together. Can I have a go? Is anyone else out there watching the game while slumped on a couch in last night\u2019s clothes in South Carolina?\u201d 44 min It\u2019s all happening now! Salah plays in Mane, who stabs the ball over the outrushing Foster on the edge of the area before being crowded out by Kabasele. 43 min Henderson is booked for pulling back the dangerous Deulofeu. 42 min: Watford miss another great chance! It\u2019s another shocking miskick. Deulofeu skinned Alexander-Arnold on the left of the area and fizzed a low cross-shot into the six-yard box. The diving Alisson pushed it out as far as Sarr, eight yards from goal, and he shanked the bouncing ball so badly that it flew off the side of his boot at a 90-degree angle. 40 min You see what happens, Nigel? You see what happens if you win a corner against this Liverpool side? Watford won a corner after that Doucoure chance, and 15 seconds later they were behind. The corner was half cleared towards Firmino, who improvised superbly to volley the loose ball over his head to Mane. He moved it down the inside-left channel to Salah, who Cruyff-turned away from Kiko Femenia on the edge of the area and toed a right-footed curler that drifted into the far corner. Brilliant goal. A classic Liverpool counter-attack! 37 min: Great chance for Watford! They should be ahead. Sarr played a nice pass into space for Capoue down the right. He moved into the area and carefully picked out Doucoure, who miskicked completely in front of goal. 35 min Firmino twists Kabasele inside out to win a corner. Nothing comes of it. This has been a dog of a game so far, devised and hosted by Nigel Pearson. He\u2019ll be thrilled with how Watford have played. 34 min \u201cAlright, Rob,\u201d says Adam Griffiths. \u201cIn this crazy, upside down state of flux/fluxed world in what we live the MBM is a rare constant. So cheers to you and your fellow MBMers for the sterling work you do, and a Merry Christmas/Happy Hannukah/kick-ass Kwanzaa/tiptop Tet to all the listeners out there in MBM-land.\u201d Cheers Adam. Merry Christmas to all you listeners! 33 min Doucoure breaks down the left and into the area before crossing low into the six-yard box. Van Dijk takes up a perfect position and lumps it clear. 32 min Liverpool are missing the relentless threat of Andy Robertson on the left. They should still win comfortably; they just need to be patient . 28 min Watford are working so hard without the ball, and will be really pleased with how the game has gone so far. It\u2019s hard to see them sustaining this for 90 minutes, but it\u2019s been an encouraging start for Nigel Pearson. 27 min Salah falls over in the area under challenge from Kabasele. Nothing doing. I don\u2019t think it was a dive, since you asked. It certainly wasn\u2019t a penalty. 26 min \u201cI\u2019m a Watford fan in the States getting up at 5 a.m. local time and thinking it will be a miracle if the Orns keep it within three,\u201d says Shaun Kuter. \u201cNo one ever accused me of being smart.\u201d It\u2019s the hope of a noble 2-0 defeat that kills you. 25 min Salah scurries infield from the right wing and flips a curling shot well wide of the far post. Every goalkick allows Watford to waste a bit more time; the crowd and Liverpool players are getting a bit irritated. 24 min Hughes is harshly booked for a foul on Henderson. Moments later, Mane hooks an optimistic volley over his shoulder and the bar from the edge of the box. 23 min It\u2019s raining shots! Will Hughes surges forward from midfield and drives a left-footed shot a few yards wide from just outside the box. Alisson had it covered but it was a purposeful run. 23 min Mane\u2019s deep cross is half cleared to Henderson, who slaps the bouncing ball into orbit from 12 yards. It was an awkward ball to hit on the run. I think that\u2019s the first shot of the match at either end. 21 min Deulofeu wins a corner for Watford, and walks over to take it at approximately 0.0002 miles per hour. More boos. 20 min \u201cSitting in fast response ambulance thanking my lucky stars I\u2019ve got the BT Sport app!\u201d says Richard Howes. \u201cAnd hoping south London will be quiet for the upcoming 90 mins. At some point will Liverpool rest van Dijk? Hopefully they\u2019ll win. I need something to cheer me up after Thursday\u2019s results... and that\u2019s not a reference to the Europa League games!\u201d Mason Greenwood does look good though, eh. As for van Dijk, he plays with a resting heart rate so I doubt he needs a rest. It\u2019s telling that he is the one player who hasn\u2019t been left out in the last few weeks. 18 min Watford have already started timewasting. There are a few boos as Mariappa delays a throw-in, and their new coach Nigel Pearson breaks into a gentle smile that says, \u2018I could not give a solitary flip what any of you think.\u2019 16 min Alexander-Arnold is starting to threaten. There\u2019s a greater onus on him today in the absence of the rested Andy Robertson. 15 min \u201cWhat bar is Keith Dugdale (6 mins) in?\u201d says David Baines. \u201cI\u2019m watching it in Cheers, the Hanoi Reds home bar.\u201d 13 min Alexander-Arnold, roaming infield, plays a dangerous through ball towards Salah that is crucially intercepted by the sliding Cathcart. 11 min Milner plays a neat one-two with Mane, only to overrun the ball. It was another neat touch from Mane, who for my money is the best attacker in the world right now. 10 min \u201cIt\u2019ll take a better stats person than me, but if we take the best second halves of a season for Manchester City and Leicester City and then take Liverpool\u2019s worst (okay, we\u2019re not quite at 19 games yet), Liverpool surely cruise home regardless?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cPeople keep puffing air into the title race balloon, but it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d No, no chance, unless Liverpool lose van Dijk, Mane, Robertson, Alexander-Arnold and Alisson to long-term injuries, and inexplicably replace Jurgen Klopp with Terry Christian. Even if Manchester City win their remaining 22 games, they won\u2019t catch Liverpool. 9 min Liverpool are slowly getting into their work. There\u2019s no real atmosphere, as is often the case with early kick-offs. 6 min \u201cMy 24-year-old son still has not seen Liverpool win the league,\u201d says Keith Dugdale. \u201cSo here I am in a bar in Hanoi, beers in hand and still nervous of the game despite the opposition and our home record. At least mathematically we can\u2019t be relegated. Next step is Champs League qualification.\u201d I used to think I was a pessimist, but I\u2019ve got nothing on Liverpool fans this season. You\u2019re the best team in the world and are going to win the league by March. Relax. Fakkin enjoy it. 5 min Watford almost take the lead! Sarr\u2019s superb low cross from the right just evades the stretching Deeney in front of goal. He went with his wrong foot, the right, and made no contact with the ball. 3 min It\u2019s been a quiet start to the game, with Liverpool yet to threaten. It gives me no pleasure to say this, but I think we have to ask a difficult question: has Jurgen Klopp taken Liverpool as far as he can? 2 min \u201cAs a lifelong Watford fan,\u201d says Mark Hawkins, \u201cshould I be ashamed at the fact I have substituted Watford players for Liverpool players in my Fantasy Football team?\u201d The only thing you should be ashamed of is putting an Emma Bunton song in my head. 1 min Peep peep! Watford kick off from left to right. It\u2019s a lovely day in Liverpool. Little brisk. The teams emerge from the tunnel, with Liverpool\u2019s players looking relaxed and content. What have they got to be so pleased about? \u201cI\u2019m also unsure whether Steve Alvey is being serious or not, but I do absolutely see the point!\u201d sniffs Matt Dony. \u201cYes, yes, I know the numbers, I\u2019ve seen the table, I\u2019m well aware of the probabilities. And yet, and yet. Honestly, at this point, I don\u2019t know what Liverpool could possibly do to make me stop feeling The Fear. I wish I had your confidence, Rob. (And charisma. And integrity. And good looks...)\u201d Definitely serious. The first email of the day \u201cLiverpool\u2019s last good chance to close the goal difference on Leicester before the Club World Cup and a run of hard league matches,\u201d says Steve Alvey. \u201cAn important detail as I expect they will drop points somewhere.\u201d I\u2019ve read this email 471 times and I\u2019ve still no idea whether it\u2019s serious or flippant. Pre-match reading Liverpool (4-2-3-1) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Milner; Henderson, Wijnaldum; Shaqiri, Firmino, Mane; Salah. Substitutes: Adrian, Robertson, Williams, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Origi. Watford (4-2-3-1) Foster; Mariappa, Cathcart, Kabasele, Kiko Femenia; Doucoure, Capoue; Sarr, Hughes, Deulofeu; Deeney. Substitutes: Gomes, Foulquier, Dawson, Chalobah, Quina, Gray, Success. Referee Andre Marriner. Hello and welcome to live coverage of Liverpool v Watford from Anfield. You know the context: top v bottom (or 2nd v 13th if you\u2019re into the whole xG thing), champions-elect v Championship-bound, etc, etc. Nothing speaks of the differences between these sides quite like the number two: that\u2019s how many points Liverpool have dropped in the Premier League this season, and how many managers Watford have sacked. Their third boss of the season, Nigel Pearson, takes charge for the first time today. Even the ostriches know Watford are in serious trouble, though there has been enough encouragement in some of their performances to suggest they are not yet a lost cause. Their great escape may have to wait until next week, when they host Manchester United, because Liverpool\u2019s home form is terrifying. In the last two years their Premier League record at Anfield is P37 W33 D4 L0. Oh, and Watford\u2019s last three visits have ended 0-5, 0-5 and 1-6. Godspeed, gents. Kick off is at 12.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>When Aung San Suu Kyi rose to denounce genocide charges against her country at the \u201cworld court\u201d last week, three victims of Myanmar\u2019s ethnic violence were sitting close behind the Nobel peace prize winner \u2013 disbelieving and seething with anger.</p> <p>Hamida Khatun, Yousuf Ali and Hasina Begum had travelled from the sprawling Kutupalong refugee camp outside Cox\u2019s Bazar in Bangladesh to sit on the legal delegation attending the International Court of Justice\u2019s emergency hearing in The Hague, in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Only lawyers were allowed to address the 17 judges during the three-day session in the United Nations\u2019 highest tribunal. The exiled Rohingya Muslims had to sit in silence, stifling their emotions.</p> <p>Khatun, 50, and Ali, 46, voted for Aung San Suu Kyi in 2010 when, after 15 years of house arrest, she represented a figure of democratic hope defying the military dictatorship. </p> <p>In the 2017 Myanmar military \u201cclearance operations\u201d targeting the Rohingya, however, Khatun\u2019s husband disappeared and her friends were murdered; Ali was tortured and sexually assaulted by police officers he knew.</p> <p>Only outside the court could they reveal the extent of their disenchantment. Khatun said she had been tempted to launch a physical attack. Ali admitted it had been difficult to sit quietly. Begum, now 22 but too young to vote in 2010, declared she could have \u201ceaten\u201d the Myanmar leader.

The violence had been triggered by terrorist attacks from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa), she said. The ICJ is now considering its judgment.</p> <p>Speaking through translators after the hearing, Khatun said: \u201cShe knows what happened but she is doing nothing. I felt very angry in the court. I wished I could have attacked her. I wanted to point out these were young children that were killed, women who were raped and babies burnt alive on fires.</p> <p>\u201cWe initially had hope because she was persecuted a long time and she was like a hostage, a victim, so we voted for her and expected something good. But I don\u2019t think she turned out well.

Where have our children gone? If they haven\u2019t committed these atrocities, then bring them back.

      "bodyText": "When Aung San Suu Kyi rose to denounce genocide charges against her country at the \u201cworld court\u201d last week, three victims of Myanmar\u2019s ethnic violence were sitting close behind the Nobel peace prize winner \u2013 disbelieving and seething with anger. Hamida Khatun, Yousuf Ali and Hasina Begum had travelled from the sprawling Kutupalong refugee camp outside Cox\u2019s Bazar in Bangladesh to sit on the legal delegation attending the International Court of Justice\u2019s emergency hearing in The Hague, in the Netherlands. Only lawyers were allowed to address the 17 judges during the three-day session in the United Nations\u2019 highest tribunal. The exiled Rohingya Muslims had to sit in silence, stifling their emotions. Khatun, 50, and Ali, 46, voted for Aung San Suu Kyi in 2010 when, after 15 years of house arrest, she represented a figure of democratic hope defying the military dictatorship. In the 2017 Myanmar military \u201cclearance operations\u201d targeting the Rohingya, however, Khatun\u2019s husband disappeared and her friends were murdered; Ali was tortured and sexually assaulted by police officers he knew. Only outside the court could they reveal the extent of their disenchantment. Khatun said she had been tempted to launch a physical attack. Ali admitted it had been difficult to sit quietly. Begum, now 22 but too young to vote in 2010, declared she could have \u201ceaten\u201d the Myanmar leader. All three were convinced she was lying. The claim that Myanmar\u2019s military carried out mass murder, rape and destruction of Rohingya Muslim communities was brought by the Gambia, a west African state that belongs to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The country\u2019s attorney general and justice minister, Abubacarr Marie Tambadou, urged what is known as the \u201cworld court\u201d to impose protective \u201cprovisional measures\u201d to prevent further killings and genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose official title is the state counsellor of Myanmar, responded to the accusation by dismissing it as an \u201cincomplete and misleading factual picture of the situation\u201d. The violence had been triggered by terrorist attacks from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa), she said. The ICJ is now considering its judgment. Speaking through translators after the hearing, Khatun said: \u201cShe knows what happened but she is doing nothing. I felt very angry in the court. I wished I could have attacked her. I wanted to point out these were young children that were killed, women who were raped and babies burnt alive on fires. \u201cWe initially had hope because she was persecuted a long time and she was like a hostage, a victim, so we voted for her and expected something good. But I don\u2019t think she turned out well. She was not being truthful.\u201d Khatun now lives in a tarpaulin hut in Kutupalong with the surviving members of her family. \u201cMy community asked me to speak out and not be scared of her,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf [Aung San Suu Kyi] is saying nothing happened, then where is my husband? Where have our children gone? If they haven\u2019t committed these atrocities, then bring them back. We want to return to our homeland with the protection of UN security forces.\u201d Begum was attacked and her husband killed when the Tatmadaw, Myanmar\u2019s military, invaded her village, Chwe Pyin. Sitting two metres away from Aung San Suu Kyi in court, she felt a rising sense of fury as she listened to her deliver a formal address in the elegant courtroom that is decorated with stained-glass windows, Persian carpets and gilt chandeliers. \u201cShe was denying everything,\u201d said a distraught Begum. \u201cShe won the Nobel peace prize. If she\u2019s a good leader, how can she deny such atrocities? I wanted to eat her, consume her.And she is a woman. The leader of Bangladesh [Sheikh Hasina] is also a woman, but she treats her people well. \u201cAung San Suu Kyi could have stopped the military, but she didn\u2019t. She has come to support the army.\u201d Begum is this weekend returning to her hut in Kutupalong where her two young children no longer have a father. Ali managed to escape with his six children when he fled his home in Nayain Chaung. His father, who was not able to walk, was killed, he said. His brother\u2019s wife, who had three children, had been raped and died a week after crossing the border. Ali\u2019s first problems with the authorities came in July 2017.

Grime\u2019s favourite insult \u2013 \u201csuck your mum\u201d \u2013 recurs a handful of times, and the busily polyrhythmic Superheroes works as an extended shout out to black British talent, name-checking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/malorie-blackman\" title=\"\">Malorie Blackman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUPSNdmFew\" title=\"\">Dave</a>.</p> <p>But pugnacious localism is only part of Stormzy\u2019s appeal. <em>Heavy Is </em><em>the Head</em> once again highlights the personal downsides of recognition. Weariness is nothing new in hip-hop \u2013 rappers have been counting the cost of being the boss for decades. <em>Gang Signs &amp; Prayer</em>, too, made it clear that Michael Omari felt ambivalent about the noblesse oblige of starriness.</p> <p>Stormzy, though, manages to keep this tired trope fresh. His regrets are legion: the friends for whom he was not there, the street pain from which he is now just a little removed, \u201cthe little things\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re sayin\u2019 I\u2019m the voice of young black youth, I say \u2018yeah, cool\u2019 and bun my zoot,\u201d he eye-rolls on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBwaflYUYrM\" title=\"\">Crown</a>. While many artists spark up as an act of hedonism or rebellion, Stormzy often smokes his weed in an act of self-medication. There are repeated pleas throughout the album for self-care \u2013 to take time out, to remember to breathe, not to let one\u2019s dreams disrupt one\u2019s sleep too much. Exasperation at being misunderstood or misrepresented is never far away, though. \u201cI\u2019m not the poster boy for mental health!\u201d Stormzy exclaims at one point. Another track seethes at the flak Stormzy received for starting a Cambridge scholarship for BAME students (\u201cit\u2019s not anti-white it\u2019s pro-black,\u201d he points out).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e013c2f5df42227bb0a8d643282473879b38fe31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e013c2f5df42227bb0a8d643282473879b38fe31/0_0_2483_3500/709.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy performs at Capital\u2019s Jingle Bell Ball with Seat at London\u2019s O2 Arena earlier this month.\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stormzy performs at Capital\u2019s Jingle Bell Ball with Seat at London\u2019s O2 Arena earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all that Stormzy is well able to carry the weight of representing not just south London, British blackness and now the UK creative industries as well, his game does drop sharply on one key track. It is tempting to hear Lessons as an extended apology to Stormzy\u2019s ex, the broadcaster Maya Jama \u2013 the two split up earlier this year amid rumours of his infidelity. (That narrative seems borne out by lines like \u201cYou gave me the world and I gave you disrespect\u201d.) But Stormzy can only muster sentimental prose here, rather than memorable poetry \u2013 a common problem when aggressive rhymers find themselves out of water, floundering in their \u201cfeels\u201d. Still: we sorely need better flows about love, not strings of cliches.</p> <p>Bum notes are relatively few, however. The 50-odd minutes of <em>Heavy Is the Head </em>passes in a blur of street status and lyrical power, tempered by nuanced considerations of sacrifice. One reason the crown feels so heavy on Stormzy\u2019s head is that he is acutely aware of the shoulders on which he stands, of the timing that is one aspect to his success. So many previous MCs enjoyed chart heat without becoming national treasures. Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Lethal Bizzle, Skepta and Kano have all made bids for the crown at one time or another, all too often with the club-grime hybrids that marked the decade where MCs could not perform live due to the Metropolitan police\u2019s notorious, now defunct <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41946915\" title=\"\">Form 696 policy</a>.</p> <p>Ours is an often bewildering era, but that grime is now an export, and that Stormzy is the country\u2019s unofficial poet laureate, is a particularly shiny silver lining.</p>",

It is a pointed rhetorical flourish from a man who mostly wears the mantle of street poet-king like a tracksuit made of fine silk. It was, arguably, only a matter of time before grime threw up its true crossover star. That the genre should have found one as analytical, mould-breaking and assured as Stormzy is a particular thrill. His second album continues seamlessly on from 2017\u2019s landmark No 1 Gang Signs &amp; Prayer. If anything, Heavy Is the Head grandstands harder, sings more sweetly and examines the rapper\u2019s own conscience even more attentively than before. First and foremost, this is a hyper-confident return \u2013 top-heavy on front, stats and burns. Joining Wiley Flow and Vossi Bop \u2013 two of four strong pre-album tracks \u2013 are just shy of half a dozen more cocky tracks, all of which re-establish Stormzy\u2019s verbal pre-eminence with panache.

Of course, Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr is \u201cyoung, black, fly and handsome\u201d too (Handsome), as photogenic on the cover of GQ as he is on the cover of Time magazine, being profiled as a Next Generation Leader. On the unapologetic Pop Boy, Stormzy notes that he has become a London \u201ctop boy\u201d without actually having to become a gangland supremo. That top boy reference now works internationally too, thanks to the recent Netflix reboot of the Channel 4 crime saga of that name. If Gang Signs &amp; Prayer enabled Stormzy to headline Glastonbury, Heavy Is the Head makes a bid for Stateside attention too: never before has UK hip-hop had such traction there. The spaciousness, punch and depth of these productions is telling, but it is a mark of the album\u2019s artistic integrity that Stormzy manages to transcend genre (again) without sacrificing his core griminess, or losing too much in the way of accent, word choice, content or theme.

Grime\u2019s favourite insult \u2013 \u201csuck your mum\u201d \u2013 recurs a handful of times, and the busily polyrhythmic Superheroes works as an extended shout out to black British talent, name-checking Malorie Blackman and Dave. But pugnacious localism is only part of Stormzy\u2019s appeal. Heavy Is the Head once again highlights the personal downsides of recognition. Weariness is nothing new in hip-hop \u2013 rappers have been counting the cost of being the boss for decades. Gang Signs &amp; Prayer, too, made it clear that Michael Omari felt ambivalent about the noblesse oblige of starriness. Stormzy, though, manages to keep this tired trope fresh. His regrets are legion: the friends for whom he was not there, the street pain from which he is now just a little removed, \u201cthe little things\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re sayin\u2019 I\u2019m the voice of young black youth, I say \u2018yeah, cool\u2019 and bun my zoot,\u201d he eye-rolls on Crown. While many artists spark up as an act of hedonism or rebellion, Stormzy often smokes his weed in an act of self-medication. There are repeated pleas throughout the album for self-care \u2013 to take time out, to remember to breathe, not to let one\u2019s dreams disrupt one\u2019s sleep too much. Exasperation at being misunderstood or misrepresented is never far away, though. \u201cI\u2019m not the poster boy for mental health!\u201d Stormzy exclaims at one point. Another track seethes at the flak Stormzy received for starting a Cambridge scholarship for BAME students (\u201cit\u2019s not anti-white it\u2019s pro-black,\u201d he points out). For all that Stormzy is well able to carry the weight of representing not just south London, British blackness and now the UK creative industries as well, his game does drop sharply on one key track. It is tempting to hear Lessons as an extended apology to Stormzy\u2019s ex, the broadcaster Maya Jama \u2013 the two split up earlier this year amid rumours of his infidelity. (That narrative seems borne out by lines like \u201cYou gave me the world and I gave you disrespect\u201d.) But Stormzy can only muster sentimental prose here, rather than memorable poetry \u2013 a common problem when aggressive rhymers find themselves out of water, floundering in their \u201cfeels\u201d. Still: we sorely need better flows about love, not strings of cliches. Bum notes are relatively few, however. The 50-odd minutes of Heavy Is the Head passes in a blur of street status and lyrical power, tempered by nuanced considerations of sacrifice. One reason the crown feels so heavy on Stormzy\u2019s head is that he is acutely aware of the shoulders on which he stands, of the timing that is one aspect to his success. So many previous MCs enjoyed chart heat without becoming national treasures. Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Lethal Bizzle, Skepta and Kano have all made bids for the crown at one time or another, all too often with the club-grime hybrids that marked the decade where MCs could not perform live due to the Metropolitan police\u2019s notorious, now defunct Form 696 policy. Ours is an often bewildering era, but that grime is now an export, and that Stormzy is the country\u2019s unofficial poet laureate, is a particularly shiny silver lining.",

      "body": "<p>The last time England set off on a winter tour at election time they were also heading for South Africa \u2013 in October 1964.

Female reporters do it <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-jesse-watters-female-reporters-sleeping-with-sources-happens-all-the-time\">\u201call the time\u201d</a> in order to get exclusive stories, according to the sentient jar of hair wax otherwise known as Fox News host Jesse Watters.</p> <p>Watters made this disgusting, and completely ludicrous, claim on Wednesday while discussing the backlash to Clint Eastwood\u2019s new movie Richard Jewell. The film is based on the real-life story of an eponymous security guard wrongfully accused of planting a bomb at the 1996 Olympic Games and portrays a female journalist sleeping with an FBI agent in order to land an exclusive story.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing though: there appears to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/12/crass-and-contemptible-is-clint-eastwoods-new-movie-built-on-a-lie\">absolutely no evidence</a> that the journalist in question, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde), slept with her FBI source in order to break the story that Jewell was a suspect in the incident.</p> <p>Let\u2019s just recap that shall we? Warner Brothers made a movie about a man whose reputation was unfairly ruined by a careless FBI and a media ecosystem more interested in rushing out a good story than establishing the truth. And, in order to spice things up, they casually besmirched the reputation of a female reporter. Because, as we all know, women aren\u2019t three-dimensional human beings in the same way men are. Their reputations don\u2019t matter. Their stories don\u2019t matter.</p> <p>What makes all this even more infuriating is that Scruggs isn\u2019t even around to stick up for herself; she died in 2001. The AJC, however, has staunchly defended her and asked Warner Brothers to add a disclaimer to the film acknowledging the whole sex-for-information thing was a fictionalization. Warner Brothers has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/13/entertainment/olivia-wilde-richard-jewell-kathy-scruggs/index.html\">refused to do this</a>, issuing a statement saying it was \u201cbased on a wide range of highly credible source material\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m highly skeptical that there is any credible evidence that Scruggs slept with her sources. If there was, then I reckon it would already be in the public domain. After all, there\u2019s nothing the world loves more than slut-shaming women. Just look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/02/katie-hill-resignation-women-politics-sexuality\">Katie Hill</a>. Just look at Monica Lewinsky. Just look at Janet Jackson, whose <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/janet-jacksons-family-have-never-forgiven-justin-timberlake-for-2004-nipplegate-super-bowl-2236398\">career suffered for years</a> after the world caught a glimpse of her nipple at the Superbowl.</p> <p>The conversation around Richard Jewell, and Watters\u2019 sweepingly sexist comments, serve as yet another reminder that women are damned if they do and they\u2019re damned if they don\u2019t. They don\u2019t get excused for their sexual transgressions in the same way men do; they get branded for life. What\u2019s more, women don\u2019t even have to sleep with anyone to get labelled a slut or accused of using their sexuality to get ahead. As the editor of the AJC has noted, the idea that women sleep their way to the top is \u201cthe worst kind of trope\u201d. And not only is it sexist and insulting, it\u2019s nonsensical. After all, if women everywhere are cynically sleeping their way to the top, wouldn\u2019t there be rather more women at the top?</p> <h2>Megan Rapinoe calls \u2018fucking bullshit\u2019 on that</h2> <p>The soccer star, who was recently named Sports Illustrated sportsperson of the year, is not impressed by a study that shows #MeToo has made men scared to hire women. \u201cWell, women are afraid to be raped, sexually assaulted, sexually harassed, kept out of jobs, fired from jobs, moved laterally their entire career,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/11/21percent-of-men-are-afraid-to-hire-women-megan-rapinoe-isnt-having-it.html\">Rapinoe said.</a> \u201cHonestly, I call fucking bullshit on that.\u201d</p> <h2>Harvey Weinstein reaches $25m settlement with over 30 women</h2> <p>The New York Times reports that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/11/harvey-weinstein-settlement-women\">settlement, which would bring multiple civil lawsuits to an end, would be paid by insurance companies</a>. Weinstein himself wouldn\u2019t have to pay a single penny out of his pocket or admit wrongdoing. But this doesn\u2019t mean he gets to dodge accountability: his criminal trial will start early next year.</p> <h2>Finland\u2019s Sanna Marin becomes world\u2019s youngest serving prime minister</h2> <p>Marin, 34, is Finland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/finland-anoints-sanna-martin-34-as-worlds-youngest-serving-prime-minister\">third female prime minister</a>. She was <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/world/2019/12/10/finlands-new-prime-minister-sanna-marin-34-was-raised-two-moms\">raised by two mums</a> and was the first person in her family to go to university. They\u2019re clearly doing something right in Finland: Marin heads a coalition containing four other parties \u2013 all of which are led by women.</p> <h2>Finnish finance minister runs dodgy Instagram poll</h2> <p>They\u2019re not doing everything right in Finland. Finance minister Katri Kulmuni recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/astroehlein/status/1205244530993315843?s=21\">thought it would be appropriate</a> to run an Instagram poll on whether Finland should repatriate \u201cjust children\u201d or \u201cchildren and mothers\u201d from Isis camps in Syria. Andrew Stroehlein, European media director at Human Rights Watch tweeted: \u201cA state should respect the rights of its citizens in all cases, not put life-and-death decisions about those citizens to a public referendum on social media. What\u2019s next, public hangings based on the volume of stadium cheers?\u201d</p> <h2>Chilean anti-rape anthem becomes international phenomenon</h2> <p>In case you missed it, do watch this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/06/chilean-anti-rape-anthem-becomes-international-feminist-phenomenon\">incredible Chilean protest song</a>.</p> <h2>Women are majority of US medical students for first time ever</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.today.com/health/women-make-majority-u-s-medical-students-first-time-t169922\">Which is a big deal</a> because studies show that women do better when they are treated by women. They\u2019re more likely to survive a heart attack and they\u2019re less likely to have to return to the hospital for more treatment.</p> <h2>Brazilian man pretends to be his mother to take driving test</h2> <p>After Heitor M\u00e1rcio Schiave\u2019s mother failed her driving test for the third time, he had a brilliant idea. The 43-year-old would dress up as his elderly mother and take the test on her behalf. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/12/brazilian-man-dresses-as-mother-to-take-driving-test\">Alas, he was found out</a>. And, to add insult injury, the driving instructor says he failed the test anyway.</p> <h2>Thousands of \u2018penis fish\u2019 wash up on California beach</h2> <p>Somehow this feels like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/12/penis-fish-fat-inkeeper-worms-california-beach\">really fitting end to 2019</a>.</p>",

I was wrong about that: Judith liked meeting people.

Hello. \u201cAnyway, back to Mark Waugh. One of the great things about live sport is those moments you were there for and no one else knows about. Sometime in the 1990s at the MCG, smallish crowd, play meandering along, I saw Mark Waugh play the greatest shot I have ever seen. He unfurled \u2013 the dictionary should have a picture of it under \u2018unfurl\u2019 a cover drive so sublime that here I am 25 years later thinking about it, dreaming about it. I swear it hit the square boundary at the \u2018G two seconds later and bounced back 30 metres. Everyone around me gasped and looked at each other in disbelief. Waugh, obviously, just wandered down the pitch, gave it a tap, and got ready for the next ball. The greatest piece of ephemeral art ever.\u201d <br></p> <p>I now <em>really</em> want to work out the innings. It can\u2019t have been the ton against the West Indies in 1992-93, which was all about the shots he played over third man - much to the Windies\u2019 annoyance. Maybe 1999 against India when he was on the cusp of losing his place? I remember that as an especially lovely half century. <strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df4c57a8f08c3972263a356\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T11:23:23.030Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>43rd over: Australia 132-2 (Burns 51, Smith 1)</strong> Leg slip straight in there for Smith, Wagner immediately attacking that line to him from over the wicket.

And look, I\u2019ve not been immune from that thinking myself when on tour. In this case, I\u2019m sure that chatter is mostly due to the orthodoxy of bowling at night whenever possible, even if the dark session is shorter at Perth with their 1pm start (Adelaide is 2pm for pink-ball Tests, by comparison).<strong> </strong>Needless to say, it won\u2019t be happening.

That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous, by the way, but the assessment is spot on - we\u2019ve seen this film before when it comes to the opener. Southee bends his back in response to the boundary-ball, angling back off the seam and nearly beating the inside edge, falling over in his follow-through, such was the effort.

Taylor c Smith b Lyon 80</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A brilliant spell of bowling by Lyon! He\u2019s been all over Taylor, making the batmsan look increasingly anxious. Taylor misses a sweep, which is his shot to get off strike. Lyon looks especially dangerous when the ball doesn\u2019t turn, going on past Taylor\u2019s edge. Taylor nails a rare half-volley but Travis Head dives and saves it one-handed at cover before bouncing up and hitting the stumps direct, nearly snaring Taylor as the batsman dives back in. That\u2019s a team-lifting effort, and frustrating for the batsman. So Taylor, back in his shell, just prods in defence at the last ball of the over, a delivery full enough to reach for and drive, but instead the batsman hangs back and when the ball doesn\u2019t turn it takes his edge to slip! Chalk up part of that wicket to Travis Head, but it was exceptional from Lyon. You could feel the tension building for Taylor, and now it breaks.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df479e08f085eda5c10780c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T06:00:15.577Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>45th over: New Zealand 147-6 (Taylor 80, de Grandhomme 15) </strong>Marnus settling into his work, and he\u2019s getting some turn with his leggies.

Labuschagne\u2019s leg-breaks will be the next on the menu. Jeet Raval\u2019s part-time stuff got substantial turn yesterday. Marnus is more of a skiddy bowler, faster through the air and with more topspin. He drags down first ball and Taylor pulls two runs, denied two more by a good diving save behind square. Taylor cuts a run next ball. I wonder how long de Grandhomme can restrain himself from trying to put Labuschagne in the stands. He drives a single along the ground first up. Taylor cuts twice and should have eight runs really, but finds backward point both times. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df475468f08c3972263a216\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T05:43:07.357Z\">5.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>40th over: New Zealand 134-6 (Taylor 74, de Grandhomme 8) </strong>Cummins carries on with the short-pitched attack to Taylor, too much angle on these bouncers from the right-armer which go across Taylor and almost outside leg stump. Tim Paine is going as far towards a Douglas Jardine field as the rules allow: two in the deep behind square leg, then three just in front, one next to the batsman for the edge off the pad, one at regulation square for the top edge, and one on the rope for the full-blooded pull. Regardless, Taylor keeps playing the shot. Not the smartest strategy given Australia\u2019s two premier quicks will need a break soon. But he gets a single to ground, then de Grandhomme slams a full ball past the bowler in the air for four. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df474238f085eda5c1077fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T05:37:56.607Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>39th over: New Zealand 129-6 (Taylor 73, de Grandhomme 4)</strong> Another single immediately for de Grandhomme from Starc, eased behind point, then Taylor is back on strike.

It is a barrage though, and Taylor <strong>gloves the ball just in front of slip!</strong> Fast from Starc, hitting Taylor\u2019s fingers on the bat handle and just dying before reaching Smith in the cordon! Good bowling. Taylor looks a little desperate as he takes on a pull shot next ball and meets fresh air, again looking every chance to glove down the leg side. <strong>Third time is also lucky,</strong> as he finally gets a pull shot out of the middle, Starc\u2019s bouncer not getting up above chest high, and <strong>Taylor clobbers four behind square.</strong> Then he bails out of another against a great short ball that zings over his front shoulder on its angle across him.

He\u2019s been landing the ball on a perfect length often today, and moving it into the right-handed batsmen. This time Watling is anticipating that inward movement, pushing to cover it, and the ball goes a bit the other way. Suddenly his hands are outside the line of his body and he\u2019s getting a thick inside edge back onto his stumps! Huge wicket, Watling can bat some seriously long hours in Test cricket.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df471518f087e8308e5dedc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T05:26:31.256Z\">5.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>37th over: New Zealand 119-5 (Taylor 68, Watling 2) </strong>Starc bowling with a bat-pad catcher on both sides of the wicket now, so the bowler has to do the fielding himself when Taylor pushes a run towards mid-on. Watling plays more decisively, a handsome off-drive for two as Starc pitches up. Wade doing the fielding. He might be called upon with the ball again today, with Australia short of seam options. Starc full again to Watling, with the short leg removed. There\u2019s some excitement behind the wicket as Watling misses his next drive, but the sound was bat hitting turf, missing ball by a distance.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df470cc8f085eda5c1077f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T05:20:44.363Z\">5.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>36th over: New Zealand 116-5 (Taylor 67, Watling 6) </strong>Cummins bowls a beauty.

Short down leg side again from Starc, and Taylor wafts a pull that doesn\u2019t threaten much except a glove to the keeper. Starc has a leg gully and a long leg behind square, then a short square leg and a deep square leg in front of the line. Only two fielders allowed behind square leg, as per the old Bodyline amended rules.</p> <p>All of that planning, then New Zealand <strong>nearly hand over a wicket with a run-out. </strong>Paine has made a mess of that. So did Taylor. He should have run himself out last night while batting with Williamson, and this time he burns Watling. Taylor knocks away a run to point, turns for the second, Watling honours the call, then Taylor bails out and turns back. Watling has to do the same, at the striker\u2019s end. He\u2019s miles out. He\u2019s gone. Lyon throws in. And then Paine, having come up to the stumps, fumbles the take. I think he was distracted by Labuschagne, who had run in from short leg to the stumps to try to take the ball as well. Between the two of them they mess up a straightforward chance, and Watling survives. He adds a single next ball like none of that ever happened.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df46dd68f08c3972263a1ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T05:11:28.475Z\">5.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>34th over: New Zealand 110-5 (Taylor 66, Watling 1) </strong>Pat Cummins starts from the other end, and his first ball is beautifully on the money.

His second, a similar line but seaming in from a slightly shorter length, taking a small nick from Watling\u2019s inside edge before thudding into the pad. Too high to prompt an appeal.

Taylor comes on strike and immediately Starc is bouncing him. Ricky Ponting on the TV is analysing vision from last night, saying that Taylor was least assured against the short ball. Took his eyes off it, often had his feet off the ground. That will likely be the mode of attack today then, and it is, though Starc bowls too much down the leg side. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df1d6a28f08f521712b4ad1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/geoff-lemon\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T04:44:54.365Z\">4.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Today is International Ross Taylor Day. He\u2019s the great hope for New Zealand to stay in this contest. New Zealand are five wickets down already, but both teams are short a bowler, with Josh Hazlewood doing his hamstring last night and Lockie Ferguson his calf. So a lot rides on Taylor\u2019s innings. If he can bat through the first wave of attack from Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc, then Australia won\u2019t have a huge amount in the way of reserves. It will come down to a spin focus with Nathan Lyon and the part-timer Marnus Labuschagne, though Lyon should get some bounce and turn out of this surface and could be the key bowler in his own right. <br></p> <p>But Taylor looked a million bucks last night after some early jitters between the wickets. He clouted his way to 66 as the wickets fell at the other end. He made 290 last time he played a Test in Perth, across the river at the Waca, and this year he\u2019s been in some of the best form of his life.<br></p> <p>If Taylor goes early today though, then NZ could be bundled out cheaply and would have to bowl again through the heat of the day, after doing that twice already. Australia would pile up a huge lead and then Lyon would have plenty to bowl at in the fourth innings. So a lot rides on this.</p> <p>If, contrarily, Taylor can bat long with BJ Watling, then New Zealand have the better bowling balance with a true all-rounder in Colin de Grandhomme to boost their attack. Starc was an irrepressible force last night, but it remains to be seen what he\u2019s like here during the day.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-14T04:51:50.957Z\">at 4.51am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Australia lead by 417 runs overnight. Of course, that\u2019s more than enough by any meaningful historical measure - indeed, the highest target chased in the fourth innings to win is 418. But it doesn\u2019t mean the Black Caps are giving up, or anything close to it. By fighting back in the final hour they have something else to take to Melbourne on Boxing Day, regardless of how this ultimately finishes. Righto, that\u2019s enough for me today. Enjoy your Saturday. Talk tomorrow! 57th over: Australia 167-6 (Wade 8, Cummins 1) Wagner misses his yorker and Wade takes advantage, clipping four runs. The short ball is where it is at though, Wade hit again on the body, this time his back. It spills away for a leg bye, the opponents sharing a playful glance. Cummins\u2019 turn, and he\u2019s beaten outside the off stump before getting off the mark with a push off his hip. Phew. Wade again, two balls to go... inside edge just short of the catcher at bat pad. So close. At last, to the final delivery of the day and it is defended. Well played, Matthew Wade. \u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d says Umpire Llong as stumps are called, the pair having another word. Nothing wrong with that. What a fantastic final hour, five wickets falling in a hurry. 56th over: Australia 161-6 (Wade 4, Cummins 0) Cummins knows how to tough out a difficult shift - we\u2019ve seen him do it plenty over his career so far. Too often, really. Southee is giving it his all from around the wicket - bouncers and yorkers. His opposing number finds a way to get safely to the finish line. One over to go. 55th over: Australia 160-6 (Wade 4, Cummins 0) Whoa, a waist-high full toss to start from Wagner to Wade. \u2018Sorry mate,\u2019 ala Pat Rafter in the follow through. It\u2019s the only time he\u2019s forced to use his bat in the over, happy - and quite correct - to leave everything else alone. 54th over: Australia 160-6 (Wade 4, Cummins 0) Ooooh, he\u2019s not far away from bowling Cummins aound his legs before scoring too. A lot of pundits wrote Southee off when he wasn\u2019t much of a fixture in the World Cup but he\u2019s very much back in business here. He completes the wicket maiden, his figures 4/62 making eight now for the match. Southee bowls the captain second ball! It\u2019s a beauty from around the wicket, pitching off-stump and darting back through the gate. What an hour this has been for New Zealand. Australia have now lost 5/29. 53rd over: Australia 160-5 (Wade 4, Paine 0) Wagner keeps it going, hitting Wade on the body with a bouncer that deceives the number five. There\u2019s a lot going on here - a knuckle ball that drops at just the right time, Wade getting down to it just in time. Back to Plan A, he\u2019s hit a second time in the over, this time on the arm. Compelling stuff. Kerry O\u2019Keeffe makes an excellent point on TV: play more hours of pink-ball Tests after dark. This is starting at 1pm, which is too early for mine. These games come to life after the lights go on. Perth is a tough sell on this front due to the time difference, but in Adelaide/Brisbane, push them back to 3pm? It\u2019s at least worth a look. 17,104 is the attendance. So, every day of this Test has had fewer people than the first three days of the most recent fixture played over at the WACA. But yes, I know that\u2019s not how the world works. Another wicket to the short ball! Far from menacing, he might even have taken the pace off it. It didn\u2019t get up but Head was committed to his stroke, helping the ball on the angle to the catcher on the 45. Australia are leading by 410 but they have lost 4/29. 52nd over: Australia 160-5 (Wade 4) 51st over: Australia 155-4 (Wade 4, Head 1) Head is off the mark second ball, putting Wade back in the hot seat and he\u2019s copping another accurate bouncer, deflecting off his shoulder into the gloves of Watling. The third time we\u2019ve seen that today. Another entertaining session to end the night, as it was on days one and two. Smith out again to the short ball! Wagner could not have telegraphed his intentions any more clearly so the former captain had a pop, but miscued the pull straight to the man at square leg. Well, then. 50th over: Australia 154-3 (Smith 16, Wade 4) Wade has waited and ducked in response to a barrage of short stuff to begin but he is comfortable enough to take on Southee this time around, off the mark with a forceful pull shot to the boundary. 49th over: Australia 149-3 (Smith 15, Wade 0) Wagner not far away at all from removing Smith with another ball that bites, jumping off the inside edge, just past the catcher at forward short leg. Sure enough, Wade cops two bouncers from Wagner as a welcoming gift. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi Peter Leybourne, hitting me up on the tweet. \u201cThinking about Steve Smith\u2019s last night catch reminded of the better one that Phil Simmons took at the SCG in mid 90s ODI Aus vs Windies. Caught Slater square drive. Australia won - Michael Bevan hitting the final ball to long on.\u201d The best bit about this is how you are essentially remembering NYD 1996 for Simmons\u2019 catch rather than Bevan\u2019s innings. I hope that Big Phil did his wicket-celebration fist pumps after the snaffle. Until my career was cut short (I\u2019ll be back), it was how I greeted each scalp. 48th over: Australia 148-3 (Smith 14, Wade 0) Southee bumps Wade to begin, left-hander ducking. This plays out again two balls later but the ball keeps so low that it only just clears the stumps ala McGrath vs Tendulkar 20 summers ago. This is what we mean when discussing Test pitches, wanting them to change in their complexion as the five days evolve. Well bowled. Wicket maiden. Southee from around the wicket gets one to bite at Burns, who plays with both feet off the ground into the hands of Nicholls at gully. He takes a sharp, low catch. The Black Caps aren\u2019t for giving up. 47th over: Australia 148-2 (Burns 53, Smith 14) Oooh here we go, here we go, here we here we go. I should have predicted this: Steve Smith\u2019s crosscourt forehand, which was only ever see from him in Test cricket when Australia are piling on third innings declaration runs. He doesn\u2019t nail it this time but you can bet he will soon. Are people still seriously insisting that Australia declare tonight? I understand why former players on TV say it - they want to play golf. Fair enough. But why we do, as fans, urge the very early finish? 46th over: Australia 147-2 (Burns 52, Smith 14) Big lbw shout from Southee for Smith. But coming around the wicket, it\u2019s pitched outside leg and NZ don\u2019t have any reviews. More interestingly: it kept quite low. By contrast, the next one has spat at his hand. They\u2019ve pitched in very similar parts of the track. Smith whips the glove off to make sure his right index finger is still in tact, and it is. Smith being Smith, he hits the next ball for four, getting into position early to help Southee\u2019s bouncer on its way to the long leg rope. \u201cCan\u2019t help you out with the innings I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peter Salmon replies. \u201cWent to most of those matches. But I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t part of any innings that was otherwise memorable. A cameo 43 sort of knock. In fact even cameo makes it sound grander than it is in my memory. I imagine it as a Boon or a Steve Waugh getting maybe 116, and Mark just dropping by for a partnership of 70, either side of lunch.\u201d In that case, I\u2019ll take 1994. His 70-odd on Christmas Eve, which was day one of that Ashes Test, with the 25th a rest day. How quirky. 45th over: Australia 142-2 (Burns 52, Smith 10) I just can\u2019t see Smith taking Wagner\u2019s short one on again. If he did, and it got him out for the second time in this match, it\u2019d become a thing. Nah. \u201cSomeone just needs to channel Mark Greatbatch and bat for two days,\u201d writes Grant Marjoribanks. Oooh, I like this. \u201cExcept when he did it in Perth 30 years ago NZ were following on. And he didn\u2019t have to bat for two day/nights. Even Paddy would have have struggled if he\u2019d had to face Merv Hughes with a pink ball under lights.\u201d Let\u2019s have a look at the Great Man in the cordon against Australia. As it happens, given the topic of the previous over, snaffling ME Waugh. 44th over: Australia 140-2 (Burns 51, Smith 9) Southee\u2019s turn as Williamson continues to shake up his attack. Smith is watching, watching, watching then driving through cover for four. He\u2019s said he doesn\u2019t like the pink ball when it goes soft, but no such concerns here. And he goes again to finish, straight down the ground with more power, crashing into the boundary. Absolutely hammered. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Peter Salmon! Hello. \u201cAnyway, back to Mark Waugh. One of the great things about live sport is those moments you were there for and no one else knows about. Sometime in the 1990s at the MCG, smallish crowd, play meandering along, I saw Mark Waugh play the greatest shot I have ever seen. He unfurled \u2013 the dictionary should have a picture of it under \u2018unfurl\u2019 a cover drive so sublime that here I am 25 years later thinking about it, dreaming about it. I swear it hit the square boundary at the \u2018G two seconds later and bounced back 30 metres. Everyone around me gasped and looked at each other in disbelief. Waugh, obviously, just wandered down the pitch, gave it a tap, and got ready for the next ball. The greatest piece of ephemeral art ever.\u201d I now really want to work out the innings. It can\u2019t have been the ton against the West Indies in 1992-93, which was all about the shots he played over third man - much to the Windies\u2019 annoyance. Maybe 1999 against India when he was on the cusp of losing his place? I remember that as an especially lovely half century. 43rd over: Australia 132-2 (Burns 51, Smith 1) Leg slip straight in there for Smith, Wagner immediately attacking that line to him from over the wicket. Of course, he picked him up in the leg trap the first time around from around the wicket, caught at short fine. In turn, he\u2019s off the mark clipping off the pads to midwicket for one. The drinks break - and the bouncer - does it! Wagner had Labuschagne miscuing his pull shot within moments of walking to the crease, only for him to be put down. Not this time with Santner\u2019s safe hands at midwicket. Marnus\u2019 run of tons comes to an end. 42nd over: Australia 131-1 (Burns 51, Labuschagne 50) He can\u2019t be stopped! Certainly not by Santner, who isn\u2019t causing them any trouble early in this new spell. Marnus reaches the mark with a push to cover from his 79th delivery. Surely they give him the chance to now push on for fourth tons on the trot. Burns, too. DRINKS! 41st over: Australia 128-1 (Burns 50, Labuschagne 48) Wagner as he does best, all short balls and cutters in an effort to create a mistake from nothing. He pulled that off a few times in the first innings. To be fair, across the over he\u2019s called for two wides - bouncers that fly too high. But, to a point, that\u2019s the price of doing business like this. 40th over: Australia 125-1 (Burns 50, Labuschagne 47) We\u2019re driiiiiiifting. Labuschagne picks three off from the first over of Santner\u2019s new spell. 24 overs left, which they won\u2019t get in with 87 minutes left on the clock - including the extra half an hour. Out of a healthy twitter exchange about umpires hitting the deck, this is on top of the podium. From the famous 1966 Grand Final. 39th over: Australia 122-1 (Burns 50, Labuschagne 44) The Composer is back with his left arm short-and-awkward. Labuschagne gives the strike to Burns early in the over but he isn\u2019t tempted with the field spread out ready for any miscued pull or hook. The lead is now 372. 38th over: Australia 121-1 (Burns 50, Labuschagne 43) Yes, Joe. Is there more public goodwill towards any Australia player than there is Joe Burns? He brings up his half-century with a push to cover, one of five runs worked around the field off Southee in the over. He\u2019s faced 102 balls to raise his bat, striking six boundaries. Double it up! 37th over: Australia 116-1 (Burns 49, Labuschagne 39) Two more singles off CDG but the crowd and television coverage are mostly interested in the conventional beer snake. But security are having nothing of it, confiscating the cups. For a country priding itself on a knockabout disposition, we\u2019re obsessed with silly stuff like that. 36th over: Australia 114-1 (Burns 46, Labuschagne 38) A good five minutes taken out of the game with that delay, which will help New Zealand\u2019s top order, who surely won\u2019t want to bat tonight. Besides, a declaration would deny Marnus the chance for four Test tons in a row. Give us that, Tim. There are properly full in the crowd at Casino Stadium, now making a beer-carrier snake of sorts. Umpire down! Umpire Aleem Dar has copped a whack to the knee from Mitch Santner and we have a delay as a result. Tim Southee was picking up and throwing after racing to a ball at cover, which meant that Dar was getting out of the way at the danger end. But Santner was running to take the stumps and the accidental collision occured. Knee on knee contact saw the man in white hit the deck. The magic spray comes out, followed by strapping. I think he\u2019s going to be okay. 35th over: Australia 111-1 (Burns 46, Labuschagne 37) de Grandhomme is continuing to do his bit, onlt giving up a couple to Labuschagne when he\u2019s a tad too straight. Otherwise, spot on. 34th over: Australia 109-1 (Burns 46, Labuschagne 35) Southee replaces Santner but he runs keep coming, Labuschagne carving away over the cordon for four - no issues there. Burns is in on it as well, taking a couple in that third man direction before finishing with a cover drive for two more, where there is now a sweeper in place. Australia have gone at a run a ball for the last five overs. I know we dismissed it before tea, but, is this the behaviour of a team that might declare tonight? As Mark Waugh calculates, if they make 80 in the next 20 overs, that leaves eight overs tonight at the Black Caps with a 440-run lead. That might be tempting. If they get them all in. 33rd over: Australia 100-1 (Burns 42, Labuschagne 30) de Grandhomme gets through a quiet maiden to Burns. \u201cMorning/Evening Adam.\u201d Morning where I am at Guardian Towers, Brian Withington. Great to hear from you. \u201cWhere better than the OBO to find solace after a soul destroying UK general election? (I won\u2019t mention turkeys voting for Christmas in case an animal rights activist quite reasonably points out that\u2019s libelling turkeys.) Moving on, given how ominously good Aus are looking already, English cricket clearly needs to work on some disingenuous three word slogans before next Ashes. Channeling the genius of \u2018Take Back Control\u2019 and \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019, how about \u2018Take Wickets Cheaply\u2019 and \u2018Get More Runs\u2019?\u201d It might be all you have. As you say, they\u2019re getting very good again. 32nd over: Australia 100-1 (Burns 42, Labuschagne 30) Shot! 1000 runs in 2019 brought up by Labuschagne, going inside-out over cover to start Santner\u2019s new over. A lovely way to get to that milestone, averaging 72 along the way. And he\u2019s far from done yet. The 50 partnership is also now raised. Burns moves into the 40s with a further boundary, chopping hard with the spin into the turf, running away to the third man rope. The Australian 100 is up as well. The tweaker is under the pump, going at five an over. 31st over: Australia 90-1 (Burns 37, Labuschagne 25) de Grandhomme offers up a couple of rare sundries this time around, a wide down the legside to Labuschagne then overstepping in at Burns. The runs keep coming when the former deflects three through the relatively vacant cordon. It has loosened up a bit since the tea break, making the most this chance to pile on runs. 30th over: Australia 83-1 (Burns 36, Labuschagne 22) Santner is more dangerous when the ball isn\u2019t spinning right now, those the deliveries that are asking questions from this right-handed pair When there\u2019s turn, they\u2019re finding enough time to pick off runs. For those in the Tom Banton Fan Club (me): the TV coverage reports that the Somerset batsman hit 104 not out in Brisbane club cricket day... off 35 balls. He\u2019s playing for the Heat in the Big Bash soon. 29th over: Australia 79-1 (Burns 35, Labuschagne 19) de Grandhomme continues his pre-Tea spell. Burns pushes a single to cover then Labuschagne deals with the rest. No rush. Some big, quick and timely runs for Erin Burns in Australia \u2018A\u2019 colours ahead of the T20 World Cup in February/March next year. 28th over: Australia 78-1 (Burns 34, Labuschagne 19) Three singles in four balls after the break. Ian Smith, on commentary, observes that Santner has been quite effective at holding an end up but needs to start bowling teams out. He nearly skittles Labuschagne with the last ball here, skidding on from around the wicket. Well kept out. Just read during the break that New Zealand\u2019s finest Olympian, Peter Snell, died overnight at age 80. The players are back on the field. Santner to Burns. PLAY! OB Jato has sent me his team of the year. You can too, of course. Dimuth Karunaratne (c), Mayank Agarwal, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Ajinkya Rahane, Ben Stokes, BJ Wattling (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Pat Cummins, Jofra Archer, and Neil Wagner (12th man: Jack Leach, because Jack Leach). \u201cI\u2019ve stuck to regular positions for all players, which means a few great perofrmers like Kohli might have missed out. Thoughts?\u201d Well, you can\u2019t leave Virat or people are going to get very angry with you. And besides, he\u2019s definitely there. You\u2019re being provacative. Fair play. I also had Jadeja in mine, for what it\u2019s worth. And Wagner. 27th over: Australia 75-1 (Burns 32, Labuschagne 18) Labuschagne finishes his scoring for the session with a tidy clip out to deep midwicket, Burns doing likewise on the pull to the same sweeper. There\u2019s a bit of extra bounce to finish at Marnus, but he rides it well. At the tea break Australia lead by 325 runs - their slowest session of the match. But it matters little with so much time at their disposal. NOT OUT! No, that\u2019s not a good review. Going well over. That\u2019s it for New Zealand in terms of their use of the DRS in this innings. IS LABUSCHAGNE LBW SHOULDERING ARMS TO DE GRANDHOMME? Williamson is wagering his second review on it. 26th over: Australia 73-1 (Burns 31, Labuschagne 17) Santner to Burns, who gets off strike with a glance. Labuschagne then adds two more with a nicely timed late cut before adding more runs through cover and past midwicket. Ominous for New Zealand. 25th over: Australia 67-1 (Burns 30, Labuschagne 12) de Grandhomme\u2019s turn after Warner\u2019s spell, with three overs left until the tea break. Labuschagne\u2019s intent is on show already, here turning one into two just behind point with rapid running. As the TV notes, if he can reach three figures in this innings he will join Jack Fingleton as the only other Australian with four Test tons on the bounce. 24th over: Australia 65-1 (Burns 30, Labuschagne 10) Positive and perfectly executed, Burns dances at Santner and deposits him straight over his head for four. Once upon a time, he was dropped two Tests after a wonderful century on the basis that he couldn\u2019t play spin. The way he played Yasir in Brisbane suggests otherwise. 23rd over: Australia 61-1 (Burns 26, Labuschagne 10) Marnus Labuschagne has now made 500 Test runs this summer - quite outstanding. He brings that up with a boundary to start the new Wagner over, cutting away a short ball that doesn\u2019t get up. By the back half of the set, the left-armer is over the wicket for the first time at Labuschagne but he wants nothing of it. Time on his side. Speaking of time, always-sensible Mike Hussey is talking about the inevitable declaration speculation. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time,\u201d he says. \u201cIn modern society we always want things to happen quicker. But this is Test cricket. There\u2019s no hurry, it\u2019s played over five days.\u201d 22nd over: Australia 57-1 (Burns 26, Labuschagne 6) Santner starts well, generating ample turn after his floaty first ball, pinning Burns to the crease. He should be in the game with the pitch breaking up. Here\u2019s that dropped catch from the previous over. 21st over: Australia 55-1 (Burns 25, Labuschagne 5) LABUSCHAGNE DROPPED! Oh dear, de Grandhomme has huge hands (I can only assume) but they aren\u2019t sufficiently coordinated to snaffle Marnus when running back with the flight at midwicket. Wagner won the top edge with the number three on the pull. Yes, every chance coming from over the shoulder when on the move is tough but they practice them over and over again at training. He had to take it. By the end of the over, there\u2019s more variable bounce from around the wicket. My sense is that this game is going to hurry up quite a bit after tea. 20th over: Australia 53-1 (Burns 24, Labuschagne 4) Labuschagne is off the mark with a push, then clipping through midwicket like he was picking up from yesterday... or the week before that or the week before that. Whisper it: twin tons are on the shelf for him here. 19th over: Australia 48-1 (Burns 23, Labuschagne 0) Shot, Joey. For the third time in the last few overs, Burns jumps onto the front foot with a big stride before square driving for four. A lot to like about that technique. There\u2019s a bit going on with the bounce now - from Wagner\u2019s end at least - with a couple of balls keeping relatively low. The second of those, a bumper, nearly hits Burns when evading. \u201cHi Adam, thanks for the blog.\u201d A pleasure as always, Scott Lowe. \u201cNot sure why people (mostly on Twitter) are saying Paine should declare tonight and get them in under lights. There\u2019s still two days to play, and Starc and Cummins probably need more than a few hours rest if they are going to be bowling in this heat. Thoughts?\u201d Usually it\u2019s former players on telly pushing for an early declaration to get the game dealt with early as possible. And look, I\u2019ve not been immune from that thinking myself when on tour. In this case, I\u2019m sure that chatter is mostly due to the orthodoxy of bowling at night whenever possible, even if the dark session is shorter at Perth with their 1pm start (Adelaide is 2pm for pink-ball Tests, by comparison). Needless to say, it won\u2019t be happening. They\u2019re only 298 ahead, they only have two fast bowlers and it\u2019s 40 degrees at the ground. Warner tries to pull Southee from around the wicket but instead the top edge ends up in the hands of the sub fielder Blundell. Nicely set up with that angle, having beaten his inside edge earlier in the over. 18th over: Australia 44-1 (Burns 19) 17th over: Australia 44-0 (Warner 19, Burns 19) Wagner with the legside trap in place to Wagner, two out for the hook, another couple catching in that general direction. The left-hander doesn\u2019t get sucked in though, clipping one off the hip. Wagner stays the course to Burns, starting with a tempter out wide - so wide it is signalled as an extra. He responds by... popping in a leg slip. I love this guy. He then oversteps for the second time in two overs. No-balls called, on the field? What is this, 1996? And he does so again to Warner a couple of balls later, a delivery that the left-hander actually had a pop at and missed - the sort that can easily get a little edge. On TV - I think I heard this correctly - they say it had been 1300 balls for Wagner between foot faults until these last couple of overs. Odd. 16th over: Australia 38-0 (Warner 17, Burns 18) Aussie Joe Burns reaches out to a Southee half-volley and creams it along the carpet behind point for four. Nice shot. As Michael Vaughan notes on comms, it won\u2019t take long before they start hunting for his head unless he makes bulk runs again soon. That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous, by the way, but the assessment is spot on - we\u2019ve seen this film before when it comes to the opener. Southee bends his back in response to the boundary-ball, angling back off the seam and nearly beating the inside edge, falling over in his follow-through, such was the effort. But Burns holds his shape to the final ball of the over, latching onto another overpitched offering, again using the angle behind point to add a second controlled boundary. Good batting. G\u2019day. Declaration runs, the best kind of runs! Okay, not quite. But, in keeping with New Zealand\u2019s discipline in the first innings with the ball, they clearly aren\u2019t going to drop their bundle and let the hosts score quickly. Even without the injured Ferguson, they won\u2019t give up hope of rolling Australia and chasing the runs - however unlikely. As always, I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout the second half of this third day. Drop me a line, fire me a tweet. 15th over: Australia 30-0 (Warner 17, Burns 10) Wagner to Burns, who scores a couple off the pads. But a couple of balls later and Warner is nearly run out! I think Burns had forgotten that Santner is a left-hander. Burns drops the ball out towards point and runs immediately, calling yes, expecting that the fielder will have to run around the ball. But Santner grabs it in his left hand and throws all in the one movement, and Warner isn\u2019t even in the frame as the ball passes the stump. A big chance missed. A couple more decent bouncers from Wagner, and he gets no-balled for an overstep into the bargain. That\u2019s drinks, and that\u2019s me for the day. I commend you into the care of Adam Collins. 14th over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 17, Burns 7) Tim Southee has swung around to replace de Grandhomme from the far end, but there\u2019s not much sense of threat from him today. Another couple of decent balls just outside off stump but Warner is leaving confidently enough. I do wonder about the selection: Southee is a key part of NZ\u2019s work at home, but he\u2019s rarely seemed a threat in Australia. Averages mid-40s and is bowling in the 120s for speed today. With Ferguson on debut his experience was probably needed, but you wonder whether someone like Matt Henry with more velocity mightn\u2019t have been worth a run here with Perth\u2019s bounce. 13th over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 17, Burns 7) Wagner carries on, mostly full to Warner this over, who takes five balls to get a run to fine leg. Wagner bowling in the low 130 kph region in this over, it will be interesting to see whether he can get his pace back up as he warms into his spell. 12th over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 16, Burns 7) Warner isn\u2019t landing much on de Grandhomme. Finds mid-off with a drive, then tries a swat-pull shot to a ball that doesn\u2019t get up high enough so that Warner misses by a foot. Finally he taps a run to point. 11th over: Australia 24-0 (Warner 15, Burns 7) Wagner is on for his first over. He\u2019s had 24 hours\u2019 break since his two days of marathon spells. What he wouldn\u2019t have given for another night. Burns gets forward and drives a boundary through the covers for four. That\u2019ll make him feel better. What is it with New Zealand\u2019s luck and day-night Tests in Australia? \u201cThe flash on Lyon\u2019s bat a few years back could have come from anywhere,\u201d emails Nathan Green, \u201cand the lack of a snicko on CDG\u2019s gloves could have come from anywhere too.\u201d 10th over: Australia 20-0 (Warner 15, Burns 3) Eventually de Grandhomme gets a couple wrong, on leg stump for Burns who gets a single, then Warner who gets four. Now then, New Zealand will review! A short ball that surprises Warner zooms past the glove, hits his shoulder and loops to second slip. There\u2019s a good take diving forward. Aleem Dar says not out, Williamson reviews. Now then. This is basically Colin de Grandhomme\u2019s dismissal all over again, except that the umpire on the field has said not out this time, and out the other time. It\u2019s inconclusive around the glove, so the TV umpire has no choice but to go with the original call. New Zealand are not getting the rub of the green. 9th over: Australia 15-0 (Warner 11, Burns 2) Southee bowls nicely to Warner from around the wicket, angling in with some swing and Warner is squared up, sparring to cover his off stump and nearly edging behind. A maiden in the end. 8th over: Australia 15-0 (Warner 11, Burns 2) Joe Burns is really starting to sweat on that first run. Gets a straight ball from de Grandhomme but hits it to midwicket and can\u2019t score. Then finally he gets a skewed push that goes accidentally into a gap at cover and gets him down the wicket, then back for a second. Ok. Deep breath. What\u2019s next? 7th over: Australia 13-0 (Warner 11, Burns 0) Warner frees his arms to redirect Southee behind point, and that takes him to 7001 runs in Test cricket. He\u2019s got his average back up to 48.6 and has 23 Test hundreds. It\u2019s a pretty remarkable record, before you even add in what he\u2019s done in the shorter formats. 6th over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 7, Burns 0) A familiar pattern, with Warner pushing a single to the off side and Burns seeing out the rest from de Grandhomme. 5th over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 6, Burns 0) Warner squirts Southee away off the inside edge, and Burns is immediately back on strike. Needs to find a way to relax and just play. He can\u2019t get off the mark in these next five balls either. 4th over: Australia 7-0 (Warner 6, Burns 0) Joe Burns really isn\u2019t comfortable at the moment. He\u2019s nervous after a couple of low scores, I fancy. Fair enough, given how fast he\u2019s been dropped repeatedly through his career. He nearly gets a duck here, hesitantly pushing at de Grandhomme, getting an inside edge, and turning to watch it bounce over his middle stump. 3rd over: Australia 7-0 (Warner 6, Burns 0) Southee to Warner, who is blocking anything on a good length but pounces on the one full delivery to drive it straight for four! So clear in his thinking and his execution at the moment. 2nd over: Australia 3-0 (Warner 2, Burns 0) We\u2019re back, and Colin de Grandhomme will open the bowling after lunch rather than Neil Wagner. Perhaps looking for some swing early while saving Wagner to change things up with the short ball. No run off the bat for Burns who keeps leaving outside off stump, but the first ball of the over was an overstep that Warner knocked away for a run. So Australia wrapped up the Kiwis for a paltry score in that session and have declined to invoke the follow-on with a bowler down. There\u2019s half the Test match yet ahead of them to forge a bigger lead. What are the tactics from here? Will Australia put the foot to the floor for two hours and then declare to make New Zealand bat under lights once again? Or bat long into the fourth day to declare then? The first option would be tempting, if the Aussies could batter 150 runs or so in the next couple of hours. But the second could really steamroll the whole New Zealand team, making them do another three sessions in the field before batting again. I suspect that\u2019s what will end up happening, unless NZ can find a rush of wickets from somewhere. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Warner 1, Burns 0) Tim Southee to bowl this one over before the lunch break then. Wide of the off stump and Warner leaves. On the leg stump, Warner glances a single. Burns gets to leave a couple, then block the sixth. Australia make it through that little bit of discomfort. They\u2019re 250 behind but Australia will not enforce the follow-on. And with about a dozen minutes until the lunch break, Australia will have to come back on and face an over or two before that interval. That\u2019s the only thing that hasn\u2019t gone their way though. They started this morning with the prospect that Taylor and Watling could bat stubbornly into the day, but in the end they\u2019ve been able to take those wickets and wrap New Zealand up within a session. Excellent bowling by Starc, with sustained hostility throughout, while Cummins was typically excellent and Lyon played his part as well. The licence is taken, but it doesn\u2019t last long. First ball against Lyon this over, Southee gallops down the track to aim a big drive down the ground, doesn\u2019t get near the pitch of the ball, and slices a fat outside edge high and into the hands of the sub fielder at point. It\u2019s all over. 55th over: New Zealand 166-9 (Southee 8, Ferguson 0) Lockie Ferguson has come out to bat. He has a calf strain, so I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll be dashing any singles. That will certainly give Southee licence to line up the fence if he wants to. Ferguson watches two leg-breaks go by. He can do no wrong! Three hundreds on the trot, and a wicket to top it off. The leg-spinner coming around the wicket, very wide on the crease, angled in, and the left-handed Santner aims a big drive. Misses it and loses his stumps. 54th over: New Zealand 166-8 (Santner 2, Southee 8) A maiden for Lyon bowling to Southee, who maintains his position as a model of restraint. 53rd over: New Zealand 166-8 (Santner 2, Southee 8) Starc\u2019s foray is over, Labuschagne is back. Southee drives a single. Santner whacks a ball straight back past the bowler who claims to have got a touch on it before it hits the stumps. Labuschagne got out that way himself in the UAE last year so he would like to get one back and level the ledger. But on the replay Southee\u2019s bat is down in time. 52nd over: New Zealand 165-8 (Santner 2, Southee 7) The clear incentive, I suppose, for Southee to play sensibly is that it\u2019s still half an hour short of lunch, it\u2019s 40 degrees out there, and if he isn\u2019t out there batting then he\u2019ll have to be out there bowling and fielding. It\u2019s much less strenuous to be blocking a few off-breaks out with the bat than running in with the ball. So Southee defends and defends until he gets a thick outside edge from Lyon for three runs, with the sub fielder Michael Neser chasing back and diving to save a run. 51st over: New Zealand 162-8 (Santner 2, Southee 5) A maiden for Starc, as Santner defends and leaves with determination. 50th over: New Zealand 162-8 (Santner 2, Southee 4) Lyon to Southee, who again doesn\u2019t try to hit a six but only gets a thick bottom edge past his stumps for four, between keeper and slip. 49th over: New Zealand 158-8 (Santner 2, Southee 0) Tim Southee has more Test sixes than AB de Villiers, Ben Stokes, Ian Botham, Sachin Tendulkar, Sanath Jayasuriya, David Warner... aiming for number 73 today to match Ricky Ponting. But Mitchell Starc won\u2019t be so easy to hit. A single and a leg bye, as neither batsman can do much convincing. 48th over: New Zealand 156-8 (Santner 1, Southee 0) Santner gets a single first ball of the over, and Southee somehow restrains himself from trying to slog five consecutive balls over the rope. Good grief. Starc gets five. In controversial fashion though. Colin de Grandhomme has been batting beautifully. He batters a boundary with a pull shot, a boundary with a cut, and then gets a short ball zooming through a tangle of arms and gloves to hit his helmet and bounce to slip. Aleem Dar has a long think before dismissing the batsman, who immediately reviews. On the replay it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s hit it, but it\u2019s not entirely conclusive that the ball has missed the glove before hitting the helmet. So Marais Erasmus upstairs decides that he can\u2019t overturn the on-field decision, and the batsman is out. Last ball of the over. 47th over: New Zealand 155-8 (Santner 0) 46th over: New Zealand 147-7 (de Grandhomme 15) Drinks now, with Taylor\u2019s wicket, and New Zealand are in strife. Santner in next. A brilliant spell of bowling by Lyon! He\u2019s been all over Taylor, making the batmsan look increasingly anxious. Taylor misses a sweep, which is his shot to get off strike. Lyon looks especially dangerous when the ball doesn\u2019t turn, going on past Taylor\u2019s edge. Taylor nails a rare half-volley but Travis Head dives and saves it one-handed at cover before bouncing up and hitting the stumps direct, nearly snaring Taylor as the batsman dives back in. That\u2019s a team-lifting effort, and frustrating for the batsman. So Taylor, back in his shell, just prods in defence at the last ball of the over, a delivery full enough to reach for and drive, but instead the batsman hangs back and when the ball doesn\u2019t turn it takes his edge to slip! Chalk up part of that wicket to Travis Head, but it was exceptional from Lyon. You could feel the tension building for Taylor, and now it breaks. 45th over: New Zealand 147-6 (Taylor 80, de Grandhomme 15) Marnus settling into his work, and he\u2019s getting some turn with his leggies. Trying to land just outside off stump to force drives through the off side. Both batsmen take him up on it, taking singles to the cover sweeper. There\u2019s one slip in, Smith there. A short third man in Warner and a backward point in Burns. A regulation cover, then Head back on the rope. Strong off-side field. Three singles from the over. 44th over: New Zealand 144-6 (Taylor 78, de Grandhomme 14) Lyon, with his nude pate shining in the sun, his arms swinging across his body like a clock\u2019s before he unfurls at the bowling crease. This time de Grandhomme\u2019s first-ball shot is worth two, playing it behind point this time. The batsmen trade singles, couple of yelps for a catch as de Grandhomme plunges forward to defend balsl that are bouncing substantially. 43rd over: New Zealand 140-6 (Taylor 77, de Grandhomme 11) Again de Grandhomme gets off strike first ball with a drive, and Taylor soaks up the rest of the Labsuchagne over. Lots of encouragement from Paine behind the stumps. 42nd over: New Zealand 139-6 (Taylor 77, de Grandhomme 10) The double spin attack now, with Lyon partnering Marnus. In an ideal world New Zealand would like to be able to go after these two, hit them out of the attack, and put the pressure back on Australia by making their fast bowlers come back and exhaust themselves. But with six wickets down NZ can\u2019t take that risk. Tell you what, they won\u2019t have much chance of hitting Lyon anywhere based on that first over. A single first up to de Grandhomme, but Taylor gets a hand grenade that explodes back through the gate, then a ball that keeps its line and bounces over the attempted cut. 41st over: New Zealand 138-6 (Taylor 77, de Grandhomme 9) Indeed, here\u2019s the first bowling change already. Labuschagne\u2019s leg-breaks will be the next on the menu. Jeet Raval\u2019s part-time stuff got substantial turn yesterday. Marnus is more of a skiddy bowler, faster through the air and with more topspin. He drags down first ball and Taylor pulls two runs, denied two more by a good diving save behind square. Taylor cuts a run next ball. I wonder how long de Grandhomme can restrain himself from trying to put Labuschagne in the stands. He drives a single along the ground first up. Taylor cuts twice and should have eight runs really, but finds backward point both times. 40th over: New Zealand 134-6 (Taylor 74, de Grandhomme 8) Cummins carries on with the short-pitched attack to Taylor, too much angle on these bouncers from the right-armer which go across Taylor and almost outside leg stump. Tim Paine is going as far towards a Douglas Jardine field as the rules allow: two in the deep behind square leg, then three just in front, one next to the batsman for the edge off the pad, one at regulation square for the top edge, and one on the rope for the full-blooded pull. Regardless, Taylor keeps playing the shot. Not the smartest strategy given Australia\u2019s two premier quicks will need a break soon. But he gets a single to ground, then de Grandhomme slams a full ball past the bowler in the air for four. 39th over: New Zealand 129-6 (Taylor 73, de Grandhomme 4) Another single immediately for de Grandhomme from Starc, eased behind point, then Taylor is back on strike. He hasn\u2019t faced much, hasn\u2019t scored much, and hasn\u2019t looked comfortable, but he is still New Zealand\u2019s main hope. Has to just get through this short barrage. It is a barrage though, and Taylor gloves the ball just in front of slip! Fast from Starc, hitting Taylor\u2019s fingers on the bat handle and just dying before reaching Smith in the cordon! Good bowling. Taylor looks a little desperate as he takes on a pull shot next ball and meets fresh air, again looking every chance to glove down the leg side. Third time is also lucky, as he finally gets a pull shot out of the middle, Starc\u2019s bouncer not getting up above chest high, and Taylor clobbers four behind square. Then he bails out of another against a great short ball that zings over his front shoulder on its angle across him. Yet another pull shot finishes the over, this one mistime and limping away in the air for a fortunate run. 38th over: New Zealand 123-6 (Taylor 68, de Grandhomme 3) New Zealand\u2019s next hope is Colin de Grandhomme, and Mitch Santner in next just made his first Test hundred the other week against England. Tough task for them up against Cummins and Starc though. The new batsman gets started with a drive through cover for three. He tends to like to get on with things. Another good bit of bowling from Cummins! He\u2019s been landing the ball on a perfect length often today, and moving it into the right-handed batsmen. This time Watling is anticipating that inward movement, pushing to cover it, and the ball goes a bit the other way. Suddenly his hands are outside the line of his body and he\u2019s getting a thick inside edge back onto his stumps! Huge wicket, Watling can bat some seriously long hours in Test cricket. 37th over: New Zealand 119-5 (Taylor 68, Watling 2) Starc bowling with a bat-pad catcher on both sides of the wicket now, so the bowler has to do the fielding himself when Taylor pushes a run towards mid-on. Watling plays more decisively, a handsome off-drive for two as Starc pitches up. Wade doing the fielding. He might be called upon with the ball again today, with Australia short of seam options. Starc full again to Watling, with the short leg removed. There\u2019s some excitement behind the wicket as Watling misses his next drive, but the sound was bat hitting turf, missing ball by a distance. 36th over: New Zealand 116-5 (Taylor 67, Watling 6) Cummins bowls a beauty. One ball after Watling drives a full ball down the ground for four, Cummins gets a ball to hit a crack, seam in at the batsman, and keep low. The pitch is starting to break up on this third day, with cracking along the length of the wicket in true Perth style. Hard not to love this new stadium\u2019s surface. 35th over: New Zealand 112-5 (Taylor 67, Watling 2) Taylor is starting rusty this morning. Short down leg side again from Starc, and Taylor wafts a pull that doesn\u2019t threaten much except a glove to the keeper. Starc has a leg gully and a long leg behind square, then a short square leg and a deep square leg in front of the line. Only two fielders allowed behind square leg, as per the old Bodyline amended rules. All of that planning, then New Zealand nearly hand over a wicket with a run-out. Paine has made a mess of that. So did Taylor. He should have run himself out last night while batting with Williamson, and this time he burns Watling. Taylor knocks away a run to point, turns for the second, Watling honours the call, then Taylor bails out and turns back. Watling has to do the same, at the striker\u2019s end. He\u2019s miles out. He\u2019s gone. Lyon throws in. And then Paine, having come up to the stumps, fumbles the take. I think he was distracted by Labuschagne, who had run in from short leg to the stumps to try to take the ball as well. Between the two of them they mess up a straightforward chance, and Watling survives. He adds a single next ball like none of that ever happened. 34th over: New Zealand 110-5 (Taylor 66, Watling 1) Pat Cummins starts from the other end, and his first ball is beautifully on the money. A hint of movement, snaking in at the off stump, making Watling defend. His second, a similar line but seaming in from a slightly shorter length, taking a small nick from Watling\u2019s inside edge before thudding into the pad. Too high to prompt an appeal. Fuller next ball and Watling digs at it. A maiden. 33rd over: New Zealand 110-5 (Taylor 66, Watling 1) We\u2019re away! Watling to face the first ball, Starc bowling it. A low full toss that Watling blocks, then a ball on his pads that the Kiwi keeper can knock away to get off the mark. Taylor comes on strike and immediately Starc is bouncing him. Ricky Ponting on the TV is analysing vision from last night, saying that Taylor was least assured against the short ball. Took his eyes off it, often had his feet off the ground. That will likely be the mode of attack today then, and it is, though Starc bowls too much down the leg side. Today is International Ross Taylor Day. He\u2019s the great hope for New Zealand to stay in this contest. New Zealand are five wickets down already, but both teams are short a bowler, with Josh Hazlewood doing his hamstring last night and Lockie Ferguson his calf. So a lot rides on Taylor\u2019s innings. If he can bat through the first wave of attack from Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc, then Australia won\u2019t have a huge amount in the way of reserves. It will come down to a spin focus with Nathan Lyon and the part-timer Marnus Labuschagne, though Lyon should get some bounce and turn out of this surface and could be the key bowler in his own right. But Taylor looked a million bucks last night after some early jitters between the wickets. He clouted his way to 66 as the wickets fell at the other end. He made 290 last time he played a Test in Perth, across the river at the Waca, and this year he\u2019s been in some of the best form of his life. If Taylor goes early today though, then NZ could be bundled out cheaply and would have to bowl again through the heat of the day, after doing that twice already. Australia would pile up a huge lead and then Lyon would have plenty to bowl at in the fourth innings. So a lot rides on this. If, contrarily, Taylor can bat long with BJ Watling, then New Zealand have the better bowling balance with a true all-rounder in Colin de Grandhomme to boost their attack. Starc was an irrepressible force last night, but it remains to be seen what he\u2019s like here during the day.",

By the end of this latest run, a total of 34 different sopranos will have sung Violetta, the tragic \u201cfallen woman\u201d of the title. Her nickname, the \u201clady of the camellias\u201d, is from the novel by Alexandre Dumas <em>fils</em> on which the opera is based. She suffers the ravages and red-cheeked pallor of consumption: the \u201cwhite death\u201d \u2013 pulmonary tuberculosis \u2013 which still had no medical identity and no cure when Verdi wrote his opera in 1853. So what makes us love this story of betrayal and heartbreak so much?</p> <p>\u201cSex and death,\u201d Eyre says bluntly. \u201cA beautiful woman. A callow man. Romantic love. An interfering father. Moral choices. Sickness. Loneliness. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/opera-the-a-to-z-of-la-traviata-9194030.html\" title=\"\">It\u2019s got everything.</a>\u201d His ROH production, with sumptuous <em>belle \u00e9poque</em> designs by Bob Crowley, ranks as one of the company\u2019s top blockbusters. With lavish costumes, architecturally magnificent sets and a grand champagne party, a casino scene, tumbling, dancing and big choruses, Eyre and Crowley have maximised every detail of the drama. \u201cI\u2019ve sent a lot of people who don\u2019t know any opera to <em>La Traviata</em>,\u201d Eyre says. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve come away amazed, transformed by the power of story and music.\u201d</p> <p>Given the popularity of <em>La Traviata</em> \u2013 900 performances in various productions around the world last year alone \u2013 a music critic sees as many <em>Traviatas</em> in a career as a theatre critic might see <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. After at least a dozen encounters with the Royal Opera\u2019s, I haven\u2019t tired of it. Nor has Oliver Mears, the ROH\u2019s director of opera, who keeps a sharp eye on the quality and validity of each revival.</p> <p>Longstanding productions of favourite operas are nothing new. Two Puccini favourites, <em>La </em><em>Boh\u00e8me</em> (by John Copley) and <em>Tosca</em> (by Franco Zeffirelli), each ran for four decades at the Royal Opera before being retired. The same composer\u2019s <em>Turandot</em>, from a 1984 production by Andrei Serban, was still going strong in 2017 and will surely return (not just because of the Nessun dorma aria).</p> <p>\u201cOpera is a living, breathing art form, not a museum,\u201d says Mears. \u201cWe can\u2019t just place dusty artefacts on the stage, year after year. Each time I see this <em>Traviata</em> I ask myself, is it holding up, is it still alive? I can say, hand on heart, it absolutely is. The clarity of the staging, the exquisite designs still work their magic. And it provides a showcase for the best singing in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aaddcd245301cdbb2fdd99ce447d716da5dfaf7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaddcd245301cdbb2fdd99ce447d716da5dfaf7f/0_280_5760_3560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the chorus on their way to the stage during the final dress rehearsal of La Traviata at the Royal Opera House in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"618\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the chorus on their way to the stage during the final dress rehearsal of La Traviata at the Royal Opera House in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An evergreen revival like <em>La Traviata</em> is vital to the Royal Opera\u2019s coffers.

      "bodyText": "The director Richard Eyre doesn\u2019t boast about his own productions but two in particular make him cry. One is Mary Poppins, the bestselling musical currently back in the West End. \u201cI always weep at the end,\u201d admits this giant of British theatre, former director of the National Theatre, with countless stage and screen credits to his name. \u201cWhen Mary flies up over the audience I find myself looking up through a veil of tears.\u201d The other is Verdi\u2019s La Traviata, the impassioned tale of the beautiful, doomed Violetta, one of the most popular tear-jerker operas of all time. Eyre\u2019s magnificent 1994 staging opens at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on Tuesday, the 25th anniversary of the production. By the end of this latest run, a total of 34 different sopranos will have sung Violetta, the tragic \u201cfallen woman\u201d of the title. Her nickname, the \u201clady of the camellias\u201d, is from the novel by Alexandre Dumas fils on which the opera is based. She suffers the ravages and red-cheeked pallor of consumption: the \u201cwhite death\u201d \u2013 pulmonary tuberculosis \u2013 which still had no medical identity and no cure when Verdi wrote his opera in 1853. So what makes us love this story of betrayal and heartbreak so much? \u201cSex and death,\u201d Eyre says bluntly. \u201cA beautiful woman. A callow man. Romantic love. An interfering father. Moral choices. Sickness. Loneliness. It\u2019s got everything.\u201d His ROH production, with sumptuous belle \u00e9poque designs by Bob Crowley, ranks as one of the company\u2019s top blockbusters. With lavish costumes, architecturally magnificent sets and a grand champagne party, a casino scene, tumbling, dancing and big choruses, Eyre and Crowley have maximised every detail of the drama. \u201cI\u2019ve sent a lot of people who don\u2019t know any opera to La Traviata,\u201d Eyre says. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve come away amazed, transformed by the power of story and music.\u201d Given the popularity of La Traviata \u2013 900 performances in various productions around the world last year alone \u2013 a music critic sees as many Traviatas in a career as a theatre critic might see Romeo and Juliet. After at least a dozen encounters with the Royal Opera\u2019s, I haven\u2019t tired of it. Nor has Oliver Mears, the ROH\u2019s director of opera, who keeps a sharp eye on the quality and validity of each revival. Longstanding productions of favourite operas are nothing new. Two Puccini favourites, La Boh\u00e8me (by John Copley) and Tosca (by Franco Zeffirelli), each ran for four decades at the Royal Opera before being retired. The same composer\u2019s Turandot, from a 1984 production by Andrei Serban, was still going strong in 2017 and will surely return (not just because of the Nessun dorma aria). \u201cOpera is a living, breathing art form, not a museum,\u201d says Mears. \u201cWe can\u2019t just place dusty artefacts on the stage, year after year. Each time I see this Traviata I ask myself, is it holding up, is it still alive? I can say, hand on heart, it absolutely is. The clarity of the staging, the exquisite designs still work their magic. And it provides a showcase for the best singing in the world.\u201d An evergreen revival like La Traviata is vital to the Royal Opera\u2019s coffers. Sets and costumes already exist. The chorus and orchestra know the music. The chief expense is the soloist and conductor. \u201cA big hitter like Traviata helps offset the costs of less familiar or more experimental work,\u201d Mears says, citing new productions, in spring 2020, of Jan\u00e1cek\u2019s Jen\u016ffa and Gerald Barry\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground. A quarter of a century ago this Traviata production nearly didn\u2019t happen. It was Eyre\u2019s first operatic venture. He was invited by Georg Solti, the internationally revered conductor \u201cwho had seen my Guys and Dolls at the National\u201d. Eyre wasn\u2019t keen.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s three sons have paid tribute to their father following Labour\u2019s worst defeat in more than 80 years, while condemning the \u201cdespicable attacks\u201d he has faced throughout his leadership. The Labour leader\u2019s youngest son, Tommy, 25, with his brothers Seb, 27, and Benjamin, 32, posted a statement on Twitter expressing pride in their father, who they said had produced the \u201cmost wonderful manifesto this country has ever seen\u201d. They described him as \u201chonest, humble and good-natured\u201d within a \u201cpoisonous world\u201d of politics, and pointed towards \u201cdespicable attacks filled with hatred\u201d as the reason for his undoing. \u201cHe took on an entire establishment. This meant the attacks from all sides intensified and became even more poisonous while he was leader. We\u2019ve never known a politician to be smeared and vilified so much,\u201d they said. \u201cJeremy has dedicated each day of his political life for the less fortunate amongst us. Unwaveringly, he has fought and campaigned for people who suffer and people in hardship.\u201d The Conservative party secured its biggest majority since 1987 in the general election. Many seats in Labour\u2019s historic heartlands \u2013 constituencies such as Bishop Auckland, Redcar and Great Grimsby \u2013 turned blue, rejecting Corbyn\u2019s vision. The brothers said that the defeat \u201churt\u201d but \u2013 despite the crumbling of Labour\u2019s \u201cred walls\u201d \u2013 they believe the time is still to come for their father\u2019s policies. \u201cTo assume that the ideologies he stands for are now outdated is so wrong. In the coming years we will see that they are more important than ever,\u201d they said. \u201cThank you to every person who saw his vision and supported it and supported him. From the three proudest sons on the planet, please continue the fight.\u201d As the results emerged, Corbyn gave a speech at his count, in Islington North, saying he would not lead the party into the next election. He later said he would step down as leader in the \u201cearly part of next year,\u201d following a meeting of Labour\u2019s national executive committee. He said he was \u201cobviously very sad at the result we\u2019ve achieved and very sad for colleagues who have lost their seats in the election and very sad for many people in this country who will now have a government that is continuing policies of austerity, and many of the poorest communities will suffer very badly from the economic strategy that I suspect the prime minister will take forward\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>The night before I meet Lisa Bloom, the BBC screens its interview with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her after she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. It is a bombshell of an interview, with Giuffre giving a detailed account of her alleged encounters with the prince. It is also classic Bloom territory: for the past decade, the American lawyer\u2019s name has been synonymous with high-profile cases in which a woman accuses a powerful man of sexual misconduct, often played out in the glare of camera lights. With her signature mix of legal aggression and media friendliness, Bloom has represented women against both Bill Cosby and Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly \u2013 and won. In the O\u2019Reilly case, she forced the Fox network to engage by filming her client calling the company\u2019s sexual harassment hotline, and posting the video on Twitter. More accusers came forward, advertisers fled, and O\u2019Reilly was done. Bloom handles publicity the way a samurai wields a sword.</p> <p>Bloom is not representing Giuffre. But she is representing five other women who claim Epstein abused them, as well as two others who say they remember seeing Giuffre with Prince Andrew at the London nightclub Tramp in 2001, on the night at the centre of the allegations. (The prince has insisted this encounter was \u201cimpossible\u201d, his unforgettable alibi being that he was at Pizza Express in Woking at the time. He has also denied having sex with Giuffre.)</p> <p>Bloom has flown from her home in Los Angeles to London ahead of the Giuffre interview, because ITV have asked for her take on it. \u201cA lot of other networks wanted me to come on to discuss this as well,\u201d she tells me. As every transatlantic TV station knows, if you\u2019ve got an item on a case about sexual misconduct, there are only two lawyers to call: one is Bloom, and the other is the even more famous and fearsome Gloria Allred, Bloom\u2019s mother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ba14287d372e1a0863d21241b0f16b1927eba40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ba14287d372e1a0863d21241b0f16b1927eba40/0_350_2866_3581/800.jpg\" alt=\"With Harvey Weinstein, October 2017.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Harvey Weinstein, October 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LRNYC/MEGA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 58, Bloom is bright-eyed and chipper, seemingly unaffected by jet lag, which she puts down to her vegan diet. She has the kind of blow dried, honey-coloured hair that suggests a monthly maintenance allowance that exceeds most people\u2019s rent. Even though I was up three times the night before with a crying baby, Bloom can\u2019t tell me often enough how terrific and young I look (I\u2019m 41). \u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing, keep doing it!\u201d she says when we meet in a photographer\u2019s studio in London. She radiates a synthetic warmth.</p> <p>As well as doing the media rounds, Bloom has also spent this trip helping her sixth client, who lives in London, prepare her story. \u201cMy client came to me about a week ago, to say, I was there and it was very memorable because somebody said, \u2018Look it\u2019s Prince Andrew!\u2019 She thought, \u2018Wow! A royal!\u2019 She also saw Virginia looking very serious, not having a good time, whereas Andrew was having a good time, smiling a lot. So I\u2019m gathering the evidence that she has, and will take her to Scotland Yard if they\u2019re interested, which they should be. The FBI says they\u2019re investigating. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of it, so they must be doing it privately,\u201d she says dryly.</p> <p>Of Bloom\u2019s five other clients on the Epstein case, four live in the US, and one in Japan. Only one, a model known as Kiki, has given up her anonymity, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/former-model-who-goes-by-kiki-to-detail-jeffrey-epstein-abuse-on-dr-oz/\" title=\"\">recently appearing on a US talkshow</a> with Bloom by her side. Dozens of lawyers are now involved in the case, including, inevitably, Allred, who is representing other women. While each suit is unique and handled by an individual lawyer, the attorneys are also working together with Epstein\u2019s estate to establish a victims\u2019 compensation fund. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-dead-prison-report-latest\" title=\"\">Epstein was found dead in his jail cell last August</a>, apparently having killed himself, so compensation rather than litigation is the primary focus now.</p> <p>Bloom has practised law all her adult life, save for a decade when she worked as a legal analyst on TV, and says even she has been stunned by the scale of the Epstein case. I ask her what she thinks of the conspiracy theories that surround it \u2013 for instance, the speculation that he was killed in prison, by powerful people who feared guilt by association. \u201cI\u2019m not generally a conspiracy theorist, but in this case there are so many shocking things that we know happened, such as Prince Andrew going to visit him for four days after he was convicted. This is a guy who was getting three girls a day trafficked to him, according to some witnesses. Really, anything\u2019s possible at this point,\u201d Bloom says.</p> <p>This should be a triumphant moment in Bloom\u2019s career. During the 2016 election, she represented two women, Jill Harth and Lisa Boyne, who accused Trump of sexual misconduct, and though the cases never went to trial, Bloom was considered to be working at the forefront of the #MeToo movement. But in 2017, her reputation was completely upended when it emerged that she had been working for Harvey Weinstein. At the time, Bloom insisted she had been merely working as an \u201cadviser\u201d, telling an interviewer that, \u201cMy job was to educate him about\u2026 what is appropriate and not appropriate in the workplace, including his tone.\u201d When asked if she had been trying to dig up dirt on the actress Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, Bloom replied, \u201cI was not.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"799a138c43736fd94654b14eef26a1f235c08a90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799a138c43736fd94654b14eef26a1f235c08a90/0_1341_3390_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With an Epstein client this year, on The Dr Oz Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With an Epstein client this year, on The Dr Oz Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in September this year, two books came out that cast serious doubt on Bloom\u2019s claims. The New York Times reporters who first broke the Weinstein story, Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, published their book about the case, She Said. Ronan Farrow, who reported on Weinstein for the New Yorker, then published his account, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/20/catch-and-kill-ronan-farrow-review\" title=\"\">Catch And Kill</a>. Both books describe Bloom\u2019s relationship with Weinstein in jaw-droppingly damning detail. In She Said, Twohey finds a memo from Bloom to Weinstein written in December 2016, when the film producer first retained her. Also copied into the memo were two private investigators, Jack Palladino and Sara Ness. Bloom shared her thoughts about McGowan, who, in 1997, had received a $100,000 settlement from Weinstein, and in 2016 tweeted that she\u2019d been raped by \u201ca studio head\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHarvey,\u201d Bloom wrote. \u201cIt was a treat to speak with you today, though yes, we\u2019d all prefer better circumstances. I\u2019ve spent the rest of the day reading Jack and Sara\u2019s thorough reports about Rose, who truly comes across as a disturbed, pathological liar, and also your former assistant\u2026 who seems to be less of a concern\u2026</p> <p>\u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them. They start out as impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed\u2026 Clearly she must be stopped in her ridiculous, defamatory attacks on you.\u201d</p> <p>Bloom went on to spell out how McGowan could be stopped. Her suggestions included: cleaning up Weinstein\u2019s Google search with a reputation management company, in order \u201cto prevent negative pieces from ranking well on Google\u201d; Weinstein and Bloom doing an interview together about his \u201cevolving\u201d views on women\u2019s issues; and this: \u201cWe can place an article re [Rose] becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she is discredited.\u201d According to Kantor and Twohey, Bloom\u2019s accounts show she worked with private investigators to collect information on multiple women and smear them on Weinstein\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>There seems to be a contradiction between your public and private statements about the relationship with Weinstein, I say.</p> <p>Bloom looks down for a beat. When she speaks, her voice is more hesitant.</p> <p>\u201cAll I can tell you, in regards to that memo, is virtually none of those things happened,\u201d she says, as though the fact her suggestions weren\u2019t taken up is even close to the point. \u201cThere is so much I would love to say about this, and unfortunately I have got strict instructions in writing from Weinstein\u2019s current attorneys that I may not speak about the case. So if I seem like I\u2019m being careful, that\u2019s why. I don\u2019t feel I can even confirm or deny that I wrote that memo. Also Rose McGowan is suing me, so that\u2019s another reason why I really can\u2019t talk about it.</p> <p>\u201cBut everything in that memo, if I did say it, I certainly don\u2019t believe now. I was talking about one person \u2013 Rose McGowan, not women in general. At the time that I signed on to help Harvey Weinstein, which was in 2016, not a single woman had gone on the record with credible claims against him. Rose McGowan had hinted at it, and that was the concern.\u201d As far as Bloom knew, she says, the allegations against Weinstein were solely about sexual harassment, not sexual assault.</p> <p>But this doesn\u2019t ring true, I tell her. In 2015, the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez had filed a police report complaining that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her, and recorded him attempting to grope her.</p> <p>\u201cOK, so Ambra, yes. But with Ambra, the Manhattan district attorney had investigated her claim and decided not to pursue it. So at the time I thought, OK, she\u2019s been deemed not to be credible, so I just sort of put it to one side,\u201d Bloom says. \u201cThe Dalai Lama said, \u2018When you lose, don\u2019t lose the lesson.\u2019 That\u2019s something I\u2019ve always tried to live by. So what\u2019s the lesson? Someone can be lacking in credibility and still also be telling the truth. That was not obvious to me at the time \u2013 it is obvious to me now. Also, if multiple women are making claims, even if they\u2019re discounted, surely this is something that has to be taken very seriously.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89443e8c7eb5b0e93e76227327c420fcd4ed654e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89443e8c7eb5b0e93e76227327c420fcd4ed654e/0_1346_3840_3349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Bloom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"872\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Dalai Lama said, \u201cWhen you lose, don\u2019t lose the lesson.\u201d\u2019 Photograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian. Hair and makeup: Sadaf Ahmad</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I find it hard to believe that someone with Bloom\u2019s experience in this area would not know that predators often deliberately go after women who are lacking in credibility, precisely because their complaints will not be believed. And did it really take her until her mid-50s to learn that multiple allegations are a warning sign?</p> <p>Part of the problem, Bloom thinks, was that as an attorney she had learned to compartmentalise allegations, as a way of ascertaining their legal gravity. She was too focused on the details to see the human whole. \u201cSo I thought, OK, it\u2019s not anybody who\u2019s his direct employee who\u2019s accusing him, it\u2019s not direct assault.\u201d</p> <p>This would be more credible if she didn\u2019t reference allegations from Weinstein\u2019s \u201cformer assistant\u201d in her original memo. Moreover, two former employees, Emily Nestor and Lauren O\u2019Connor, had already provided written accounts of Weinstein\u2019s assaults and harassment, which were widely known within the company.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I was not aware of that,\u201d Bloom says. She insists that she carefully vetted Weinstein before agreeing to be part of his team. \u201cI researched and read every single thing that was publicly available and that I could get my hands on. I spoke to him at length in person and by phone, and spoke to folks who knew him and worked for him,\u201d she says. But Weinstein\u2019s tendency towards sexual predation was so well known within the industry that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ceNfXrccbQ\" title=\"\">Tina Fey\u2019s sitcom 30 Rock</a> joked about it in 2012, and Courtney Love referenced it on the red carpet in 2005 (\u201cIf Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party in the Four Seasons, don\u2019t go.\u201d). So perhaps Bloom needs to refine her vetting system. \u201cAm I perfect at doing this? No,\u201d she agrees.</p> <p>Even some Weinstein company board members criticised Bloom for defending him too aggressively. In October 2017, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html?smid=pc-thedaily\" title=\"\">Twohey and Kantor revealed in the New York Times</a> that they had seen emails from Bloom to the board in which she outlined a plan to defend Weinstein that involved \u201cphotos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct\u201d. Board member Lance Maerov wrote that \u201cpublishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory\u201d, and told Bloom she was \u201cfanning the flames and compounding the problem\u201d. Maerov also pointed out a conflict of interest: the Weinstein Company was planning to make a TV series of Bloom\u2019s book, Suspicion Nation, about the Trayvon Martin case. (Bloom was not involved in the case, but writes about it like the legal pundit she once was, explaining the trial and criticising the prosecution.) \u201cHow can you possibly provide impartial advice to Harvey or address this group with any credibility?\u201d Maerov wrote.</p> <p>Bob Weinstein added: \u201cIt is my opinion, that u are giving your client poor counsel. Perhaps Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.\u201d</p> <p>When I bring this up, Bloom looks more irritated than pained, and if her previous tactic was warmth and approachability, it now switches into the more common lawyerly pose of slipperiness and hair-splitting. I ask about her suggestion of finding photos of Weinstein with his accusers in \u201cfriendly poses\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"744ab9720461a65b6e8508bf3a978b5b5ca78da5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/744ab9720461a65b6e8508bf3a978b5b5ca78da5/0_104_3000_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Bloom and her mother Gloria Allred\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her mother, women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred, in 2014: \u2018We don\u2019t always see eye to eye.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t suggest finding photos. There are photos that are out there. So I don\u2019t know what that means about finding them,\u201d she says sharply.</p> <p>It presumably means placing them in the press.</p> <p>\u201cWell, there were newspapers that had them. I think what I said was, \u2018There are photos that are going to run.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I start to read her the New York Times article but she talks over me: \u201cListen, people are so taken with this issue, but when taking a case, you have to look at all of the evidence, including photos. I don\u2019t think I ever suggested that one photo tells the entire story \u2013 but it is always part of the story.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, Bloom is saying that the photos were just a way of educating herself about Weinstein. She has also used this argument in relation to Farrow. In Catch And Kill, Farrow writes that he first contacted Bloom because she had previously supported his sister, Dylan, who has long accused their father, Woody Allen, of molesting her as a child \u2013 an allegation he denies. (Bloom had also appeared on Farrow\u2019s TV show, talking about how the rich and powerful protect themselves. \u201cThe first thing they do is go on the attack against the victim, try to dredge up anything from her life they can find to embarrass her,\u201d Bloom said.) Once Farrow began investigating Weinstein, he asked her for advice, and to keep it confidential. \u201cYou have my word,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>According to Farrow, Bloom then suggested that he meet with Weinstein, saying she knew the producer \u201ca little\u201d. Farrow declined, but his book is punctuated with subsequent calls from Bloom (\u201c\u2018Hey!\u2019 she said brightly\u2026\u201d), in which she asked what further information he had on the case. In the summer of 2017, Farrow expressed his astonishment that she had \u2013 as he had learned \u2013 been passing on information to Weinstein\u2019s people.</p> <p>\u201cRonan,\u201d she replied. \u201cI <em>am</em> his people.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Did she misrepresent her relationship with Weinstein in their initial conversations?</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely false,\u201d she says before I finish the question. \u201cFirst of all, it was public knowledge that I had a book deal with Weinstein \u2013 I tweeted about it [in April 2016] but I guess Ronan didn\u2019t see that. So there\u2019s no secret, right? We were working together. But Ronan didn\u2019t want to speak to me. I told him Harvey wanted to speak to him \u2013 he didn\u2019t want to speak to him. That\u2019s his choice.\u201d</p> <p>He believes you were calling him to find out what he knew, in order to relay that to Weinstein.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume,\u201d she says with a laugh.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By the time I got emotionally healthy and strong enough to report my abuser, the statute of limitations had expired</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/07/harvey-weinstein-lisa-bloom-resigns\" title=\"\">Bloom stepped down from the Weinstein case in October 2017</a>, shortly after the full allegations were published in the New York Times. On The View a month later, she tearfully conceded that she had been \u201cso excited\u201d about her book deal that \u201cit clouded my judgment\u201d. In our conversation, it is also clear that she was starstruck. \u201cI thought, \u2018What a great opportunity to work with this film producer who the Obamas love,\u2019\u201d she says, also citing Weinstein\u2019s friendships with Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore and Gloria Steinem. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018OK, this is a good guy,\u2019\u201d she says. The money, presumably, was another inducement: according to She Said, Bloom was charging Weinstein $895 an hour, plus a $50,000 retainer.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lisa Bloom was born in Philadelphia and largely raised in Los Angeles, the only child of a single mother. Allred was only 20 when her daughter was born, and her marriage to Bloom\u2019s father, Peyton Bray, was short and fraught: she left him when his mental illness tipped over into physical violence. Bray, who was diagnosed as bipolar, later killed himself. Shortly afterwards, Allred went on holiday with a girlfriend and was raped at gunpoint. She never went to the police, assuming she wouldn\u2019t be believed. But when she decided to become a lawyer a few years later, her experience undoubtedly played a part in her decision to focus on female victims of domestic and sexual violence.</p> <p>The personal has also played a part in Bloom\u2019s professional life. She went into law to defend abused children, because she was once one herself. Between the ages of 11 and 15, she was, she tells me, abused by a close relative.</p> <p>Did she ever take legal steps against him?</p> <p>\u201cI never reported him to the police. I was an emotional wreck and suicidal as a teen and into my 20s, because of the years of unrelenting abuse. I was in no position to take legal action. By the time I got emotionally healthy and strong enough to do it in my late 20s, the statute of limitations, every paedophile\u2019s get-out-of-jail-free card, had expired,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd9a323fb7fd12b13856e62c01cc221a708cbccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd9a323fb7fd12b13856e62c01cc221a708cbccc/511_472_2619_1571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With client Janice Dickinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With client Janice Dickinson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She told her mother about the abuse when she was 18. How did Allred react? There is a pause. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about my mother in this story, because I feel she\u2019s the best person to talk about her experience,\u201d Bloom says.</p> <p>Today, she lives about half an hour away from her mother: Allred is down on the beach in Malibu and Bloom lives with her second husband up in the hills. They are, she says, with only the slightest hesitation, emotionally close. \u201cI\u2019m 100% behind what she does for a living, but we don\u2019t always see eye to eye on a personal level. And I think that\u2019s what happens when you have two strong-willed people. She just came to Thanksgiving at my house along with the rest of the family and we had a wonderful time. I\u2019m proud she\u2019s my mother.\u201d Bloom has a daughter, Sarah, who now works as a lawyer at Bloom\u2019s firm. Her son, Sammy, is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sammyisdancing/?hl=en\" title=\"\">the US national men\u2019s pole dancing champion</a> (\u201cGod knows where he gets it from\u201d) and is now also training to be a lawyer. \u201cBecause you have no choice in our family,\u201d Bloom laughs.</p> <p>Bloom\u2019s mother was once mocked for her numerous media appearances but is now revered as a feminist groundbreaker. Allred pioneered a new legal approach, using the media to defend women and minorities, often by acting as a kind of publicist for them. During the OJ Simpson trial, when Simpson\u2019s lawyers tried to make the case about everything but the actual murders, Allred was hired by the family of Simpson\u2019s wife, Nicole Brown. She became a ubiquitous TV presence, reminding the public of the victims: Brown and Ron Goldman. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Gloria, Nicole would always have been just that person on a gurney,\u201d Brown\u2019s sister, Denise, says in Seeing Allred, the 2018 Netflix documentary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Have she and her mother made up? 'We had a little rift, but we\u2019re both tough people. It\u2019s water under the bridge'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bloom has largely followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps, and her company, The Bloom Firm, has made a name for itself defending women and minorities. Hours before our interview, Bloom emails to urge me to look at her biography <a href=\"https://thebloomfirm.com/lawyer/lisa-bloom/\" title=\"\">on her firm\u2019s website</a>. \u201cMy celebrity cases get a lot of attention, but most of my cases are on behalf of everyday people, and they are very important to me as well,\u201d she writes. I ask if she has been stung by criticisms of her high-profile cases. After the comedian Kathy Griffin controversially posed with a Donald Trump mask mocked up to look like a severed head, she hired Bloom to help her deal with the public criticism. But the two women fell out and Griffin called her \u201ca fame whore\u201d. Bloom sighs: \u201cPeople think all I do is what they see in the news, but 99% of my cases are not high-profile,\u201d she says, citing the women she is representing against the Greek billionaire, Alki David, who in<strong> </strong>April was sued for sexual assault.</p> <p>In the same online biography, Bloom emphasises repeatedly that she has rejected \u201cBig Law\u2019s big bucks\u201d in order to fight for civil rights. But she is certainly earning a lot now, I say.</p> <p>\u201cPeople forget that I have a business. Let\u2019s say that I have a case and we get $1m in the case, and let\u2019s say that we get a third of that. That does not go into my pocket \u2013 it goes to the company to pay salaries. People will say, \u2018Lisa Bloom took a third!\u2019 But I believe that I should be paid for my work,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Allred has not held back on criticising her daughter\u2019s decision to defend Weinstein. \u201cHad I been asked by Mr Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment. [But] I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/gloria-allred-lisa-bloom-harvey-weinstein-statement\" title=\"\">she said in a public statement in 2017</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be608d71f1e2199f28b843cf6aade9e7d94feeb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be608d71f1e2199f28b843cf6aade9e7d94feeb8/1604_650_1863_2328/800.jpg\" alt=\"With comedian Kathy Griffin. \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With comedian Kathy Griffin.<strong> </strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI would have preferred a phone call,\u201d Bloom says with a light laugh.</p> <p>While her mother has tended to use publicity as a means to an end, Bloom appears more dazzled by celebrity, to the extent that in 2016, it became the end. In Seeing Allred, CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, who has interviewed both women on his show, says, \u201cBoth of them have been advocates for victims\u2019 rights, but Gloria had to do it in a much tougher time than Lisa is having to do it now. So it\u2019s interesting to watch how they both deal with it, a generation apart.\u201d Allred knows you can never give an inch, because then you lose everything. Bloom has given more than an inch.</p> <p>I ask Bloom if she and her mother have made up since the criticism over Weinstein. She shrugs off the question as if it were as insignificant as a fly: \u201cWe had a little rift, but we\u2019re both tough people. It\u2019s water under the bridge,\u201d she says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>After Bloom resigned from the Weinstein case, she flew to Houston to advise a victim of domestic violence. \u201cAnd I asked her, \u2018Is all the Harvey Weinstein coverage affecting you?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Harvey who?\u2019\u201d Bloom says.</p> <p>She insists that she hasn\u2019t lost any clients as a result of playing for the other side. On the contrary, she says, her firm has almost doubled in size since 2017. The revelations in She Said and Catch And Kill seemed career-ending, but Bloom is dealing with them like a lawyer: head on and with a certain amount of slipperiness. For now she is focused on the Epstein case and maybe, in time, if she does enough high-profile cases in the same area, they will drive down all the Google references to her alliance with Weinstein. She has vowed never again to defend anyone accused of sexual misconduct, focusing instead on the victims.</p> <p>Two years since #MeToo gathered steam, I ask if she thinks we are seeing real systemic change, or merely a rearrangement of deckchairs. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing some change, but not nearly enough. In every one of my cases I still get asked about the same myths: why didn\u2019t she report it earlier? What about these inconsistent statements?\u201d she says, with no apparent irony.</p> <p>Bloom might have proved a figurehead of the #MeToo movement; instead, she is considered one of its villains. Of course, she says, she deeply regrets working for Weinstein. This \u201ccolossal mistake\u201d, as she refers to it, has spiked all her achievements with accusations of cynicism and hypocrisy. It\u2019s hard to be the change when you have worked to perpetuate the problem.</p> <p>\u201cI hope I treat all of my clients with compassion,\u201d she says with emotion. And I\u2019m sure she does, even if she occasionally thinks of them as \u201cthe Roses of the world\u201d; presumably she can now reassure them that she has worked with \u201cthe Harveys of the world\u201d. After all, David Boies, another high-profile lawyer who formerly worked for Weinstein, is now representing Virginia Giuffre. \u201cAttorneys represent a lot of distasteful people, and attorneys and clients are different people,\u201d says Bloom.

      "bodyText": "The night before I meet Lisa Bloom, the BBC screens its interview with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her after she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. It is a bombshell of an interview, with Giuffre giving a detailed account of her alleged encounters with the prince. It is also classic Bloom territory: for the past decade, the American lawyer\u2019s name has been synonymous with high-profile cases in which a woman accuses a powerful man of sexual misconduct, often played out in the glare of camera lights. With her signature mix of legal aggression and media friendliness, Bloom has represented women against both Bill Cosby and Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly \u2013 and won. In the O\u2019Reilly case, she forced the Fox network to engage by filming her client calling the company\u2019s sexual harassment hotline, and posting the video on Twitter. More accusers came forward, advertisers fled, and O\u2019Reilly was done. Bloom handles publicity the way a samurai wields a sword. Bloom is not representing Giuffre. But she is representing five other women who claim Epstein abused them, as well as two others who say they remember seeing Giuffre with Prince Andrew at the London nightclub Tramp in 2001, on the night at the centre of the allegations. (The prince has insisted this encounter was \u201cimpossible\u201d, his unforgettable alibi being that he was at Pizza Express in Woking at the time. He has also denied having sex with Giuffre.) Bloom has flown from her home in Los Angeles to London ahead of the Giuffre interview, because ITV have asked for her take on it. \u201cA lot of other networks wanted me to come on to discuss this as well,\u201d she tells me. As every transatlantic TV station knows, if you\u2019ve got an item on a case about sexual misconduct, there are only two lawyers to call: one is Bloom, and the other is the even more famous and fearsome Gloria Allred, Bloom\u2019s mother. At 58, Bloom is bright-eyed and chipper, seemingly unaffected by jet lag, which she puts down to her vegan diet. She has the kind of blow dried, honey-coloured hair that suggests a monthly maintenance allowance that exceeds most people\u2019s rent. Even though I was up three times the night before with a crying baby, Bloom can\u2019t tell me often enough how terrific and young I look (I\u2019m 41). \u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing, keep doing it!\u201d she says when we meet in a photographer\u2019s studio in London. She radiates a synthetic warmth. As well as doing the media rounds, Bloom has also spent this trip helping her sixth client, who lives in London, prepare her story. \u201cMy client came to me about a week ago, to say, I was there and it was very memorable because somebody said, \u2018Look it\u2019s Prince Andrew!\u2019 She thought, \u2018Wow! A royal!\u2019 She also saw Virginia looking very serious, not having a good time, whereas Andrew was having a good time, smiling a lot. So I\u2019m gathering the evidence that she has, and will take her to Scotland Yard if they\u2019re interested, which they should be. The FBI says they\u2019re investigating. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of it, so they must be doing it privately,\u201d she says dryly. Of Bloom\u2019s five other clients on the Epstein case, four live in the US, and one in Japan. Only one, a model known as Kiki, has given up her anonymity, recently appearing on a US talkshow with Bloom by her side. Dozens of lawyers are now involved in the case, including, inevitably, Allred, who is representing other women. While each suit is unique and handled by an individual lawyer, the attorneys are also working together with Epstein\u2019s estate to establish a victims\u2019 compensation fund. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell last August, apparently having killed himself, so compensation rather than litigation is the primary focus now. Bloom has practised law all her adult life, save for a decade when she worked as a legal analyst on TV, and says even she has been stunned by the scale of the Epstein case. I ask her what she thinks of the conspiracy theories that surround it \u2013 for instance, the speculation that he was killed in prison, by powerful people who feared guilt by association. \u201cI\u2019m not generally a conspiracy theorist, but in this case there are so many shocking things that we know happened, such as Prince Andrew going to visit him for four days after he was convicted. This is a guy who was getting three girls a day trafficked to him, according to some witnesses. Really, anything\u2019s possible at this point,\u201d Bloom says. This should be a triumphant moment in Bloom\u2019s career. During the 2016 election, she represented two women, Jill Harth and Lisa Boyne, who accused Trump of sexual misconduct, and though the cases never went to trial, Bloom was considered to be working at the forefront of the #MeToo movement. But in 2017, her reputation was completely upended when it emerged that she had been working for Harvey Weinstein. At the time, Bloom insisted she had been merely working as an \u201cadviser\u201d, telling an interviewer that, \u201cMy job was to educate him about\u2026 what is appropriate and not appropriate in the workplace, including his tone.\u201d When asked if she had been trying to dig up dirt on the actress Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, Bloom replied, \u201cI was not.\u201d But in September this year, two books came out that cast serious doubt on Bloom\u2019s claims. The New York Times reporters who first broke the Weinstein story, Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, published their book about the case, She Said. Ronan Farrow, who reported on Weinstein for the New Yorker, then published his account, Catch And Kill. Both books describe Bloom\u2019s relationship with Weinstein in jaw-droppingly damning detail. In She Said, Twohey finds a memo from Bloom to Weinstein written in December 2016, when the film producer first retained her. Also copied into the memo were two private investigators, Jack Palladino and Sara Ness. Bloom shared her thoughts about McGowan, who, in 1997, had received a $100,000 settlement from Weinstein, and in 2016 tweeted that she\u2019d been raped by \u201ca studio head\u201d. \u201cHarvey,\u201d Bloom wrote. \u201cIt was a treat to speak with you today, though yes, we\u2019d all prefer better circumstances. I\u2019ve spent the rest of the day reading Jack and Sara\u2019s thorough reports about Rose, who truly comes across as a disturbed, pathological liar, and also your former assistant\u2026 who seems to be less of a concern\u2026 \u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them. They start out as impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed\u2026 Clearly she must be stopped in her ridiculous, defamatory attacks on you.\u201d Bloom went on to spell out how McGowan could be stopped. Her suggestions included: cleaning up Weinstein\u2019s Google search with a reputation management company, in order \u201cto prevent negative pieces from ranking well on Google\u201d; Weinstein and Bloom doing an interview together about his \u201cevolving\u201d views on women\u2019s issues; and this: \u201cWe can place an article re [Rose] becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she is discredited.\u201d According to Kantor and Twohey, Bloom\u2019s accounts show she worked with private investigators to collect information on multiple women and smear them on Weinstein\u2019s behalf. There seems to be a contradiction between your public and private statements about the relationship with Weinstein, I say. Bloom looks down for a beat. When she speaks, her voice is more hesitant. \u201cAll I can tell you, in regards to that memo, is virtually none of those things happened,\u201d she says, as though the fact her suggestions weren\u2019t taken up is even close to the point. \u201cThere is so much I would love to say about this, and unfortunately I have got strict instructions in writing from Weinstein\u2019s current attorneys that I may not speak about the case. So if I seem like I\u2019m being careful, that\u2019s why. I don\u2019t feel I can even confirm or deny that I wrote that memo. Also Rose McGowan is suing me, so that\u2019s another reason why I really can\u2019t talk about it. \u201cBut everything in that memo, if I did say it, I certainly don\u2019t believe now. I was talking about one person \u2013 Rose McGowan, not women in general. At the time that I signed on to help Harvey Weinstein, which was in 2016, not a single woman had gone on the record with credible claims against him. Rose McGowan had hinted at it, and that was the concern.\u201d As far as Bloom knew, she says, the allegations against Weinstein were solely about sexual harassment, not sexual assault. But this doesn\u2019t ring true, I tell her. In 2015, the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez had filed a police report complaining that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her, and recorded him attempting to grope her. \u201cOK, so Ambra, yes. But with Ambra, the Manhattan district attorney had investigated her claim and decided not to pursue it. So at the time I thought, OK, she\u2019s been deemed not to be credible, so I just sort of put it to one side,\u201d Bloom says. \u201cThe Dalai Lama said, \u2018When you lose, don\u2019t lose the lesson.\u2019 That\u2019s something I\u2019ve always tried to live by. So what\u2019s the lesson? Someone can be lacking in credibility and still also be telling the truth. That was not obvious to me at the time \u2013 it is obvious to me now. Also, if multiple women are making claims, even if they\u2019re discounted, surely this is something that has to be taken very seriously.\u201d I find it hard to believe that someone with Bloom\u2019s experience in this area would not know that predators often deliberately go after women who are lacking in credibility, precisely because their complaints will not be believed. And did it really take her until her mid-50s to learn that multiple allegations are a warning sign? Part of the problem, Bloom thinks, was that as an attorney she had learned to compartmentalise allegations, as a way of ascertaining their legal gravity. She was too focused on the details to see the human whole. \u201cSo I thought, OK, it\u2019s not anybody who\u2019s his direct employee who\u2019s accusing him, it\u2019s not direct assault.\u201d This would be more credible if she didn\u2019t reference allegations from Weinstein\u2019s \u201cformer assistant\u201d in her original memo. Moreover, two former employees, Emily Nestor and Lauren O\u2019Connor, had already provided written accounts of Weinstein\u2019s assaults and harassment, which were widely known within the company. \u201cWell, I was not aware of that,\u201d Bloom says. She insists that she carefully vetted Weinstein before agreeing to be part of his team. \u201cI researched and read every single thing that was publicly available and that I could get my hands on. I spoke to him at length in person and by phone, and spoke to folks who knew him and worked for him,\u201d she says. But Weinstein\u2019s tendency towards sexual predation was so well known within the industry that Tina Fey\u2019s sitcom 30 Rock joked about it in 2012, and Courtney Love referenced it on the red carpet in 2005 (\u201cIf Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party in the Four Seasons, don\u2019t go.\u201d). So perhaps Bloom needs to refine her vetting system. \u201cAm I perfect at doing this? No,\u201d she agrees. Even some Weinstein company board members criticised Bloom for defending him too aggressively. In October 2017, Twohey and Kantor revealed in the New York Times that they had seen emails from Bloom to the board in which she outlined a plan to defend Weinstein that involved \u201cphotos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct\u201d. Board member Lance Maerov wrote that \u201cpublishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory\u201d, and told Bloom she was \u201cfanning the flames and compounding the problem\u201d. Maerov also pointed out a conflict of interest: the Weinstein Company was planning to make a TV series of Bloom\u2019s book, Suspicion Nation, about the Trayvon Martin case. (Bloom was not involved in the case, but writes about it like the legal pundit she once was, explaining the trial and criticising the prosecution.) \u201cHow can you possibly provide impartial advice to Harvey or address this group with any credibility?\u201d Maerov wrote. Bob Weinstein added: \u201cIt is my opinion, that u are giving your client poor counsel. Perhaps Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.\u201d When I bring this up, Bloom looks more irritated than pained, and if her previous tactic was warmth and approachability, it now switches into the more common lawyerly pose of slipperiness and hair-splitting. I ask about her suggestion of finding photos of Weinstein with his accusers in \u201cfriendly poses\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t suggest finding photos. There are photos that are out there. So I don\u2019t know what that means about finding them,\u201d she says sharply. It presumably means placing them in the press. \u201cWell, there were newspapers that had them. I think what I said was, \u2018There are photos that are going to run.\u2019\u201d I start to read her the New York Times article but she talks over me: \u201cListen, people are so taken with this issue, but when taking a case, you have to look at all of the evidence, including photos. I don\u2019t think I ever suggested that one photo tells the entire story \u2013 but it is always part of the story.\u201d In other words, Bloom is saying that the photos were just a way of educating herself about Weinstein. She has also used this argument in relation to Farrow. In Catch And Kill, Farrow writes that he first contacted Bloom because she had previously supported his sister, Dylan, who has long accused their father, Woody Allen, of molesting her as a child \u2013 an allegation he denies. (Bloom had also appeared on Farrow\u2019s TV show, talking about how the rich and powerful protect themselves. \u201cThe first thing they do is go on the attack against the victim, try to dredge up anything from her life they can find to embarrass her,\u201d Bloom said.) Once Farrow began investigating Weinstein, he asked her for advice, and to keep it confidential. \u201cYou have my word,\u201d she replied. According to Farrow, Bloom then suggested that he meet with Weinstein, saying she knew the producer \u201ca little\u201d. Farrow declined, but his book is punctuated with subsequent calls from Bloom (\u201c\u2018Hey!\u2019 she said brightly\u2026\u201d), in which she asked what further information he had on the case. In the summer of 2017, Farrow expressed his astonishment that she had \u2013 as he had learned \u2013 been passing on information to Weinstein\u2019s people. \u201cRonan,\u201d she replied. \u201cI am his people.\u2019\u201d Did she misrepresent her relationship with Weinstein in their initial conversations? \u201cAbsolutely false,\u201d she says before I finish the question. \u201cFirst of all, it was public knowledge that I had a book deal with Weinstein \u2013 I tweeted about it [in April 2016] but I guess Ronan didn\u2019t see that. So there\u2019s no secret, right? We were working together. But Ronan didn\u2019t want to speak to me. I told him Harvey wanted to speak to him \u2013 he didn\u2019t want to speak to him. That\u2019s his choice.\u201d He believes you were calling him to find out what he knew, in order to relay that to Weinstein. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume,\u201d she says with a laugh. Bloom stepped down from the Weinstein case in October 2017, shortly after the full allegations were published in the New York Times. On The View a month later, she tearfully conceded that she had been \u201cso excited\u201d about her book deal that \u201cit clouded my judgment\u201d. In our conversation, it is also clear that she was starstruck. \u201cI thought, \u2018What a great opportunity to work with this film producer who the Obamas love,\u2019\u201d she says, also citing Weinstein\u2019s friendships with Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore and Gloria Steinem. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018OK, this is a good guy,\u2019\u201d she says. The money, presumably, was another inducement: according to She Said, Bloom was charging Weinstein $895 an hour, plus a $50,000 retainer. *** Lisa Bloom was born in Philadelphia and largely raised in Los Angeles, the only child of a single mother. Allred was only 20 when her daughter was born, and her marriage to Bloom\u2019s father, Peyton Bray, was short and fraught: she left him when his mental illness tipped over into physical violence. Bray, who was diagnosed as bipolar, later killed himself. Shortly afterwards, Allred went on holiday with a girlfriend and was raped at gunpoint. She never went to the police, assuming she wouldn\u2019t be believed. But when she decided to become a lawyer a few years later, her experience undoubtedly played a part in her decision to focus on female victims of domestic and sexual violence. The personal has also played a part in Bloom\u2019s professional life. She went into law to defend abused children, because she was once one herself. Between the ages of 11 and 15, she was, she tells me, abused by a close relative. Did she ever take legal steps against him? \u201cI never reported him to the police. I was an emotional wreck and suicidal as a teen and into my 20s, because of the years of unrelenting abuse. I was in no position to take legal action. By the time I got emotionally healthy and strong enough to do it in my late 20s, the statute of limitations, every paedophile\u2019s get-out-of-jail-free card, had expired,\u201d she says. She told her mother about the abuse when she was 18. How did Allred react? There is a pause. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about my mother in this story, because I feel she\u2019s the best person to talk about her experience,\u201d Bloom says. Today, she lives about half an hour away from her mother: Allred is down on the beach in Malibu and Bloom lives with her second husband up in the hills. They are, she says, with only the slightest hesitation, emotionally close. \u201cI\u2019m 100% behind what she does for a living, but we don\u2019t always see eye to eye on a personal level. And I think that\u2019s what happens when you have two strong-willed people. She just came to Thanksgiving at my house along with the rest of the family and we had a wonderful time. I\u2019m proud she\u2019s my mother.\u201d Bloom has a daughter, Sarah, who now works as a lawyer at Bloom\u2019s firm. Her son, Sammy, is the US national men\u2019s pole dancing champion (\u201cGod knows where he gets it from\u201d) and is now also training to be a lawyer. \u201cBecause you have no choice in our family,\u201d Bloom laughs. Bloom\u2019s mother was once mocked for her numerous media appearances but is now revered as a feminist groundbreaker. Allred pioneered a new legal approach, using the media to defend women and minorities, often by acting as a kind of publicist for them. During the OJ Simpson trial, when Simpson\u2019s lawyers tried to make the case about everything but the actual murders, Allred was hired by the family of Simpson\u2019s wife, Nicole Brown. She became a ubiquitous TV presence, reminding the public of the victims: Brown and Ron Goldman. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Gloria, Nicole would always have been just that person on a gurney,\u201d Brown\u2019s sister, Denise, says in Seeing Allred, the 2018 Netflix documentary. Bloom has largely followed in her mother\u2019s footsteps, and her company, The Bloom Firm, has made a name for itself defending women and minorities. Hours before our interview, Bloom emails to urge me to look at her biography on her firm\u2019s website. \u201cMy celebrity cases get a lot of attention, but most of my cases are on behalf of everyday people, and they are very important to me as well,\u201d she writes. I ask if she has been stung by criticisms of her high-profile cases. After the comedian Kathy Griffin controversially posed with a Donald Trump mask mocked up to look like a severed head, she hired Bloom to help her deal with the public criticism. But the two women fell out and Griffin called her \u201ca fame whore\u201d. Bloom sighs: \u201cPeople think all I do is what they see in the news, but 99% of my cases are not high-profile,\u201d she says, citing the women she is representing against the Greek billionaire, Alki David, who in April was sued for sexual assault. In the same online biography, Bloom emphasises repeatedly that she has rejected \u201cBig Law\u2019s big bucks\u201d in order to fight for civil rights. But she is certainly earning a lot now, I say. \u201cPeople forget that I have a business. Let\u2019s say that I have a case and we get $1m in the case, and let\u2019s say that we get a third of that. That does not go into my pocket \u2013 it goes to the company to pay salaries. People will say, \u2018Lisa Bloom took a third!\u2019 But I believe that I should be paid for my work,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, Allred has not held back on criticising her daughter\u2019s decision to defend Weinstein. \u201cHad I been asked by Mr Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment. [But] I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel,\u201d she said in a public statement in 2017. \u201cI would have preferred a phone call,\u201d Bloom says with a light laugh. While her mother has tended to use publicity as a means to an end, Bloom appears more dazzled by celebrity, to the extent that in 2016, it became the end. In Seeing Allred, CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, who has interviewed both women on his show, says, \u201cBoth of them have been advocates for victims\u2019 rights, but Gloria had to do it in a much tougher time than Lisa is having to do it now. So it\u2019s interesting to watch how they both deal with it, a generation apart.\u201d Allred knows you can never give an inch, because then you lose everything. Bloom has given more than an inch. I ask Bloom if she and her mother have made up since the criticism over Weinstein. She shrugs off the question as if it were as insignificant as a fly: \u201cWe had a little rift, but we\u2019re both tough people. It\u2019s water under the bridge,\u201d she says. *** After Bloom resigned from the Weinstein case, she flew to Houston to advise a victim of domestic violence. \u201cAnd I asked her, \u2018Is all the Harvey Weinstein coverage affecting you?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Harvey who?\u2019\u201d Bloom says. She insists that she hasn\u2019t lost any clients as a result of playing for the other side. On the contrary, she says, her firm has almost doubled in size since 2017. The revelations in She Said and Catch And Kill seemed career-ending, but Bloom is dealing with them like a lawyer: head on and with a certain amount of slipperiness. For now she is focused on the Epstein case and maybe, in time, if she does enough high-profile cases in the same area, they will drive down all the Google references to her alliance with Weinstein. She has vowed never again to defend anyone accused of sexual misconduct, focusing instead on the victims. Two years since #MeToo gathered steam, I ask if she thinks we are seeing real systemic change, or merely a rearrangement of deckchairs. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing some change, but not nearly enough. In every one of my cases I still get asked about the same myths: why didn\u2019t she report it earlier? What about these inconsistent statements?\u201d she says, with no apparent irony. Bloom might have proved a figurehead of the #MeToo movement; instead, she is considered one of its villains. Of course, she says, she deeply regrets working for Weinstein. This \u201ccolossal mistake\u201d, as she refers to it, has spiked all her achievements with accusations of cynicism and hypocrisy. It\u2019s hard to be the change when you have worked to perpetuate the problem. \u201cI hope I treat all of my clients with compassion,\u201d she says with emotion. And I\u2019m sure she does, even if she occasionally thinks of them as \u201cthe Roses of the world\u201d; presumably she can now reassure them that she has worked with \u201cthe Harveys of the world\u201d. After all, David Boies, another high-profile lawyer who formerly worked for Weinstein, is now representing Virginia Giuffre. \u201cAttorneys represent a lot of distasteful people, and attorneys and clients are different people,\u201d says Bloom. In other words, what else did we expect? \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

It was a day for under-pressure German coaches in the A-League. Marco Kurz sneaks away with a point against Wellington following a spiky 0-0 in Victoria. But his compatriot Markus Babbel could soon feel the heat in Perth. A big win the W-League for Brisbane Roar, with Matildas star Hayley Raso bagging a brace in their 3-2 win over Adelaide. And plenty more from golf, cricket and cycling. Thanks for your company - join us again tomorrow night! A-League: Perth Glory 1-0 Western Sydney - half-time: 45 min: And plenty more imponderables for Markus Babbel and his men. They\u2019re 45 minutes away from staring down the barrel of five straight losses. And it doesn\u2019t matter where you are in the world, not too many coaches come back from results like that - especially given the backing the German has already had from his chairman. 43 min: Perth still enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession. You wonder what the game plan can be from Babbel - given the temperature it\u2019s not a game in which his men can press high or hard for long periods. Nor will lightning transition raids be the feature, you imagine. Like Sydney FC v Mariners early, this feels just all very comfortable for the home side. 37 min: Another set piece and Mrcela rises well to send a header goalwards, but it evades both the target and a teammate. They\u2019re not short of tall timber the Glory - they may have lost Lowry and Spiranovic, but they still boast some commanding centre backs - always a set piece risk. 32 min: A lovely backheel from Castro, but he finds Franjic in an offside position unfortunately. Such consummate ability on the ball. Perth dominating possession and chances - outside that first minute scare, they\u2019ve not allowed the Wanderers much of a look thus far. 27 min: And a brief respite as we stop for the first of the additional drinks breaks, given the temperature out there. So far, so good for Perth and Popovic - not that his animated instructions would suggest that. 24 min: A test of character now for the Wanderers - Perth under Popovic aren\u2019t a side that overcommits, but they\u2019ve got plenty of outlets to hurt you - the pace of Ikonomidis, the guile of Castro for two. Georgievski looks to spark something down the flanks, and he\u2019s earned the visitors a corner. Goal! Perth Glory 1-0 Western Sydney Wanderers (Wuthrich) 18 min: Oh wow. It was a mad scramble from the corner - but it eventually goes through! Kilkenny with a well-worked corner, it\u2019s flicked on nicely at the near post, before an acrobatic overhead from Fornaroli keeps the play alive. His effort finds Ikonomidis who clatters against the crossbar, but it falls kindly for the centre back! A first goal in the A-League, and a memorable one. 16 min: Baby Baccus with a shot for the visitors, but he can\u2019t hook it round. Can\u2019t blame him - he has already hit a match-winning screamer this season. Fornaroli goes to ground after a tangle with Ziegler, he may have copped an inadvertent finger in the eye, the Uruguayan. 11 min: An early booking as Perth\u2019s right-back Ivan Franjic goes into the book. He\u2019s an important campaigner for Popovic, the former Socceroo, especially given his domestic pedigree as a serial winner, last season with the Glory, and famously, with Ange Postecoglou\u2019s Roarcelona. He\u2019ll have to watch his step here though. 6 min: Both sides feeling their way patiently into this one. A real opportunity for Perth to re-start their title defence. A win here and they jump to fifth, with several clubs scratching around in indifferent form lately. The Wanderers very much in that bracket. Kick off! Perth Glory v Western Sydney Wanderers 1 min: And a very bright start for the visitors, who get Liam Reddy scrambling. It\u2019s an absolutely sweltering day in the West, the mercury\u2019s still hovering around 37C, having topped 40C earlier in the day, so expect this one not to be played at breakneck speed. So - to team news. Here\u2019s Perth: And Western Sydney: No changes for Tony Popovic, but plenty of tinkering from Babbel, who shuffles nearly his entire back five. The big news, illness forcing the thus-far superb Daniel Lopar onto the bench. So - it\u2019s been a mixed bag from the A-League triple header - and we\u2019ve still got Perth v Wanderers to come! We\u2019ve had the good, the bad and the ugly - so what\u2019s still to come? The Wanderers have gone from top of the table to losing four on the spin. You\u2019d have to say, a loss here and it gets sticky for Markus Babbel. Mind you, Tony Popovic\u2019s Perth aren\u2019t exactly firing. If you missed it, here\u2019s my column on them a week or so back: 90 +2 min: Caceres and Van der Saag combine well to put through Barbarouses, but the throughball is just too heavy. As the seconds trickle away we\u2019ve time for one last corner, and the Mariners\u2019 keeper Mark Birighitti comes up! He\u2019s near it, but can\u2019t get a decisive touch. And with the opposite goal begging, Redmayne hangs onto it, with his own fans baying to see him pump it long and into an empty net. But there\u2019s the whistle. 90 min: Four minutes added on is the verdict from the touchline. And as Mariners push, Sydney look to break in transition - but with no Baumjohann, Ninkovic or Le Fondre out there it\u2019s not quite as ruthless as we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks. 88 min: This is turning into on to forget for Sydney FC fans, their side have been woefully disinterested for large periods of this second half. And now they\u2019ve conceded 70% of possession over the last 10 minutes, drawing the odd rare boo from their home supporters. And finally a big chance - and it\u2019s a huge save from Redmayne! He gets the big paw up to deny Gallifuoco\u2019s thumping header. What a sequence. And now he\u2019s scampered off his line to clear ahead of De Silva. 84 min: It\u2019s an A-League debut for Harry van der Saag, Sydney\u2019s young right back. And it\u2019s fellow youngster Ruiz-Diaz who blazes an effort over for Mariners. They\u2019re still all tip, no iceberg, the visitors. And unfortunately, that\u2019s been a story of their season - plenty of promise in buildup, but woefully short of firepower up front. 77 min: Trent Buhagiar comes on for Sydney FC, another former Mariners star, following Anthony Caceres onto the pitch in Sky Blue. His pace almost carves out an opening, but again Birighitti is attentive in the Mariners goal. 71 min: For all their industry, this game is drifting very comfortably away from the Mariners - it might be time for Stajcic to shuffle his pack. In fairness it\u2019s a very young bench - only Matt \u201cGolden Elbows\u201d Simon the obvious potential game changer, and it\u2019s him and teenager Dylan Ruiz-Diaz comes on for the fitness-seeking duo of Duric and Jair. 63 min: Oh my! Almost a calamity from absolutely nothing! A routine back pass but Andrew Redmayne half fluffs his control, and he clears the ball as it rolls over his own goal-line. It had definitely passed the line, but not the whole of the ball. Imagine if the Mariners had drawn level there! Innocuous stuff. 58 min: It\u2019s hardly been the action-packed thriller of Victory v Phoenix, and dare you\u2019d say, has nowhere near the niggle, but Mariners for their part are sticking fast to their guns. A rare opportunity as Ninkovic fires over under pressure. Remarkably, they\u2019ve fashioned only one shot on target tonight, and that was the goal. They\u2019re not exactly coasting, the champions, but they\u2019ve not exactly put the pedal to the floor. Second half! Sydney FC 1-0 Central Coast We\u2019re back underway in Kogarah - what can Alen Stajcic\u2019s men come up with? Mark Birighitti is called into early action as Barbarouses hares through on goal. Sharp goalkeeping. A quick around the grounds to see what\u2019s happening elsewhere - and I can report for our NZ fans, a key breakthrough, and then a big let off. Marnus gets 500 for the summer, but will he punish lax catching? Adam Collins is our eyes and ears there: A-League: Sydney FC 1-0 Central Coast - half-time 45 min: Ooh, a late chance for the Mariners, as Jair stooped to try and head home a cross that was just behind the Brazilian. And straight away Sydney almost score at the other end. That\u2019s how they do you - just when you think you\u2019re back in it, dangerzone. The Mariners survive on this occasion though, and it\u2019s the home side nursing a narrow lead. NBL: Melbourne United 81-104 Sydney Kings And a strong bounce-back in the NBL by the ladder-leaders after losses to the Wildcats and Taipans. Here\u2019s Australian Associated Press\u2019 executive summary: United entered Saturday\u2019s contest at Melbourne Arena, having won their past seven home games against the Kings, but the NBL frontrunners ended their drought with a dominant performance against their fierce interstate rivals. United\u2019s attack disappeared in the opening quarter and the Kings took full advantage, jumping ahead 31-18 before extending their lead to 16 points with a 9-0 run to close the first half. Melbourne attempted a comeback in the second half but the visitors showed their championship favouritism as they thwarted every United charge to run out comfortable winners. Kings point guard Casper Ware tormented his former club with a game-high 28 points, Didi Louzada added 14 and Jae\u2019Sean Tate finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds, as Andrew Bogut earned his first win over United in his home town. Melo Trimble (19 points) and Shawn Long (18) tried valiantly to keep Melbourne in the match but they received little support apart from Casey Prather (10). 33 min: Alex Baumjohann tries to pick out a teammate, but it\u2019s well cut out by Rowles. What a revelation the German has been in his second season - his contribution has been Ninkovic-esque - a stark contrast to his unhappy time at Western Sydney last campaign. And for our golfing aficionados to catch up on all the day\u2019s President\u2019s Cup action please scroll back down for my colleague Scott Heinrich\u2019s excellent wrap of day three. The standout story remains to be however unfolding off the greens, as Tiger Woods digs in to defend his beleaguered and under-performing player Patrick Reed: 22 min: For all they\u2019ve gone behind early, the Mariners have made a fair fist of this, without necessarily creating any clear cut chances, mind. Steve Corica won\u2019t mind. He\u2019s not a \u201csit back and nurse your lead\u201d type of coach, but he\u2019ll happily try and rope-a-dope opposing teams, especially those chasing an early lead. 13 min: Mariners with some sustained possession, but Sydney happy to allow their visitors the ball at the back, before looking to spring on lightning transition, like they did so well during their 5-1 thumping of Brisbane last week. Speaking of, if you missed the earlier news story some choice words from Roar coach Robbie Fowler who fair to say, took exception to a non-post-game-handshake salvo from Mark Rudan: Goal! Sydney FC 1-0 Central Coast (Barbarouses) - 4\u2019 Ach. Alen Stajcic has spent all week masterminding a game plan to upset the reigning champions. And it\u2019s lasted all of 250 seconds. An error by Jack Clisby at left back allows Rhyan Grant in behind - and he\u2019s got two to choose from in the centre, but his cross is tucked home by Kosta Barbarouses! A horrific start for the bottom-placed side. What a test of their character this will now be. Kick off! And here\u2019s how they line up - firstly, Sydney FC: And the Mariners: The hugely experienced Korean Kim takes the armband, while Jair - the former Newcastle Jets man - is handed a first start after winning a contract on trial. So - let\u2019s look ahead to the A-League second fixture - it\u2019s Sydney FC hosting Central Coast Mariners. Top vs bottom. Free flowing v free falling. Goliath v David. Which would all be a foregone conclusion if it wasn\u2019t for these two clubs having a habit of throwing up tasty fixtures across the years.. what price for a John Aloisi era 4-3 tonight? A lively conclusion to a real thriller from Queensland. A double to Hayley Raso and a goal to youngster Indiah-Paige Riley has denied the Reds a share of the points, after Mary Fowler and Mallory Weber drew the visitors back from 2-0 down inside 12 minutes. The home side just shaded possession and created more chances, but had to endure a nervy late showing, despite Raso\u2019s 83rd minute winner. They notch back to back wins after starting the season with consecutive defeats - but it\u2019s back to the drawing board for the hard-working Reds, who remain bottom, and pointless. The headline act today is of course the Australia v New Zealand cricket Test - Geoff Lemon is our eyes and ears for that one, where Australia is just starting its second innings, after a Mitchell Starc 5-for handed them a healthy lead: Thanks Scotty, and what a start to our triple header of A-League football tonight. That was a crucial game for Melbourne Victory\u2019s season, where Marco Kurz\u2019s tenure is on a wing and a prayer. If they\u2019d lost that one it could have made for a very nervy derby against high-flying crosstown rivals, City. For the Phoenix, coach Ufuk Talay will be hugely disappointed not have got all three points there. It\u2019s another feather in his cap, the manner in which the visitors outplayed, out-competed, and mentally out-edged a spikey encounter. But they\u2019ll need more in the final third if they\u2019re to be a real force come finals time of the season. There\u2019s plenty of non-A-League action flying round too - I\u2019ll get settled in my plump sofa chair and race round the grounds to bring you that as well - golf, cricket, W-League and more: that\u2019s Sportwatch. Proof that games of football don\u2019t need goals to be compelling, absorbing, engaging and thoroughly entertaining. The action was fast, the quality high and the cards plentiful. Referee Stephen Lucas peeled off 11 cards - 10 yellow and one red - with Melbourne Victory attracting all but three of them. As for the result, it suits the Nix much more than the Victory, who need points in bundles of three rather than one. As for me, I\u2019m done. Put a fork in me. Over to you, Richard Parkin. A-League: 90 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wellington There will be five minutes of added time. That should be enough for 20 or so yellow cards. A-League: 85 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wellington And now Devlin gets a yellow, Fomo clearly getting the better of him. I\u2019ve never seen a 0-0 like it. It\u2019s x-rated. A-League: 81 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wellington It\u2019s been high-octane stuff from the outset but if anything this match is picking up pace as the clock winds down. Referee Stephen Lucas has brandished more cards than he\u2019ll send at Christmas (maybe, maybe not, but I couldn\u2019t resist the pun) and that\u2019s now 10 in total following an eight-minute period that saw five yellows. For reasons varying from dissent to bad tackles and anything in between, Nabbout, Sotirio, Toivonen, Broxham and Poulsen are now in the book. Interestingly, or perhaps not, eight of the 10 cards have been shown to Victory players. The stage is set for a grandstand finish to the 2019 Presidents Cup after an afternoon of high drama and twists and turns at Royal Melbourne. Team USA finally won a session to reduce a four-point deficit to just two, but it was an extraordinary collapse from American superstars Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler that left golf fans gobsmacked and with the Internationals in sight of a shock first triumph since 1998. Thomas and Fowler squandered a five-hole advantage with eight to play to square their foursomes match with Marc Leishman and Abraham Ancer, who remains unbeaten on his Cup debut after the extraordinary comeback. The priceless half point ensures the Internationals will carry the lead into Sunday\u2019s deciding singles for the first time since last winning the cup 21 years ago, also at Royal Melbourne. The Internationals\u2019 10-8 advantage leaves the heavily favoured and star-studded US outfit needing at least 7.5 points from the 12 possible from Sunday\u2019s singles session to win the Cup for the eighth time in a row. After seeing his team lose the morning fourball session 2.5 to 1.5 to trail 9-5 overall, US playing captain Tiger Woods was questioned for not picking himself in the foursomes. When Dustin Johnson and Gary Woodland beat Adam Scott and Louis Oosthuizen two and one, and Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay downed Cameron Smith and Sungjae Im by the same scoreline, Woods, though, was looking like a genius. But suddenly, the Internationals have all the momentum after Joaquin Niemann and Byeong Hun An had also charged back from two down with five to play to rescue half a point against Kuchar and Tony Finau in the final match of the day. - with thanks to AAP A-League: 59 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wellington Dobras red card! Dobras gets his marching orders after raising his right boot to clear a ball but collecting Devlin in the mouth on the way through. He was already on a yellow but that\u2019s a straight red. The Victory players are apoplectic, and one does have to ask what else Dobras could do. You could argue that Devlin was simply in the way. Does seem harsh but regardless, the hosts are down to 10 men. W-League: HT: Brisbane Roar 2-1 Adelaide United An entertaining, open half of play comes to an end, with Fowler\u2019s strike after 25 minutes halving Adelaide\u2019s deficit. A-League: 51 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wellington The half-time break has done little to calm these players. Dobras earns the fourth yellow of the match for his crass tackle from behind on Devlin, and moments later Wellington\u2019s best chance of the game almost goes in as DeVere soars above the rest only for his header to crash onto the crossbar and down onto, not over, the goal line. W-League: Goal! Brisbane Roar 2-1 Adelaide United (Mary Fowler, 25\u2019) We have no goals in the A-League but the scorer is being kept very busy in the W-League. And just when you were thinking, \u2018How far the Roar?\u2019, Adelaide strike back courtesy of Mary Fowler\u2019s goal midway through the first half. A-League: HT: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wellington No goals but plenty of action in a highly entertaining half of football at AAMI Park. The best chances of the half were owned mostly by Melbourne Victory, with two chances not taken late in the piece that on another day might have gone in. Firstly, Dobras shot low and hard from outside the box, beating the keeper but cannoning his shot into the post, before Toivonen sent a free kick from just outside the area wide to the left. W-League: Goal! Brisbane Roar 2-0 Adelaide United (Hayley Raso, 12\u2019) The Roar are all over Adelaide in these early exchanges and now it\u2019s 2-0 to the home side after Hayley Raso\u2019s quality strike. A-League: 34 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wellington More yellow than a Coldplay song at AAMI Park right now, with three cards shown in as many spiteful minutes. First, Donachie is cautioned for his slide tackle on Ball, then Steinmann goes in the book for rushing in and inflaming the situation. Something the referee mightn\u2019t have seen was Donachie raising his hand and collecting Steinmann on the chops. You\u2019d hope he didn\u2019t see it, because if he did that\u2019s a second yellow and thanks for coming right there. To round out an eventful little spell, Basha collects Davila with a poor challenge and gets his own yellow. W-League: Goal! Brisbane Roar 1-0 Adelaide United (Indiah-Paige Riley, 4\u2019) Brisbane draw first blood at Lions FC Stadium with Indiah-Paige Riley finding the back of the net in a game both sides will be desperately seeking three points. Track Cycling World Cup update Despite battling cancer, sprint star Matthew Glaetzer has continued to inspire his Australian teammates at the Brisbane World Cup track cycling round. At his final meet before undergoing treatment, the two-time world champion is aiming to be a medal threat after comfortably winning his heat and cruising into the Keirin second round on Saturday. The 27-year-old is showing no sign of slowing down despite receiving health news that would stop many in their tracks. In his first event since being diagnosed with thyroid cancer, Glaetzer won Keirin bronze at last weekend\u2019s World Cup round in New Zealand. Now barely a month after his health scare, he has staked an early medal claim at Brisbane\u2019s Anna Meares Velodrome with his impressive effort on Saturday. \u201cHe is real eager to keep going. He doesn\u2019t want to step away,\u201d Glaetzer\u2019s Australian star teammate Sam Welsford said. \u201cIt is motivating the rest of the team just the way he gives 100 per cent every day.\u201d Glaetzer will receive treatment after the Brisbane round but is still hopeful of contesting February\u2019s world titles and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. - with thanks to AAP A-League: 17 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Wellington A fairly lively opening to this contest and it was very nearly 1-0 to the Victory after Toivonen wins a header, finds some space in the box and pulls the trigger ... only for Marinovic to effect a stunning one-hand save to his right. We\u2019re up, up, up and away in the A-League game between Melbourne Victory and Wellington. Do the Victory need a win here or what? It\u2019s still early-ish days, but a loss here would be near catastrophic (in the context of their championship ambitions, obviously). Here are the teams: Melbourne Victory (4-2-3-1): Thomas (GK); Traore, Broxham, Donachie, Lesiotis; Poulsen, Basha; Kruse, Dobras, Nabbout; Toivonen. Subs: White (GK), Barnett, Brown, Lauton, Roux, Carrigan, Kamsoba. Wellington (4-2-3-1): Marinovic (GK); Cacace, De Vere, Taylor, Payne; Steinmann, Devlin; Piscopo, Davila, Sotirio; Ball. Subs: Sail (GK), Hudson-Wihongi, Waine, Hooper, McCowatt, McGing. And here\u2019s more on that stoush between a fan and Patrick Reed\u2019s caddie at the Presidents Cup today. What with this and the Fowler-Rudan blue, there\u2019s quite a bit of acrimony doing the rounds today. Tasty! Track Cycling World Cup update Sidelined by brain surgery, Australian track cycling coach Tim Decker has still been able to make his presence felt at the Brisbane World Cup round. Confidence is sky high for Australia\u2019s world champion team pursuit outfit ahead of the Tokyo Olympics after they overcame their mentor\u2019s absence to claim World Cup gold at Anna Meares Velodrome. Australia were reeling ahead of the three-day meet that concludes on Sunday when Decker underwent an operation to repair a brain bleed following an accident while riding his bike. They were told the man who had guided both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s team pursuit outfits to stunning 2019 world title victories would be out of action until the New Year. The shock news came just five years after Decker first underwent brain surgery following another bike crash. Decker may have been recovering in Adelaide but he still proved to be an inspiration at the Brisbane World Cup\u2019s opening night on Friday, with both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s combinations toasting their mentor after striking gold. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the main cogs in our team. I know how much he was hurting not being here,\u201d Australian women\u2019s star Annette Edmondson said. \u201cWe got a call from him just before the finals and we know he is with us every step of the way. We can\u2019t wait for him to get back but it\u2019s nice to know we can do it without him if we have to.\u201d The Australian men threatened to break their own world record in the first round heats before finishing almost four seconds ahead of New Zealand in the finals. And the Australian women gave their national record a nudge on their way to holding out the Kiwis in the gold medal race. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have our coach so we didn\u2019t have any splits, so it was all about feel and knowing each other - that comes from years of training together,\u201d Australian men\u2019s star Sam Welsford said. \u201cWe rely on Tim a lot so it was actually good for us to be self-reliant and focus on what we could do, trusting our ability and backing ourselves. But we can\u2019t wait to have him back.\u201d - with thanks to AAP RIP Sir Peter Snell. My, could this man run. How about handshake-gate, eh? While it\u2019s not quite on the Rooney-Vardy scale of stuff-your-face-with-popcorn-and-watch-it-all-unfold drama, it\u2019s about as close as the A-League gets. In a nutshell, Mark Rudan and Robbie Fowler were slinging barbs left, right and centre after last night\u2019s Roar-United A-Leagued game. Check out the story below. And don\u2019t forget the popcorn. Play is about to commence on day three of the first Test between Australia and New Zealand in Perth. And the big news is Josh Hazlewood is done for the match with that hamstring. Follow the play via our liveblog, which is now, um, live. Presidents Cup update - Patrick Reed\u2019s caddie is having a shocker Patrick Reed\u2019s caddie Kessler Karain has been involved in an altercation with a fan after the Saturday morning session of the Presidents Cup.The American Golf Channel reported that Karain, who is Reed\u2019s brother-in-law, got physical with a fan at Royal Melbourne. The controversial US golfer is winless from his three matches and has been targeted by local fans since his arrival in Australia. Last week he was penalised for improving his lie in a bunker during a tournament, with Australian golfer Cameron Smith, who is on the International team, labelling him a cheat. Fellow Aussie Marc Leishman said the 2018 Masters champion had brought the taunts and criticism on himself. The Golf Channel reported that tensions boiled over following the morning fourball competition. \u201cReed was really hearing it from the fans and it got a little out of control there after the match and that\u2019s where the altercation took place,\u201d the Channel said. On day one, Reed shouldered Smith, who was in the crowd, as he left a hole, with the Australian saying he wasn\u2019t sure what prompted the bizarre action. A group of fans dressed up as Reed\u2019s caddie on Saturday, but were stripped by security of toy clubs and a shovel. - with thanks to AAP Presidents Cup update - Patrick Reed is having a shocker Tiger Woods\u2019 unflinching faith in Patrick Reed is proving an unmitigated disaster, with golf\u2019s most polarising personality suffering a third straight Presidents Cup defeat at Royal Melbourne. Woods raised eyebrows even among American fans when he opted to pair up Reed with Webb Simpson again on Saturday, despite the duo being humbled in their opening two matches. Heckled at every opportunity by fans following his cheating scandal last week in the Bahamas, Reed slumped to a crushing five-and-three fourball loss to Hideki Matsuyama and CT Pan as the Internationals extended their commanding lead to four points. Reed was the only player not to win even a single hole. - with thanks to AAP How hangs it, sports fans? Cracking day of sport in the offing if I do say so myself. The wonderment and glory of the Test summer continues in Perth (separate liveblog) but there\u2019s a sight more than just the cricket to whet your appetite: day three of the Presidents Cup is ongoing, there are three A-league games and one W-League game today, plus a bit cycling in Brisbane (I say a bit, but in actual fact it\u2019s the Track Cycling World Cup, so actually a lot). You know how it goes here: send me an email or a tweet if you\u2019d like to get in touch.",

      "body": "<p>When <em>The Street</em> was published in 1946, African American literature was tacitly understood to be African American male literature; and women\u2019s literature was coded as white women\u2019s literature. Ann Petry was a New Englander, yet she didn\u2019t write with the reserve we associate with authors from that region. This is no novel of manners a la Dorothy West. Nor did she choose Walden Pond as her muse. Instead, Petry set her story in Harlem, but not the \u201cNew Negro\u201d centre of racial uplift and progress. For Petry, 116th Street is the gritty antagonist, representing the intersection of racism, sexism, poverty and human frailty.</p> <p>I was fortunate to discover <em>The Street</em> as an undergraduate student at Spelman College, historically a black women\u2019s college in Atlanta. The week before, we had read Richard Wright\u2019s <em>Native Son</em>, and were dismayed by the depiction of Bessie, the only significant black female character in this book that purportedly illuminated the \u201cblack experience\u201d in the 1940s. A professor now myself, I understand that we were assigned <em>Native Son</em> first not because some critics considered <em>The Street</em> to be a women\u2019s version of <em>Native Son</em>, but because after reading <em>The Street</em> we would not have had patience for <em>Native Son</em>\u2019s violent erasure of black women\u2019s lives. (Also, seasoned professors assign the most exciting books at the end of term to motivate exhausted students to make it to the finish line.)</p> <p>The beating heart of <em>The Street</em> is Lutie Johnson, a single mother of an eight-year-old son. A traditional woman at heart, she married her sweetheart, anticipating some hardships, but overall, expected a happy and respectable life. However, reality intruded on this dream. The union couldn\u2019t withstand the everyday strains of marriage coupled with the financial challenges brought on by pernicious racism and the unique pressure of Lutie\u2019s job as a maid. He cheats; she leaves. Down, but not out, Lutie remains inspired by Benjamin Franklin \u2013 she is convinced that \u201canybody could be rich if he wanted to and worked hard enough and figured it out carefully enough\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, Lutie is an American. However, she is a black American and these terms do not always mesh. Recently, I was in Washington with my friend, the novelist Jacqueline Woodson. We were on our way to a meeting with Michelle Obama, so questions of citizenship and belonging were at the forefront of our minds. We paused before a huge US flag, draped from a silver pole, watching a gaggle of white tourists pose for photos. Jacqueline suggested that I do the same. In the picture, I am smiling uneasily as the flag, nudged by the wind, curls around my arm.</p> <p>Jacqueline said: \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like any picture of a black person and the American flag appears to be a protest?\u201d Studying the tiny photo of me surrounded by stars and stripes, I agreed. \u201cAt the very least, the image is ironic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b18512a7aaca4face0864100fc2230f198b6f458\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b18512a7aaca4face0864100fc2230f198b6f458/0_0_241_392/241.jpg\" alt=\"An early copy of The Street\" width=\"241\" height=\"392\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An early copy of <em>The Street</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whenever I think of <em>The Street</em>, my mind is flooded with ironic images. Perhaps it goes back to the first copy I purchased, during my undergraduate days. The cover was all muted greyscale tones; on it, a child hugs his mother\u2019s legs. A classmate had a vintage copy that portrayed Lutie as a buxom bombshell corseted into a red dress. In the years since, I have come across many editions: one shows Lutie, still red-dressed, and captioned: \u201cThe boldly shocking bestselling novel of a woman caught in the vice and violence of Harlem.\u201d Another shows Lutie in a 1980s skirt suit, as she rests her hands on the shoulders of her small son. She looks as if she is a woman on her way to the office, pondering issues of the work/life balance. A mass-market paperback shows Lutie decked out in a turtleneck, trench coat and leggings. The description \u2013 \u201cShe was a soul on ice in a brutal ghetto\u201d \u2013 echoes Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s iconic memoir of race and masculinity.</p> <p>These conflicting images speak to the complexity of Lutie and the Street itself. Crossing the line between belles-lettres and pulp, Petry was a pioneer of the literary thriller, a genre popularised by her contemporary Patricia Highsmith. <em>The Street </em>embodies many of the conventions of crime fiction, and the novel is populated by a host of seedy characters. Boots Smith, the slimy bandleader; Junto, the nightclub owner, so dastardly that he makes Boots seem like a gentleman; Jones, the building superintendent, who sneaks into Lutie\u2019s apartment and fondles her underwear. There is no comfort for Lutie in the friendship of women. The most generous person she meets is the madame downstairs, who offers her an opportunity to be decently compensated for demeaning sex work.</p> <p>These juicy details are reflected in the trashy book covers and perhaps explain its incredible sales record. However, <em>The Street</em> is so much more than a lurid tale, soaked in sex, violence and suspense. Petry laces through the story shrewd social commentary about the relentless nature of poverty and its effect on black women in particular. She addresses stereotypes one by one and crushes them underfoot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"44fe965f43d34d34baf576d470a51220aa2122bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44fe965f43d34d34baf576d470a51220aa2122bc/0_0_1058_1600/661.jpg\" alt=\"The Street Novel by Ann Petry\" width=\"661\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One treasured figure in the American myth is that of the mammy, the black domestic worker who cares for her employer\u2019s family with duty and delight.

      "bodyText": "When The Street was published in 1946, African American literature was tacitly understood to be African American male literature; and women\u2019s literature was coded as white women\u2019s literature. Ann Petry was a New Englander, yet she didn\u2019t write with the reserve we associate with authors from that region. This is no novel of manners a la Dorothy West. Nor did she choose Walden Pond as her muse. Instead, Petry set her story in Harlem, but not the \u201cNew Negro\u201d centre of racial uplift and progress. For Petry, 116th Street is the gritty antagonist, representing the intersection of racism, sexism, poverty and human frailty. I was fortunate to discover The Street as an undergraduate student at Spelman College, historically a black women\u2019s college in Atlanta. The week before, we had read Richard Wright\u2019s Native Son, and were dismayed by the depiction of Bessie, the only significant black female character in this book that purportedly illuminated the \u201cblack experience\u201d in the 1940s. A professor now myself, I understand that we were assigned Native Son first not because some critics considered The Street to be a women\u2019s version of Native Son, but because after reading The Street we would not have had patience for Native Son\u2019s violent erasure of black women\u2019s lives.

      "bodyText": "In the midst of Barack Obama\u2019s much-vaunted military surge against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2010, Hayam Mohammed, an elder from Panjwai near the Pakistani border confronted an officer from the US 101st Airborne who had come into his village. \u201cYou walk here during the day,\u201d the elder told the soldier bitterly as the Observer listened. \u201cBut at night [the Taliban] come bringing night letters\u201d \u2013 threats targeting those collaborating with foreign forces. That surge, which like so many other initiatives in Afghanistan\u2019s long war was celebrated as a huge success, today serves only as a grim reminder of the deception and failure revealed in the explosive Afghanistan papers published by the Washington Post this week. Comprising more than 600 interviews with key insiders collected confidentially by the Office of Special Inspector General for Reconstruction in Afghanistan [Sigar], and published after a three-year court battle, the trove has been compared in significance to the Pentagon Papers, the secret Department of Defense history of the Vietnam war leaked in 1971. Like that secret history, the Afghanistan Papers\u2019 accumulated oral history depicts a war mired in failure \u2013 in sharp contrast to the \u201cmisleading\u201d story told to the US and British publics by officials in massaged figures and over-optimistic assessments. But even if that deception has been the main focus of reporting, the hundreds of interviews \u2013 with senior generals and Afghan governors, with ambassadors, aid officials and policy advisers \u2013 also tell another story: how successive presidents from Bush through Obama to Donald Trump, publicly rejected \u201cnation-building\u201d but created a violent, corrupt and dysfunctional state only barely propped up by US arms. They detail too how \u2013 like the Soviet Union before them \u2013 the US and its allies came so badly unstuck in Afghanistan through a combination of hubris and ignorance, and with a political leadership \u2013 both under Obama and Bush \u2013 more concerned with domestic politics than the impact of their decisions on Afghanistan. Reading at times like an extended exercise in blame, the interviews trace a widespread desire among participants to nail down an original sin for the failures in Afghanistan; even to seek an exculpation for a conflict that has cost $1tn and the lives of tens of thousands over almost 20 years. From the shortcomings of the US military\u2019s newly rewritten counter-insurgency doctrine \u2013 described by one interviewee as \u201ccolonial\u201d in its conceit \u2013 to a tolerance of widespread corruption and \u201cwarlordism\u201d blamed for fueling the resurgence of the Taliban, a key theme of many of those who spoke to Sigar was the lack of coherence in Washington\u2019s approach to Afghanistan from the outset. From the very beginning, as Richard Haas \u2013 the former US government policy coordinator for Afghanistan \u2013 confided in his interview, there was little enthusiasm in George W Bush\u2019s White House for the country once the Taliban was driven out in 2001. \u201cI remember that we were around the table and there was the president [George W Bush]. The feeling was that you could put a lot into it and you wouldn\u2019t get a lot out of it. I would not call it cynical, I would call it pessimistic about what the relationship [was] between investment and return in Afghanistan.\u201d Other interviewee subjects, however, place the initial failure even further back: with the original decision to elide the Taliban with Osama bin Laden\u2019s al-Qaida in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Among people like Jeffrey Eggers, a former US Navy Seal and staffer on the National Security Council in the George Bush and Obama administrations, this the key point. \u201cWhy did we make the Taliban the enemy when we were attacked by al-Qaida? Why did we want to defeat the Taliban? Why did we think it was necessary to build a hyper-function[al] state to forgo the return of the Taliban?\u201d For Richard Boucher, assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs between 2006 and 2009, the contradictions in the aims framed a mission that appeared founded on impossibility. \u201cIf we think our exit strategy is to either beat the Taliban \u2013 which can\u2019t be done given the local, regional, and cross border circumstances \u2013 or to establish an Afghan government that is capable of delivering good government to its citizens using American tools and methods, then we do not have an exit strategy because both of those are impossible.\u201d His summation, however, was even more scathing: \u201cWe did not know what we were doing.\u201d The lack of vision at the war\u2019s start, which left the US and its allies racing to catch up as US attention turned quickly to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was only exacerbated by the decisions that would belatedly get made in response to the rapidly resurgent Taliban in the middle of the last decade. Among the handful of Britons identified by name in the papers is Gen David Richards, the commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2007. \u201cThere was no coherent long-term strategy,\u201d Richards told the Sigar interviewers, adding that the countries involved in the International Stabilisation Force [Isaf], under Nato command, had insufficient troops to do the job. \u201cEvery nation was in charge of protecting an area larger than they had forces to do so with, and if you don\u2019t have enough forces to protect what you\u2019re trying to do, stabilization can\u2019t be done.\u201d \u201cNo individual is to blame,\u201d he added bleakly: \u201cThe system let everyone down.\u201d But if there is one issue with the Afghanistan papers, however, it is that they represent the views of a selection of insiders who were at one time or another invested in the success of the war, often unable to step outside the sometimes arcane disagreements they were steeped in. Austin Wright, an academic who specialises in Afghanistan at the University of Chicago, and has made a study of the declassified military records of the war, offers an outsider\u2019s perspective from his reading of the interviews. Wright notes that many in the media have picked up on the acknowledgment by the head of Sigar, John J Sopko, asserting the US public was \u201cmisled\u201d consistently by official accounting of progress of the war. But he believes that focus misses the fact that many in leadership positions also misinterpreted their own data concerning the nature, intentions and capabilities of the Taliban at key points in the conflict in their desire to see signs of victory. Wright points to US military and Nato surveys that indicated that at key points, including after their initial defeat, the Taliban simply withdrew either to regroup or instill a false sense of progress, echoing the observation made by village elder Hayam Mohammed at the height of the 2010 surge. \u201cThe Taliban are strategic and patient,\u201d says Wright. \u201cThey are also skillful at manipulating the information being seen in the field to maximise any political process. \u201cWhat you see \u2013 during the Obama era handover of leadership to Afghan forces for example \u2013 is a significant reduction in violence across large areas where there are foreign forces. But what the survey data also showed was a continuing Taliban presence, not necessarily fighting but not going away. \u201cThen, when you see the actual physical withdrawal of US troops, you see an increase in violence again. What that tells you is that they have been sitting it out to until the cost of re-intervention becomes too high.\u201d The sense of overdue re-evaluation is not confined to just those interviewed by Sigar but shared by many who served in senior roles in Afghanistan. \u201cI remember thinking at the time I was running around Helmand that we should be able to do this, whatever that thing was,\u201d a former British diplomat who served in the region told the Observer. \u201cBut in retrospect, it was not realistic because while we were pissing into sand in Helmand you have to look at bigger picture. \u201cLooking back, [then-Afghan president Hamid] Karzai had already given up on the west when Bush went into Iraq. \u201cAnd by the time people realised that the Taliban were coming back it was too late.\u201d A very reasonable question was what would have happened if the international community had delivered the investment and committed the resources in 2003-04 that were delivered 2008-10. The diplomat responds to a point made by Gen Dan McNeill, the former US and Nato commander in Afghanistan, Dan McNeill, who in his interview with Sigar complained that even before his first deployment in 2002 he could not find anyone able to give him a definition of what \u201cwinning meant\u201d. \u201cIf you can\u2019t define \u2018winnable\u2019 how do you define if the war is lost. What is clear,\u201d he added looking to the future, \u201cis that there is going to be an ongoing low level of commitment for a long time to come in terms training and in terms of trying to prevent Afghanistan becoming a serious problem again. \u201cYou can argue that you are preventing Afghanistan being used as an operational base for the really bad guys, but then there are plenty of other options for them.

The AJC has threatened legal action against Warner Bros, and female journalists have shared their frustration with both the sullying of a respected and hard-working professional and also the recycling of a tired stereotype of reporters sleeping with sources for intel. Warners and Eastwood stood their ground, turning the tables on the paper, blaming them again for reckless journalism but not explaining the origin of the scene itself. And at the Gotham Awards last week, Wilde <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/olivia-wilde-defends-richard-jewell-character-kathy-scruggs-1203421696/\">claimed</a> it was sexist for critics to call out the scene and was a misunderstanding of feminism.</p> <p>This week, as the film is released in cinemas, the backlash has increased, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/12/crass-and-contemptible-is-clint-eastwoods-new-movie-built-on-a-lie\">a reported feature I wrote</a> to others from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/business/media/richard-jewell-kathy-scruggs.html\">the New York Times</a> to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-clint-eastwoods-new-movie-gets-every-wrong-about-the-female-reporter-who-broke-the-richard-jewell-story/2019/12/10/fca0d8b4-1b69-11ea-8d58-5ac3600967a1_story.html\">the Washington Post</a>.

First, this isn\u2019t true with a large percentage of reviews revealing unease over the scene and second, the only people reducing the character to this are those involved in the film.</p> <p>Scruggs was referred to as a \u201cdedicated reporter\u201d known for her bawdy humour and larger-than-life character in The Suspect, but is portrayed on screen as an unprofessional and highly sexed cipher, slithering up to an FBI agent, pushing her hand up his thigh and debating whether to have sex in a hotel room or a car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ba0bc49513ed6650744b594d46f7a3614ef9725\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba0bc49513ed6650744b594d46f7a3614ef9725/0_0_3500_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clint Eastwood attends the premiere of Richard Jewell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clint Eastwood attends the premiere of Richard Jewell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Screenwriter Billy Ray, who initially told me he would \u201creserve comment\u201d <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/12/richard-jewell-movie-controversy-reporter-kathy-scruggs-clint-eastwood-billy-ray-atlanta-journal-constitution-1202806453/\">has now opened up</a>, attacking the AJC for \u201ca distraction campaign\u201d by focusing on one minute of a two-hour-plus movie. \u201cThe movie isn\u2019t about Kathy Scruggs; it\u2019s about the heroism and hounding of Richard Jewell, and what rushed reporting can do to an innocent man,\u201d he told Hollywood news site Deadline. \u201cAnd by the way, I will stand by every word and assertion in the script.\u201d He also takes credit for \u201cthe redeeming of Kathy Scruggs\u201d as in the film, she realises her mistake despite never \u201cpublicly atoning\u201d in real life.</p> <p>In the same piece, Deadline confirms what we already knew, and what those who knew her have said and what the two men who wrote the exhaustive book about Richard Jewell have stated: there\u2019s no evidence she traded sex for information.

      "bodyText": "The ongoing furore over Clint Eastwood\u2019s Oscar-hungry new drama Richard Jewell shows no signs of abating, partly because the contentious issue at its centre is so egregious and partly because no one involved with the film is willing to admit this. The film purports to tell the \u201ctrue\u201d story of the heroic security guard who found the pipe bomb which killed one person and injured 111 others at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He was heralded as a hero until he became the focus of the FBI investigation, a fact that was first made public in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution before getting picked up across the country. Jewell was ultimately cleared after a difficult 88 days of accusations and media focus. Since its premiere last month, one particular scene has sparked controversy, an interaction alleging sex-for-tips between Kathy Scruggs, the AJC journalist who broke the story \u2013 and played in the film by Olivia Wilde as a vampish femme fatale \u2013 and an FBI agent, an amalgamation of characters played by Jon Hamm. It\u2019s an unverified claim according to her colleagues, friends and family as well as Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen, the authors of The Suspect, the book that served as a basis for the film and which involved over 180 interviews in research. In a firmly worded statement this week Alexander and Salwen stated that they found no evidence of sex-for-tips ever having taken place. Scruggs herself died in 2001. Those who knew and worked with Scruggs have expressed their anger. The AJC has threatened legal action against Warner Bros, and female journalists have shared their frustration with both the sullying of a respected and hard-working professional and also the recycling of a tired stereotype of reporters sleeping with sources for intel.

And at the Gotham Awards last week, Wilde claimed it was sexist for critics to call out the scene and was a misunderstanding of feminism. This week, as the film is released in cinemas, the backlash has increased, from a reported feature I wrote to others from the New York Times to the Washington Post. As a result a new round of statements have emerged from those involved, but rather than providing any substantial proof or apologising, they have only added to the controversy.

      "body": "<p>In the beginning I was just a dad who fell over a bit and then couldn\u2019t drive the car. Then we had a name for what was happening to me: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/15/dad-writing-birthday-cards-for-sons-he-wont-see-grow-up-motor-neurone-disease\" title=\"\">motor neurone disease</a>.<strong> </strong>The rest of my physical decline has taken two years and I now write with a camera attached to a computer, which tracks reflections from my pupils. I can use the same device to talk with my synthetic voice. It\u2019s obviously slower to use, and has trained me to get to the point, in much the same way that dying has.</p> <p>In the room next door, as I write, I can hear Jimmy, my two-year-old son, offering to take passengers on a bus ride to various destinations. It\u2019s half-term and Tom, my seven-year-old, has wandered out into the garden. He\u2019s smiling, looking back at the house, as he points out a squirrel to someone standing inside. There\u2019s adult laughter, too. I can hear Gill, my wife, talking with one of my carers.</p> <p>I\u2019m in an adjacent downstairs bedroom, suspended in a sling that hangs from the ceiling hoist. It\u2019s positioned over a bedpan, and my floppy neck is wedged upright between a pillow and a piece of foam. I usually stay here for a while because it also has a view of the garden. It\u2019s gusty and leaves are twirling down from an ash tree.</p> <p>I realise I\u2019ve been saying goodbye to my family for two years. Always imagining this version of myself, without a voice or moving parts. But now I\u2019m here, I can see that we\u2019re all just interested in the same thing: how anxious all these squirrels are as they bury their treasure in the turf. How they keep looking back over their shoulders. And how life just carries on, until it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>There was a moment halfway through my decline when Tom needed to check whether he would die one day. He was wrapped in a blanket on my lap as I confirmed its inevitability. He sobbed and I pulled the sides of the blanket in around him. After a few moments his tears came to an end, and five minutes later he was upside down on the sofa giggling at his toes.</p> <p>Children walk past spiders\u2019 webs all the time and see little things dying. Death is all around them; they know this better than their parents, who have often forgotten. I know I had. But children haven\u2019t reached this stage yet. Death and dying can be known. It doesn\u2019t stop them laughing at a fart or making an empty crisp packet go pop.</p> <p>Jimmy was at my bedside a few mornings ago dispensing imaginary ice-cream. I was staring upwards, and I could hear him low down to my right. I opened and closed my mouth to show that I was eating some of the \u201c[va]nilla\u201d on offer but, silent and motionless, I don\u2019t know if he noticed, and then I heard him padding away into the next room.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I see three people moving and turning together \u2013 and it\u2019s no longer breaking my heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I can\u2019t be active in the life of my children. I have to see what the day brings. There was the moment last week when Tom rested his cheek into my upper arm, gently twisted the top of his head upwards against my flesh like a nestling cat, then twirled away. It was a moment that must have lasted five seconds at most but I kept it with me \u2013 held on to it \u2013 for days, as if I wasn\u2019t just making contact, but taking an imprint.</p> <p>I owe these moments to materials that are both plastic and hollow. To an expanding network of tubing crisscrossing my body: transparent blues and yellows, concertinaed or smooth. The largest gauge of tubing has the central importance of the eastbound M4 heading into London. This is the one swooshing air and oxygen into my lungs, but there are other tiny subcutaneous tubes more like narrow Cornish lanes, trickling a minuscule palliative cocktail just under the skin of my bicep. The other key thoroughfare is the one delivering sticky beige nutrition through a macaroni-sized tube running directly into my abdomen.</p> <p>Tubes are now a way of life and, with so many doctors and nurses coming and going, there\u2019s plenty of spare tubing lying around. This place is like a fisherman\u2019s cottage but with coils of plastic everywhere \u2013 in wicker baskets or hanging from hooks. A lot of it ends up in the bath with my two boys. Or it becomes part of Jimmy\u2019s marching trumpet band.</p> <p>When I was diagnosed, my heart broke in different ways, but some of those feelings have softened. It was always the tiny pieces of future that hurt. I\u2019d imagine Gill and Tom and Jimmy unloading shopping, or just being listless together on a Sunday.</p> <p>But I\u2019m very still with this disease now: I\u2019m an observer, sensing lives happening in other rooms. I hear bottles and cans rattling in plastic bags. I see the rain at three o\u2019clock on a Sunday. All this detail goes by or around me and I see it working. I see three people moving and turning together \u2013 and it\u2019s no longer breaking my heart. It\u2019s just sad and comforting. I didn\u2019t expect the end of my life to feel like the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca3eaa3476070ac675b56c574a4556baf671642c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3eaa3476070ac675b56c574a4556baf671642c/138_479_5313_3187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Hammond with his wife, Gill, and sons Tom (left) and Jimmy, at home, November 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hammond and his family at home last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I see and hear my family clowning around and I want so much to be in there with them \u2013 teaching my children to brush their teeth in the style of a camel. Instead I\u2019m unnaturally still \u2013 observing the way their bodies move to express or receive humour. The way a back curves, or a head is thrown back. Watching hands thrust out wide, or even the opposite of such movements. All the infinite expressions. But I\u2019m not clowning around any more; I just see it going on \u2013 how ornate it is, how beautiful.</p> <p>Other losses are simpler and more incremental. Sometimes they are nothing more than adaptation and sometimes, like the loss of my voice, they are devastating. I lost my swallow very quickly. There was a three-week period when Gill made sure I had lots of really nice soups, and that was it. Food was a thing of the past. I\u2019ve never got over that loss.</p> <p>I\u2019m fortunate that my ventilator filters out the aroma of most foods, replacing them with a smell like the inside of a plastic bucket. Occasionally smells get through, like roast lamb or the mist that comes from Tom peeling an orange, but mostly I\u2019m assailed by food memories. The most recent is of the yellow Styrofoam containing takeaway from a Lebanese restaurant. Other food memories are more permanent and catastrophic, and these are all the foods I ever made or shared with my young family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/15/dad-writing-birthday-cards-for-sons-he-wont-see-grow-up-motor-neurone-disease\">I'm writing 33 birthday cards for the sons I won't see grow up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the boys are in bed, Gill climbs up on to my hospital bed and sometimes falls asleep. It can feel like I\u2019ve been waiting the whole day for this moment. Watching Gill asleep always feels like such peace to me, and some of this article would have been written with Gill by my side in that way.</p> <p>It\u2019s really hard to cry when you rely on a mask for air. I use a mask that\u2019s attached to my nose, so when I cry my mouth stretches wide open and all the valuable air gusts out, like a badly insulated letter box. And the camera I use to communicate can\u2019t track the progress of my pupils, so crying is a form of incapacitation. It\u2019s so much easier for Gill, who can stretch out on the bed and sob without any of these secondary difficulties. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re always crying together. It just happens sometimes. Recently Gill\u2019s been reading to me from old travel diaries, written in the days before we had children. Stories of mountains and recklessness on motorbikes, other countries. The past feels so luxurious.</p> <p>But now it\u2019s the present. It\u2019s all been leading up to this. Sad but no longer broken. Here with Gill. It\u2019s a magical kind of sadness, saying goodbye. A bit like preparing to travel again, but no longer together.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-short-history-of-falling-9780008339906.html\" title=\"\">A Short History </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-short-history-of-falling-9780008339906.html\" title=\"\">Of Falling: Everything I Observed </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-short-history-of-falling-9780008339906.html\" title=\"\">About Love Whilst Dying</a>, by Joe Hammond, is published by 4th Estate.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "bodyText": "In the beginning I was just a dad who fell over a bit and then couldn\u2019t drive the car. Then we had a name for what was happening to me: motor neurone disease. The rest of my physical decline has taken two years and I now write with a camera attached to a computer, which tracks reflections from my pupils. I can use the same device to talk with my synthetic voice. It\u2019s obviously slower to use, and has trained me to get to the point, in much the same way that dying has. In the room next door, as I write, I can hear Jimmy, my two-year-old son, offering to take passengers on a bus ride to various destinations. It\u2019s half-term and Tom, my seven-year-old, has wandered out into the garden. He\u2019s smiling, looking back at the house, as he points out a squirrel to someone standing inside. There\u2019s adult laughter, too. I can hear Gill, my wife, talking with one of my carers. I\u2019m in an adjacent downstairs bedroom, suspended in a sling that hangs from the ceiling hoist. It\u2019s positioned over a bedpan, and my floppy neck is wedged upright between a pillow and a piece of foam. I usually stay here for a while because it also has a view of the garden. It\u2019s gusty and leaves are twirling down from an ash tree. I realise I\u2019ve been saying goodbye to my family for two years. Always imagining this version of myself, without a voice or moving parts. But now I\u2019m here, I can see that we\u2019re all just interested in the same thing: how anxious all these squirrels are as they bury their treasure in the turf. How they keep looking back over their shoulders. And how life just carries on, until it doesn\u2019t. There was a moment halfway through my decline when Tom needed to check whether he would die one day. He was wrapped in a blanket on my lap as I confirmed its inevitability. He sobbed and I pulled the sides of the blanket in around him. After a few moments his tears came to an end, and five minutes later he was upside down on the sofa giggling at his toes. Children walk past spiders\u2019 webs all the time and see little things dying. Death is all around them; they know this better than their parents, who have often forgotten. I know I had. But children haven\u2019t reached this stage yet. Death and dying can be known. It doesn\u2019t stop them laughing at a fart or making an empty crisp packet go pop. Jimmy was at my bedside a few mornings ago dispensing imaginary ice-cream. I was staring upwards, and I could hear him low down to my right. I opened and closed my mouth to show that I was eating some of the \u201c[va]nilla\u201d on offer but, silent and motionless, I don\u2019t know if he noticed, and then I heard him padding away into the next room. I can\u2019t be active in the life of my children. I have to see what the day brings. There was the moment last week when Tom rested his cheek into my upper arm, gently twisted the top of his head upwards against my flesh like a nestling cat, then twirled away. It was a moment that must have lasted five seconds at most but I kept it with me \u2013 held on to it \u2013 for days, as if I wasn\u2019t just making contact, but taking an imprint. I owe these moments to materials that are both plastic and hollow. To an expanding network of tubing crisscrossing my body: transparent blues and yellows, concertinaed or smooth. The largest gauge of tubing has the central importance of the eastbound M4 heading into London. This is the one swooshing air and oxygen into my lungs, but there are other tiny subcutaneous tubes more like narrow Cornish lanes, trickling a minuscule palliative cocktail just under the skin of my bicep. The other key thoroughfare is the one delivering sticky beige nutrition through a macaroni-sized tube running directly into my abdomen. Tubes are now a way of life and, with so many doctors and nurses coming and going, there\u2019s plenty of spare tubing lying around. This place is like a fisherman\u2019s cottage but with coils of plastic everywhere \u2013 in wicker baskets or hanging from hooks. A lot of it ends up in the bath with my two boys. Or it becomes part of Jimmy\u2019s marching trumpet band. When I was diagnosed, my heart broke in different ways, but some of those feelings have softened. It was always the tiny pieces of future that hurt. I\u2019d imagine Gill and Tom and Jimmy unloading shopping, or just being listless together on a Sunday. But I\u2019m very still with this disease now: I\u2019m an observer, sensing lives happening in other rooms. I hear bottles and cans rattling in plastic bags. I see the rain at three o\u2019clock on a Sunday. All this detail goes by or around me and I see it working. I see three people moving and turning together \u2013 and it\u2019s no longer breaking my heart. It\u2019s just sad and comforting. I didn\u2019t expect the end of my life to feel like the future. I see and hear my family clowning around and I want so much to be in there with them \u2013 teaching my children to brush their teeth in the style of a camel. Instead I\u2019m unnaturally still \u2013 observing the way their bodies move to express or receive humour. The way a back curves, or a head is thrown back. Watching hands thrust out wide, or even the opposite of such movements. All the infinite expressions. But I\u2019m not clowning around any more; I just see it going on \u2013 how ornate it is, how beautiful. Other losses are simpler and more incremental. Sometimes they are nothing more than adaptation and sometimes, like the loss of my voice, they are devastating. I lost my swallow very quickly. There was a three-week period when Gill made sure I had lots of really nice soups, and that was it. Food was a thing of the past. I\u2019ve never got over that loss. I\u2019m fortunate that my ventilator filters out the aroma of most foods, replacing them with a smell like the inside of a plastic bucket. Occasionally smells get through, like roast lamb or the mist that comes from Tom peeling an orange, but mostly I\u2019m assailed by food memories. The most recent is of the yellow Styrofoam containing takeaway from a Lebanese restaurant. Other food memories are more permanent and catastrophic, and these are all the foods I ever made or shared with my young family. When the boys are in bed, Gill climbs up on to my hospital bed and sometimes falls asleep. It can feel like I\u2019ve been waiting the whole day for this moment. Watching Gill asleep always feels like such peace to me, and some of this article would have been written with Gill by my side in that way. It\u2019s really hard to cry when you rely on a mask for air. I use a mask that\u2019s attached to my nose, so when I cry my mouth stretches wide open and all the valuable air gusts out, like a badly insulated letter box. And the camera I use to communicate can\u2019t track the progress of my pupils, so crying is a form of incapacitation. It\u2019s so much easier for Gill, who can stretch out on the bed and sob without any of these secondary difficulties. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re always crying together. It just happens sometimes. Recently Gill\u2019s been reading to me from old travel diaries, written in the days before we had children. Stories of mountains and recklessness on motorbikes, other countries. The past feels so luxurious. But now it\u2019s the present. It\u2019s all been leading up to this. Sad but no longer broken. Here with Gill. It\u2019s a magical kind of sadness, saying goodbye. A bit like preparing to travel again, but no longer together. \u2022 A Short History Of Falling: Everything I Observed About Love Whilst Dying, by Joe Hammond, is published by 4th Estate. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Once Britain had voted leave \u2013 after a remain campaign whose inadequacies owed more to the Tory and Labour bigwigs running it, including Alan Johnson, than to Corbyn\u2019s aloofness \u2013 the party was always going to be in difficulty. But Corbyn\u2019s position in the years that followed only made things worse. Whether remainers should have accepted Brexit after the referendum or fought on is a separate question \u2013 the fact is that enough remain voters wanted the opportunity to stop it. Had Labour adopted support for a second referendum earlier, it may have got back ahead of the curve and avoided looking like a dithering party with a leader who didn\u2019t know his own mind. But it never managed to package its referendum commitment as a ticket to certainty rather than endless instability \u2013 while its leadership succeeded only in alienating leavers and remainers alike. Thanks to this chastening electoral defeat, Brexit is something that will be done to Labour by the Tories. They now have the votes to get Britain out of the EU by the end of January. Labour was too complacent for too long, only to find it didn\u2019t know what to do, and voters didn\u2019t understand what it was trying to do. \u2022 Chaminda Jayanetti is a journalist covering politics and public services",

Out on the Atlantic the battle was won by the British, Canadian and American navies learning as they went on, employing ever more advanced technology (above all radar, which hardly gets a look-in here), the Leigh light for illuminating the target at night, better armaments and explosives, the use of escort carriers and eventually the closing of the undefended \u201cAtlantic gap\u201d with the allocation of long-range Liberator bombers as submarine hunters.

Great though the damage was, Britain was never as close to disaster as Parkin makes out, and his figures on shipping losses seem wrong. The British merchant fleet did not lose 4m tons a month in autumn 1941 (which would soon have crippled the fleet entirely) but 2.4m tons in the Atlantic for the whole year. In fact in the second half of 1941, the battle swung in the British navy\u2019s favour, with shipping losses down considerably from earlier months.

Nevertheless, this is a good read on a corner of the war and the men and women who peopled it \u2013 one very much worthy of our attention. \u2022 A Game of Birds and Wolves is published by Sceptre (RRP \u00a320).

      "body": "<p><em><strong>In recent years, Weekend has been named news supplement of the year at the Press Awards in 2015, and at the British Society of Magazine Editors in 2015 and 2018. </strong></em><strong>Last month, Melissa was voted the 2019 British Society of Magazine Editors \u201ceditors\u2019 editor\u201d, the </strong><strong>society\u2019s top award.</strong></p> <p><strong>When did you join the Guardian? What had you done beforehand? How did you come to this role?</strong></p> <p>I joined the Guardian on 10 September 2001, so the world changed on day two. I\u2019d been hired as features editor on Weekend, with a focus on getting celebrity interviews; overnight, access to Hollywood stars felt like a low priority. But the role expanded to include features commissioning more broadly \u2013 everything from crime to politics, lifestyle trends, first-person writing, Dave Eggers\u2019 short-short stories, and coordinating special issues. After that, I was the Guardian\u2019s arts editor for seven years. I\u2019ve been editing Weekend since 2013.</p> <p><strong>What do you enjoy most about the job?</strong></p> <p>The variety and the degree of collaboration, both within our team of 20 (editors, subeditors, picture editors, designers), with other Guardian desks and with other publishers \u2013 such as last summer\u2019s takeover by the gal-dem collective. At its best, it feels like conducting a great orchestra: the talent is all around you \u2013 the writers, photographers, designers \u2013 and it\u2019s my job to pull it together.</p> <p>I love working with writers on our long reads, some of whom need very little help; other stories might go through multiple drafts and feel like a co-production from the off. We pay a lot of attention to the amount of time readers spend with a story online: almost invariably, the work put into getting a story right pays off. Some recent highlights would include Hannah Jane Parkinson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/30/nothing-like-broken-leg-mental-health-conversation\">piece about her experiences of mental illness</a>, and Paul Lewis\u2019s series of articles on the dystopian side of Silicon Valley.</p> <p>I also love the visual aspect \u2013 the conversations we have about covers and photoshoots, where we share our bad drawings (I actually think mine are pretty good), Instagram bookmarks, and ideas from elsewhere. Some stories are harder to illustrate than others \u2013 for instance, a piece on how political pollsters are learning from past failures wasn\u2019t obvious. Shooting the interviewees would have been one way to go, but it\u2019s a chewy subject and a lot of headshots could look too like the news pages. So we commissioned a photograph of the metaphor that kept coming to mind: pink jelly nailed to a wall, published with the headline Mission Impossible. For our first-look cover story on The Crown, we had only a handful of images from the set \u2013 none strong enough for a cover. So we commissioned a designer to produce a first-class stamp with a Queen Olivia Colman turning to face the reader.<strong> </strong>I had no idea the Queen reviewing her new stamp would be the first scene in the new series.</p> <p><strong>Who have been your favourite interviewees?</strong></p> <p>Some are memorable because it took such a long time to persuade them: Monica Lewinsky\u2019s 2016 interview with Jon Ronson came after a two-year conversation. More recently, Taylor Swift gave her first UK interview in years after months of discussion with deputy music editor Laura Snapes: their encounter was refreshingly candid about the loneliness of the longterm celebrity.</p> <p>The magazine is blessed with brilliantly smart interviewers, so there are too many to mention (and not all of them celebrities), but these are recent ones that have stayed with me: Jacinda Ardern, Ant and Dec, Naomi Campbell, Keanu Reeves, Michelle Obama, Alia Ghanem, the mother of Osama bin Laden; and less recently, Amanda Knox, Rachel Dolezal, Susan Klebold, Sadiq Khan, One Direction, Tom Hanks. Every interview is a negotiation of some kind, and we have a high bar in terms of the access we need to be able to put the reader in the room. And fortunately there are still plenty of people who get that, and who are up for a real conversation. Lizzo, we\u2019re here when you\u2019re ready.</p> <p><strong>Which piece(s) are you proudest of?</strong></p> <p>Much of the best work has been a huge team effort. The gal-dem issue, led by Liv Little and Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, and deputy Weekend editor Ruth Lewy, was months in the planning. In 2014, we collaborated with the National Film Board of Canada on a magazine and film project on the seven digital deadly sins, and won a Webby award. I was proud to work on our November 2017 cover story, The Tower Next Door, which took readers deep into the lives of the residents of Whitstable House, a building that neighbours Grenfell, in the aftermath of the fire. An idea from editor Mike Herd led to months of immersive reporting by writer Simon Hattenstone, filmmaker Alex Healey, photographer Christian Sinibaldi, digital designer Feilding Cage,and many others.</p> <p>Weekend\u2019s themed issues can be a lot of work, but also the most rewarding: this summer\u2019s climate special was full of great reporting and original angles on the crisis, but for a long time it was lacking a strong cover: very late in the day, commissioning editor Joe Stone persuaded Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg to talk \u2013 a conversation that not only gave us a scoop but injected much-needed hope.</p> <p><strong>What have been the highlights of your career to date?</strong></p> <p>Working with so many writers I admire, both in and out of the Guardian: Elena Ferrante, Roxane Gay, Clive James, Molly Ringwald, Stephen King, Zadie Smith, Andrea Dworkin, Meera Sodha. Interviewing David Lynch at his home off Mulholland Drive; and writer Grace Paley at her cabin in Vermont. Reporting on rape trials in Newcastle a couple of years ago \u2013 though I was too optimistic that conviction rates were about to improve.</p> <p>It never stops being exciting to land an exclusive, to be the first to read brilliant copy (or a 10/10 Blind Date), to see a photoshoot that exceeds expectations.</p> <p><strong>Do you get much feedback from readers? What makes Weekend such a valuable part of the Guardian?</strong></p> <p>I do. Partly through our letters page, partly through the comments below the line, partly through social media. I\u2019m very conscious of having two audiences \u2013 a UK-based, print-buying one, and a global digital audience who don\u2019t know that they are reading a Weekend article. Unlike, say, the Times or New York Times, we don\u2019t have a distinct magazine page on the website. Everything has to stand on its own feet online.</p> <p>Readers have submitted great ideas, family stories, many, many suggestions for improvement: we take it all on board, and it informs what we do. We\u2019ve just put together our fifth conversations special (out next Saturday) because of the enthusiastic response, even though it is a gargantuan effort (we will typically approach about 100 people to take part, starting in the summer). I just got a great letter from a tall reader with a short husband who would like to see more shapes and sizes on our fashion pages, which I\u2019ll follow up. A reader also suggested a tribute to Deborah Orr\u2019s time as Weekend editor, which will run on 28 December.</p> <p>I\u2019ve talked a lot about the features because that\u2019s the bit we have to reinvent every week \u2013 but much of the feedback reminds me that it\u2019s our columnists who are the glue, as well as regulars such as Experience and Blind Date. (I once sat in on a focus group where a reader was asked what the first thing he turned to in the Saturday paper was. \u201cThe scores,\u201d he said. Was he a big football fan, the moderator asked. No, he said: the <em>Blind Date</em> scores).</p> <p>I came to Weekend first as a reader, and understand the loyalty the magazine has inspired through successive editors, and how important it is to keep the heart, the warmth, the fun and surprises \u2013 while not shying away from the serious. It should be a treat \u2013 a part of the Guardian where we have a little more time and space to dig deep, to look beyond the reflexive, to be creative with our commissioning. We have fun doing it, and I hope that shows.</p>",

The RDG stressed it had \u201cput years of work into drafting, consulting, and planning for these changes\u201d, with the memory of May 2018\u2019s disastrous changeover still fresh. Thousands of trains were cancelled in weeks of major delay and disruption, mainly affecting passengers on Govia Thameslink Railway, Northern and TransPennine services. A review found no one had taken charge even as the industry realised there was insufficient time to prepare for the changes needed, including training drivers. Train companies and Network Rail have put teams in place to monitor services and respond quickly to any disruption, as well as increasing staff at stations to help passengers adapt to new trains and schedules, the RDG said. An RDG director, Robert Nisbet, said: \u201cMany train times will change next week as train operators introduce faster and more frequent services to improve journeys and better connect communities up and down the country, so people should check the timetable before they travel. \u201cTrain operators and Network Rail will be working together to run a reliable service and respond quickly to any teething problems as people get used to the change.\u201d Since the May 2018 debacle, two further timetable changes were implemented without disruption, last December and in May this year.",

Shot in silvery black and white, it downplays the romanticism of later versions for a more sober, bittersweet study of familial togetherness and resilience amid hardship.

The scented gel is simply and satisfyingly painted on the skin, dries almost instantly and makes itself known for a good four hours. Green Orange &amp; Coriander is my favourite, and manages to be suitably festive while remaining eminently wearable come summer, while Pomelo (grapefruity) has more universal appeal. Tom Ford has steeped his musky, wearable Soleil Neige fragrance (think hot skin in cold weather) and tiny shimmering platinum flecks in a softening but light body oil (\u00a372, 100ml). The effect is glowy and sexy on limbs and clavicles, and the scent lingers for far longer than I\u2019d expected. For those with skin that reacts badly to a direct dab of scent (surprisingly common), Gucci\u2019s Bloom Hair Mist For Her (\u00a338, 30ml) imparts the same scent as the original, much-adored white flower bouquet, without drying hair. Chanel has decanted its rightly iconic No5 into a lipstick-tube-sized refill spray (\u00a366, 3x7ml), resulting in something very beautiful, chic and highly practical. Mine lives in my makeup bag and, so far, I\u2019ve avoided sleepily spraying it on my mouth. Solid perfume is another useful space saver, and ideal for tossing into a handbag or holdall without worrying about breakage. Jo Malone\u2019s extremely covetable Fragrance Combining Palette (\u00a324) is the most impressive. The sturdy black metal compact slides into two \u2013 each half housing one of 10 of the brand\u2019s bestsellers (\u00a314 each), including Blackberry &amp; Bay (my personal favourite) and Mimosa &amp; Cardamom (the smell of my wedding), to be worn alone or layered as one (to beautiful effect, as it turns out). I was initially appalled by DS &amp; Durga\u2019s Auto Fragrances, since I\u2019ve always felt air freshener to be worse than anything it\u2019s attempting to mask, with car fresheners their most gag-inducing incarnation. But trust me when I say these swinging tags (\u00a310), are gentle and refined. The woody, wintry Portable Fireplace is a reminder, not of sickly, ciggy, 70s summer traffic jams, but of a cosy, classy, hunkery Christmas.",

      "body": "<p>Here he comes, one of the planet\u2019s most conspicuous young men, stepping out of the London drizzle and into a dusty suburban pub. If there was an old vinyl record player in the place it would scratch quiet. Instead, the two-dozen punters turn hushed and intent, as if a unicorn has just trotted in off the street, and nobody wants to scare it off. \u201cThat\u2019s frickin\u2019 Harry frickin\u2019 Styles,\u201d whispers a young man at the bar, \u201cin <em>this</em> pub.\u201d The pop star is asked what he wants to drink and in a voice already inclined to undertones, quietly orders a cup of tea.</p> <p>A former teen star who is now 25, a happier and rockier solo artist since his boyband One Direction split a few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/harry-styles\" title=\"\">Styles</a> has hidden himself inside a large, swamp-green parka. He\u2019s tall, around the 6ft mark, and carries himself with a slight stoop. If Styles could only do something about his appearance from the neck up (elfin brow, wide Joker smile, a face that\u2019s recognisable across multiple continents) you sense he could drink in pubs like this anonymously enough. As it is, cover blown, he removes the parka. A woolly jumper beneath has a picture of the planet Saturn on it. Maybe they\u2019ve heard of Styles there, too.</p> <p>We take a seat in the corner. On nearby tables, conversations start to sputter as people try to keep their own talk ticking along on autopilot while straining to hear what Styles says. I ask him about the sheer strangeness of this and other aspects of fame. Full stadiums, swooning admirers, an excess of opportunity and cash. Why isn\u2019t Styles an absolute ordeal of a human being by now? Keith Richards, at a comparable stage, imagined himself the pirate leader of a travelling nation-state, unbound by international law. Elton John was on vast amounts of cocaine. Meanwhile, here\u2019s Harry, known in the music industry as a bit of a freak, medically, having maintained abnormally high levels of civility in his system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5d36b68034ac23c12c9d1e8caa7aad4bcb1c64b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d36b68034ac23c12c9d1e8caa7aad4bcb1c64b3/0_1211_5226_4972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Styles lying on the floor with his legs in the air wearing Gucci boots, trousers and waistcoat, with a bare chest and a pearl necklace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"951\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boots, waistcoat and trousers, Gucci.

Main image: top, waistcoat and trousers, Harris Reed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Bradley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Styles tilts his head, flattered. There are others, he promises. \u201cPeople who are successful, and still nice. It\u2019s when you meet the people who are successful and <em>aren\u2019t</em> nice, you think: What\u2019s yer excuse? Cos I\u2019ve met the other sort.\u201d</p> <p>Styles read Keith Richards\u2019 autobiography a while back, and he recently finished Elton\u2019s, too. (\u201c<em>Soooo</em> much cocaine,\u201d he marvels.) We talk for a bit about whether extreme dissolute behaviour and artistic greatness go hand in hand. Styles, who has just released his second solo album, Fine Line, the penultimate track of which is called Treat People With Kindness, has to hope not. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you <em>need</em> to be a dick to be a good artist. But, then, there are also a lot of good artists who are dicks. So. Hmm. Maybe I need to start scaring babies in supermarkets?\u201d</p> <p>A couple of lads hustle over to offer drinks. A photo is requested; they say they\u2019ll wait. I\u2019m weirdly anxious about Styles\u2019s phone, which is slung on the table in front of him. What must be the black-market value of that thing? If fans were to get hold of it, would they want to open Styles\u2019s music app first, to listen to tracks from the new album, or rush to see his messages and calls, to find out who Styles has been flirting with late at night? The interest in his music has always run at a ratio of about 50/50 with the interest in who he is dating.</p> <p>It\u2019s a ratio Styles tries to adjust in favour of the music by being vague about his ex-partners, real and rumoured (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\" title=\"\">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kendall-jenner\" title=\"\">Kendall Jenner</a>, Parisian model Camille Rowe), diverting to discuss his songs about failed relationships. A year ago, when Styles was floating around near this pub in north London, where he lives, and California, where he tends to record, looking for inspiration for the new album, his close friend Tom Hull told him: \u201cJust date amazing women, or men, or whatever, who are going to fuck you up\u2026 Let it affect you and write songs about it.\u201d</p> <p>Styles, who writes in collaboration with Hull and producer Tyler Johnson, sounds as if he took the advice. The new album, Fine Line, is at its best when capturing late-hours moments, drunk calls, \u201cwandering hands\u201d, kitchen snogs. A golden-haired lover recurs. There are up tracks, down tracks, some with the trippy delirium of harpsichord-era Stones, others with the angsty Britpop swell of strings. While I listened, I couldn\u2019t help scribbling down names, possible subjects. On the lyric \u201cThere\u2019s a piece of you in how I dress\u201d I wrote: maybe Kendall? In a song about a lover \u201cway too bright for me\u201d: surely Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40ee27ff573a068321448b814d748b919b407afb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40ee27ff573a068321448b814d748b919b407afb/0_0_1829_1096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift and Harry Styles in 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Taylor Swift in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Styles says he keeps to a general rule: write what comes and don\u2019t think about it too much afterwards. The only time he worries about an individual lyric is if it risks putting an ex in a difficult position. \u201cIf a song\u2019s about someone, is that fine? Or is that gonna get annoying for them, if people try to decipher it?\u201d Has he ever got that judgment call wrong and taken a bollocking from an angry ex? Styles raises an eyebrow. \u201cMaybe ask me in a month.\u201d</p> <p>I quiz him on something I\u2019ve often wondered about. Why are the very famous so inclined to hook up with the very famous? From the outside it looks twice the hassle, with twice the odds of ending badly. \u201cDon\u2019t we all do that, though?\u201d Styles asks. \u201cGo into things that feel relatively doomed from the start?\u201d I ask him why he doesn\u2019t date normals. He seems tickled: \u201cUm. I mean, I <em>do</em>. I have a private life. You just don\u2019t know about it.\u201d</p> <p>Styles doesn\u2019t particularly like being asked about his love life, but is amused all the same, as he is about most things. When I ask about the logistics of someone as well known as him dating someone anonymous (\u201cDo you need to give them, like, some sort of primer?\u201d), Styles snorts with laughter.</p> <p>\u201cUh-h-h. Like any conversation, I guess, it\u2019s easier if you\u2019re honest. But I try to let it come up when it comes up. Cos that\u2019s a weird thing to talk about, y\u2019know? If you\u2019ve just started seeing someone, and you\u2019re, like: [he adopts a throaty, mission-briefing voice] <em>So! This is what\u2019s gonna happen!</em>\u201d Styles holds out his hands: no, ta. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna have that conversation, man. It would be fucking weird.\u201d</p> <p>And not very sexy, I say.</p> <p>\u201cNot sexy,\u201d Styles says, \u201cno.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9860a1f4726a3349c0f0e9fd22e1ce89cee79f24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9860a1f4726a3349c0f0e9fd22e1ce89cee79f24/0_0_5317_6758/787.jpg\" alt=\"A closeup of Harry Styles with his hands covering most of his face, with lots of rings on and smiley faces on his fingernails\" width=\"787\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shirt and H and S rings, Gucci.

(\u201c<em>Nat</em> sexy, no.\u201d) After a workout in a hotel gym recently, Styles says he was taken aback (\u201ctaken <em>abeck</em>\u201d) to be asked by a stranger whether he was speaking in a fake voice. He was appalled. But after so long crossing borders and time zones, living and working between England and the US, the accent has undergone a jazzy remix, and tends to get farthest from its Cheshire roots when he\u2019s around strangers. Once Styles begins to get comfortable in the pub, the flatter, no-nonsense sounds of his youth return. <em>Nowpe</em> he says, for <em>nope</em>. <em>Fook</em>, for <em>fuck</em>.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the <em>fook</em> are they?\u201d This was the response of his childhood pals, he remembers, back in the village of Holmes Chapel, when little Harry had the gumption to show up in the playground wearing Chelsea boots instead of the approved chunky trainers. Styles\u2019s parents had separated when he was very young, but there is no origin-story trauma: he has always stayed close to both. His mother, Anne, would praise his singing voice in the car, and when Styles was 16 it was agreed he could audition for a singing contest on TV.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For a long time I didn\u2019t try therapy \u2013 I wanted to be the guy who didn\u2019t need it.

The day before, you\u2019ve never been on telly. Then suddenly\u2026\u201d Suddenly you\u2019re a piece of national property. \u201cYou don\u2019t think at the time, \u2018Oh, maybe I should keep some of my personal stuff back for myself.\u2019 Partly because, if you\u2019re a 16-year-old who does that, you look like a jumped-up little shit. Can you imagine? \u2018Sorry, actually, I\u2019d rather not comment\u2026\u2019 You don\u2019t know what to be protective of.\u201d</p> <p>By the winter of 2010, Styles was a fan favourite, a key member of One Direction, a five-piece that enjoyed enormous national exposure and gathered millions of fans before any music had been released. Cameras filmed every part of their rise. There wasn\u2019t any time in the dark to practise, test things out, mentally brace. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to dip in a toe,\u201d Styles says. \u201cBut, listen, I was a kid, all I knew was: I didn\u2019t have to go to school any more. I thought it was fucking great.\u201d He remembers having a lot of fun, and being well taken care of. He jokes: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to deal with a bit later. When I wake up in my 40s and think: <em>Arrrggh</em>.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1cad6a78e63859bd431f0a47f508a118cd03189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1cad6a78e63859bd431f0a47f508a118cd03189/0_59_3472_2327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One Direction (from left): Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Harry Styles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With One Direction in 2012 (far right). Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IBL/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February 2012, One Direction were feted at the Brit Awards, hours before they were due to fly to the US for the first time. On TV that night they looked young, silly, chuffed \u2013 on the precipice of something huge, and with no clue at all. Their subsequent wonder-run (five platinum albums, four world tours) had its foundations in their ridiculous popularity in the States. Right away, Styles remembers, \u201cWe were fuelling a machine. Keeping the fire going.\u201d He remembers it as a stimulating time; maybe overstimulating. \u201cComing out of it, when the band stopped, I realised that the thing I\u2019d been missing, because it was all so fast paced, was human connection.\u201d</p> <p>I first met Styles in 2014, around the time the lack of human connection was starting to bite. One Direction were promoting their penultimate album and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/15/one-direction-boy-band-exclusive-interview-\" title=\"\">I\u2019d been commissioned to write about them</a>the Guardian. Management felt the boys were so exhausted that my minutes in their presence had to be strictly counted. Inside a circle of cripplingly hot lights, while someone ran the stopwatch, we interacted as humanly as we could.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74c669ff2ae07b126f6aaaea45299503d6218e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c669ff2ae07b126f6aaaea45299503d6218e6f/0_726_7878_4728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Styles as a soldier sitting on the beach in Dunkirk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Dunkirk (on left).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember how jaded the best singer in the group, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/zayn-malik\" title=\"\">Zayn Malik</a>, seemed. (Malik was weeks away from quitting.) I also remember how flattered and bewildered the others were to be asked a few grownup questions \u2013 and not what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/louis-tomlinson\" title=\"\">Louis Tomlinson</a> would later describe to me as \u201cwho\u2019s-your-favourite-superhero\u2026 all that shit\u201d. Styles was watchful and quiet that day. By total chance, a week later, we were in the same London cafe and he tapped my shoulder. He was having lunch with friends. \u201cWill ya join us?\u201d</p> <p>It struck me as a quietly classy move. I was fascinated to see him interact with mates he\u2019d chosen for himself. Styles was dry and funny, older than his years. After lunch we said the usual things about keeping in touch, and followed each other on Twitter. I kept an eye on his updates, about leaving One Direction, releasing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/14/harry-styles-album-review-one-direction-carolina-sign-of-the-times\" title=\"\">impressive, self-titled debut album</a> in 2017, playing for 36,000 people in Madison Square Garden in New York, acting in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oscar-nominated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/17/dunkirk-review-christopher-nolans-apocalyptic-war-epic-is-his-best-film-so-far\" title=\"\">war movie Dunkirk</a>. Meanwhile, I did my best to manage the mess that had been made of my own account after Styles\u2019s Twitter follow ignited a small explosion of teenage longing in my mentions. For at least a year I received weekly, sometimes daily, pleas from people who wanted messages conveyed to \u201cH\u201d. Still now, every few days, fans in America, Asia and Europe follow me to \u201csee what H sees\u201d in their timeline.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I get told a nice shirt is for ladies, it doesn\u2019t make me want to wear it less. It\u2019s a very freeing time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He has around 50 million social media followers, and with that comes the ability to ripple the internet like somebody airing a bedsheet. I\u2019ve noticed, though, how rarely Styles directs people to support specific causes, last doing so in 2018, when he encouraged people to join a march against gun violence. Why don\u2019t you use your influence more, I ask? \u201cBecause of dilution. Because I\u2019d prefer, when I say something, for people to think I mean it.\u201d He runs his fingertips across the table. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m still searching for that one thing, y\u2019know. Something I can really stand up for, and get behind, and be like: This Is My Life Fight. There\u2019s a power to doing the <em>one</em> thing. You want your whole weight behind it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s one of the things that sets Styles apart, the way he puts his whole weight behind the different aspects of this strange job. If you watch footage of him as a <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-45/episode/6-harry-styles-with-harry-styles-305714\" title=\"\">guest host on Saturday Night Live</a> last month, Styles plunges in, fully inhabiting the silliness of every sketch. He has good songs in his repertoire (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/apr/07/harry-styles-sign-of-the-times\" title=\"\">2017\u2019s ballad Sign Of The Times</a> stands out), and would probably admit to some middling songs that attest to his relative inexperience as a writer. But whichever of his songs Styles performs, he goes all-in, trusting that his zest and energy will hold an audience\u2019s attention. He approaches this interview in roughly the same spirit, not enjoying every question, fidgeting, pleading for clemency once or twice, but giving everything due consideration. </p> <p>I bring up something Styles joked about earlier: the possibility of waking up in his 40s with deferred mental health problems.</p> <p>\u201cMm,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"060622f42d311fbc32b18f278471655b3f8a847a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/060622f42d311fbc32b18f278471655b3f8a847a/0_296_5295_4401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Styles wearing a spotty Maison Margiela jacket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"831\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacket and brooch, Maison Margiela.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Bradley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Have you thought about therapy, I ask, to get ahead of that?</p> <p>\u201cI go,\u201d he says. \u201cNot every week. But whenever I feel I need it. For a really long time I didn\u2019t try therapy, because I wanted to be the guy who could say: \u2018I don\u2019t need it.\u2019 Now I realise I was only getting in my own way.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt helps.\u201d</p> <p>Lately he\u2019s been reading a lot (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/27/three-women-lisa-taddeo-review\" title=\"\">Lisa Taddeo\u2019s Three Women</a> stood out). He\u2019s watched a lot of Netflix (crime thrillers and music docs). He recently cried through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/15/slave-play-broadway-jeremy-o-harris\" title=\"\">Slave Play on Broadway</a>. I sense in Styles, at 25, a pent-up undergraduate hunger, maybe a desire to make up for lost time. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely been wanting to learn stuff, try stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cThings I didn\u2019t grow up around. Things I\u2019d always been a little bit sceptical about. Like therapy, like meditation. All I need to hear is someone saying, \u2018Apparently, it\u2019s amazing\u2019, and I\u2019ll try it. When I was in Los Angeles once, I heard about juice cleanses. I thought, yeah, I\u2019ll do a juice cleanse.\u201d</p> <p>How messy were the results?</p> <p>\u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d Styles raises an eyebrow, recalling the poos. \u201cThey were all right. I was just hungry. And <em>bored</em>.\u201d</p> <p>One notable feature of Styles\u2019s solo career has been his headlong embrace of unconventional clothing. A 2017-18 tour could have been sponsored by the Dulux colour wheel: mustard tones in Sydney, shocking pink in Dallas. In a more serious sense, some of Styles\u2019s choices have fed into an important political discussion about gendered fashion. In May, as a co-host at the Met Gala in New York, he stepped out in a sheer blouse and a pearl earring. One evening\u2019s work challenged a lot of stubborn preconceptions about who gets to wear what.</p> <p>He says: \u201cWhat women wear. What men wear. For me it\u2019s not a question of that. If I see a nice shirt and get told, \u2018But it\u2019s for ladies.\u2019 I think: \u2018Okaaaay? Doesn\u2019t make me want to wear it less though.\u2019 I think the moment you feel more comfortable with yourself, it all becomes a lot easier.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"948990ac94c6c6aeeb5dd2092b0caeaa4c925f1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/948990ac94c6c6aeeb5dd2092b0caeaa4c925f1c/674_59_4351_3319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner at the Met Gala in May 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"763\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Kendall Jenner at the Met Gala in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What do you mean, I ask?</p> <p>Styles is leaning forward, hands folded around his cup of tea. \u201cA part of it was having, like, a big moment of self-reflection. And self-acceptance.\u201d He has a habit, when he\u2019s made a definitive statement, of raising his chin and nodding a little, as if to decide whether he still agrees with himself. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very free, and <em>freeing</em>, time. I think people are asking, \u2018Why not?\u2019 a lot more. Which excites me. It\u2019s not just clothes where lines have been blurred, it\u2019s going across so many things. I think you can relate it to music, and how genres are blurring\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Sexuality, too, I say.</p> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d says Styles. \u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a popular perception, I say, that you don\u2019t define as straight. The lyrics to your songs, the clothes you choose to wear, even the sleeve of your new record \u2013 all of these things get picked apart for clues that you\u2019re bisexual. Has anyone ever asked you though?</p> <p>\u201cUm. I guess I haaaaave been asked? But, I dunno. <em>Why</em>?\u201d</p> <p>You mean, why ask the question?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I think I do mean that. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting on an answer, and protecting it, and holding it back. It\u2019s not a case of: I\u2019m not telling you cos I don\u2019t want to tell you. It\u2019s not: ooh this is mine and it\u2019s not yours.\u201d</p> <p>What is it then?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s: <em>who cares</em><em>?</em> Does that make sense?

Because if you don\u2019t want people to care, why hint? Take the album sleeve for Fine Line. With its horizontal pink and blue stripes, a splash of magenta, the design seems to gesture at the trans and bisexual pride flags. Which is great \u2013 unless the person behind it happens to be a straight dude, sprinkling LGBTQ crumbs that lead nowhere. Does <em>that</em> make sense?</p> <p>Styles nods. \u201cAm I sprinkling in nuggets of sexual ambiguity to try and be more interesting? No.\u201d As for the rest, he says, \u201cin terms of how I wanna dress, and what the album sleeve\u2019s gonna be, I tend to make decisions in terms of collaborators I want to work with. I want things to look a certain way. Not because it makes me look gay, or it makes me look straight, or it makes me look bisexual, but because I think it looks cool. And more than that, I dunno, I just think sexuality\u2019s something that\u2019s fun. Honestly? I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve given it any more thought than that.\u201d</p> <p>In our musty corner of the pub we\u2019ve somehow passed a couple of hours in intense discussion. We\u2019ll lighten up, before Styles heads home, with some chat about clever films (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/15/marriage-story-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson\" title=\"\">Marriage Story</a>), stupider viral videos (the little boy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oww_8byJBXw\" title=\"\">who\u2019s just learned the word \u201capparently\u201d</a>), that favourite-superhero stuff that, after all, has its place. He talks about the curious double time scheme of a pop star\u2019s life \u2013 those crammed 18-hour days and then the sudden empty off-time when Styles might find himself walking miles across London to buy a book, afterwards congratulating himself: \u201cWell, that\u2019s an hour filled.\u201d</p> <p>Before we stand up I ask if he\u2019s minded any of my questions.</p> <p>He pushes out his lips, possibly recalling them one by one, then shakes his head. \u201cWhat I would say, about the whole being-asked-about-my-sexuality thing \u2013 this is a job where you might get asked. And to complain about it, to say you hate it, and still do the job, that\u2019s just silly. You respect that someone\u2019s gonna ask. And you hope that they respect they might not get an answer.\u201d</p> <p>I tell him I do.</p> <p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p> <p>Styles has to find those lads who wanted a photo. He scoops his phone off the table and flicks his thumb around the screen. Lately, he says, when he messes around on his phone in an idle moment, it\u2019s mostly to look at videos \u2013 clips that his friends have sent him, in which their kids sing along to music he\u2019s made. \u201cNever gets old,\u201d Styles says, beaming.</p> <p>A few years ago, when he emerged from the boyband, blinking, shattered, he set himself three tasks: prioritise friends, learn how to be an adult, achieve a proper balance between the big and the small. Full stadiums, provocative outfits \u2013 Styles genuinely loves these things. \u201cBut I guess I\u2019ve realised, as well,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the coolest things are not always the cool things. Do you know what I mean?\u201d He grabs his parka and his phone and, a little stooped, heads for home.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Harry Styles\u2019s album Fine Line is out now.</p> <p>If you would like your&#xa0;comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here he comes, one of the planet\u2019s most conspicuous young men, stepping out of the London drizzle and into a dusty suburban pub. If there was an old vinyl record player in the place it would scratch quiet. Instead, the two-dozen punters turn hushed and intent, as if a unicorn has just trotted in off the street, and nobody wants to scare it off. \u201cThat\u2019s frickin\u2019 Harry frickin\u2019 Styles,\u201d whispers a young man at the bar, \u201cin this pub.\u201d The pop star is asked what he wants to drink and in a voice already inclined to undertones, quietly orders a cup of tea. A former teen star who is now 25, a happier and rockier solo artist since his boyband One Direction split a few years ago, Styles has hidden himself inside a large, swamp-green parka. He\u2019s tall, around the 6ft mark, and carries himself with a slight stoop. If Styles could only do something about his appearance from the neck up (elfin brow, wide Joker smile, a face that\u2019s recognisable across multiple continents) you sense he could drink in pubs like this anonymously enough. As it is, cover blown, he removes the parka. A woolly jumper beneath has a picture of the planet Saturn on it. Maybe they\u2019ve heard of Styles there, too. We take a seat in the corner. On nearby tables, conversations start to sputter as people try to keep their own talk ticking along on autopilot while straining to hear what Styles says. I ask him about the sheer strangeness of this and other aspects of fame. Full stadiums, swooning admirers, an excess of opportunity and cash. Why isn\u2019t Styles an absolute ordeal of a human being by now? Keith Richards, at a comparable stage, imagined himself the pirate leader of a travelling nation-state, unbound by international law. Elton John was on vast amounts of cocaine. Meanwhile, here\u2019s Harry, known in the music industry as a bit of a freak, medically, having maintained abnormally high levels of civility in his system. Styles tilts his head, flattered. There are others, he promises. \u201cPeople who are successful, and still nice. It\u2019s when you meet the people who are successful and aren\u2019t nice, you think: What\u2019s yer excuse? Cos I\u2019ve met the other sort.\u201d Styles read Keith Richards\u2019 autobiography a while back, and he recently finished Elton\u2019s, too. (\u201cSoooo much cocaine,\u201d he marvels.) We talk for a bit about whether extreme dissolute behaviour and artistic greatness go hand in hand. Styles, who has just released his second solo album, Fine Line, the penultimate track of which is called Treat People With Kindness, has to hope not. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you need to be a dick to be a good artist. But, then, there are also a lot of good artists who are dicks. So. Hmm. Maybe I need to start scaring babies in supermarkets?\u201d A couple of lads hustle over to offer drinks. A photo is requested; they say they\u2019ll wait. I\u2019m weirdly anxious about Styles\u2019s phone, which is slung on the table in front of him. What must be the black-market value of that thing? If fans were to get hold of it, would they want to open Styles\u2019s music app first, to listen to tracks from the new album, or rush to see his messages and calls, to find out who Styles has been flirting with late at night? The interest in his music has always run at a ratio of about 50/50 with the interest in who he is dating. It\u2019s a ratio Styles tries to adjust in favour of the music by being vague about his ex-partners, real and rumoured (Taylor Swift, Kendall Jenner, Parisian model Camille Rowe), diverting to discuss his songs about failed relationships. A year ago, when Styles was floating around near this pub in north London, where he lives, and California, where he tends to record, looking for inspiration for the new album, his close friend Tom Hull told him: \u201cJust date amazing women, or men, or whatever, who are going to fuck you up\u2026 Let it affect you and write songs about it.\u201d Styles, who writes in collaboration with Hull and producer Tyler Johnson, sounds as if he took the advice. The new album, Fine Line, is at its best when capturing late-hours moments, drunk calls, \u201cwandering hands\u201d, kitchen snogs. A golden-haired lover recurs. There are up tracks, down tracks, some with the trippy delirium of harpsichord-era Stones, others with the angsty Britpop swell of strings. While I listened, I couldn\u2019t help scribbling down names, possible subjects. On the lyric \u201cThere\u2019s a piece of you in how I dress\u201d I wrote: maybe Kendall? In a song about a lover \u201cway too bright for me\u201d: surely Taylor. Styles says he keeps to a general rule: write what comes and don\u2019t think about it too much afterwards. The only time he worries about an individual lyric is if it risks putting an ex in a difficult position. \u201cIf a song\u2019s about someone, is that fine? Or is that gonna get annoying for them, if people try to decipher it?\u201d Has he ever got that judgment call wrong and taken a bollocking from an angry ex? Styles raises an eyebrow. \u201cMaybe ask me in a month.\u201d I quiz him on something I\u2019ve often wondered about. Why are the very famous so inclined to hook up with the very famous? From the outside it looks twice the hassle, with twice the odds of ending badly. \u201cDon\u2019t we all do that, though?\u201d Styles asks. \u201cGo into things that feel relatively doomed from the start?\u201d I ask him why he doesn\u2019t date normals. He seems tickled: \u201cUm. I mean, I do. I have a private life. You just don\u2019t know about it.\u201d Styles doesn\u2019t particularly like being asked about his love life, but is amused all the same, as he is about most things. When I ask about the logistics of someone as well known as him dating someone anonymous (\u201cDo you need to give them, like, some sort of primer?\u201d), Styles snorts with laughter. \u201cUh-h-h. Like any conversation, I guess, it\u2019s easier if you\u2019re honest. But I try to let it come up when it comes up. Cos that\u2019s a weird thing to talk about, y\u2019know? If you\u2019ve just started seeing someone, and you\u2019re, like: [he adopts a throaty, mission-briefing voice] So! This is what\u2019s gonna happen!\u201d Styles holds out his hands: no, ta. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna have that conversation, man. It would be fucking weird.\u201d And not very sexy, I say. \u201cNot sexy,\u201d Styles says, \u201cno.\u201d A quick aside about his accent, which is hard to capture in print. (\u201cNat sexy, no.\u201d) After a workout in a hotel gym recently, Styles says he was taken aback (\u201ctaken abeck\u201d) to be asked by a stranger whether he was speaking in a fake voice. He was appalled. But after so long crossing borders and time zones, living and working between England and the US, the accent has undergone a jazzy remix, and tends to get farthest from its Cheshire roots when he\u2019s around strangers. Once Styles begins to get comfortable in the pub, the flatter, no-nonsense sounds of his youth return. Nowpe he says, for nope. Fook, for fuck. \u201cWhat the fook are they?\u201d This was the response of his childhood pals, he remembers, back in the village of Holmes Chapel, when little Harry had the gumption to show up in the playground wearing Chelsea boots instead of the approved chunky trainers. Styles\u2019s parents had separated when he was very young, but there is no origin-story trauma: he has always stayed close to both. His mother, Anne, would praise his singing voice in the car, and when Styles was 16 it was agreed he could audition for a singing contest on TV. \u201cThe craziest part about the whole X Factor thing,\u201d says Styles, who auditioned for the ITV reality show in 2010, \u201cis that it\u2019s so instant. The day before, you\u2019ve never been on telly. Then suddenly\u2026\u201d Suddenly you\u2019re a piece of national property. \u201cYou don\u2019t think at the time, \u2018Oh, maybe I should keep some of my personal stuff back for myself.\u2019 Partly because, if you\u2019re a 16-year-old who does that, you look like a jumped-up little shit. Can you imagine? \u2018Sorry, actually, I\u2019d rather not comment\u2026\u2019 You don\u2019t know what to be protective of.\u201d By the winter of 2010, Styles was a fan favourite, a key member of One Direction, a five-piece that enjoyed enormous national exposure and gathered millions of fans before any music had been released. Cameras filmed every part of their rise. There wasn\u2019t any time in the dark to practise, test things out, mentally brace. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to dip in a toe,\u201d Styles says. \u201cBut, listen, I was a kid, all I knew was: I didn\u2019t have to go to school any more. I thought it was fucking great.\u201d He remembers having a lot of fun, and being well taken care of. He jokes: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to deal with a bit later. When I wake up in my 40s and think: Arrrggh.\u201d In February 2012, One Direction were feted at the Brit Awards, hours before they were due to fly to the US for the first time. On TV that night they looked young, silly, chuffed \u2013 on the precipice of something huge, and with no clue at all. Their subsequent wonder-run (five platinum albums, four world tours) had its foundations in their ridiculous popularity in the States. Right away, Styles remembers, \u201cWe were fuelling a machine. Keeping the fire going.\u201d He remembers it as a stimulating time; maybe overstimulating. \u201cComing out of it, when the band stopped, I realised that the thing I\u2019d been missing, because it was all so fast paced, was human connection.\u201d I first met Styles in 2014, around the time the lack of human connection was starting to bite. One Direction were promoting their penultimate album and I\u2019d been commissioned to write about themthe Guardian. Management felt the boys were so exhausted that my minutes in their presence had to be strictly counted. Inside a circle of cripplingly hot lights, while someone ran the stopwatch, we interacted as humanly as we could. I remember how jaded the best singer in the group, Zayn Malik, seemed. (Malik was weeks away from quitting.) I also remember how flattered and bewildered the others were to be asked a few grownup questions \u2013 and not what Louis Tomlinson would later describe to me as \u201cwho\u2019s-your-favourite-superhero\u2026 all that shit\u201d. Styles was watchful and quiet that day. By total chance, a week later, we were in the same London cafe and he tapped my shoulder. He was having lunch with friends. \u201cWill ya join us?\u201d It struck me as a quietly classy move. I was fascinated to see him interact with mates he\u2019d chosen for himself. Styles was dry and funny, older than his years. After lunch we said the usual things about keeping in touch, and followed each other on Twitter. I kept an eye on his updates, about leaving One Direction, releasing an impressive, self-titled debut album in 2017, playing for 36,000 people in Madison Square Garden in New York, acting in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oscar-nominated war movie Dunkirk. Meanwhile, I did my best to manage the mess that had been made of my own account after Styles\u2019s Twitter follow ignited a small explosion of teenage longing in my mentions. For at least a year I received weekly, sometimes daily, pleas from people who wanted messages conveyed to \u201cH\u201d. Still now, every few days, fans in America, Asia and Europe follow me to \u201csee what H sees\u201d in their timeline. He has around 50 million social media followers, and with that comes the ability to ripple the internet like somebody airing a bedsheet. I\u2019ve noticed, though, how rarely Styles directs people to support specific causes, last doing so in 2018, when he encouraged people to join a march against gun violence. Why don\u2019t you use your influence more, I ask? \u201cBecause of dilution. Because I\u2019d prefer, when I say something, for people to think I mean it.\u201d He runs his fingertips across the table. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m still searching for that one thing, y\u2019know. Something I can really stand up for, and get behind, and be like: This Is My Life Fight. There\u2019s a power to doing the one thing. You want your whole weight behind it.\u201d It\u2019s one of the things that sets Styles apart, the way he puts his whole weight behind the different aspects of this strange job. If you watch footage of him as a guest host on Saturday Night Live last month, Styles plunges in, fully inhabiting the silliness of every sketch. He has good songs in his repertoire (2017\u2019s ballad Sign Of The Times stands out), and would probably admit to some middling songs that attest to his relative inexperience as a writer. But whichever of his songs Styles performs, he goes all-in, trusting that his zest and energy will hold an audience\u2019s attention. He approaches this interview in roughly the same spirit, not enjoying every question, fidgeting, pleading for clemency once or twice, but giving everything due consideration. I bring up something Styles joked about earlier: the possibility of waking up in his 40s with deferred mental health problems. \u201cMm,\u201d he says. Have you thought about therapy, I ask, to get ahead of that? \u201cI go,\u201d he says. \u201cNot every week. But whenever I feel I need it. For a really long time I didn\u2019t try therapy, because I wanted to be the guy who could say: \u2018I don\u2019t need it.\u2019 Now I realise I was only getting in my own way.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt helps.\u201d Lately he\u2019s been reading a lot (Lisa Taddeo\u2019s Three Women stood out). He\u2019s watched a lot of Netflix (crime thrillers and music docs). He recently cried through Slave Play on Broadway. I sense in Styles, at 25, a pent-up undergraduate hunger, maybe a desire to make up for lost time. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely been wanting to learn stuff, try stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cThings I didn\u2019t grow up around. Things I\u2019d always been a little bit sceptical about. Like therapy, like meditation. All I need to hear is someone saying, \u2018Apparently, it\u2019s amazing\u2019, and I\u2019ll try it. When I was in Los Angeles once, I heard about juice cleanses. I thought, yeah, I\u2019ll do a juice cleanse.\u201d How messy were the results? \u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d Styles raises an eyebrow, recalling the poos. \u201cThey were all right. I was just hungry. And bored.\u201d One notable feature of Styles\u2019s solo career has been his headlong embrace of unconventional clothing. A 2017-18 tour could have been sponsored by the Dulux colour wheel: mustard tones in Sydney, shocking pink in Dallas. In a more serious sense, some of Styles\u2019s choices have fed into an important political discussion about gendered fashion. In May, as a co-host at the Met Gala in New York, he stepped out in a sheer blouse and a pearl earring. One evening\u2019s work challenged a lot of stubborn preconceptions about who gets to wear what. He says: \u201cWhat women wear. What men wear. For me it\u2019s not a question of that. If I see a nice shirt and get told, \u2018But it\u2019s for ladies.\u2019 I think: \u2018Okaaaay? Doesn\u2019t make me want to wear it less though.\u2019 I think the moment you feel more comfortable with yourself, it all becomes a lot easier.\u201d What do you mean, I ask? Styles is leaning forward, hands folded around his cup of tea. \u201cA part of it was having, like, a big moment of self-reflection. And self-acceptance.\u201d He has a habit, when he\u2019s made a definitive statement, of raising his chin and nodding a little, as if to decide whether he still agrees with himself. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very free, and freeing, time. I think people are asking, \u2018Why not?\u2019 a lot more. Which excites me. It\u2019s not just clothes where lines have been blurred, it\u2019s going across so many things. I think you can relate it to music, and how genres are blurring\u2026\u201d Sexuality, too, I say. \u201cYep,\u201d says Styles. \u201cYep.\u201d There\u2019s a popular perception, I say, that you don\u2019t define as straight. The lyrics to your songs, the clothes you choose to wear, even the sleeve of your new record \u2013 all of these things get picked apart for clues that you\u2019re bisexual. Has anyone ever asked you though? \u201cUm. I guess I haaaaave been asked? But, I dunno. Why?\u201d You mean, why ask the question? \u201cYeah, I think I do mean that. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting on an answer, and protecting it, and holding it back. It\u2019s not a case of: I\u2019m not telling you cos I don\u2019t want to tell you. It\u2019s not: ooh this is mine and it\u2019s not yours.\u201d What is it then? \u201cIt\u2019s: who cares? Does that make sense? It\u2019s just: who cares?\u201d I suppose my only question, then, is about the stuff that looks like clue dropping. Because if you don\u2019t want people to care, why hint? Take the album sleeve for Fine Line. With its horizontal pink and blue stripes, a splash of magenta, the design seems to gesture at the trans and bisexual pride flags. Which is great \u2013 unless the person behind it happens to be a straight dude, sprinkling LGBTQ crumbs that lead nowhere. Does that make sense? Styles nods. \u201cAm I sprinkling in nuggets of sexual ambiguity to try and be more interesting? No.\u201d As for the rest, he says, \u201cin terms of how I wanna dress, and what the album sleeve\u2019s gonna be, I tend to make decisions in terms of collaborators I want to work with. I want things to look a certain way. Not because it makes me look gay, or it makes me look straight, or it makes me look bisexual, but because I think it looks cool. And more than that, I dunno, I just think sexuality\u2019s something that\u2019s fun. Honestly? I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve given it any more thought than that.\u201d In our musty corner of the pub we\u2019ve somehow passed a couple of hours in intense discussion. We\u2019ll lighten up, before Styles heads home, with some chat about clever films (Marriage Story), stupider viral videos (the little boy who\u2019s just learned the word \u201capparently\u201d), that favourite-superhero stuff that, after all, has its place. He talks about the curious double time scheme of a pop star\u2019s life \u2013 those crammed 18-hour days and then the sudden empty off-time when Styles might find himself walking miles across London to buy a book, afterwards congratulating himself: \u201cWell, that\u2019s an hour filled.\u201d Before we stand up I ask if he\u2019s minded any of my questions. He pushes out his lips, possibly recalling them one by one, then shakes his head. \u201cWhat I would say, about the whole being-asked-about-my-sexuality thing \u2013 this is a job where you might get asked. And to complain about it, to say you hate it, and still do the job, that\u2019s just silly. You respect that someone\u2019s gonna ask. And you hope that they respect they might not get an answer.\u201d I tell him I do. \u201cCool.\u201d Styles has to find those lads who wanted a photo. He scoops his phone off the table and flicks his thumb around the screen. Lately, he says, when he messes around on his phone in an idle moment, it\u2019s mostly to look at videos \u2013 clips that his friends have sent him, in which their kids sing along to music he\u2019s made. \u201cNever gets old,\u201d Styles says, beaming. A few years ago, when he emerged from the boyband, blinking, shattered, he set himself three tasks: prioritise friends, learn how to be an adult, achieve a proper balance between the big and the small. Full stadiums, provocative outfits \u2013 Styles genuinely loves these things. \u201cBut I guess I\u2019ve realised, as well,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the coolest things are not always the cool things. Do you know what I mean?\u201d He grabs his parka and his phone and, a little stooped, heads for home. \u2022 Harry Styles\u2019s album Fine Line is out now.

      "body": "<p>The BBC\u2019s director general has expressed his exasperation with \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d about the broadcaster\u2019s election news coverage, although some of its journalists privately fear that errors during the campaign may have hit public trust in the corporation.</p> <p>Tony Hall emailed staff on Friday to thank them for their work on the BBC\u2019s coverage, which has led to the corporation\u2019s political news output coming under intense online scrutiny. This followed criticism of the editing out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/25/bbc-admits-mistake-in-editing-out-laughter-at-johnson-in-tv-debate\">laughter aimed at Boris Johnson </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/25/bbc-admits-mistake-in-editing-out-laughter-at-johnson-in-tv-debate\"> in a news bulletin</a>, reporters uncritically repeating Conservative sources, such as when a Labour activist was erroneously accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/matt-hancock-aide-altercation-hospital-campaign-visit\">punching a Tory aide,</a> and the prime minister escaping scrutiny after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/06/conservatives-dismiss-andrew-neil-demands-for-johnson-interview\">dodging a one-on-one interview</a> with Andrew Neil.</p> <p>Hall said the BBC\u2019s critics were often seeing bias in what were genuine human errors: \u201cIn a frenetic campaign where we\u2019ve produced hundreds of hours of output, of course we\u2019ve made the odd mistake and we\u2019ve held up our hands to them. Editors are making tough calls every minute of the day. But I don\u2019t accept the view of those critics who jump on a handful of examples to suggest we\u2019re somehow biased one way or the other.\u201d</p> <p>He also suggested social media platforms should find ways to reduce the level of public criticism aimed at journalists, such as BBC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/11/bbc-denies-political-editors-postal-vote-comments-broke-law\">political editor Laura </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/11/bbc-denies-political-editors-postal-vote-comments-broke-law\">Kuenssberg</a>: \u201cElections always put the BBC\u2019s impartiality in the spotlight. Social media offers a megaphone to those who want to attack us and makes this pressure greater than ever. The conspiracy theories that abound are frustrating. And let\u2019s be clear \u2013 some of the abuse which is directed at our journalists who are doing their best for audiences day in, day out is sickening. It shouldn\u2019t happen. And I think it\u2019s something social media platforms really need to do more about.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this, there remain concerns within the corporation\u2019s newsrooms that this election was a tough challenge for a broadcaster that strives for accuracy. More than 30 BBC journalists spoke to the Guardian about the outlet\u2019s coverage in the final days of the campaign, ranging from senior on-air presenters to mid-level producers and recent hires.</p> <p>Almost all of them, who spoke anonymously to give their frank views, believed strongly in the BBC\u2019s purpose and importance as a unifying force of reliable news in a divided country. But many raised doubts as to how the corporation\u2019s output can withstand such a level of scrutiny. A common complaint was the risk of feeling paralysed by the knowledge that every single piece of television, radio or online output is at risk of being examined in detail on Twitter for allegations of bias.</p> <p>While older staff were more likely to dismiss online complaints about coverage, younger staff repeatedly and persistently raised concerns about the loosely phrased tweets of senior BBC journalists, which often reach millions of people without passing through editors.</p> <p>\u201cThey should be subject to the same rigour as any other online material,\u201d one journalist said.</p> <p>Another employee involved in the broadcaster\u2019s politics output during the election said: \u201cI\u2019m proud of the programmes we\u2019ve put together, but I feel like we\u2019ve been undermined at every turn by constant gaffes on the part of senior presenters and editors. I detect an unhealthy us-versus-them mentality, an unwillingness to say sorry when the BBC gets it wrong and a genuine terror of upsetting the government in particular.\u201d</p> <p>There was repeated concern that the BBC\u2019s model of neutral reporting was not suited to an age where politicians are more willing to try to manipulate the media, with Johnson and his aide Dominic Cummings repeatedly singled out for taking advantage of that.</p> <p>Fran Unsworth, director of news and current affairs, told the Guardian that the broadcaster faced a challenge to fight back against claims of bias: \u201cThings go viral very quickly and our ability to respond and deal with them is limited. Even when we try to explain and put out the denials or the explanation as to how things might\u2019ve happened. People just aren\u2019t buying it. It\u2019s a real issue for us to deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>While the BBC has long been a punchbag of right-wing publications such as The Sun and Daily Mail, there has been much more criticism from left-wing campaigners and centrist pro-Remain campaigners this election. BBC journalists based in London, an area with strong Labour support, reported finding it harder now that their friendship groups were increasingly critical of the corporation\u2019s output.</p> <p>Many complained that they had come to dread discussing their jobs at family events or children\u2019s parties because they would find themselves cornered and cross-examined on accusations of BBC bias.</p> <p>One regional BBC reporter said they had noticed many more members of the public refusing to talk to him, although it was unclear whether this was just part of a general anti-media reaction among the public. \u201cIt felt like BBC reputation has taken a bit of a hit and not just in the Twitter vacuum. Not that I think there is a bias of course. Just a series of errors have unfortunately fallen a similar way, which gives plenty of ammo.\u201d</p> <p>Although many of the more prominent anti-BBC complaints in this election have come from the left of politics, staff pointed out that pro-Conservative Brexit supporters often file more complaints about coverage directly to the corporation.</p> <p>One BBC journalist working on a high-profile radio programme expressed exasperation with \u201cludicrous Twitter storms\u201d over minor errors but admitted criticism had made life harder. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough working for the BBC at the moment. I have never known the fury to be so great. But my overwhelming impression is that people should be careful what they wish for, because they will end up with Fox News or Russia Today.\u201d</p> <p>Unsworth said it was not realistic to ask correspondents to step back from Twitter but there is room for changes: \u201cIt is an important form of communication to get their stories out. We just need to reinforce our social media rules. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s viable to say take a step back.\u201d</p> <p>She also said she sees her duty as being to the whole of the BBC\u2019s audience, not just political activists scrutinising the BBC\u2019s output on social media. \u201cThis is a smaller world than the people think it is. I find people who are living ordinary lives and they\u2019re not on social media every day. They are still taking their cues from the mainstream news.\u201d</p> <p>Unsworth said she had been proud of the corporation\u2019s output during the election and preferred scrutiny rather than being ignored.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows that we matter.

      "bodyText": "The BBC\u2019s director general has expressed his exasperation with \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d about the broadcaster\u2019s election news coverage, although some of its journalists privately fear that errors during the campaign may have hit public trust in the corporation. Tony Hall emailed staff on Friday to thank them for their work on the BBC\u2019s coverage, which has led to the corporation\u2019s political news output coming under intense online scrutiny. This followed criticism of the editing out laughter aimed at Boris Johnson in a news bulletin, reporters uncritically repeating Conservative sources, such as when a Labour activist was erroneously accused of punching a Tory aide, and the prime minister escaping scrutiny after dodging a one-on-one interview with Andrew Neil. Hall said the BBC\u2019s critics were often seeing bias in what were genuine human errors: \u201cIn a frenetic campaign where we\u2019ve produced hundreds of hours of output, of course we\u2019ve made the odd mistake and we\u2019ve held up our hands to them. Editors are making tough calls every minute of the day. But I don\u2019t accept the view of those critics who jump on a handful of examples to suggest we\u2019re somehow biased one way or the other.\u201d He also suggested social media platforms should find ways to reduce the level of public criticism aimed at journalists, such as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: \u201cElections always put the BBC\u2019s impartiality in the spotlight. Social media offers a megaphone to those who want to attack us and makes this pressure greater than ever. The conspiracy theories that abound are frustrating. And let\u2019s be clear \u2013 some of the abuse which is directed at our journalists who are doing their best for audiences day in, day out is sickening. It shouldn\u2019t happen. And I think it\u2019s something social media platforms really need to do more about.\u201d Despite this, there remain concerns within the corporation\u2019s newsrooms that this election was a tough challenge for a broadcaster that strives for accuracy. More than 30 BBC journalists spoke to the Guardian about the outlet\u2019s coverage in the final days of the campaign, ranging from senior on-air presenters to mid-level producers and recent hires. Almost all of them, who spoke anonymously to give their frank views, believed strongly in the BBC\u2019s purpose and importance as a unifying force of reliable news in a divided country. But many raised doubts as to how the corporation\u2019s output can withstand such a level of scrutiny. A common complaint was the risk of feeling paralysed by the knowledge that every single piece of television, radio or online output is at risk of being examined in detail on Twitter for allegations of bias. While older staff were more likely to dismiss online complaints about coverage, younger staff repeatedly and persistently raised concerns about the loosely phrased tweets of senior BBC journalists, which often reach millions of people without passing through editors. \u201cThey should be subject to the same rigour as any other online material,\u201d one journalist said. Another employee involved in the broadcaster\u2019s politics output during the election said: \u201cI\u2019m proud of the programmes we\u2019ve put together, but I feel like we\u2019ve been undermined at every turn by constant gaffes on the part of senior presenters and editors. I detect an unhealthy us-versus-them mentality, an unwillingness to say sorry when the BBC gets it wrong and a genuine terror of upsetting the government in particular.\u201d There was repeated concern that the BBC\u2019s model of neutral reporting was not suited to an age where politicians are more willing to try to manipulate the media, with Johnson and his aide Dominic Cummings repeatedly singled out for taking advantage of that. Fran Unsworth, director of news and current affairs, told the Guardian that the broadcaster faced a challenge to fight back against claims of bias: \u201cThings go viral very quickly and our ability to respond and deal with them is limited. Even when we try to explain and put out the denials or the explanation as to how things might\u2019ve happened. People just aren\u2019t buying it. It\u2019s a real issue for us to deal with it.\u201d While the BBC has long been a punchbag of right-wing publications such as The Sun and Daily Mail, there has been much more criticism from left-wing campaigners and centrist pro-Remain campaigners this election. BBC journalists based in London, an area with strong Labour support, reported finding it harder now that their friendship groups were increasingly critical of the corporation\u2019s output. Many complained that they had come to dread discussing their jobs at family events or children\u2019s parties because they would find themselves cornered and cross-examined on accusations of BBC bias. One regional BBC reporter said they had noticed many more members of the public refusing to talk to him, although it was unclear whether this was just part of a general anti-media reaction among the public. \u201cIt felt like BBC reputation has taken a bit of a hit and not just in the Twitter vacuum. Not that I think there is a bias of course. Just a series of errors have unfortunately fallen a similar way, which gives plenty of ammo.\u201d Although many of the more prominent anti-BBC complaints in this election have come from the left of politics, staff pointed out that pro-Conservative Brexit supporters often file more complaints about coverage directly to the corporation. One BBC journalist working on a high-profile radio programme expressed exasperation with \u201cludicrous Twitter storms\u201d over minor errors but admitted criticism had made life harder. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough working for the BBC at the moment. I have never known the fury to be so great. But my overwhelming impression is that people should be careful what they wish for, because they will end up with Fox News or Russia Today.\u201d Unsworth said it was not realistic to ask correspondents to step back from Twitter but there is room for changes: \u201cIt is an important form of communication to get their stories out. We just need to reinforce our social media rules. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s viable to say take a step back.\u201d She also said she sees her duty as being to the whole of the BBC\u2019s audience, not just political activists scrutinising the BBC\u2019s output on social media. \u201cThis is a smaller world than the people think it is. I find people who are living ordinary lives and they\u2019re not on social media every day. They are still taking their cues from the mainstream news.\u201d Unsworth said she had been proud of the corporation\u2019s output during the election and preferred scrutiny rather than being ignored. \u201cIt shows that we matter. It would be worse if they weren\u2019t talking about us. All the talk had been that the mainstream media doesn\u2019t really matter anymore.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Top City fund manager, campaigner for equal pay and opportunities, aspiring governor of the Bank of England, author \u2013 and now social media fashion influencer? Dame Helena Morrissey has often been f\u00eated as an overachiever, but few could have predicted the latest pivot for the former head of Legal &amp; General\u2019s personal investing business and founder of the 30% Club, which campaigns for more women in boardrooms. She has taken to Instagram to advise women on how to dress for success. Styling herself as a \u201csoft power dresser\u201d, Morrissey, who has nine children and was recently interviewed to become the next Bank governor, has launched an Instagram account offering \u201cdaily tips for modern feminine career dressing\u201d. She started posting in late November and kicked off her recommendations with a full-length picture of herself wearing a Zara shirt dress with a silk scarf print. As in most of the 20 or so other images, she is posing next to gold floor-length curtains in her family living room. In her captions, Morrissey discusses how to cope with \u201csartorial challenges\u201d, advocates comfortable shoes and sings the praises of young British designers. She claims her family motto is \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d, and says the motto is the inspiration behind her second-eldest daughter\u2019s new vintage fashion venture, Florence Clementine Archive, where some of the photographs of the luxury clothes for sale feature a suspiciously familiar model. In one recent post, Morrissey styled a pleated \u201ctruly special skirt\u201d costing thousands from Gucci with a ribbed polo neck from the Japanese clothing company Uniqlo, which sells for about \u00a325. Under the photo, she extols the virtues of wearing less corporate outfits: \u201cA young colleague started dressing more distinctively. One day, I admired the beautiful skirt she was wearing; she told me I had inspired her to dress for work in the feminine style she preferred. It was so lovely of her to share that \u2013 and wonderful to see her grow in confidence \u2013 and get promoted!\u201d The handful of comments below that post from her followers are entirely positive. \u201cI adore this skirt,\u201d writes one. \u201cI love you\u2019re sharing, what an inspiration,\u201d says another. Whether new or vintage, some of Morrissey\u2019s outfits from labels such as Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and Jimmy Choo may be beyond the means of most of her 2,700 followers, if they are not on a top City salary. Nor do they appeal to every female worker. \u201cI would never wear that, it looks like something my mother thinks I should wear as a CEO,\u201d says one thirtysomething female boss of a financial services firm, of Morrissey\u2019s green Dolce &amp; Gabbana dress, which is embellished with large white daisies. \u201cAs a leader in a male-dominated and often bullish environment, what I wear really matters as to how I am perceived.\u201d Another female leader in the fintech business suggests bright colours and embellished skirts are easier to wear for women already at the top of their profession: \u201cI stick to that more corporate look as otherwise assumptions would be made and I would be dismissed more quickly. Dressing in a more flamboyant and fun way isn\u2019t helpful when you aren\u2019t at the level of seniority Morrissey is.\u201d Morrissey recently quit Legal &amp; General, saying she wanted to pursue other interests.

      "body": "<p>Some memoirists send drafts of their work to loved ones, or even not-so-loved ones, and where there\u2019s a response alter their writing as a result. Others see no need for consultation. Either way, when writing about your own life, it\u2019s important to get the monkeys off your shoulder \u2013 to be uninhibited by the possible fallout of your words. You can worry about other people later, when you\u2019re editing. In mid-flow, you need the illusion of privacy, not to be anticipating people\u2019s reactions (which are in any case unpredictable). Most self-censorship is cowardly. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/02/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-elizabeth-strout\" title=\"\">Elizabeth\u2019s Strout\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/02/my-name-is-lucy-barton-review-elizabeth-strout\" title=\"\">My Name Is Lucy Barton</a></em>, the writing tutor Sarah says: \u201cIf you find yourself protecting anyone as you write \u2026 remember this: you\u2019re not doing it right.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone has a book in them, it\u2019s said, but as Martin Amis noted in his memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/05/martinamis\" title=\"\">Experience</a> </em>(2000)<em>,</em> what everyone seems to have in them \u201cis not a novel but a memoir \u2026 We are all writing it or at any rate talking it: the memoir, the apologia, the CV, the cri de coeur.\u201d Democracy itself may be under threat but the democratisation of the memoir keeps advancing. What was once a geriatric, self-satisfied genre \u2013 politicians, generals and film stars looking back fondly on long careers \u2013 is now open to anyone with a story to tell. And the genre has reinvented itself to take diverse forms: lyric essay, creative non-fiction, confessional prose-poem and so on. You don\u2019t have to be famous to write a memoir. And it doesn\u2019t have to be cradle-to-grave: a slice of life, or collage of fragments, can be enough.</p> <p>The outlets for publishing memoirs have diversified too. Small presses and the subscription publisher <a href=\"https://unbound.com/\" title=\"\">Unbound </a>have widened the field. Self-publishing also plays a part, as does the internet: from online blog to book-length memoir is an obvious trajectory, since both are first-person discourse offering an intimate relationship with readers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b97e30969182cbe9d830d35f7366441e1d148bf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b97e30969182cbe9d830d35f7366441e1d148bf9/204_290_1664_2087/797.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Kraus, author of I Love Dick.\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Kraus, author of <em>I Love Dick</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nic Amato</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like blogs, memoirs are sometimes accused of self-absorption: me-me-me. It\u2019s an unfair charge. In fact it often seems that those writing memoirs, far from being narcissists, need constant encouragement that their story is worth telling, that they\u2019re not being self-indulgent, that it\u2019s OK to use the word \u201cI\u201d. Chris Kraus, in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/30/chris-kraus-i-love-dick-was-written-in-a-delirium\" title=\"\">1997 novel </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/30/chris-kraus-i-love-dick-was-written-in-a-delirium\" title=\"\">I Love Dick</a>,</em> recalls how \u201cwhenever I tried writing in the first person it sounded like some other person, or else the tritest most neurotic parts of myself that I wanted so badly to get beyond. Now I can\u2019t stop writing in the first person, it feels like it\u2019s the last chance I\u2019ll ever have to figure some of this stuff out.\u201d To figure stuff out is half the point of writing memoir but, as Virginia Woolf said, the reason so many memoirs are failures is that \u201cthey leave out the person to whom things happened\u201d. As with life drawing, so with life writing: we expect nakedness. You can even make a case for memoir being the most self-sacrificial of forms, the author laying herself open for the benefit of others, who feel less alone in the world once an experience they\u2019ve been through is articulated by someone else. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/30/empathy-exams-leslie-jamison-review\" title=\"\">Leslie Jamison</a>, the author of <em>The Empathy Exams </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/recovering-leslie-jamison-review-intoxication-aftermath-alcohol\" title=\"\">The Recovering</a></em>, a memoir of addiction, has said, the confessional memoir \u201cis often the opposite of solipsism: it creates dialogue. It elicits responses. It coaxes chorus like a brushfire.\u201d</p> <p>The motives for writing memoir vary widely, from greed (celebs can command lucrative advances) to propaganda (the author\u2019s experiences set down in the hope of effecting social change) to catharsis (a healing of one\u2019s own \u2013 and others\u2019 \u2013 wounds) to memorialising (to preserve a story that would otherwise be lost). Whatever their motive, most of the life-writing students I\u2019ve worked with over the years are level-headed. They write to make sense of their lives or to narrate a piece of family history. Sometimes they embargo what they\u2019ve written, because the material is too sensitive; sometimes they publish it privately, for family and friends; sometimes it goes out into the world. The potential impact on others is an increasing consideration. All universities now have ethics committees, and life writing is treated much as sociology or anthropology would be, with consent a major issue: have the \u201cparticipants\u201d (ie any living person who appears in the memoir) given their permission to be written about? </p> <p>It\u2019s not just universities that want to be ethically clean and legally invulnerable. Publishers do too, and memoirs can be a minefield. It\u2019s hard enough being honest with yourself (Mark Twain: \u201cWhen a man is writing a book dealing with the privacies of his life \u2013 a book which is to be read while he is still alive \u2013 he shrinks from speaking his whole frank mind\u201d), but when you\u2019re writing candidly about others the stakes are even higher. According to George Bernard Shaw, \u201cAll autobiographies are lies\u201d because \u201cno man is bad enough to tell the truth about himself during his lifetime, involving as it must the truth about his family and friends and colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily, there are writers bad enough to tell such truths, either because they\u2019re foolhardy or they have scores to settle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jul/07/family.family7\" title=\"\">Alice Jolly</a>, author of a memoir about surrogacy, <em>Dead Babies and Seaside Towns</em>, likes to quote the American writer Anne Lamott: \u201cIf people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"14ecb1d080d69049a3c6dc895e97d617d85c7503\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14ecb1d080d69049a3c6dc895e97d617d85c7503/438_45_824_1010/816.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Jolly.\" width=\"816\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alice Jolly\u2019s <em>Dead Babies and Seaside Towns</em> is about motherhood, grief, infertility and the British coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martin Amis wrote <em>Experience</em> \u201cto speak, for once, without artifice\u201d. Not, though, with any less concern for \u201cformality\u201d \u2013 for shape and structure \u2013 than he brings to his fiction. There\u2019s an idea that a memoir is somehow easier to write than a novel, because it is based on real events rather than invented. But as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/01/joyce-carol-oates-my-life-as-a-rat-interview\" title=\"\">Joyce Carol Oates</a> has said, a memoir isn\u2019t journalism or history, supplying \u201ca verifiable, corroborative truth\u201d, it is a literary text, consisting of words that have been \u201cartfully arranged\u201d. We might read it in a different way from fiction, with authenticity more of a consideration than aesthetics. But the two are indivisible: the authenticity can\u2019t exist without artistry. Truth in life doesn\u2019t automatically morph into truth on the page. And living people don\u2019t necessarily come to life in print. It takes creativity \u2013 hence the term \u201ccreative non-fiction\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a delicate balance. Too much artifice \u2013 flashy metaphors and show-off prose \u2013 and you risk losing the reader\u2019s trust. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\" title=\"\">Kathryn Harrison</a>\u2019s <em>The Kiss</em> is a powerful study of her incestuous relationship with her father, with whom she\u2019s reunited as a young woman. It\u2019s a brilliant account of coercion on his part and numbed submission on hers. There\u2019s just one detail that has always bothered me: one night she spots a cockroach in the kitchen and traps it under a glass tumbler. It may have happened \u2013 probably did \u2013 just as she describes. But it feels too neat an image of her own entrapment. In a novel it would look over-determined. Should she have cut it? Perhaps. In a memoir where credibility is crucial, decorative flourishes risk breaking that contract.</p> <p>In life writing, any whiff of fiction breeds doubt. So it seems to me. And so it seemed to Thomas Hardy when he wrote of the \u201cinfinite mischief\u201d of \u201cmixing of fact and fiction in unknown proportions\u201d. But it is true that the boundaries are shifting. There are parts of the world that don\u2019t recognise the difference between novels and memoirs. And the teasing, vicarious appeal of autofiction, that most fashionable of genres, is that \u2013 no matter how hard we comb the text and paratext for clues \u2013 we don\u2019t know what the author personally experienced and what has been invented. In 2003, if James Frey had published his <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/15/usa.world\" title=\"\">A Million Little Pieces</a></em> as autofiction, he might not have been pilloried by Oprah Winfrey for taking liberties with the truth. Memoir is different, though: its claim is that everything has been taken from life \u2013 that nothing is knowingly untrue. Yes, for the sake of readability, scenes may have been switched round, characters conflated, and dialogue approximated rather than accurately recalled. Readers can live with that. They know that memory is unreliable and subjectivity unavoidable \u2013 that when you recall a family event, say, your siblings will remember it differently. But unwitting misremembering is not the same as deliberate falsification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fb5d705f1c407946ccb0e4cb4dc555a48c7ab43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fb5d705f1c407946ccb0e4cb4dc555a48c7ab43/0_162_4354_2612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry Hudson\u2019s Lowborn covers her turbulent upbringing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kerry Hudson\u2019s <em>Lowborn</em> covers her turbulent upbringing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iain Masterton/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trauma is often the trigger for a memoir: an abusive childhood, a life-threatening illness, the death of a parent or partner.

According to Byron, it\u2019s better that way \u2013 you need to wait till the pain has been processed: \u201cWhile you are under the influence of passions, you only feel, but cannot describe them.\u201d Then again, books composed in the immediate aftermath of a trauma aren\u2019t necessarily worthless; it depends on the circumstances.</p> <p>I wrote a memoir of my dad, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview13\" title=\"\">And When Did You Last See Your Father?</a></em>, in the 11 months after his death, whereas the one about my mum, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview22\" title=\"\">Things My Mother Never Told Me</a></em>, took me years. One was about losing a parent, the other about belatedly finding a parent; one was emotionally charged, the other a work of research, drawn from letters written before I was born (and in that respect not a memoir at all).</p> <p>Death is often the basis of life writing. But it can\u2019t be all gloom: misery memoirs have a bad name. Let there be light \u2013 playful digressions and a graveside joke or two. Self-pity wins no friends. Even elegies have to entertain.

      "bodyText": "Some memoirists send drafts of their work to loved ones, or even not-so-loved ones, and where there\u2019s a response alter their writing as a result. Others see no need for consultation. Either way, when writing about your own life, it\u2019s important to get the monkeys off your shoulder \u2013 to be uninhibited by the possible fallout of your words. You can worry about other people later, when you\u2019re editing. In mid-flow, you need the illusion of privacy, not to be anticipating people\u2019s reactions (which are in any case unpredictable). Most self-censorship is cowardly. In Elizabeth\u2019s Strout\u2019s My Name Is Lucy Barton, the writing tutor Sarah says: \u201cIf you find yourself protecting anyone as you write \u2026 remember this: you\u2019re not doing it right.\u201d Everyone has a book in them, it\u2019s said, but as Martin Amis noted in his memoir Experience (2000), what everyone seems to have in them \u201cis not a novel but a memoir \u2026 We are all writing it or at any rate talking it: the memoir, the apologia, the CV, the cri de coeur.\u201d Democracy itself may be under threat but the democratisation of the memoir keeps advancing. What was once a geriatric, self-satisfied genre \u2013 politicians, generals and film stars looking back fondly on long careers \u2013 is now open to anyone with a story to tell. And the genre has reinvented itself to take diverse forms: lyric essay, creative non-fiction, confessional prose-poem and so on. You don\u2019t have to be famous to write a memoir. And it doesn\u2019t have to be cradle-to-grave: a slice of life, or collage of fragments, can be enough. The outlets for publishing memoirs have diversified too. Small presses and the subscription publisher Unbound have widened the field. Self-publishing also plays a part, as does the internet: from online blog to book-length memoir is an obvious trajectory, since both are first-person discourse offering an intimate relationship with readers. Like blogs, memoirs are sometimes accused of self-absorption: me-me-me. It\u2019s an unfair charge. In fact it often seems that those writing memoirs, far from being narcissists, need constant encouragement that their story is worth telling, that they\u2019re not being self-indulgent, that it\u2019s OK to use the word \u201cI\u201d. Chris Kraus, in her 1997 novel I Love Dick, recalls how \u201cwhenever I tried writing in the first person it sounded like some other person, or else the tritest most neurotic parts of myself that I wanted so badly to get beyond. Now I can\u2019t stop writing in the first person, it feels like it\u2019s the last chance I\u2019ll ever have to figure some of this stuff out.\u201d To figure stuff out is half the point of writing memoir but, as Virginia Woolf said, the reason so many memoirs are failures is that \u201cthey leave out the person to whom things happened\u201d. As with life drawing, so with life writing: we expect nakedness. You can even make a case for memoir being the most self-sacrificial of forms, the author laying herself open for the benefit of others, who feel less alone in the world once an experience they\u2019ve been through is articulated by someone else. As Leslie Jamison, the author of The Empathy Exams and The Recovering, a memoir of addiction, has said, the confessional memoir \u201cis often the opposite of solipsism: it creates dialogue. It elicits responses. It coaxes chorus like a brushfire.\u201d The motives for writing memoir vary widely, from greed (celebs can command lucrative advances) to propaganda (the author\u2019s experiences set down in the hope of effecting social change) to catharsis (a healing of one\u2019s own \u2013 and others\u2019 \u2013 wounds) to memorialising (to preserve a story that would otherwise be lost). Whatever their motive, most of the life-writing students I\u2019ve worked with over the years are level-headed. They write to make sense of their lives or to narrate a piece of family history. Sometimes they embargo what they\u2019ve written, because the material is too sensitive; sometimes they publish it privately, for family and friends; sometimes it goes out into the world. The potential impact on others is an increasing consideration. All universities now have ethics committees, and life writing is treated much as sociology or anthropology would be, with consent a major issue: have the \u201cparticipants\u201d (ie any living person who appears in the memoir) given their permission to be written about? It\u2019s not just universities that want to be ethically clean and legally invulnerable. Publishers do too, and memoirs can be a minefield. It\u2019s hard enough being honest with yourself (Mark Twain: \u201cWhen a man is writing a book dealing with the privacies of his life \u2013 a book which is to be read while he is still alive \u2013 he shrinks from speaking his whole frank mind\u201d), but when you\u2019re writing candidly about others the stakes are even higher. According to George Bernard Shaw, \u201cAll autobiographies are lies\u201d because \u201cno man is bad enough to tell the truth about himself during his lifetime, involving as it must the truth about his family and friends and colleagues.\u201d Luckily, there are writers bad enough to tell such truths, either because they\u2019re foolhardy or they have scores to settle. Alice Jolly, author of a memoir about surrogacy, Dead Babies and Seaside Towns, likes to quote the American writer Anne Lamott: \u201cIf people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.\u201d Martin Amis wrote Experience \u201cto speak, for once, without artifice\u201d. Not, though, with any less concern for \u201cformality\u201d \u2013 for shape and structure \u2013 than he brings to his fiction. There\u2019s an idea that a memoir is somehow easier to write than a novel, because it is based on real events rather than invented. But as Joyce Carol Oates has said, a memoir isn\u2019t journalism or history, supplying \u201ca verifiable, corroborative truth\u201d, it is a literary text, consisting of words that have been \u201cartfully arranged\u201d. We might read it in a different way from fiction, with authenticity more of a consideration than aesthetics. But the two are indivisible: the authenticity can\u2019t exist without artistry. Truth in life doesn\u2019t automatically morph into truth on the page. And living people don\u2019t necessarily come to life in print. It takes creativity \u2013 hence the term \u201ccreative non-fiction\u201d. It\u2019s a delicate balance. Too much artifice \u2013 flashy metaphors and show-off prose \u2013 and you risk losing the reader\u2019s trust. Kathryn Harrison\u2019s The Kiss is a powerful study of her incestuous relationship with her father, with whom she\u2019s reunited as a young woman. It\u2019s a brilliant account of coercion on his part and numbed submission on hers. There\u2019s just one detail that has always bothered me: one night she spots a cockroach in the kitchen and traps it under a glass tumbler. It may have happened \u2013 probably did \u2013 just as she describes. But it feels too neat an image of her own entrapment. In a novel it would look over-determined. Should she have cut it? Perhaps. In a memoir where credibility is crucial, decorative flourishes risk breaking that contract. In life writing, any whiff of fiction breeds doubt. So it seems to me. And so it seemed to Thomas Hardy when he wrote of the \u201cinfinite mischief\u201d of \u201cmixing of fact and fiction in unknown proportions\u201d. But it is true that the boundaries are shifting. There are parts of the world that don\u2019t recognise the difference between novels and memoirs. And the teasing, vicarious appeal of autofiction, that most fashionable of genres, is that \u2013 no matter how hard we comb the text and paratext for clues \u2013 we don\u2019t know what the author personally experienced and what has been invented. In 2003, if James Frey had published his A Million Little Pieces as autofiction, he might not have been pilloried by Oprah Winfrey for taking liberties with the truth. Memoir is different, though: its claim is that everything has been taken from life \u2013 that nothing is knowingly untrue. Yes, for the sake of readability, scenes may have been switched round, characters conflated, and dialogue approximated rather than accurately recalled. Readers can live with that. They know that memory is unreliable and subjectivity unavoidable \u2013 that when you recall a family event, say, your siblings will remember it differently. But unwitting misremembering is not the same as deliberate falsification. Trauma is often the trigger for a memoir: an abusive childhood, a life-threatening illness, the death of a parent or partner. It may be decades before the experience is written about, as with Lemn Sissay\u2019s recent My Name Is Why, which recalls his years in the care system. According to Byron, it\u2019s better that way \u2013 you need to wait till the pain has been processed: \u201cWhile you are under the influence of passions, you only feel, but cannot describe them.\u201d Then again, books composed in the immediate aftermath of a trauma aren\u2019t necessarily worthless; it depends on the circumstances. I wrote a memoir of my dad, And When Did You Last See Your Father?, in the 11 months after his death, whereas the one about my mum, Things My Mother Never Told Me, took me years. One was about losing a parent, the other about belatedly finding a parent; one was emotionally charged, the other a work of research, drawn from letters written before I was born (and in that respect not a memoir at all). Death is often the basis of life writing. But it can\u2019t be all gloom: misery memoirs have a bad name. Let there be light \u2013 playful digressions and a graveside joke or two.

Though they vary widely in form, they share a conviction that women\u2019s stories deserve to be heard. There\u2019s a sense of empowerment about them, even when that means owning up to weakness. In the pipe-and-tweed-jacket days of publishing, they would not have made it into print. It will be a surprise if the next few years don\u2019t bring a rash of #MeToo memoirs from millennials. Each generation has new taboos to break. And breaking them requires new literary forms \u2013 fresh ways of being honest, fresh ways of venting rage. As Ashworth puts it: \u201cSome days it feels like writing truthfully about her own life is the most subversive thing a woman can do.\u201d The best memoirs are always transgressive.

The fort, now a scheduled monument, was constructed under governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 78AD, as part of his campaign to control the native Ordovices, a Celtic tribe who resisted Roman rule with some enthusiasm. Agricola\u2019s response was a brutal campaign which, according to Roman chronicler (and Agricola\u2019s son-in-law) Tacitus, almost wiped out the tribe.</p> <p>The Roman remains at Tomen y Mur are extensive, and various earthworks outside the fort are believed to be a parade ground, a bathhouse, a mansio (a house for visiting officials), burial mounds, a temple and a rare, small military amphitheatre. Abandoned in 140AD, the site was reoccupied a millennium later, and a castle mound built inside the original walls.

Tomen y Mur, surprisingly unsignposted in spite of its significance, sits on the lower slopes of Mynydd Maentwrog, not far from the A470 to the north-east of Llyn Trawsfynydd reservoir. The fort, now a scheduled monument, was constructed under governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 78AD, as part of his campaign to control the native Ordovices, a Celtic tribe who resisted Roman rule with some enthusiasm. Agricola\u2019s response was a brutal campaign which, according to Roman chronicler (and Agricola\u2019s son-in-law) Tacitus, almost wiped out the tribe. The Roman remains at Tomen y Mur are extensive, and various earthworks outside the fort are believed to be a parade ground, a bathhouse, a mansio (a house for visiting officials), burial mounds, a temple and a rare, small military amphitheatre. Abandoned in 140AD, the site was reoccupied a millennium later, and a castle mound built inside the original walls. It was probably constructed by the Normans to counter the Welsh insurgency of 1095. It\u2019s a lovely site, surrounded by fields dotted with the inevitable sheep. There are panoramic views to the west across Llyn Trawsfynydd, a large reservoir on whose north-eastern shore squats a rather less inevitable, decommissioned nuclear power station.

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re throwing a Christmas party, mulled wine has one thing going for it: you can make up a big batch and leave it for your guests to help themselves \u2013 no fuss for the host. But if by mid-December, you can\u2019t face another glass of what is all too often sickly-sweet, tooth-coating stuff \u2013 let alone the thought of offering it to your nearest and dearest \u2013 here are four alternatives for festive party tipples that can be prepped in advance. Many draw on a long tradition of party punches and festive drinks that deserve to get more of a showing at this time of year.</p> <h2><strong>Cinnamon-apple cava spritz</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf6dc39643940bbf6610219fe446dde5f8746b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6dc39643940bbf6610219fe446dde5f8746b80/0_0_9600_9600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett\u2019s cinnamon-apple cava spritz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett\u2019s cinnamon-apple cava spritz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cava is so much more than an affordable alternative to champagne (or a welcome relief from the ubiquitous prosecco). Its toasty, brioche notes are a particularly good foil to refreshing apple and warm spice flavours: this spritz combines both, to create a warming but refreshing welcome drink. We especially like Ravent\u00f3s i Blanc\u2019s wine, a biodynamic cava producer whose blanc de blancs can be picked up <a href=\"https://www.gourmethunters.com/en_GB/Ravent%C3%B3s+i+Blanc+Blanc+de+Blancs+2017\" title=\"\">for not much over \u00a310 online</a>, and is far more interesting than many champagnes at four times the price.</p> <p>Prep <strong>40 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>About 20</strong></p> <p>For the spiced apple puree<br><strong>6 large tangy eating apples</strong><br><strong>1 tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>Caster sugar</strong>, to taste<br><strong>1 vanilla pod</strong>, split lengthways</p> <p>To serve<br><strong>3 chilled bottles cava</strong> \u2013 we especially like <a href=\"https://www.gourmethunters.com/en_GB/Ravent%C3%B3s+i+Blanc+Blanc+de+Blancs+2017\" title=\"\">Ravent\u00f3s i Blanc\u2019s blanc de blancs</a>, which can be got for just over \u00a310 online, and is far more interesting than many champagnes at four times the price<br><strong>Apple crisps</strong>, to garnish (optional, but fancy)<br><strong>20ml shot bourbon per guest</strong> (optional, but fun)</p> <p>Make the spiced apple puree in advance: core and peel the apples, then cut into quarters. Put into a large pan, add enough water just to cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until soft. Strain off the water and put the softened fruit in a food processor with the cinnamon (or use a stick blender).</p> <p>Blend smooth, adding just as much sugar as you need to match your taste. Scrape in the vanilla seeds to round out the sweet flavours, then cover and chill until needed. The puree keeps for a week in the fridge, and will make more than 20 servings, but it\u2019s great on porridge or stirred through yoghurt, too.</p> <p>On the night of the party, prepare your glasses: for each guest, spoon a heaped teaspoon of apple puree into the bottom of a champagne flute or small wine glass. Add a dash of cava to wet the inside of each glass and swirl it around to mix it with the puree.</p> <p>As your guests arrive, hand them a glass topped up with chilled cava and garnished with an apple crisp. To introduce even more festive warmth, add a 20ml shot of bourbon to each glass before you add the cava.</p> <h2><strong>Sherry cobbler</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6decaa3972329e851705c76ce33add269327d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6decaa3972329e851705c76ce33add269327d17/0_0_9600_9600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett\u2019s sherry cobbler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett\u2019s sherry cobbler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not just for trifles (or grannies), sherry is a fortified wine that forms the basis of some of the oldest known cocktails, with recipes dating back to 1820. This version is made with amontillado and fresh fruit, served over ice. Because it\u2019s not fashionable, you can get good sherry at great prices, making it ideal for catering for a big group.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>About 20</strong></p> <p><strong>500g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>2 litres amontillado sherry</strong><br><strong>4 oranges</strong>, cut into 1cm-thick slices</p> <p>To serve<br><strong>2 big bags of ice cubes or 1 bag of crushed ice</strong><br><strong>A few punnets of blackberries and blueberries </strong><br><strong>1 big bunch </strong><strong>fresh mint </strong></p> <p>The day before, make a simple syrup: take a litre measuring jug, fill it halfway with caster sugar (ie, 500g, give or take), then fill nearly to the top with boiling water. Stir to dissolve, leave to cool, then refrigerate. (You almost certainly won\u2019t need all the syrup, but it keeps well and can be used in all sorts of cocktails.)</p> <p>The proportions for the cobbler are simple, so it\u2019s easy to scale up or down. One serving = 100ml amontillado + 20ml sugar syrup (or a 5:1 ratio of sherry to syrup, if you prefer). So, for 20 guests, combine two litres of sherry with 200ml syrup in a serving pitcher, then add the orange slices.</p> <p>If you have ice cubes, crush them by wrapping one bag at a time in a tea towel and bashing it with a rolling pin (excellent post-Christmas shopping stress relief).</p> <p>To serve, set the jug of cobbler, a bowl of crushed ice, highball glasses, the berries and the mint out on a table. All you or your guests have to do is fill a glass with crushed ice, top up with the cobbler and garnish with berries and a sprig of mint.</p> <h2><strong>Mulled cider</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d27ce24ef81f982a5d1c5d3c5070d91e32e2a642\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d27ce24ef81f982a5d1c5d3c5070d91e32e2a642/0_0_9600_9600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett\u2019s mulled cider\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett\u2019s mulled cider.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Warming, Christmassy spices work so much better with sharp, mouth-smacking cider than with wine, and the result is less alcoholic, too \u2013 ideal for anyone pacing themselves over the long party season.</p> <p>Prep <strong>30 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>About 20</strong></p> <p><strong>Zest and juice of 2 lemons</strong>, peeled carefully in wide strips, with a potato peeler to leave as much of the white pith behind as possible<br><strong>3 clementines</strong>, peeled<br><strong>2 cinnamon sticks</strong><br><strong>6 cloves</strong><br><strong>2 star anise</strong><br><strong>2 cardamom pods</strong>, lightly crushed with the flat of a large knife<br><strong>2 vanilla pods</strong>, split lengthways<br><strong>50g fresh ginger</strong>, finely chopped<br><strong>4 litres </strong><strong>good, dry cider</strong><br><strong>500g dark brown sugar</strong>, or less, to taste</p> <p>In a heavy-based frying pan over a very low heat, toast the lemon peel, clementine peel (keep the fruit for later), cinnamon, cloves, star anise, cardamom, vanilla and ginger for around 10 minutes, constantly moving everything around in the pan so nothing can catch and burn. Once the aromas of the spices start to fill the air, tip into a bowl and set aside.</p> <p>Pour the cider into a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Cut up the clementine flesh and add to the cider with the lemon juice and the reserved spice mix. Warm over a low heat and gradually stir in the sugar, tasting as you go. You may decide you don\u2019t need all of it, depending on how much of a sweet tooth you have.</p> <p>Leave the mulled cider on the lowest possible heat for your guests to ladle directly into mugs, but make sure you and they keep the pan covered, or the alcohol will boil off and you\u2019ll be left with nothing but hot spiced apple juice.</p> <h2><strong>Port and cranberry winter sangria</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2dbdf030f6df29a225396a7ebf501a86b4fd87d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2dbdf030f6df29a225396a7ebf501a86b4fd87d/0_0_9600_9600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett\u2019s port and cranberry winter sangria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett\u2019s port and cranberry winter sangria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Normally only spotted at the end of Christmas dinner when the cheese is rolled out, port is actually at its best served slightly chilled. Combining it with Christmas-coloured fruit makes for a beautiful, ruby-red party punch.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>About 20</strong></p> <p><strong>2 x 750ml bottles juicy red wine</strong>, such as a cabernet franc, merlot or syrah <br><strong>\u00bd bottle (375ml) ruby red port</strong><br><strong>50ml brandy</strong><br><strong>150ml cranberry juice</strong>, or more to taste<br><strong>2 red apples</strong><br><strong>2 firm,</strong><strong> crunchy pears </strong><br><strong>1 handful fresh cranberries</strong><br><strong>1 bag ice cubes</strong><br><strong>10 fresh figs</strong>, halved, to garnish (optional but beautiful)</p> <p>Pour the wine, port and brandy into a large jug (or two), making sure at least a third of the jug is left empty to accommodate the ice, then add the cranberry juice \u2013 add more if you want to make what is otherwise a very robust drink that bit more quaffable, but don\u2019t let it get too sweet.</p> <p>Core the apples and pears, but don\u2019t peel them. Dice into 1cm cubes, then stir through the sangria with the fresh cranberries.</p> <p>Keep refrigerated until your guests arrive, then top up the jug with ice and stir well.

Prep 40 min Serves About 20 For the spiced apple puree 6 large tangy eating apples 1 tsp ground cinnamon Caster sugar, to taste 1 vanilla pod, split lengthways To serve 3 chilled bottles cava \u2013 we especially like Ravent\u00f3s i Blanc\u2019s blanc de blancs, which can be got for just over \u00a310 online, and is far more interesting than many champagnes at four times the price Apple crisps, to garnish (optional, but fancy) 20ml shot bourbon per guest (optional, but fun) Make the spiced apple puree in advance: core and peel the apples, then cut into quarters. Put into a large pan, add enough water just to cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until soft. Strain off the water and put the softened fruit in a food processor with the cinnamon (or use a stick blender). Blend smooth, adding just as much sugar as you need to match your taste. Scrape in the vanilla seeds to round out the sweet flavours, then cover and chill until needed. The puree keeps for a week in the fridge, and will make more than 20 servings, but it\u2019s great on porridge or stirred through yoghurt, too. On the night of the party, prepare your glasses: for each guest, spoon a heaped teaspoon of apple puree into the bottom of a champagne flute or small wine glass. Add a dash of cava to wet the inside of each glass and swirl it around to mix it with the puree. As your guests arrive, hand them a glass topped up with chilled cava and garnished with an apple crisp. To introduce even more festive warmth, add a 20ml shot of bourbon to each glass before you add the cava. Sherry cobbler Not just for trifles (or grannies), sherry is a fortified wine that forms the basis of some of the oldest known cocktails, with recipes dating back to 1820. This version is made with amontillado and fresh fruit, served over ice. Because it\u2019s not fashionable, you can get good sherry at great prices, making it ideal for catering for a big group. Prep 20 min Serves About 20 500g caster sugar 2 litres amontillado sherry 4 oranges, cut into 1cm-thick slices To serve 2 big bags of ice cubes or 1 bag of crushed ice A few punnets of blackberries and blueberries 1 big bunch fresh mint The day before, make a simple syrup: take a litre measuring jug, fill it halfway with caster sugar (ie, 500g, give or take), then fill nearly to the top with boiling water. Stir to dissolve, leave to cool, then refrigerate. (You almost certainly won\u2019t need all the syrup, but it keeps well and can be used in all sorts of cocktails.) The proportions for the cobbler are simple, so it\u2019s easy to scale up or down. One serving = 100ml amontillado + 20ml sugar syrup (or a 5:1 ratio of sherry to syrup, if you prefer). So, for 20 guests, combine two litres of sherry with 200ml syrup in a serving pitcher, then add the orange slices. If you have ice cubes, crush them by wrapping one bag at a time in a tea towel and bashing it with a rolling pin (excellent post-Christmas shopping stress relief). To serve, set the jug of cobbler, a bowl of crushed ice, highball glasses, the berries and the mint out on a table. All you or your guests have to do is fill a glass with crushed ice, top up with the cobbler and garnish with berries and a sprig of mint. Mulled cider Warming, Christmassy spices work so much better with sharp, mouth-smacking cider than with wine, and the result is less alcoholic, too \u2013 ideal for anyone pacing themselves over the long party season. Prep 30 min Serves About 20 Zest and juice of 2 lemons, peeled carefully in wide strips, with a potato peeler to leave as much of the white pith behind as possible 3 clementines, peeled 2 cinnamon sticks 6 cloves 2 star anise 2 cardamom pods, lightly crushed with the flat of a large knife 2 vanilla pods, split lengthways 50g fresh ginger, finely chopped 4 litres good, dry cider 500g dark brown sugar, or less, to taste In a heavy-based frying pan over a very low heat, toast the lemon peel, clementine peel (keep the fruit for later), cinnamon, cloves, star anise, cardamom, vanilla and ginger for around 10 minutes, constantly moving everything around in the pan so nothing can catch and burn. Once the aromas of the spices start to fill the air, tip into a bowl and set aside. Pour the cider into a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Cut up the clementine flesh and add to the cider with the lemon juice and the reserved spice mix. Warm over a low heat and gradually stir in the sugar, tasting as you go. You may decide you don\u2019t need all of it, depending on how much of a sweet tooth you have. Leave the mulled cider on the lowest possible heat for your guests to ladle directly into mugs, but make sure you and they keep the pan covered, or the alcohol will boil off and you\u2019ll be left with nothing but hot spiced apple juice. Port and cranberry winter sangria Normally only spotted at the end of Christmas dinner when the cheese is rolled out, port is actually at its best served slightly chilled. Combining it with Christmas-coloured fruit makes for a beautiful, ruby-red party punch. Prep 15 min Serves About 20 2 x 750ml bottles juicy red wine, such as a cabernet franc, merlot or syrah \u00bd bottle (375ml) ruby red port 50ml brandy 150ml cranberry juice, or more to taste 2 red apples 2 firm, crunchy pears 1 handful fresh cranberries 1 bag ice cubes 10 fresh figs, halved, to garnish (optional but beautiful) Pour the wine, port and brandy into a large jug (or two), making sure at least a third of the jug is left empty to accommodate the ice, then add the cranberry juice \u2013 add more if you want to make what is otherwise a very robust drink that bit more quaffable, but don\u2019t let it get too sweet. Core the apples and pears, but don\u2019t peel them. Dice into 1cm cubes, then stir through the sangria with the fresh cranberries. Keep refrigerated until your guests arrive, then top up the jug with ice and stir well. Serve in large wine glasses, with half a fig slotted over the rim of the glass for extra festive flair. \u2022 Recipes by Albert Blaize and Claire Strickett.

      "body": "<p>Can you trust the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to resolve your dispute with a bank or insurer? A whistleblower has told Guardian Money that a \u201cdisastrous\u201d management reorganisation has left the service in disarray, with the public waiting as long as two years to get justice.</p> <p>The whistleblower, a senior staff member at the FOS who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that:<br>\u2022 Consumers sending complex complaints to FOS can wait 10 months before a file is even picked up and examined.<br>\u2022 The waiting time for pension disputes is seven months.<br>\u2022 Wronged consumers can wait up to two years until their claims are finally adjudicated.<br>\u2022 The number of unresolved general claims (non-PPI) that remain unresolved a year after being received now stands at 15,551.<br>\u2022 Managers expected case handlers to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, but the real figure is 1.7.</p> <p>The FOS has disputed the whistleblower\u2019s claims and says 80% of cases are resolved within six months. It says it runs an \u201ceffective and essential service\u201d, while conceding that it has seen a trend towards more complex complaints \u2013 such as fraud and scams, and self-invested personal pensions \u2013 that often require significant time and resources to resolve.</p> <p>Documents shown to Money by the whistleblower indicate that a consumer with a complex dispute with their mortgage company or home insurer faces a wait of about 10 months before the file is even picked up and looked for the first time.</p> <p>The service was set up to help consumers get fair treatment from the banks, insurers, pension and other financial services providers. Staff act as independent adjudicators over disputes, and their findings are binding on the companies concerned. It\u2019s free for consumers to use, but the company concerned must pay \u00a3550.</p> <p>However, the service has been beset with problems in recent years. In 2018, an undercover reporter for <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/press/news/investigation-fos-finds-staff-severe-lack-training\" title=\"\">Channel 4\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/press/news/investigation-fos-finds-staff-severe-lack-training\" title=\"\">Dispatches</a> found that staff with inadequate training or financial competence were judging cases \u2013 sometimes without, it claimed, properly reading case files.</p> <p>Several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/22/backlog-of-financial-ombudsman-cases-grows-to-30000\" title=\"\">staff have since turned whistleblower</a> in a bid to get the Financial Conduct Authority to take action. Their comments chime with complaints to Money from readers who, having been through the arbitration process, claim the service is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>According to the latest whistleblower, things are even worse now than a year ago. A 2016 reorganisation changed the way cases are distributed, he says. Instead of using expert adjudicators to deal solely with disputes in their specialist areas, new investigators were expected to work across all areas of finance.

      "bodyText": "Can you trust the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to resolve your dispute with a bank or insurer? A whistleblower has told Guardian Money that a \u201cdisastrous\u201d management reorganisation has left the service in disarray, with the public waiting as long as two years to get justice. The whistleblower, a senior staff member at the FOS who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that: \u2022 Consumers sending complex complaints to FOS can wait 10 months before a file is even picked up and examined. \u2022 The waiting time for pension disputes is seven months. \u2022 Wronged consumers can wait up to two years until their claims are finally adjudicated. \u2022 The number of unresolved general claims (non-PPI) that remain unresolved a year after being received now stands at 15,551. \u2022 Managers expected case handlers to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, but the real figure is 1.7. The FOS has disputed the whistleblower\u2019s claims and says 80% of cases are resolved within six months. It says it runs an \u201ceffective and essential service\u201d, while conceding that it has seen a trend towards more complex complaints \u2013 such as fraud and scams, and self-invested personal pensions \u2013 that often require significant time and resources to resolve. Documents shown to Money by the whistleblower indicate that a consumer with a complex dispute with their mortgage company or home insurer faces a wait of about 10 months before the file is even picked up and looked for the first time. The service was set up to help consumers get fair treatment from the banks, insurers, pension and other financial services providers. Staff act as independent adjudicators over disputes, and their findings are binding on the companies concerned. It\u2019s free for consumers to use, but the company concerned must pay \u00a3550. However, the service has been beset with problems in recent years. In 2018, an undercover reporter for Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches found that staff with inadequate training or financial competence were judging cases \u2013 sometimes without, it claimed, properly reading case files. Several staff have since turned whistleblower in a bid to get the Financial Conduct Authority to take action. Their comments chime with complaints to Money from readers who, having been through the arbitration process, claim the service is not fit for purpose. According to the latest whistleblower, things are even worse now than a year ago. A 2016 reorganisation changed the way cases are distributed, he says. Instead of using expert adjudicators to deal solely with disputes in their specialist areas, new investigators were expected to work across all areas of finance. The result, he says, has been a huge drop in the service\u2019s performance in what it calls its \u201cgeneral cases\u201d, leaving a growing list of people awaiting what can be life-changing sums of money. Complaints are initially judged by an\u201cinvestigator\u201d and only escalated to the experienced ombudsmen if either party appeals against the first decision. The queue of complaints waiting for an ombudsman\u2019s decision has increased dramatically in recent years and now stands at 15,592. \u201cPreviously the adjudicators worked in specialised areas such as mortgages or pensions, [but now] the investigators are expected to be able to handle complaints across most areas, although the board has since acknowledged this was unfeasible and rowed back on this. \u201cManagers believed their changes would enable investigators to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, which turned out to be a gross misjudgment. The system has never delivered more than 2.6 case closures per week and the current output is now 1.7,\u201d he says. \u201cThe organisation is facing problems beyond simply the backlogs. The resolved complaints per investigator per week is less than half of what it was claimed would be achieved. And the cost of resolving each complaint now exceeds \u00a31,100 \u2013 placing the long-term sustainability of the organisation in doubt.\u201d The end of the tsunami of PPI claims that swamped the service was set to be an opportunity to start clearing the backlog in complaints.

The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/14/burrito-bond-restaurant-chilango-restructuring-talks\" title=\"\">revealed on 14 November</a> that UK-based Mexican restaurant chain Chilango was in talks about the future of the business.</p> <p>That was a blow for the hundreds of people who, as recently as April, signed up for its multimillion-pound mini-bond scheme, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/06/too-hot-to-handle-dont-be-burned-on-p2p-or-mini-bond-loans\" title=\"\">promised returns of 8% a year</a>. The <a href=\"https://burritobond.rapidz.pw/\" title=\"\">website promoting the bond offer</a> had declared that \u201c100%\u201d of its restaurants were profitable.</p> <p>This week the news got a lot worse. The company has proposed a financial restructuring known as a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/company-voluntary-arrangements\" title=\"\">company voluntary arrangement</a> (CVA) \u2013 and documents sent to creditors and seen by Guardian Money show the business\u2019s debt burden is unsustainable, and that if a restructuring does not take place, the company is likely to enter administration or liquidation.</p> <p>The shake-up could see the bondholders receiving just 10p for every \u00a31 they invested.</p> <p>Chilango, which has 12 UK outlets, 10 in London, raised \u00a32.1m via the first version of its burrito bond in 2014. Just over a year ago Chilango launched a second burrito bond, and in April announced it had pulled in more than \u00a33.7m from almost 800 investors \u2013 including 194 people who put in at least \u00a310,000 each.</p> <p>Issuing mini-bonds is a way for a firm to borrow directly from the public, and they have proved popular with small investors desperate for better returns. You get a fixed interest rate and, when the bond matures, your capital is returned to you. But they are <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/secured-energy-bonds-plc-options-investors\" title=\"\">risky and controversial</a>.</p> <p>The documents show that the Chilango bondholders are being offered a choice. They can back the restructuring and either transfer their investments into shares in the company or receive a payment of just 10p in the pound \u201cin full and final settlement of their debt\u201d. Or they can vote against the shake-up.</p> <p>Going for the shares sounds like a no-brainer, particularly when you bear in mind these are presented as paying an 8% annual dividend (though this would be \u201cas and when the company can afford it\u201d).

      "bodyText": "Small investors who sank millions of pounds into a \u201cburrito bond\u201d scheme were this week told they could face losing 90% of their money \u2013 or 99% if the company goes into administration. The Guardian revealed on 14 November that UK-based Mexican restaurant chain Chilango was in talks about the future of the business. That was a blow for the hundreds of people who, as recently as April, signed up for its multimillion-pound mini-bond scheme, which promised returns of 8% a year. The website promoting the bond offer had declared that \u201c100%\u201d of its restaurants were profitable. This week the news got a lot worse. The company has proposed a financial restructuring known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) \u2013 and documents sent to creditors and seen by Guardian Money show the business\u2019s debt burden is unsustainable, and that if a restructuring does not take place, the company is likely to enter administration or liquidation. The shake-up could see the bondholders receiving just 10p for every \u00a31 they invested. Chilango, which has 12 UK outlets, 10 in London, raised \u00a32.1m via the first version of its burrito bond in 2014. Just over a year ago Chilango launched a second burrito bond, and in April announced it had pulled in more than \u00a33.7m from almost 800 investors \u2013 including 194 people who put in at least \u00a310,000 each. Issuing mini-bonds is a way for a firm to borrow directly from the public, and they have proved popular with small investors desperate for better returns. You get a fixed interest rate and, when the bond matures, your capital is returned to you. But they are risky and controversial. The documents show that the Chilango bondholders are being offered a choice. They can back the restructuring and either transfer their investments into shares in the company or receive a payment of just 10p in the pound \u201cin full and final settlement of their debt\u201d. Or they can vote against the shake-up. Going for the shares sounds like a no-brainer, particularly when you bear in mind these are presented as paying an 8% annual dividend (though this would be \u201cas and when the company can afford it\u201d). But, crucially, the shareholders have to agree to the creation of this new class of preference shares, and it seems far from certain that they will give their consent. That\u2019s because these new shares would rank above ordinary shares in the pecking order if, say, the company was sold. If the shareholders don\u2019t agree, the bondholders will have to make do with 10p in the pound. The documents warn that \u201cthe return to creditors generally is estimated to be significantly lower if the company is placed into administration (0.83p in \u00a31) than if the proposal is approved\u201d. They say the company needs \u201cto address significant cashflow challenges, including a sizeable forecast deficit from January 2020 totalling \u00a30.3m\u201d. Following the announcement of the CVA, Chilango said it had \u201cbegun a process of engagement with its stakeholders with a plan to secure the future of the business\u201d.",

At the time this seemed like a really big deal.</p> <p>It was a desperate excursion: nothing we could afford could be procured at 24 hours\u2019 notice. Finally, at dusk, on a road full of junk shops, we found two men loading a battered workshop table on to the back of a lorry to take it to the dump. For \u00a350 they took it to our house instead. It was crooked, gouged and spattered with grease and paint. The top was made of old roof rafters, with large peg holes at either end. It would do in an emergency, we thought, until something better came along.</p> <p>Twenty-two years later, I am sitting at the same kitchen table, staring at the 2p coin that we jammed into one of the peg holes to stop things falling through, when the oldest one walks in.</p> <p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I say. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you, like, 30 now?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he says.

Back then, Israel was led by a coalition government that ranged from right to center-left, including Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres.</p> <p>But when it comes to US politics under Trump, Netanyahu is no mere bystander. Two recent and exhaustively researched biographies, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Netanyahu-Years-Ben-Caspit/dp/1250087058\">Ben Caspit\u2019s The Netanyahu Years</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bibi-Turbulent-Times-Benjamin-Netanyahu/dp/0465097820\">Anshel Pfeffer\u2019s Bibi</a>, shine serious light on how Israel\u2019s standing within the US has shifted, with their subject playing no small role. Besting Barack Obama, as Netanyahu did, solidified his status with conservatives in both countries \u2013 but at a lingering cost in the US.</p> <p>According to Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/45466_Page2.html\">former instructor of Ron Dermer</a>, Netanyahu\u2019s one-time hand-picked ambassador to Washington, \u201cIsrael has won the hearts and minds of Republicans in America, while at the same time it is losing the Democrats.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/06/houses-israel-vote-077048\">A recent resolution</a> passed by the House reaffirmed US support for Israel and a two-state solution.

      "bodyText": "Like abortion and taxes, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Israel is one more flashpoint in America under Donald Trump. As millennials, minorities, women and liberals don\u2019t readily cotton to the 45th president, their support for the Jewish state cannot be assumed. In the words of a recent Economist/YouGov poll: \u201cWhen it comes to Israel, American views are partisan.\u201d These trends have been decades in the making. They precede the coming of Trump and the rise of Netanyahu. At the 1988 Democratic convention, delegates rejected a call for a Palestinian state but not before Chuck Schumer, then a congressman from Brooklyn, found himself subject to the ire of Jesse Jackson\u2019s supporters. Back then, Israel was led by a coalition government that ranged from right to center-left, including Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. But when it comes to US politics under Trump, Netanyahu is no mere bystander. Two recent and exhaustively researched biographies, Ben Caspit\u2019s The Netanyahu Years and Anshel Pfeffer\u2019s Bibi, shine serious light on how Israel\u2019s standing within the US has shifted, with their subject playing no small role. Besting Barack Obama, as Netanyahu did, solidified his status with conservatives in both countries \u2013 but at a lingering cost in the US. According to Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and former instructor of Ron Dermer, Netanyahu\u2019s one-time hand-picked ambassador to Washington, \u201cIsrael has won the hearts and minds of Republicans in America, while at the same time it is losing the Democrats.\u201d A recent resolution passed by the House reaffirmed US support for Israel and a two-state solution. Republicans and progressive Democrats were displeased, albeit for different reasons. Suffice to say, Netanyahu is not a perfect fit with the minority and youth-driven, upstairs-downstairs coalition that occupies an ever larger space within the Democratic party, or with the predominantly although not exclusively liberal US Jewish community. In Israel, Trump\u2019s popularity hovers near 70%. Among US Jews the figure is the polar opposite. Both Caspit and Pfeffer speak with authority. Caspit is a reporter for Israel\u2019s Maariv daily. Pfeffer, English by birth and an occasional contributor to the Guardian, writes for Haaretz, the liberal broadsheet which, with the New York Times, Netanyahu considers an enemy of the state, a reminder that Trump-style authoritarianism-lite knows no borders. As Caspit makes clear, the Israel-born and US-educated Netanyahu is an unabashed Jewish nationalist whose alignment with the Republican party is an expression of his DNA. Caspit recounts how Netanyahu\u2019s father, Benzion, sided with the GOP while FDR was president. Benzion\u2019s son drank at the same well as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and the late senator Jesse Helms. Both Caspit and Pfeffer recount how, in 1996, Netanyahu turned to Arthur Finkelstein, a conservative political guru, to defeat Peres in his maiden political contest. The late Finkelstein was legendary in Republican and conservative circles. With Roger Stone (now convicted) and others, Finkelstein was a founder of the National Conservative Political Action Committee.

In 2002, out of government, Netanyahu testified before Congress that if Saddam Hussein were toppled: \u201cI guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.\u201d So much prescience.

As the Israeli prime minister has privately acknowledged, he does not speak \u201cDemocratic\u201d. Those around Netanyahu also concede that he either cannot or will not internalize America\u2019s changing demographics. Now under indictment, Netanyahu faces prosecution and is looking to invoke parliamentary immunity. According to recent reports, he is taking his cues from Breitbart\u2019s Israel operations and seeking to bolster his campaign with assistance from Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, two Trump stalwarts. Support for Israel and the heart of the Republican party have both shifted right.

On that score, enter Daniel Gordis\u2019s wistful and elegiac We Stand Divided, which focuses on the \u201crift between American Jews and Israel\u201d but is also an implicit lament that American Jews have morphed into an iteration of modern-day Quakers, educated and mercantile but not hyper-ethnocentric.

      "body": "<p>This Christmas you\u2019ll find me sitting around a crackling fire with my family: my mum whomping down her third mince pie, my sister searching for bubbly, and my stepfather burying his nose in the sports pages. One of my ex-boyfriends will be making us die with laughter while another ex polishes off the cava, and a completely different ex tries to pull focus from the first ex, who is on all fours pretending to give birth to a penguin. My actual boyfriend will either be in hysterics or dreading his turn at charades. Christmas is complicated.</p> <p>People start moaning about how stressful Christmas is around the time Pret release their new festive sandwich. Single gay friends, especially, worry about travelling to towns they left as soon as they could, populated by people they hid from on Facebook and hoped never to see again. I know this feeling, because for years it\u2019s what I did, too. Back in the early noughties, the thought of going home to Jersey was so gloomy that I was forced to take action. I was single, but had stayed pretty good friends with an ex who had grown up in a family of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, so I asked him to come home with me. He was thrilled to have an invite, and that year proved that just because turkey is dry it doesn\u2019t mean the holiday has to be. Having an ally took the edge off, and the lively addition of a guest with ADHD and a gift for candid storytelling meant we all had the most fun we\u2019d had in years.</p> <p>When I met my next boyfriend, he got on brilliantly with my ex, who was now also my best friend, so spending the next Christmas together was a no-brainer. When we split up, we remained good friends, and a couple of Decembers later he was spending Christmas with me, the original ex, another ex and my current boyfriend. These days, there are so many of us at my family Christmas that we have to rent somewhere big enough. We\u2019ve spent it in a cliff-top fort, a 14th-century castle, a Tudor cottage and an actual abbey. This year we\u2019re off to a medieval manor house in Shropshire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50e2aa5b31bccb7c294a135782b1292e098323d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50e2aa5b31bccb7c294a135782b1292e098323d7/0_267_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Mackenzie, family and friends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve never understood why more people don\u2019t stay friends with their exes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Malcolm Mackenzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is this all a bit weird? It doesn\u2019t feel weird. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a gay thing or a \u201cme\u201d thing, but it seems likely that gay people sometimes stay friends with the people they sleep with, or else face a pretty desolate social circle. When you\u2019re young, randy and searching for validation through intimacy, it\u2019s easy to misdiagnose kindred spirits as potential mates, and my guess is that about half the people we go out with should just be friends.</p> <p>It took time for my present boyfriend to assimilate. He is younger than the rest of us and it must have felt overwhelming entering our coven with its shared history, habits and nonsense language. Initially there were arguments: between him and me, and between him and certain exes. But a year or two later we were laughing about it. He admits that when he spent his first Christmas with us he felt lost, but he quickly carved out a role as the cook and could disappear to the kitchen for a breather when it all got too much, with my mother often hot on his heels.</p> <p>I asked my mum about the situation I\u2019d imposed on her before writing this piece, and she was typically Aquarian in her response, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d When pushed, she did agree that it must seem strange to other people, but she\u2019d never really thought about it because she\u2019d met everyone and got on with them before they showed up at her door. And that\u2019s worth pointing out: these are all bona fide long-term partners. Casual dalliances get an Insta follow not a turkey dinner.</p> <p>Because my mum lives on Jersey and my sister and I have emigrated to \u201cthe mainland\u201d, things are pretty quiet for her most of the year, so when she jumps off-rock and joins the annual circus of my failed love affairs, she welcomes the change of pace, the constant chatter, filthy stories, dance routines, games and amped-up gaiety. She lived through the 70s, so I\u2019m sure we seem pretty tame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecd14acc96b1a18165f8f9545457d51c41c4d484\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecd14acc96b1a18165f8f9545457d51c41c4d484/41_201_3739_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Mackenzie is at the back on the right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Is this all a bit weird? It doesn\u2019t feel weird.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Malcolm Mackenzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My younger sister has never known Christmas without my plus ones and, like mum, never used to give it a thought. But she assures me that it is odd, because even among her group of trendy pansexual Brighton millennials, exes rarely stay friends, let alone make a date to spend every December together. Despite this, the ex thing has rubbed off on her, and she is now best friends with her ex. </p> <p>I\u2019ve never understood why more people don\u2019t stay friends with their exes. No one ever did me so much wrong that I never wanted to speak to them again. Of course I\u2019ve been cheated on, but you\u2019ll get over your boyfriend having toilet sex while you wait on the dancefloor with a vodka and cranberry, really you will. After breaking up with my exes I forgave any indiscretions because I really enjoyed their company \u2013 and because being righteous is lonely and dull.</p> <p>There are downsides to Exmas. It gets competitive at jigsaw time, and we\u2019ve worked out that three exes is too many: they make pacts, take sides, and eat all the After Eights. Three upsets the dynamic, dividing one healthy group into bickery factions until we\u2019re so annoying that my stepfather is driven to passive-aggressively clanging the coal scuttle as he cleans out the fire \u2013 which absolutely needs doing at 6am on Boxing Day. We are a <em>lot</em> and no one is offended if somebody makes a temporary escape \u2013 though the time one ex disappeared to go on a Grindr date halfway through Doctor Who was a plot twist no one saw coming. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c6c37c3eb51990b2dcab8acd7230f6778a38a78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c6c37c3eb51990b2dcab8acd7230f6778a38a78/278_361_2730_1639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Mackenzie\u2019s mother is second from left as Eleanor of Aquitaine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My mum [second from left, as Eleanor of Aquitaine] welcomes the constant chatter and amped-up gaiety.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Malcolm Mackenzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another year, an ex made amorous overtures to one of my sister\u2019s friends. The sot was so soused that the friend gallantly helped him to his bedroom. Finding himself alone with the young man, my ex wrongly assumed he was there for one thing. The next day was awkward, but it was something to talk about over leftovers. </p> <p>My Christmases have not always been like this. When my parents split up and my mum remarried, I was a belligerent teenager and resisted the new family. I was angry at my dad and didn\u2019t want to be with him, either. One Christmas I said no to everyone and stayed at home alone, Macaulay Sulkin\u2019. Shrinks might call this the \u201cinciting moment\u201d. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019ve done everything in my power since then to make Christmas all about me, but I\u2019m also not <em>not</em> saying that either.</p> <p>Because I feel comfortable at my curated Christmas, I can be myself in a way I might not with my extended family. The dressing up started off small \u2013 it was easy enough to coax everyone into a fake moustache and comedy teeth \u2013 but things have since escalated. My finest moment was luring everyone to a fancy-dress shop and convincing them to hire every historical costume they had. Watching my mum baste a giant ham dressed as Eleanor of Aquitaine is something I\u2019ll take to the grave. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/16/how-we-live-together-the-foster-family\">How we live together: the foster family</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Jehovah\u2019s Witness thing means one of my exes may never spend Christmas with his family, but he\u2019s made peace with that. The one who bore the brunt of the coal scuttle incident has never returned, and another is torn: for many, Christmas is family time, and he admits that spending it with mine can lead to moments of melancholy. Perhaps out of guilt, or inspired by our trips away, he is taking a sabbatical from this year\u2019s Exmas to go on holiday with his own mum. I hope he has a lovely time, but I fully expect him back in 2020 \u2013 and if he ever wants to bring his boyfriend, I\u2019m sure that would be fine.</p> <p>We grow up with stories where the ex is either a villain or the one that got away, but I\u2019ve found that to be a lie. Our beloved becomes the one: the one we love and the one we can\u2019t live without; meanwhile, the ones that got away should be able to come round for a wine whenever they like, although a text first would be nice. Like many gay people, when I left home I created a new \u201cchosen\u201d family. But it turns out I wasn\u2019t replacing my actual family, I was adding to it. Bringing both together at this time of year means I get to have my Christmas cake and eat it, too.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;If you would like your&#xa0;comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "This Christmas you\u2019ll find me sitting around a crackling fire with my family: my mum whomping down her third mince pie, my sister searching for bubbly, and my stepfather burying his nose in the sports pages. One of my ex-boyfriends will be making us die with laughter while another ex polishes off the cava, and a completely different ex tries to pull focus from the first ex, who is on all fours pretending to give birth to a penguin. My actual boyfriend will either be in hysterics or dreading his turn at charades. Christmas is complicated. People start moaning about how stressful Christmas is around the time Pret release their new festive sandwich. Single gay friends, especially, worry about travelling to towns they left as soon as they could, populated by people they hid from on Facebook and hoped never to see again. I know this feeling, because for years it\u2019s what I did, too. Back in the early noughties, the thought of going home to Jersey was so gloomy that I was forced to take action. I was single, but had stayed pretty good friends with an ex who had grown up in a family of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, so I asked him to come home with me. He was thrilled to have an invite, and that year proved that just because turkey is dry it doesn\u2019t mean the holiday has to be. Having an ally took the edge off, and the lively addition of a guest with ADHD and a gift for candid storytelling meant we all had the most fun we\u2019d had in years. When I met my next boyfriend, he got on brilliantly with my ex, who was now also my best friend, so spending the next Christmas together was a no-brainer. When we split up, we remained good friends, and a couple of Decembers later he was spending Christmas with me, the original ex, another ex and my current boyfriend. These days, there are so many of us at my family Christmas that we have to rent somewhere big enough. We\u2019ve spent it in a cliff-top fort, a 14th-century castle, a Tudor cottage and an actual abbey. This year we\u2019re off to a medieval manor house in Shropshire. Is this all a bit weird? It doesn\u2019t feel weird. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a gay thing or a \u201cme\u201d thing, but it seems likely that gay people sometimes stay friends with the people they sleep with, or else face a pretty desolate social circle. When you\u2019re young, randy and searching for validation through intimacy, it\u2019s easy to misdiagnose kindred spirits as potential mates, and my guess is that about half the people we go out with should just be friends. It took time for my present boyfriend to assimilate. He is younger than the rest of us and it must have felt overwhelming entering our coven with its shared history, habits and nonsense language. Initially there were arguments: between him and me, and between him and certain exes. But a year or two later we were laughing about it. He admits that when he spent his first Christmas with us he felt lost, but he quickly carved out a role as the cook and could disappear to the kitchen for a breather when it all got too much, with my mother often hot on his heels. I asked my mum about the situation I\u2019d imposed on her before writing this piece, and she was typically Aquarian in her response, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d When pushed, she did agree that it must seem strange to other people, but she\u2019d never really thought about it because she\u2019d met everyone and got on with them before they showed up at her door. And that\u2019s worth pointing out: these are all bona fide long-term partners. Casual dalliances get an Insta follow not a turkey dinner. Because my mum lives on Jersey and my sister and I have emigrated to \u201cthe mainland\u201d, things are pretty quiet for her most of the year, so when she jumps off-rock and joins the annual circus of my failed love affairs, she welcomes the change of pace, the constant chatter, filthy stories, dance routines, games and amped-up gaiety. She lived through the 70s, so I\u2019m sure we seem pretty tame. My younger sister has never known Christmas without my plus ones and, like mum, never used to give it a thought. But she assures me that it is odd, because even among her group of trendy pansexual Brighton millennials, exes rarely stay friends, let alone make a date to spend every December together. Despite this, the ex thing has rubbed off on her, and she is now best friends with her ex. I\u2019ve never understood why more people don\u2019t stay friends with their exes. No one ever did me so much wrong that I never wanted to speak to them again. Of course I\u2019ve been cheated on, but you\u2019ll get over your boyfriend having toilet sex while you wait on the dancefloor with a vodka and cranberry, really you will. After breaking up with my exes I forgave any indiscretions because I really enjoyed their company \u2013 and because being righteous is lonely and dull. There are downsides to Exmas. It gets competitive at jigsaw time, and we\u2019ve worked out that three exes is too many: they make pacts, take sides, and eat all the After Eights. Three upsets the dynamic, dividing one healthy group into bickery factions until we\u2019re so annoying that my stepfather is driven to passive-aggressively clanging the coal scuttle as he cleans out the fire \u2013 which absolutely needs doing at 6am on Boxing Day. We are a lot and no one is offended if somebody makes a temporary escape \u2013 though the time one ex disappeared to go on a Grindr date halfway through Doctor Who was a plot twist no one saw coming. Another year, an ex made amorous overtures to one of my sister\u2019s friends. The sot was so soused that the friend gallantly helped him to his bedroom. Finding himself alone with the young man, my ex wrongly assumed he was there for one thing. The next day was awkward, but it was something to talk about over leftovers. My Christmases have not always been like this. When my parents split up and my mum remarried, I was a belligerent teenager and resisted the new family. I was angry at my dad and didn\u2019t want to be with him, either. One Christmas I said no to everyone and stayed at home alone, Macaulay Sulkin\u2019. Shrinks might call this the \u201cinciting moment\u201d. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019ve done everything in my power since then to make Christmas all about me, but I\u2019m also not not saying that either. Because I feel comfortable at my curated Christmas, I can be myself in a way I might not with my extended family. The dressing up started off small \u2013 it was easy enough to coax everyone into a fake moustache and comedy teeth \u2013 but things have since escalated. My finest moment was luring everyone to a fancy-dress shop and convincing them to hire every historical costume they had. Watching my mum baste a giant ham dressed as Eleanor of Aquitaine is something I\u2019ll take to the grave. The Jehovah\u2019s Witness thing means one of my exes may never spend Christmas with his family, but he\u2019s made peace with that. The one who bore the brunt of the coal scuttle incident has never returned, and another is torn: for many, Christmas is family time, and he admits that spending it with mine can lead to moments of melancholy. Perhaps out of guilt, or inspired by our trips away, he is taking a sabbatical from this year\u2019s Exmas to go on holiday with his own mum. I hope he has a lovely time, but I fully expect him back in 2020 \u2013 and if he ever wants to bring his boyfriend, I\u2019m sure that would be fine. We grow up with stories where the ex is either a villain or the one that got away, but I\u2019ve found that to be a lie. Our beloved becomes the one: the one we love and the one we can\u2019t live without; meanwhile, the ones that got away should be able to come round for a wine whenever they like, although a text first would be nice. Like many gay people, when I left home I created a new \u201cchosen\u201d family. But it turns out I wasn\u2019t replacing my actual family, I was adding to it. Bringing both together at this time of year means I get to have my Christmas cake and eat it, too. \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>On the really painful days in politics, most commentary isn\u2019t worth the name. It\u2019s not analysis, it\u2019s score-settling; party political broadcasts for the I-told-you-so brigade, rushed out by people who won\u2019t admit to ever getting a single thing wrong themselves.</p> \n<p>So it will go this weekend. You\u2019ll read that Labour\u2019s wipeout was only down to Brexit, by those who won\u2019t admit a flaw in Jeremy Corbyn and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/five-reasons-why-labour-lost-the-election\" title=\"\">noodling mess</a> of a campaign. Or that it was all the Labour leader\u2019s fault, said by remainers who have seen the position they urged on him blown to bits. It was both, of course. Ask voters in those seats that have just gone blue for the first time since the 1930s, or the Labour would-bes who tried canvassing them. If you want to play election Cluedo, then Corbyn and Brexit go together like Colonel Mustard with the candlestick. But when a party descends into civil war, the factions at each others\u2019 throats rarely bother looking up at the rest of the country.</p> \n<p>To clear the decks, here\u2019s my confession. I never foresaw the scale of this wipeout \u2013 and what it spells for our already failing economy, fractured society and battered democracy frankly scares me. Yet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/labour-leave-voters-politics-general-election-brexit\" title=\"\">reporting I\u2019ve done</a> \u2013 both in this election and before \u2013 made me almost sure Labour was going to lose, and in precisely those areas that are all over the front pages. What were called its heartlands, at least until Thursday night. The Bolsovers, the Bishop Aucklands. The un-metropolitan, unfashionable, never-kissed-a-Tory land that would, as the old saw goes, elect a donkey if it wore a red rosette.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/working-class-voters-desert-labour-stoke-on-trent-england-red-wall\">Working-class voters desert Labour as 'red wall' crumbles</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And I can say with certainty that this week\u2019s meltdown is the culmination of trends that stretch back decades. They were Corbyn\u2019s poisoned inheritance, not his creation \u2013 but any leader who wants to win back those seats will have to deal with them better than he managed.</p> \n<p>For decades, their party took much of the north, the Midlands and Wales as its birthright. It was the \u201cred wall\u201d that would repel invading Tory forces. As one Labour county councillor in Derbyshire, the region that lost Dennis Skinner as an MP on Thursday night, told me: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/on-the-doorstep-labour-faces-the-question-who-do-you-speak-for\" title=\"\">They barely bothered to campaign</a>.\u201d While the party bigwigs threw their weight about, the mines and the manufacturers, the steel and the shipbuilding were snuffed out. With them went the culture of Labourism: the bolshy union stewards, the self-organised societies, most of the local newspapers. Practically any institution that might incubate a working-class provincial political identity was bulldozed.</p> \n<p>In North East Derbyshire last month, I saw up close what was left: warehouses and care work. Bullying bosses, zero-hours contracts, poverty pay and social security top-ups. Smartphones to tell you whether you have a shift that morning, and Facebook to give you the news, or some dishonest fragment of it.

      "bodyText": "On the really painful days in politics, most commentary isn\u2019t worth the name. It\u2019s not analysis, it\u2019s score-settling; party political broadcasts for the I-told-you-so brigade, rushed out by people who won\u2019t admit to ever getting a single thing wrong themselves. So it will go this weekend. You\u2019ll read that Labour\u2019s wipeout was only down to Brexit, by those who won\u2019t admit a flaw in Jeremy Corbyn and his noodling mess of a campaign. Or that it was all the Labour leader\u2019s fault, said by remainers who have seen the position they urged on him blown to bits. It was both, of course. Ask voters in those seats that have just gone blue for the first time since the 1930s, or the Labour would-bes who tried canvassing them. If you want to play election Cluedo, then Corbyn and Brexit go together like Colonel Mustard with the candlestick. But when a party descends into civil war, the factions at each others\u2019 throats rarely bother looking up at the rest of the country. To clear the decks, here\u2019s my confession. I never foresaw the scale of this wipeout \u2013 and what it spells for our already failing economy, fractured society and battered democracy frankly scares me. Yet the reporting I\u2019ve done \u2013 both in this election and before \u2013 made me almost sure Labour was going to lose, and in precisely those areas that are all over the front pages. What were called its heartlands, at least until Thursday night. The Bolsovers, the Bishop Aucklands. The un-metropolitan, unfashionable, never-kissed-a-Tory land that would, as the old saw goes, elect a donkey if it wore a red rosette. And I can say with certainty that this week\u2019s meltdown is the culmination of trends that stretch back decades. They were Corbyn\u2019s poisoned inheritance, not his creation \u2013 but any leader who wants to win back those seats will have to deal with them better than he managed. For decades, their party took much of the north, the Midlands and Wales as its birthright. It was the \u201cred wall\u201d that would repel invading Tory forces. As one Labour county councillor in Derbyshire, the region that lost Dennis Skinner as an MP on Thursday night, told me: \u201cThey barely bothered to campaign.\u201d While the party bigwigs threw their weight about, the mines and the manufacturers, the steel and the shipbuilding were snuffed out. With them went the culture of Labourism: the bolshy union stewards, the self-organised societies, most of the local newspapers. Practically any institution that might incubate a working-class provincial political identity was bulldozed. In North East Derbyshire last month, I saw up close what was left: warehouses and care work. Bullying bosses, zero-hours contracts, poverty pay and social security top-ups. Smartphones to tell you whether you have a shift that morning, and Facebook to give you the news, or some dishonest fragment of it. Across the UK, mines were turned into museums, factories swapped for call centres, meaningful local government replaced by development quangos. And what was Labour\u2019s response? Tony Blair and Gordon Brown pretended some new skills-based economy lay around the corner and parachuted their own chosen people into these safe seats. Thinktankers, union HQ bureaucrats, ex-student politicians: all found careers and weekend homes for themselves. David Miliband swung from the Institute for Public Policy Research to Blair\u2019s office to MP for South Shields \u2013 which, as a longstanding Labour parliamentarian told me yesterday morning, \u201che couldn\u2019t even find on a map\u201d. Last week Miliband claimed on Twitter: \u201cThe biggest Labour challenge is not the angst of the middle class \u2026 it is the disbelief of the working class.\u201d This tribune of the Tyneside proletariat now works 3,000 miles away at a New York-based charity that in 2017 reportedly paid him \u00a3680,000. What did such smooth-cheeked careerists offer their constituents? Head pats about the \u201cwhite working class\u201d and their \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d. Never mind that the working class might also be brown. Even as the working class were marginalised politically and destroyed economically, New Labour patronised them into apathy.

Some in Labour might well think they can win back seats by beating up on immigrants and tacking to the right: Johnson\u2019s party can do both with far more gusto. Corbynism began with promises of democracy, but ended up as bunkerised as all other Labour leaderships. What started as anti-austerity movement is now a melange of ideas, most of which look and sound utterly absurd on a doorstep on a rainy morning. In the era of taking back control, Corbyn offered yet more direction from Westminster, with utilities run from the centre and hundreds of billions disbursed from remote state institutions. Many of these ideas are interesting, but few of them were properly worked through and none patiently argued for. Giving workers stakes in firms, a green new deal, free broadband: each one came well-intentioned but bedecked in question marks. Any radicalism that fails to ask the really thorny questions isn\u2019t radical at all. In Britain in 2019, those include: against rampant inequality and climate change, what\u2019s the economy for?

Simon Stiell, Grenada\u2019s environment minister, speaking for AOSIS, urged all parties to reach a compromise. \u201cOur countries will be rendered uninsurable if we breach 1.5C warming,\u201d he said. There was a widespread view among delegates that Brazil was refusing to compromise on article 6 as a means of holding up implementation of the Paris accord. Brazil\u2019s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, is hostile to the Paris agreement, and is accused of paving the way for devastating fires set by ranchers in the Amazon, but the government is still officially a party to the UN talks.

And be willing to face the near-certainty of defeat, as the Senate appears unlikely to convict and remove Trump from office.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re ugly,\u201d Representative <strong>Steve Chabot</strong>, Republican of <strong>Ohio</strong>, said of the Senate proceedings. He would know, as a manager of former president Bill Clinton\u2019s trial two decades ago.</p> <p>Plenty of ambitious people are quietly jockeying for the job by writing Pelosi letters nominating themselves, spreading the word or just hoping their work impresses her.</p> <p>The eventual group picked seems certain to be diverse in race and gender, providing a contrast to the 13 white, male Republican lawmakers who prosecuted the case against Clinton. (Trump\u2019s defense at the trial will be conducted by his legal team, not lawmakers.) There\u2019ll also be a desire for a geographical spread.</p> <p>The Senate informs the House when the managers can present the articles of impeachment. The House prosecutors theatrically cross the Capitol and enter the Senate chamber, presided over by the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court\">supreme court</a></strong> chief justice <strong>John Roberts</strong> and populated with senators who act as the jury.</p> <p>The House members then read the resolution containing the articles and leave until the Senate invites them back for the trial.

But on Thursday, in arguments before the full court, a mix of 15 judges nominated by both Democrats and Republicans got into a spirited debate about Trump\u2019s business interests and whether the panel should have taken the unusual step of overturning Messitte\u2019s ruling allowing the lawsuit to move forward.</p> <p>Deputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan said the three-judge panel was within its authority to issue its ruling: \u201cWe think it is clear and indisputable that you cannot sue the president of the United States in his official capacity without at a minimum having an express statement authorizing such a suit by Congress.\u201d</p> <p>Judge James Wynn Jr grilled Mooppan about whether he was arguing that the judiciary has no remedy when a president violates the emoluments clause and that the president is above the law. Mooppan said Messitte committed \u201cmultiple, fundamental errors\u201d in refusing to dismiss the suit.</p> <p>Judge J Harvey Wilkinson III defended Trump\u2019s arguments during the hearing, saying the court cannot treat the case as if it\u2019s an \u201cordinary, run-of-the-mill case\u201d.</p> <p>He said the judiciary is \u201cseeking to assert over the presidency of the United States authority that has never been asserted or claimed before\u201d.</p> <p>In October, Trump\u2019s company said it is exploring the sale of the hotel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f60c54f3f8bf74dad8e62ce6336ad7e28d226184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f60c54f3f8bf74dad8e62ce6336ad7e28d226184/0_0_4989_3326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Trump International Hotel near sunset in Washington in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Trump International Hotel near sunset in Washington in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df391c08f08ecfcf97ffe15\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-13T13:56:06.560Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Committee votes on articles of impeachment</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></p> <p>Good morning, bewildered politics watchers, there has already been action on Capitol Hill this morning, so please do tune in for a lively Friday.</p> <ul> <li>The House judiciary committee <strong>just voted in favor</strong> of the two articles of <strong>impeachment</strong> against <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, setting the stage for a vote by the full House of Representatives next week to impeach the president.</li> <li>The back ground is that after 11pm ET last night, the judiciary chairman, <strong>Jerry Nadler</strong> (<strong>Democrat</strong> of New York), gaveled the 14-hour-plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/12/house-judiciary-committee-hearing-trump-impeachment\">tense hearing</a> closed <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/12/trump-impeachment-articles-house-judiciary-committee\">without a vote</a></strong> on the two <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/10/democrats-articles-of-impeachment-against-trump-five-takeaways\">articles</a> of </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry\">impeachment</a></strong> before them.</li> <li><strong>Republicans </strong><strong>erupted</strong> in shock and rage, but Nadler was clearly intent on avoiding being accused of holding a vote at dead of night when America wasn\u2019t watching.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Monday\u2019s blog: I was honestly just kidding when I predicted the rest of today would be quiet, but it was actually very quiet. Hope everyone has a restful weekend! Billionaire Mike Bloomberg buys CityLab but can\u2019t afford to keep more than half its staff. Maybe his campaign was just too busy (fake) dancing? Mayor Pete Buttigieg releases the names of the bundlers who have raised more than $25,000 for his campaign. Life is not fair. Apropos of nothing: In case you missed it, sketch comedy group the Upright Citizens Brigade dunked on both Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg by releasing a cringeworthy Bloomberg 2020 dance that was just dorktastic enough to challenge the Team Pete dance: Team Bloomberg was quick to disavow the dance... ...which led to some A+ commitment to the bit by comedians Nick Ciarelli and Brad Evans. It\u2019s really unclear how many people fully understand that this was joke, however, even after a full day. Because after all it\u2019s 2019 and the Internet is a hellscape. Mayor Pete Buttigieg has released the names of bundlers who have raised more than $25,000 for his Democratic presidential nominee bid as part of his promised transparency push: \u201cPete\u2019s campaign has been more transparent than any other campaign this cycle,\u201d his team claims. Here\u2019s the full list. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, weighs in on the supreme court deciding to take up the cases involving the financial records of President Trump: Here\u2019s a statement from the Democratic National Committee on the Unite Here Local 11 strike and the candidates threatening to boycott next week\u2019s debate over it: Billionaire and Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg has added CityLab to the growing roster at Bloomberg Media, and the first order of business for the billionaire - oh sorry, did we mention that already? - will be to lay off more than half the reporting staff. According to Mother Jones, Bloomberg Media will only bring seven people from the CityLab staff on board. CityLab, an offshoot website of the Atlantic, currently has about 13 full-time staff and three contractors. CityLab staff writer Kriston Capps made a point that this may not all be on Bloomberg. It appears that in this acquisition, the Atlantic preemptively laid off the ENTIRE staff. Now SOME can reapply for jobs. Some cannot. At first campaign visit to California, Bloomberg made a big deal about launching a \u201cwar on poverty\u201d. Hope that includes something for these laid-off reporters! Hey all, Vivian Ho with the west coast bureau taking over the blog for Joanna Walters. Since absolutely nothing newsworthy happened this week, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be in for a very quiet rest of the day. The US politics news has picked up considerably in the last couple of hours and there are likely to continue to be developments and reaction in the coming hours. My colleague on the west coast, Vivian Ho, will take over the blog now and bring you all the news. The main events of late have been: The US supreme court will take up three separate cases all dealing with Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to keep his tax returns and other financial details private, vs a New York prosecutor and congressional Democrats\u2019 efforts to expose them. Bernie Sanders has retracted his endorsement for the controversial Democratic congressional candidate Cenk Uygur, who is running to fill the seat in California formerly held by Katie Hill before she abruptly resigned. The Democratic 2020 candidates set to debate at Loyola Marymont University in Los Angeles next Thursday have threatened to boycott the event if they have to cross the picket lines of striking workers there. Six out of the seven had confirmed they will not cross the lines, and then the seventh, Amy Klobuchar, added herself to the list to make it unanimous. Looks like there\u2019ll need to be a new labor deal struck at the uni \u2013 or a new venue for the debate, which has already been moved once over a workers\u2019 dispute. Scramble! A New York prosecutor (Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr) and three congressional committees have tried all legal means to force Donald Trump to make public his financial information, especially his tax returns. So far unsuccessfully. Those running for president usually disclose their tax returns but Trump has resolutely refused to do so, first claiming during the 2016 campaign that they were being audited by the tax authorities, and therefore off limits. And later seeming to drop that spurious defense and simply use all legal tools at his disposal to defy subpoenas and demands and keep his monetary affairs private. As well as a matter of plain transparency, questions have swirled for years about the size of Trump\u2019s wealth and whether all his tax dealings are entirely above board, both in terms of the letter and spirit of the law. A federal judge in Manhattan in May ruled against Trump, in saying he wouldn\u2019t block recent Congressional subpoenas that are demanding his financial records from two banks, Deutsche Bank and Capitol One. And treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin defied a subpoena from the House ways and means committee. Now after the various appeals, the supreme court will take up the matter, hearing three separate cases involving similar issues. With Trump\u2019s appointments of Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, conservatives are in the ascendency on the bench and one might reasonably guess they are going to come down on the president\u2019s side - though not guaranteed, obviously. The court will hear three separate cases and when the Supremes rule in June, smack bang in the thick of the 2020 election campaign, as the Democrats head towards their party convention in July (the GOP convention is in August). The US supreme court said this afternoon that it will hear Donald Trump\u2019s pleas to keep his tax, bank and financial records private \u2013 a major tussle between the president and Congress that also could affect the 2020 presidential campaign. The justices are poised to issue decisions in June, amid Trump\u2019s bid for a second term, the AP writes. Rulings against the president could result in the quick release of personal financial information that Trump has sought strenuously to keep private. The court also will decide whether the Manhattan district attorney can obtain eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns as part of an ongoing criminal investigation. The US supreme court has agreed to hear subpoena fights over Donald Trump\u2019s financial records, with decisions expected by late June. More details to follow. Bernie Sanders has just retracted his endorsement for the controversial Democratic congressional candidate Cenk Uygur, who is running to fill the seat formerly held by Katie Hill before she resigned a few weeks ago. Sanders\u2019s retraction appears to be moot, as Sanders acknowledges that Uygur is rejecting all endorsements for his campaign. But this is another twister in a significant political storm, as there has been uproar about Uygur running for the seat of, of all people, Hill. Hill was obliged to resign from Congress over allegations of a rule-breaking sexual indiscretion, which she has denied, and an acknowledged previous affair with a campaign subordinate \u2013 all wrapped in an atrocious onslaught of digital bullying (aka revenge porn) from her ex that garnered criticism of a double standard in Washington for female politicians. And there had been growing disquiet about Sanders cozying up to Uygur with an endorsement yesterday. Uygur is a host of the TV commentary show Young Turks and has a long history of making wildly sexist comments. Jezebel called him \u201cgross\u201d earlier today. No surprise here, Senator Amy Klobuchar has just tweeted to confirm she also will not cross the picket line of striking workers at the university where the Democratic debate is due to be held next Thursday. That\u2019s now confirmed unanimity between the seven 2020 candidates due to debate at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles on 19 December. There is a workers\u2019 strike at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, the location of next week\u2019s Democratic debate \u2013 which has prompted, at this point, six of the seven candidates who\u2019ve qualified to participate, to threaten to boycott the event. They say they\u2019ll refuse to cross the picket line. Out of Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Tom Steyer, Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar, who are the seven who\u2019ve qualified for the debate, all but Klobuchar are saying this afternoon that they stand in solidarity with the workers and won\u2019t cross their picket line. Warren was first to announce her decision. The dispute between union cooks, dishwashers and servers at Loyola and Sodexo, the company that runs the school\u2019s food service, is the second labor action that has threatened the Thursday debate. In November, the Democratic National Committee moved the debate to Loyola from UCLA because of a contract dispute there involving the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, the Los Angeles Times reports. Out and about in New Hampshire Representative Ilhan Omar is out campaigning with Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire today, per her Twitter account. They\u2019re doing a town hall together. Sanders is talking about affordable housing and a Green New Deal to address the climate crisis. Sanders and Omar in New Hampshire \u2018The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is\u2019 On the campaign trail, Joe Biden is also talking about the climate crisis. He\u2019s also concerned about voting rights. Biden is in Texas today. He\u2019s also talking about healthcare and workers\u2019 rights. Union support Seven Democratic 2020 candidates are set to take the stage at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles next Thursday, likely just a day after the full House votes to impeach Donald Trump. Unfortunately, Cory Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro haven\u2019t made the debate requirements, as the threshold set by the party leadership, the Democratic National Committee, continues to rise both in terms of donations and minimum support in independent opinion polls. It will be Biden, Warren, Klobuchar, Sanders, Buttigieg, Yang and Steyer. Today, she\u2019s on the campaign trail in Florida but Amy Klobuchar is talking about the incessant flooding in Iowa and the climate crisis, not impeachment. Support for Klobuchar has been rising in the first voting state, Iowa, which holds its caucuses on 3 February, prior to the New Hampshire primary on 11 February. Another action-packed day in the politics blogosphere, do stay tuned. So far today: The House judiciary committee voted to approve articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his alleged political corruption in dealing with Ukraine. Democratic 2020 candidate Mike Bloomberg unveiled his campaign action plan to deal with the climate crisis. The full House of Representatives vote to impeach the president is expected to happen next Wednesday (one week from Christmas Day and just two days before Congress splits for the holidays) \u2013 at least on current expectations ... Donald Trump indicated that, officially at least, he doesn\u2019t care what form his impeachment trial takes as long as he can do what he wants and his lackeys kill it off quickly. Soccer mega star Megan Rapinoe endorsed Elizabeth Warren for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run for president. Democratic 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren hasn\u2019t been talking about impeachment today, she\u2019s been talking about the US opioids crisis and a government that\u2019s been hijacked by the rich and powerful. But in a splash of spirit on what\u2019s been a rather solemn Friday in politics, Warren just received the endorsement of soccer mega-hero, the award-winning Megan Rapinoe, according to this news on social media pointed out to me by my Guardian US senior politics reporter colleague Lauren Gambino. In this fascinating exchange by telephone, the two women share their mutual respect and admiration and Rapinoe says: \u201cConsider me TeamWarren,\u201d to which Warren responds: \u201cI think we got this, Megan.\u201d And in her other job ... multi-hatted ambassador Warren on the trail \u2018They\u2019re ugly\u2019 There\u2019s a campaign going on in Washington that even the most garrulous members of Congress aren\u2019t eager to talk about: to be part of a team of uncertain size, with a risky mission, to be named by a leader who isn\u2019t talking about what she\u2019s looking for or when she will decide. Welcome to the race within the House to win a spot on the Democratic team that will prosecute the impeachment case against Donald Trump, the AP writes. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is the sole decider, but she has offered no hints as the impeachment saga accelerates toward an expected vote next week by the full House and, in January, a Senate trial. \u201cWhen the time is right, you\u2019ll know who the people are,\u201d she told reporters Thursday. The impeachment managers will have to withstand the scrutiny and risk of prosecuting the case against Trump from the floor of the Republican-held Senate, before a global audience. And be willing to face the near-certainty of defeat, as the Senate appears unlikely to convict and remove Trump from office. \u201cThey\u2019re ugly,\u201d Representative Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio, said of the Senate proceedings. He would know, as a manager of former president Bill Clinton\u2019s trial two decades ago. Plenty of ambitious people are quietly jockeying for the job by writing Pelosi letters nominating themselves, spreading the word or just hoping their work impresses her. The eventual group picked seems certain to be diverse in race and gender, providing a contrast to the 13 white, male Republican lawmakers who prosecuted the case against Clinton. (Trump\u2019s defense at the trial will be conducted by his legal team, not lawmakers.) There\u2019ll also be a desire for a geographical spread. The Senate informs the House when the managers can present the articles of impeachment. The House prosecutors theatrically cross the Capitol and enter the Senate chamber, presided over by the supreme court chief justice John Roberts and populated with senators who act as the jury. The House members then read the resolution containing the articles and leave until the Senate invites them back for the trial. The prosecutors, possibly assisted by outside counsel, present the evidence against Trump and respond to any of the president\u2019s lawyers or senators. Most of what Donald Trump just said in the Oval Office about impeachment add up to utter rubbish, so rather than fan those flames, we\u2019ll limit it to the most useful quote, when he was asked by pool reporters: \u201cDo you prefer a long Senate trial or a short one?\u201d The president said: \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I want. Look there is \u2013 we did nothing wrong. So I\u2019ll do long, or short. I\u2019ve heard Mitch, I\u2019ve heard Lindsey. I think they are very much in agreement on some concept.\u201d He\u2019s referring first to the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who will play a leading role in the expected impeachment trial, and bleated outrageously towards the base on Fox News last night that, basically, he will play it any way Trump wants and reckons there is zero chance of Trump not being acquitted. And Lindsey refers, of course, to the Republican Senator and prominent Trump cheerleader Lindsey Graham, who wants to kill off the impeachment process as quickly as possible after it reaches the Senate. The president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was spotted arriving at the White House this morning not long before the impeachment vote on Capitol Hill, fresh from beetling around Ukraine gathering evidence against Democrats inside his and Donald Trump\u2019s alternative universe. Donald Trump, in the Oval Office, just told reporters he \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind a long, or short impeachment trial\u201d. That congressional trial is expected to take place in the Republican-dominated Senate early next year, after the House almost certainly votes next week to impeach Trump over his dealings with Ukraine, which have been allegedly a threat to national security and the integrity of the US election process. There\u2019s been debate about whether Republicans in the Senate should try to engineer a substantial trial, with witnesses and cross examination, etc, in order to lay out a fierce defense of Trump, or try to dismiss the whole impeachment thing without such drama. The outcome either way is almost inevitable \u2013 the Senate will not vote to oust Trump from office. The reporters\u2019 pool from the White House reports that Trump added: \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad thing for our country but it seems to be very good for me politically.\u201d Republicans are banking on the impeachment decision backfiring on Democrats. Trump also said: \u201cIt\u2019s a witch-hunt. It\u2019s a sham. It\u2019s a hoax ... to be using this for a perfect phone call ... It\u2019s a scam ... You\u2019re trivializing impeachment. The people are disgusted.\u201d It should be noted that the country is almost evenly split but with the slight though clear majority being those who are so disgusted by the president\u2019s actions in relation to Ukraine that they support impeachment. Fewer are more disgusted by the fact of him being impeached (though all may be forgiven for feeling disturbed and depressed by the whole sorry state of affairs!). Trump was meeting with Paraguay\u2019s president, Mario Abdo, and accompanying, looking awkward on a sofa to Trump\u2019s left, were the vice-president, Mike Pence, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Committee voted today, not yesterday after a longer than expected debate, but here are the steps going forward. C\u2019mon, man! As Uncle Joe would say. Listen, Jake, the Beatles may be working class music royalty but, dispirited progressives on either side of the Atlantic, of all the things you could do, do not \u201cLet it be!\u201d Feel free to tweet me with your alternative Beatles lyric of the day @JoannaWalters13. It might even be preferable to shout: \u201cHelp, I need somebody, help!\u201d But fighting talk is preferred ... The House rules committee said this morning that it plans to meet on Tuesday to establish procedures for the full House of Representatives to follow when it considers two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump next week. The panel\u2019s meeting, set for 11am ET, sets the stage for a debate before the full House of Representatives that is likely to begin on the floor on Wednesday, Reuters writes. The committee generally sets the terms for House debates the day before action on the House floor. So, as mentioned earlier, so far the vote can be expected to take place on Wednesday, but that\u2019s not set in stone. Trump is charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in the two articles of impeachment. The first relates to his pressuring the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, by withholding crucial military aid and effectively dangling an Oval Office meeting in return for Ukraine publicly investigating Trump\u2019s 2020 US election Democratic rival Joe Biden, whose son Hunter previously sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company despite not having specialist expertise in that industrial sector. The second relates to Trump doing a very effective job at blocking most aides and administration officials from testifying to the impeachment inquiry in the House and defying subpoenas both to appear as witnesses and hand over documents and other evidence relating to the president\u2019s allegedly corrupt dealings with Ukraine. Here\u2019s a reminder of the origins of the US impeachment process. Recent 2020 candidate, squillionaire and former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg is campaigning in Virginia today and has just fired a shot across the bow of his more progressive rivals, such as, most notably, US Senators Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Bernie Sanders (Vermont), in relation to the UK election. Britain\u2019s hard-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, went down to a heavy, heavy defeat against Conservative Boris \u201cget Brexit done\u201d Johnson last night. Bloomberg talked about the environment this morning in Alexandria, Va. Never the twain shall meet? Some official reaction to the impeachment vote in committee. The Democratic National Committee chair, Tom Perez: Evidence that Trump committed multiple impeachable offenses \u2013 abusing the official powers of the Oval Office and obstructing Congress \u2013 is overwhelming and irrefutable. To preserve our democracy for now, and for future generations, our Constitution must be upheld. Congress must fulfill its constitutional obligation and move forward to hold the president accountable.\u201d White House press office response: Where\u2019s the Christmas spirit? Helpful summary: The House rules committee has outlined the schedule for the impeachment vote next week. Following the vote to approve articles of impeachment by the judiciary committee earlier this morning, the full House of Representatives will meet next week to debate amendments to the articles on Tuesday, then vote on the floor on Wednesday. This is now the expectation, though the committee was expected to vote at around 12.30pm yesterday and ended up almost 12 hours later abruptly deciding not to vote until the following morning. So these schedules may not be set in stone. Not speaking to each other Voting to impeach Nadler declares \u2018sad day\u2019 The House judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, said of the vote an hour ago to approve two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump: \u201cToday is a solemn and sad day. For the third time in a little over a century and a half, the House judiciary committee has voted articles of impeachment against the president - for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House will act expeditiously. Thank you.\u201d The delayed vote was swift and sure this morning, 23 for, 17 against. The ranking Republican Doug Collins was incandescent when Nadler suddenly gaveled the marathon hearing closed after 11pm last night without the crucial vote. He studiously avoided eye contact with the chairman as the two took their seats for this morning\u2019s vote, cheek by jowl with each other, shortly after 10am. Nadler similarly ignored Collins. The cold shoulders spoke volumes. Recent 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg has just unveiled a climate plan to slash US carbon emissions by 50% in 10 years, by slapping tougher pollution standards on new gas-fired power plants and replacing coal with cleaner energy sources, such as wind and solar. The plan catches the billionaire former New York City mayor up to a crowded field of Democratic presidential hopefuls that have already detailed aggressive plans to eliminate US greenhouse gas emissions, Reuters writes. The move taps into what has become a crucial issue for Democratic voters. Bloomberg announced his candidacy last month, putting him among 15 Democrats vying to take on Republican candidate Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. \u201cThe president refuses to lead on climate change, so the rest of us must,\u201d Bloomberg said in a release. Trump is thoroughly skeptical about the science of the human-caused climate emergency, and has rolled back climate regulations. He has also withdrawn the United States from the landmark Paris Agreement \u2013 the international accord to fight global heating, following through on his 2017 announcement. Bloomberg\u2019s plan would target 80% clean energy by 2028, and would be the first of several schemes to move the country toward 100% clean energy as fast as possible, ideally before 2045, his campaign said. It would do so by setting stringent pollution limits on new gas-fired plants, and by ending all subsidies for fossil fuels. Meanwhile, it would create incentives to improve clean-energy technology and invest in poor communities impacted by fossil fuel pollution, or that are struggling to transition to a cleaner energy economy. Read the latest on the House committee vote here: The Trump administration and China are close to finalizing a modest trade agreement that would suspend tariffs that are set to kick in Sunday, de-escalating their 17-month trade war. \u201cWe\u2019re close to a deal,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s head of international affairs, who has been briefed by both sides, the AP writes. Brilliant said the administration has agreed to suspend Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese imports Sunday and to reduce existing tariffs, though it wasn\u2019t clear by how much. In return, Beijing would buy more US farm products, increase Americans companies\u2019 access to the Chinese market and tighten protection for intellectual property rights. The deal awaits final approval from Donald Trump and China has not yet shown its hand, so we need to tread cautiously. The Chinese have just postponed a press briefing. Trump tweeted early yesterday: \u201cGetting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China. They want it, and so do we!\u201d\u2019 Beijing had threatened to retaliate if Trump proceeded with plans to raise tariffs on $160 billion of Chinese imports Sunday. The two sides are negotiating a so-called Phase 1 agreement as part of the effort to resolve their sprawling trade dispute. Still, the truce leaves unsettled the toughest and most complex issues that have divided the two sides.

A divided federal appeals court spent more than three hours Thursday sparring over whether Donald Trump is illegally profiting from the presidency through his luxury Washington hotel. The state of Maryland and the District of Columbia asked 15 judges on the fourth US circuit court of appeals to reconsider a ruling by a three-judge panel directing a federal judge in Maryland to dismiss their lawsuit against the president, the Associated Press writes. The two jurisdictions allege Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the constitution by accepting profits through foreign and domestic officials who stay at the Trump International hotel, which sits rather majestically in a historic building on Pennsylvania Avenue and has become the \u201csee and be seen\u201d venue for Trump allies in the capital. Maryland\u2019s Aattorney general, Brian Frosh, and district attorney general, Karl Racine, have argued that hotels in their jurisdictions suffer \u201ccompetitive injury\u201d because officials hoping to curry favor with the president are more likely to stay at his hotel. A three-judge panel of the fourth circuit ruled in July that the two jurisdictions lack standing to pursue their claims against the president and granted a rare writ of mandamus, directing US district court Jjudge Peter Messitte to throw out the lawsuit. The three judges on the panel who ruled in Trump\u2019s favor were all nominated by Republican presidents. But on Thursday, in arguments before the full court, a mix of 15 judges nominated by both Democrats and Republicans got into a spirited debate about Trump\u2019s business interests and whether the panel should have taken the unusual step of overturning Messitte\u2019s ruling allowing the lawsuit to move forward. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan said the three-judge panel was within its authority to issue its ruling: \u201cWe think it is clear and indisputable that you cannot sue the president of the United States in his official capacity without at a minimum having an express statement authorizing such a suit by Congress.\u201d Judge James Wynn Jr grilled Mooppan about whether he was arguing that the judiciary has no remedy when a president violates the emoluments clause and that the president is above the law. Mooppan said Messitte committed \u201cmultiple, fundamental errors\u201d in refusing to dismiss the suit. Judge J Harvey Wilkinson III defended Trump\u2019s arguments during the hearing, saying the court cannot treat the case as if it\u2019s an \u201cordinary, run-of-the-mill case\u201d. He said the judiciary is \u201cseeking to assert over the presidency of the United States authority that has never been asserted or claimed before\u201d. In October, Trump\u2019s company said it is exploring the sale of the hotel. Good morning, bewildered politics watchers, there has already been action on Capitol Hill this morning, so please do tune in for a lively Friday. The House judiciary committee just voted in favor of the two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, setting the stage for a vote by the full House of Representatives next week to impeach the president. The back ground is that after 11pm ET last night, the judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler (Democrat of New York), gaveled the 14-hour-plus tense hearing closed without a vote on the two articles of impeachment before them. Republicans erupted in shock and rage, but Nadler was clearly intent on avoiding being accused of holding a vote at dead of night when America wasn\u2019t watching. The vote had been expected yesterday morning! The committee moments ago voted to approve two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It\u2019s the equivalent of congressional indictments for high crimes and misdemeanors, almost certainly triggering a Senate trial in January. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is expected to make an official announcement today about progress in the direction of a trade deal with China. He signed off on a tentative agreement yesterday, though the Chinese were silent. And we have been to this brink before only for Trump to retreat, so expect it when you see it, folks.

      "bodyText": "A 15-year-old indigenous boy has been murdered in Brazil on the edge of a heavily deforested indigenous reserve in the state of Maranh\u00e3o, on the fringes of the Amazon. The murder, the fourth from the Guajajara tribe in recent weeks, came as a wave of racist abuse against indigenous people swept social media in the state. The Indigenous Missionary Council(CIMI), a non-profit group reported that Erisvan Soares Guajajara\u2019s body was found with knife wounds on Friday in Amarante do Maranh\u00e3o. The group said he had travelled to the town, on the edge of the Ararib\u00f3ia indigenous reserve, with his father. The G1 news site reported that a non-indigenous man called Roberto Silva, 31, was also killed with Erisvan and that both died in the early hours of Friday at a party in an area called Vila Industrial. \u201cAnother brutal crime against the Guajajara people,\u201d tweeted Sonia Guajajara, a leader from the same tribe and reserve who is executive coordinator of Brazilian indigenous association ABIP. \u201cEveryone who doesn\u2019t like us feels allowed to kill because they know impunity rules. It\u2019s time to say ENOUGH.\u201d Murders of indigenous people soared 23% in 2018, according to CIMI figures, and land invasions have risen since far-right president Jair Bolsonaro took office in January. He has compared indigenous people living on reserves to \u201cprehistoric men\u201d and said their lands should be developed. In a statement, the state government of Maranh\u00e3o said preliminary investigations indicated \u201cthe crime was not motivated by hate, land disputes or deforestation in indigenous reserves\u201d. Brazil\u2019s indigenous agency Funai said it was following the case. Erisvan lived in the Ararib\u00f3ia indigenous reserve, which has been decimated by loggers. A group of Guajajara forest guardians expelled loggers from the reserve but have faced threats and violent attacks. In November, the guardian Paulo Paulino Guajajara was killed by loggers in an ambush and another, La\u00e9rcio Guajajara, was shot and injured. Loggers in illegal vehicles operate openly around Amarante yet police rarely intervene. \u201cThere is a lot of racism against indigenous in Amarante,\u201d said Gilderlan Rodrigues, CIMI\u2019s Maranh\u00e3o coordinator. The group said Erisvan\u2019s family refuted comments by local police linking the killings to the drug trade. Last Saturday, two Guajajara leaders \u2013 Firmino Silvino Guajajara and Raimundo Bernice Guajajara \u2013 were shot and killed in a drive-by shooting on a highway in the nearby Cana Brava indigenous reserve in the same state. Two others were injured. The men were returning from a meeting when a group of men in a white car opened fire. A Funai official said the killing could have been related to frequent robberies on the highway which crosses the reserve but Maranh\u00e3o\u2019s human rights society blamed rising prejudice. Since then a wave of racist abuse has swept social media in the region. \u201cThose who fired should have killed at least 50,\u201d said one local on a WhatsApp group. \u201cThe government should throw a bomb and exterminate these disgraceful indigenous,\u201d said another. \u201cThese are common people \u2026 inciting crimes against indigenous people,\u201d said \u00c9rika Nogueira, the director of the Ascalwa indigenous association. \u201cThat is what is most worrying, it is civil society.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It is surely no coincidence Keeper Hill (1.55) showed so much improvement after a wind operation when he scored at Haydock last month. He battled on gamely to give 11lb and a beating to a higher-rated horse, an effort that left his previous handful of chase runs far behind. Today\u2019s Caspian Caviar Gold Cup is a very different test but he may be suited by having a strong pace to follow and odds of 16-1 surely understate his chance. Brelan D\u2019As, second here last month, ought to go close again, while Generous Day could be the each-way value at 20-1. Cepage has been raised 8lb for running second at Aintree last month, which seems harsh. Good Man Pat may get involved if his jumping holds up. 2.10 Doncaster Unexpectedly, Sam Spinner has a perfect record after his first two races over fences and that, combined with his achievements over hurdles, has made him a short price for this Grade Two. He is not a natural steeplechaser and his limitations should be exposed by Windsor Avenue. 2.30 Cheltenham The terms of this race hardly favour Valtor, who meets Redford Road on 8lb worse terms than when beating that rival by two lengths last month. But he will be sharper here and the extra quarter-mile ought to help. Though older than the rest, he has a lot of talent and experience for a novice hurdle. 2.45 Doncaster Tombee Du Ciel represents connections who have won this twice in the past five years and has achieved a good level of form in France without winning. But he has not run since April and preference is for Lord Lamington, who had plenty in hand when scoring on his hurdles debut at Market Rasen nine days ago. 3.05 Cheltenham There is every reason to think Pentland Hills is the real deal, for all that we have only seen him three times over hurdles and he was an unexpected winner of the Triumph. His defeat of Fakir D\u2019Oudairies at Aintree already reads well and he is the one in this field who could be a serious Champion Hurdle contender. Le Patriote travelled well for a long way on his reappearance and looks a danger. Elixir De Nutz\u2019s form is questionable. 3.20 Doncaster If he is to make the cut for the Grand National, Cloth Cap had better win something before the weights are set in mid-February and opportunities will not come much better than this four-runner affair. 3.40 Cheltenham Capping what could be a good day for Nicky Henderson, Lust For Glory is expected to build on her handicap debut at Ascot last month, when she stayed on well but too late into second. This extra half-mile looks the right move.",
