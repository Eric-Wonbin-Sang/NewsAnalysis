      "body": "<p><strong>Harold</strong> <strong>Macmillan</strong><strong> and John </strong><strong>Selwyn Lloyd</strong></p> <p>If ever there was an example of the ongoing feud between the households at 10 and 11 Downing Street it was under the Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan (1957-63). As with the dispute between the Treasury and Boris Johnson/Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s desire for higher public spending and faster growth was the root cause. Two of Macmillan\u2019s chancellors, Peter Thorneycroft and Derick Heathcoat-Amory, resigned. Their successor, John Selwyn Lloyd, lasted longer \u2013 nearly two years \u2013 before being fired. Indeed Macmillan was at odds with No 11 most of the time, preferring the advice of the Oxford economist Roy Harrod, in effect his unofficial adviser.</p> <p><strong>Edward Heath and Anthony Barber</strong></p> <p>A prime minister\u2019s desire to dominate his chancellor was achieved most fully in practice in Heath\u2019s government. His first chancellor, Iain Macleod, died within a month and his successor Barber (1970-74), whose main interest was tax reform, found himself dominated by Heath when it came to macroeconomic policy. Heath\u2019s decision to speed up the pace of public spending and \u201cgo for growth\u201d in reaction to what was then considered the high level of unemployment marked the first appearance of the phrase U-turn. The Tory manifesto of 1970 had said public expenditure needed cutting back. Heath became his own chancellor, with unhappy results .</p> <p><strong>Harold Wilson and James Callaghan</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05bf258ba8b5bcaf570c64506bfdfb6e97314cc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05bf258ba8b5bcaf570c64506bfdfb6e97314cc4/48_53_2467_3084/800.jpg\" alt=\".\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harold Wilson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dissatisfaction with the Treasury was rife in the first Wilson government of 1964-70 - so much so that the Department of Economic Affairs was set up under Wilson\u2019s deputy George Brown as a rival to Jim Callaghan\u2019s Treasury. The thinking was that the Treasury was too cautious and a restraint on economic growth. It was the decade of two National Plans, aimed at faster growth.

      "bodyText": "Harold Macmillan and John Selwyn Lloyd If ever there was an example of the ongoing feud between the households at 10 and 11 Downing Street it was under the Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan (1957-63). As with the dispute between the Treasury and Boris Johnson/Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s desire for higher public spending and faster growth was the root cause. Two of Macmillan\u2019s chancellors, Peter Thorneycroft and Derick Heathcoat-Amory, resigned. Their successor, John Selwyn Lloyd, lasted longer \u2013 nearly two years \u2013 before being fired. Indeed Macmillan was at odds with No 11 most of the time, preferring the advice of the Oxford economist Roy Harrod, in effect his unofficial adviser. Edward Heath and Anthony Barber A prime minister\u2019s desire to dominate his chancellor was achieved most fully in practice in Heath\u2019s government. His first chancellor, Iain Macleod, died within a month and his successor Barber (1970-74), whose main interest was tax reform, found himself dominated by Heath when it came to macroeconomic policy. Heath\u2019s decision to speed up the pace of public spending and \u201cgo for growth\u201d in reaction to what was then considered the high level of unemployment marked the first appearance of the phrase U-turn. The Tory manifesto of 1970 had said public expenditure needed cutting back. Heath became his own chancellor, with unhappy results . Harold Wilson and James Callaghan Dissatisfaction with the Treasury was rife in the first Wilson government of 1964-70 - so much so that the Department of Economic Affairs was set up under Wilson\u2019s deputy George Brown as a rival to Jim Callaghan\u2019s Treasury. The thinking was that the Treasury was too cautious and a restraint on economic growth. It was the decade of two National Plans, aimed at faster growth. However, Callaghan\u2019s 1964-67 chancellorship was chronically impeded by Wilson\u2019s decision in 1964 not to devalue the pound until the event was forced on him by the markets in 1967. This crucial prime ministerial decision also foiled the work of the Department of Economic Affairs. It was wound up.

      "bodyText": "One of the characteristics that made Wales successful under Warren Gatland was their power of recovery. In the 12 years the New Zealander was in charge they suffered successive defeats in a Six Nations campaign three times and an early test for his successor, Wayne Pivac, is how the champions respond to last Saturday\u2019s defeat to Ireland in Dublin. \u201cWe have lost one game but it is not all over,\u201d says the Wales full\u2011back, Leigh Halfpenny, whose return to form after missing half of last season with concussion has helped conceal the absence of the injured Liam Williams. \u201cWe can still win the title. We lost our first game in 2013 to Ireland and then won the rest to retain the championship so we know we are still in the hunt.\u201d France arrive in Cardiff on Saturday armed with one of Gatland\u2019s former lieutenants, Shaun Edwards. Not only do the hosts have to win to retain an interest in the title before their trip to Twickenham in the following round, but to prevent unfavourable early comparisons between the two regimes. Gatland tasted Six Nations success in Dublin with Wales twice and two years ago lost in a match similar to last Saturday\u2019s, outplayed for the most part but in with a chance of sneaking victory until conceding a late try. But he oversaw a defeat by France in Cardiff once, in 2010. Six years ago, Wales were beaten 26-3 in Ireland in the second round and recovered to overcome France by 21 points at home two weeks later. \u201cIt means focusing on ourselves and working hard on the training field to put right what went wrong in Dublin,\u201d says Halfpenny. \u201cWe know we have to put in a performance against France.

It uses tax havens, and critics say its executive salaries are too high and its accounts are opaque.</p> <p>In 2011, the then secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell, set out a new vision for CDC, pledging to make it more \u201csocially and environmentally responsible\u201d, with fewer investments in \u201charmful tax regimes\u201d and greater transparency.

      "bodyText": "A government development corporation that invests billions of pounds in Asia and Africa stands accused of squandering public money and failing to make a difference to poverty levels \u2013 charges it strongly rejects. CDC, formerly known as the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which was set up by Clement Attlee in 1948 and is wholly owned by the Department for International Development (DfID), has provided \u201clittle to no evidence that \u2026 it is making an impact in terms of tackling poverty, providing genuinely additional resources or making effective use of government resources,\u201d according to a new report. In the past, the corporation, which has invested in luxury hotels, shopping centres, gated communities and private hospitals, has been accused of favouring high financial returns on its investments over tackling poverty. It uses tax havens, and critics say its executive salaries are too high and its accounts are opaque. In 2011, the then secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell, set out a new vision for CDC, pledging to make it more \u201csocially and environmentally responsible\u201d, with fewer investments in \u201charmful tax regimes\u201d and greater transparency. He was concerned that too much money was going to private equity intermediaries, with the result that not enough was going to development projects. But in 2019, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact gave the CDC an \u201camber/red\u201d rating, finding that it had produced an \u201cunsatisfactory achievement in most areas\u201d. And, according to Doing More Harm Than Good \u2013 a new report from Global Justice Now, a social justice organisation \u2013 CDC, which in 2016 saw its potential investment budget increase from \u00a31.5bn to \u00a36bn, remains a cause for concern. The report says that, despite Mitchell\u2019s reforms, which were designed to reduce the amount of money being siphoned off by intermediaries, CDC today invests an annual \u00a32bn via private equity funds compared with \u00a31.9bn in 2011. Of the investments in which CDC owns more than 20%, two-thirds are based in tax havens \u2013 something that the institution insists is necessary to stop it being taxed twice, but which campaigners say is a cause for concern. \u201cCDC has demonstrated a near-total resistance to reform by continuing to make more profit than it should and by channelling its investments through tax havens,\u201d said Daniel Willis, an aid and climate campaigner at Global Justice Now and co-author of the report. \u201cThis \u2018market knows best\u2019 approach to development uses aid money to facilitate the extraction of wealth from the global south to the global north \u2013 the exact opposite to what any institution with a development mandate should be doing.\u201d Global Justice Now highlighted several CDC investments which it said were a concern. These include the Abraaj Growth Markets Health Fund, which invests in private healthcare institutions around the world, and Bridge International Academies, a low-cost private school chain with significant operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda. The report states: \u201cOur research has found numerous issues with Bridge schools, including exclusion of poor and disadvantaged children; violation of health and safety and labour conditions; and a severe lack of transparency and accountability. The situation became so serious that authorities in Kenya and Uganda actually tried to stop the schools operating.\u201d A spokesperson for Bridge said the research referred to in the report dated from 2016 and claimed that it had refuted the allegations, adding: \u201cWe have educated a million children living in extreme poverty; consistently outperform national averages in government exams and have been independently shown to deliver equity of learning.\u201d CDC has also invested in a company which operates coal-burning cement factories in east Africa, one that owns a petroleum pipeline in Cameroon, and another that owns an oil-burning power plant in Benin.

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp says he feels for Pep Guardiola and his Manchester City players after Liverpool\u2019s closest rivals were handed a two-year ban from the Champions League. The Reds manager was speaking from a place of comfort after his side pulled 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League thanks to a 1-0 victory at Norwich thanks to a goal from substitute Sadio Man\u00e9. Uefa\u2019s decision to ban City from European competition for contravening financial fair play and misleading European football\u2019s governing body sent shockwaves across football on Friday. But while Klopp insisted he was not across the details of events off the field he showed solidarity with his fierce competitor on it. \u201cIt was a shock when I heard [the news]\u201a\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI saw the headline but I have no idea how these kind of things work, how [a punishment like City\u2019s] happens. What I can say, as a football coach, is that under Pep Guardiola City play sensational football. I have always admired what they do and how they do it. \u201cTo be honest I feel for Pep and the players. Wow. They did, for sure, nothing wrong. They just played football and sensational football. Wherever Pep was he has helped each league to improve. But then in the end we all have to respect some rules and I have no idea if they did or not.\u201d Klopp revealed that Man\u00e9 had been fit to start against Norwich after returning from a hamstring injury but he had chosen to keep the Senegalese forward on the bench with Wednesday\u2019s Champions League fixture against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in mind. \u201cSadio could have started today, of course, but I wanted to have a free decision for Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "Retweeting a New York Times piece which quoted Ralph Waldo Emerson \u2013 shortly after retweeting footage of a small-town mayor inadvertently live-broadcasting a visit to the toilet, thereby mixing low culture with high \u2013 Donald Trump seemed to confirm on Saturday that his campaign for re-election will be fuelled by \u201cgrievance, persecution and resentment\u201d. Quoting Times White House correspondent Peter Baker, Trump wrote: \u201cRalph Waldo Emerson seemed to foresee the lesson of the Senate Impeachment Trial of President Trump. \u2018When you strike at the King, Emerson famously said, \u2018you must kill him.\u2019 \u201cMr Trump\u2019s foes struck at him but did not take him down. A triumphant Mr Trump emerges from the biggest test of his presidency emboldened, ready to claim exoneration, and take his case of grievance, persecution and resentment to the campaign trail.\u201d Trump chose to pass his own comment only with a familiar claim about his impeachment and the Russia investigation before it, writing: \u201cThe Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!\u201d Baker\u2019s piece was published on 1 February, four days before Trump\u2019s acquittal in the third impeachment trial in US history. It was headlined: While stained in history, Trump will emerge from trial triumphant and unshackled. Two weeks later, that prediction seems to have been born out. Trump faced two articles of impeachment, concerning abuse of power in his attempts to have Ukraine investigate political rivals and obstruction of Congress in its own investigation of the matter. The Republican-held Senate rejected attempts to hear testimony from witnesses and acquitted the president with only one GOP vote against, that of Mitt Romney of Utah, a longtime Trump opponent. Since then, the president has called his impeachment \u201cbullshit\u201d; criticised Romney; fired a White House aide and an ambassador who gave testimony in the impeachment inquiry; and admitted sending Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden, the matter at the heart of his impeachment which he previously denied. Trump has also seemed to interfere in the sentencing of Roger Stone, his adviser who was convicted under special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Moscow and possible obstruction of justice by the president. Stoking fears of a constitutional crisis, Trump has claimed the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to interfere in justice department affairs. Critics have said that indicates he thinks presidents are essentially kings, above the law, a view arguably reinforced by his attorney general although William Barr was moved this week to put at least tactical distance between himself and his raging president. Emerson, a great American essayist of the 19th century, wrote his line about striking at kings when a pupil, the future supreme court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, attempted to refute Plato. Trump\u2019s other early retweet on Saturday was of a message which said: \u201cTHIS IS HILARIOUS Mayor of Georgetown in the US excused himself to go &amp; use the washroom in the middle of a meeting &amp; forgot to switch off his mic on his tie &amp; this is what happened.\u201d The event in question, replete with farting noises and giggling council members, happened in Georgetown, Texas in 2016. The mayor, Dale Ross, pronounced himself \u201cnot particularly embarrassed\u201d. Trump was in Florida, due to attend the Daytona 500 motor race on Sunday and act as grand marshal and starter in a play to his political base. It was reported that the president was planning a lap of the circuit in the Beast, his heavily armoured limousine. Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer indicated one motivation for attending the famous Daytona race, as his boss George W Bush did in 2004, another election year. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of positive, overwhelming affirmation to hear the roar of the crowd,\u201d Fleischer told the Associated Press. \u201cWhat politician doesn\u2019t want that? \u201cSecondly, there\u2019s what I call the reverberation effect. People watching at home, who hear the roar of the crowd for a president, that can drive them toward some sense of approval or fondness or liking for the president.\u201d On Saturday morning, Trump also repeated Fox News criticism of the decision not to pursue charges against Andrew McCabe, who the president fired as deputy director of the FBI in March 2018, two days before his scheduled retirement.",

But another MP said: \u201cThe question is, if Starmer wins, what will he do then? Who he appoints to the shadow cabinet will be the first big signal.\u201d</p> <p>At yesterday\u2019s hustings, Long-Bailey was the only remaining candidate who would grant the Scottish parliament legal powers to hold a second independence referendum, saying that to refuse this \u201cwould drive more of our voters into the arms of the Scottish National party\u201d.</p> <p>Starmer did not rule out the possibility, saying: \u201cIt is an interesting question, but we shouldn\u2019t get sucked into that.

I know we don\u2019t agree all the time, and our visions are probably very different, but we meet on areas of common ground, and that\u2019s what would make us a strong shadow cabinet and I would have Keir and Lisa in my shadow cabinet.\u201d Nandy indicated that she would also welcome both rivals to serve under her, saying she would be \u201cproud to serve alongside these two\u201d. Thornberry was knocked out of the contest after failing to reach the necessary threshold of support from local parties or Labour affiliates. At a deadline of midnight on Friday, she had 31 nominations from local constituency parties, two short of the 33 needed, and had failed to receive any nominations from affiliates. Starmer, Long-Bailey and Nandy had already met the requirement to get on to the ballot papers, which will go out to party members in the next few days. Starmer\u2019s remarks came, as behind the scenes, MPs from the right and left of the party advanced their own demands for a new shadow cabinet. Critics of the Corbyn project said that if the next leader did not signal a clear departure from the recent past by placing figures such as Yvette Cooper, Hilary Benn and Rachel Reeves in key posts, then Labour would have \u201clearnt nothing\u201d from its disastrous election defeat in December. This wing would like to see Cooper as shadow home secretary, Reeves as shadow chancellor, and Benn as shadow foreign secretary. \u201cIf we do not make these kinds of appointments under Starmer or whoever it is, then we are saying we do not want to win elections, full stop,\u201d said one former minister. But leftwing MPs sympathetic to Corbyn were also flexing their muscles, saying that if Corbynites like Long-Bailey are excluded members will rise up in protest. \u201cThey will not put up with a move back to New Labour and centrism,\u201d said one MP. \u201cWe will have a party that is completely divided again between the majority of the parliamentary party and the majority of the membership.\u201d Throughout the contest, Starmer has pitched his campaign to the left in order not to alienate members, who have the final say. But another MP said: \u201cThe question is, if Starmer wins, what will he do then? Who he appoints to the shadow cabinet will be the first big signal.\u201d At yesterday\u2019s hustings, Long-Bailey was the only remaining candidate who would grant the Scottish parliament legal powers to hold a second independence referendum, saying that to refuse this \u201cwould drive more of our voters into the arms of the Scottish National party\u201d. Starmer did not rule out the possibility, saying: \u201cIt is an interesting question, but we shouldn\u2019t get sucked into that. The SNP are constantly using the constitutional issue to mask other issues.\u201dBut Nandy reinforced her opposition to another independence referendum saying: \u201cWe have to stand up for Scotland remaining in the UK, and for solidarity across the nations and regions of the UK.\u201d",

The wind. Our opponent. The organisation of our opponent. The way we played in the first half. The distances between the lines were too big; we went too early with our long balls. The counter-press was not there. The good thing is, if you don\u2019t play well in the first half, it\u2019s easier to improve! Trent\u2019s positioning was improved, it was higher, and immediately everything changed. We were much more compact. Then we brought Fabinho and Sadio. One brought more organisation, and Sadio ...<em> [giggles]</em> ... he was fresh and made the difference, which was nice, so we could win the game. I haven\u2019t seen it back, but I am pretty sure it was a perfect finish. I\u2019m 98 percent sure <em>[Norwich\u2019s first-half chance] </em>was offside. But it was a great save. Alisson has helped us so often, which is good, but we pay him for that actually! The mentality of the boys was exceptional. It\u2019s really all bout the character of these wonderful football players. <em>[Our lead] </em>is so insane, I really don\u2019t understand it, I am not smart enough. It is difficult. I have no clue how it has happened. We are focused. We feel really good.\u201d</p> <p><strong>He\u2019s then asked about the Manchester City situation.</strong> \u201cIt was a shock. When it came out, wow. The only thing I can say is, I am a football coach, and what Man City did when I am in England is exceptional, absolutely exceptional. About all the rest, I have no idea. I can imagine it is really difficult for the sports people to understand. I really feel for Pep and the players. But it is the first verdict and they can appeal. The football they played was exceptional, and will be exceptional.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e4849ef8f08e13324744166\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-15T19:48:30.126Z\">7.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Daniel Farke\u2019s verdict on a bittersweet performance by his team.</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, because in many topics we were very, very good. It was a top-class performance, but a moment of magic by Mane was crucial. Of course it\u2019s disappointing at the moment, but we can be proud of our performance. When we create chances we have to be effective. We were two against one on the goalkeeper. We should be tidier and not as nervous, it must be a goal if you want to beat Liverpool. We were playing the best in the world, and we\u2019re a bit sad that we were unable to score with one of our counter-attacks. We were pretty close to coming away with a good result. The lads left their hearts out on the pitch. I can\u2019t accuse them too much, the quality of Mane was the difference.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eb7f0739f2f305694a0f42ca86794eadd66e9c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb7f0739f2f305694a0f42ca86794eadd66e9c0/0_24_4538_2723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norwich manager Daniel Farke looks dejected after the final whistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norwich manager Daniel Farke looks dejected after the final whistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-15T20:18:02.188Z\">at 8.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e48484e8f086a28115ac7f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-15T19:39:58.376Z\">7.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Incidentally, today\u2019s winner is Mane\u2019s 100th goal in English football. </strong>Exactly three quarters of them have been scored for Liverpool, the rest for his former club Southampton.

Three points this evening aren\u2019t a must, not yet, but how they would help. One, never mind three, might be so precious come the end of the season.</p> <p><strong>A small problem tonight: they\u2019re facing Liverpool, who have won 34 of their last 35 matches in this division. </strong>An even bigger problem: that\u2019s not the most nerve-shredding stat Norwich have to wrestle with! Liverpool have won seven of their last eight games against Norwich, rattling in 33 goals along the way. In recent years, the Canaries have been Liverpool\u2019s bunnies.</p> <p><strong>But this is football, and so there\u2019s always hope. </strong>For a start, Liverpool can often look a little rusty coming off the back of a break. On the opening day of this season, Norwich gave a better account of themselves at Anfield than a 4-1 result suggests. And early on in Jurgen Klopp\u2019s reign, City pushed the Reds all the way in a psychedelic mindbender that ended 4-5. That game, in January 2016, was the last time these teams met at Carrow Road. Klopp, who had his glasses memorably clipped off his startled face during the melee that ensued after Adam Lallana\u2019s late, late winner, won\u2019t forget that one in a hurry.</p> <p><strong>Norwich will also point to their home record this season. </strong>They\u2019ve drawn with Arsenal and Spurs, gave Chelsea a fright, and stunned the champions Manchester City on a Saturday evening back in September. It\u2019ll surely count as a huge shock if they get something out of this match tonight ... and yet on the other hand, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big surprise at all. Can the bottom club stun the leaders? Or will Liverpool stretch their lead at the top to a wholly preposterous 25 points? It should be fun finding out the answer. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>5.30pm.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "So that, me old MBM pals, is your lot. Paul MacInnes was the man brave enough to face down the elements at storm-battered Carrow Road this evening, and his report is in. You know what to do: click and enjoy. Thanks for reading this live blog. Nighty night. And now Jurgen Klopp, who is in chatterbox mode tonight. \u201cIt was a difficult game for different reasons. The wind. Our opponent. The organisation of our opponent. The way we played in the first half. The distances between the lines were too big; we went too early with our long balls. The counter-press was not there. The good thing is, if you don\u2019t play well in the first half, it\u2019s easier to improve! Trent\u2019s positioning was improved, it was higher, and immediately everything changed. We were much more compact. Then we brought Fabinho and Sadio. One brought more organisation, and Sadio ... [giggles] ... he was fresh and made the difference, which was nice, so we could win the game. I haven\u2019t seen it back, but I am pretty sure it was a perfect finish. I\u2019m 98 percent sure [Norwich\u2019s first-half chance] was offside. But it was a great save. Alisson has helped us so often, which is good, but we pay him for that actually! The mentality of the boys was exceptional. It\u2019s really all bout the character of these wonderful football players. [Our lead] is so insane, I really don\u2019t understand it, I am not smart enough. It is difficult. I have no clue how it has happened. We are focused. We feel really good.\u201d He\u2019s then asked about the Manchester City situation. \u201cIt was a shock. When it came out, wow. The only thing I can say is, I am a football coach, and what Man City did when I am in England is exceptional, absolutely exceptional. About all the rest, I have no idea. I can imagine it is really difficult for the sports people to understand. I really feel for Pep and the players. But it is the first verdict and they can appeal. The football they played was exceptional, and will be exceptional.\u201d Daniel Farke\u2019s verdict on a bittersweet performance by his team. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, because in many topics we were very, very good. It was a top-class performance, but a moment of magic by Mane was crucial. Of course it\u2019s disappointing at the moment, but we can be proud of our performance. When we create chances we have to be effective. We were two against one on the goalkeeper. We should be tidier and not as nervous, it must be a goal if you want to beat Liverpool. We were playing the best in the world, and we\u2019re a bit sad that we were unable to score with one of our counter-attacks. We were pretty close to coming away with a good result. The lads left their hearts out on the pitch. I can\u2019t accuse them too much, the quality of Mane was the difference.\u201d Incidentally, today\u2019s winner is Mane\u2019s 100th goal in English football. Exactly three quarters of them have been scored for Liverpool, the rest for his former club Southampton. Sky flash up a stat that illustrates the African Player of the Year\u2019s versatility and talent: 59 with the right foot, 27 with his left, and 14 headers. Plus of course a hat-trick in two minutes and 56 seconds, a Premier League record, albeit one broken against a team managed by Tim Sherwood. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson speaks: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good break, and a week\u2019s training as well. We knew it would be difficult coming here. They\u2019re bottom of the league but they still cause teams problems. They play football. It was a good performance from us in the end and thankfully we got the three points. We\u2019ve got to be delighted with the result. There are still things we have to improve on.\u201d Sky\u2019s Geoff Shreeves then asks man-of-the-match Sadio Mane whether he considers the title a done deal. A grin and cheeky glint in the eye suggests yes, but he\u2019s careful to trot out the \u201cmore games to play\u201d party line, and Henderson interjects with \u201cone step\u201d just to make sure his team-mate doesn\u2019t go off message Fabinho-style. Liverpool are now 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League. ! Norwich remain rooted to the bottom, on 18 points, seven adrift of safety. But their performance this evening will give them heart during the relegation run-in. Today\u2019s free hit nearly earned them a point; on another day, with a bit more luck, they might even have snaffled three, having hit the post six minutes before Sadio Mane\u2019s excellent winner. But this Liverpool side are second-to-none at grinding out results when playing below their best. Five more wins, 15 more points, and they\u2019ll be the champions of England for the first time since 1990. One win down, five more to go, and it\u2019ll be Liverpool\u2019s title. But the leaders were made to work so hard by the Premier League\u2019s bottom team. They celebrate more in relief than anything else. 90 min +2: Firmino tussles with Lewis down the right. He concedes a foul, then kicks the ball away. But the referee isn\u2019t minded to flash a yellow for that one. 90 min +1: Space for Aarons down the right. His cutback finds Buendia, who clumps carelessly out for a goal kick. He had options there. Liverpool breathe again. 90 min: Mane is booked for throwing the ball away after conceding a throw. There will be three additional minutes. 89 min: Buendia slips Pukki into space down the inside right. He\u2019s not going to be able to outpace Van Dijk, so takes a shot from distance. It\u2019s heading into the bottom left, but is snaffled with care by a perfectly positioned Alisson. 87 min: Drmic worries Liverpool with a power run down the left. The ball\u2019s eventually run out of play; goal kick. But the visitors look a little nervous again in the wake of Firmino\u2019s miss. 86 min: A huge miss by Firmino! Alexander-Arnold whips a cross in from the right, teeing up the Brazilian for a tap-in. But the ball\u2019s travelling at speed and he shanks it wide and high. Could the miss cost Liverpool? That was awful. 84 min: That\u2019s Keita\u2019s last contribution. He\u2019s replaced by Milner. Meanwhile Norwich make a double change, throwing on Buendia and Drmic in place of Rupp and Tettey. 83 min: ... Henderson flashes at fresh air by the near post. Cantwell tries to make off down the left, and is clattered from behind by Keita, who is booked for his trouble. 82 min: Salah miscontrols 25 yards out. No matter: McLean blooters the loose ball behind for a corner. From which ... 80 min: Salah and Alexander-Arnold take turns to busy themselves down the right, but neither player manages to produce anything significant. The away fans making plenty of noise now, nevertheless. Henderson creams a long ball down the inside-left channel. Mane brings it down, spins, and slams a wonderful shot into the bottom left. There\u2019s a quick VAR check, as Mane had placed a hand on Zimmerman\u2019s back as he turned, but it\u2019s never going to be disallowed. 77 min: Liverpool\u2019s play is getting a little frantic. Passes not quite sticking. And then, all of a sudden ... 75 min: ... it\u2019s an easy take for Alisson. Liverpool try to break upfield, but Norwich are soon coming straight back at them through Lewis, who goes on a glory run down the left. He\u2019s eventually stopped by Henderson, tracking back, but for a second Liverpool were exposed there. After a long period under pressure, Norwich have the scent now! 74 min: Suddenly Norwich have their tails up, and in the next phase of play, a corner\u2019s won down the right. One corner leads to another, and ... 72 min: Cantwell tears down the left. He rolls the ball across the face of the box. Tettey lets it run across him. He looks as though he\u2019s taken it too far wide, but then unleashes a shot that caroms off the base of the right-hand post and away! Norwich so close to taking a shock lead! Again! 71 min: Mane releases Salah down the inside left with a sensational diagonal pass. Salah pulls the ball across the face of goal, but nobody else in red is switched on, allowing Zimmerman to clear. 70 min: Hanley slips over with the ball at his feet, just outside the Norwich box. Henderson clumsily falls on him, and suddenly a promising chance for Liverpool is a free kick for Norwich. Hanley breathes a sigh of relief. 69 min: Gomez sprays a long pass down the left. Robertson cushions a header into the path of Mane, who threatens to burst clear into the box. But Aarons stands firm, Krul gathers, and the ball had hit Mane\u2019s arm anyway. 67 min: Liverpool\u2019s corner is no good, though Van Dijk fumes as he\u2019s tugged over by a combination of Pukki and Rupp. There\u2019s not enough in the tussle, and play goes on. 66 min: Robertson whistles another cross in from the left flank. Aarons sticks out a leg to intercept, with Mane lurking, and nearly deflects the ball into his own net. Instead, it\u2019ll be a corner. 65 min: Liverpool keep Norwich pinned in their own box. Crosses flying in from both sides. Salah has the best chance, but his attempt to sidefoot home a Robertson cross into the bottom right is blocked. 64 min: Robertson crosses from the left. The ball is nowhere near Salah and that\u2019s easy pickings for Krul. 62 min: Norwich take their sweet time over a throw in the midfield. Liverpool look a little agitated, which is of course the point. 60 min: Klopp has seen enough. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wijnaldum are replaced by Mane and Fabinho. 59 min: Salah turns on a sixpence inside the Norwich area and blasts towards the bottom left. Krul parries sensationally. The ball sits up for Keita, who must score, but doesn\u2019t connect properly, allowing Krul to parry again and smother. It\u2019s one of those: a bad miss but a stunning save nonetheless. Both sides have had one now. 58 min: Ah, there he is! Salah tees him up on the edge of the D. He sends a rising shot towards Krul, who is forced to tip over the bar. Corner, from which Van Dijk sends an uncharacteristically tame header into the arms of Krul. 56 min: Space for Keita down the right. He\u2019s got options in the box, but prods a very uncertain ball into the area that\u2019s easily intercepted and cleared. So much for the earlier brief sighting of Leipzig Naby. 54 min: Keita romps down the middle before feeding Robertson out on the left. Robertson rolls the ball through the six-yard box, but Firmino can\u2019t get anywhere near it at the front stick. The ball trundles harmlessly out for a goal kick. This is going swimmingly for Norwich, who are keeping the runaway league leaders at arm\u2019s length. 52 min: Henderson\u2019s poor pass in midfield allows Pukki to tear off down the left. The ball\u2019s worked towards the other flank, Cantwell getting past Robertson and lashing a shot into the side netting. Alisson had it covered. Robertson took a wee tug on Cantwell\u2019s shirt there; had the Norwich player decided to go down, the referee would have had a serious decision to make. 50 min: Norwich haven\u2019t had a sniff since the restart. But Liverpool are yet to parlay their dominance into serious work for Krul. 48 min: Firmino should make off down the right but McLean sticks to his back and eventually wrestles the ball away from him. The leaders have come out looking a little sharper, Jurgen Klopp presumably having made some trenchant observations during the break. 47 min: Liverpool are immediately on the front foot. Robertson drives down the left but can\u2019t quite break clear. Then Henderson chips one into the box from the right but Aarons wins an aerial battle with Firmino and clears the danger. Norwich get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. The current scoreline is good news for second-placed Manchester City ... and boy do they need some good news right now. Here\u2019s David Conn\u2019s latest take on City\u2019s two-year Champions League ban. There\u2019s just enough time for Liverpool to earn their third corner of the match, and waste it. And that\u2019s the half-time whistle. Norwich will be very happy with their performance, though they should be leading. Rupp\u2019s indecision and Alisson\u2019s brilliance combining to keep the scores level. 45 min +1: The corner should be claimed by Krul at the far post. But the keeper thinks Zimmerman will deal, and vice versa. Eventually Salah nips in, but can\u2019t find anyone in the centre with a weakly hit cross. Norwich get away with one. 45 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain and Robertson combine to win a corner on the left. One last chance for Liverpool to take a lead into half-time, perhaps? 44 min: Lewis nearly lets Firmino in with a poor clearing header, but just as it looks like the Brazilian will burst clear into the box, the Norwich sub fights back and clears up his own mess. An entertaining tussle. 42 min: Alexander-Arnold tries to find Van Dijk at the far post with a low curler, but Krul reads the free kick well and smothers. 41 min: Henderson rolls a pass down the right channel for Firmino, who turns Hanley with ease. Hanley climbs all over his back to stop him bursting into the box, and takes the booking. This is still a free kick in a dangerous position, though, just to the side of the box, 25 yards out. 39 min: Alexander-Arnold prepares to take the corner, but is held up awhile as the referee comes across to check he\u2019s placed the ball in the quadrant. Eventually we\u2019re good to go. The corner is blocked, and ends up back at the feet of Alexander-Arnold, who yanks a wild shot wide left from the edge of the box. 37 min: That near miss has lit a fire under Liverpool. Robertson, Keita and Salah take turns to drive at the Norwich back line. Salah\u2019s shot, an attempted curler towards the top left, is deflected out for a corner. 35 min: Rupp combines briskly with Cantwell down the right. For a split second it looks as though they\u2019ve opened Liverpool up, but Rupp runs the ball out for a goal kick. Norwich are soon coming back at the leaders. A long ball down the middle. Rupp brings it down, and he\u2019s clear of the Liverpool offside trap! He tries to round Alisson on the keeper\u2019s left - or is he trying to pass to Pukki, by his side? Either way, Alisson sticks out an arm and breaks up the move. What a save ... but Rupp will reflect that he should have done better. Norwich should be leading. 33 min: Keita plays a headed one-two with Henderson on the edge of the Norwich box, then drags a lame shot wide right. Krul, calmness personified, watches it bobble harmlessly past his post. 32 min: Robertson is sent scampering down the left by Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s cute flick. His low cross fails to find Salah, six yards out, and Norwich are able to clear their lines. 30 min: The first sign of Liverpool frustration, as Van Dijk tries to force an attack and yanks a weird pass to nobody straight out of play. No pressure, other than the weight of history. 28 min: Robertson\u2019s diagonal ball is stunned instantly by Salah, just inside the Norwich box on the right. He tees up Alexander-Arnold, who hits a weak first-time shot that\u2019s easily blocked. Norwich are holding their own. 26 min: Byram is helped off by the physio and is replaced by Lewis. 24 min: Krul rakes a ball down the Norwich left. Byram sticks out a leg to trap, and twangs his hamstring. He immediately clasps the back of his right leg. He\u2019s clearly not going to be able to continue. 22 min: Keita bursts into action, dribbling with purpose down the middle, beating a couple of Norwich challenges and nearly executing a crisp one-two with Salah. Norwich manage to hack clear. A brief glimpse of the Naby Keita we saw at Leipzig. 20 min: Liverpool\u2019s patience snaps, and Oxlade-Chamberlain hoicks a dismal cross from the left deep into the stand behind. Krul hasn\u2019t been forced into serious action yet. 19 min: Liverpool stroke it around the back in the 1970s style. Patience the watchword for the leaders at the minute. 17 min: The free kick is sent down the left wing, but Pukki is unable to get the jump on Gomez. The home side are playing with the freedom of a team who have been told by their boss that this is a free hit. 16 min: Henderson bowls Cantwelll to the floor, to the left of the centre circle. A chance for Norwich to send folk upfield. 14 min: Firmino appears to be in the mood tonight. He nearly sends Wijnaldum clear down the inside left with a ludicrous dragback and flick, but the Dutch midfielder gets his feet in a tangle as he looks to burst into the box. Norwich clear. 12 min: Tettey, going down the middle, has team-mates either side of him, and Liverpool backtracking. He should slip Pukki clear down the inside left, but picks the wrong pass and the chance to seriously worry Liverpool is gone. 10 min: A long ball down the middle by Liverpool this time. Firmino tries to bring it down on the penalty spot with a Bergkamp-style trap and turn. He nearly executes it perfectly, but Zimmerman gets a toe in, and Firmino\u2019s sensational plan is foiled. 8 min: Norwich come again, Cantwell trying a trick to get past Alexander-Arnold on the left. Neat skill, but it doesn\u2019t quite come off and he loses control. Goal kick. Yes, this match is promising to bloom into an entertaining back-and-forth. 7 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a dig from 25 yards. His attempt to thread one into the bottom left is easily snaffled by Krul. This match is lively and open. 6 min: A long ball down the middle by Hanley. Pukki is under it, and for a second looks like getting ahead of Gomez. But he slips as he tries to figure out the ball\u2019s flight, and Liverpool mop up. That\u2019ll give Norwich encouragement after a slow start. 5 min: Alexander-Arnold whips a ball in from the right. Zimmerman tries to clear with a diving header, but succeeds only in pinging the ball off the lurking Keita. It ricochets harmlessly into the arms of Krul, but on another day, etc. Then Liverpool come again through Firmino down the inside-left channel. He tries to work enough space for a proper shot but fails. City clear their lines. 4 min: Liverpool are beginning to hog the ball. Norwich are happy to sit back, and sit deep. 3 min: All a bit scrappy so far as both teams try to get a handle on the conditions. 1 min: Liverpool are on the front foot immediately. Firmino drifts in from the left and tees up Alexander-Arnold, who drags a shot well wide left after 13 seconds. That would have been some start. Liverpool get the game started. \u201cNorwich might be facing a Liverpool team on a terrifying run, but at least they don\u2019t have to face Luis Suarez,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cMan, he hated Norwich. So many ridiculous goals.\u201d In the interests of balance, here\u2019s one of the greatest goals of all time. The teams are out! Norwich wear their trademark yellow and green. That allows Liverpool to wear their storied red. It\u2019s always an aesthetic treat when both teams get to wear their best duds. Despite the horrific weather, Carrow Road is packed and bouncing. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes! Farke talking up his side\u2019s chances, there, as best he can. He\u2019ll be pleased to know that Ben Heywood has his back. \u201cI\u2019d love to believe that we could pull off a shock and become the first team in about 12 months to beat Liverpool and thereafter pull off the greatest escape since James Coburn strolled over the Swiss border. It\u2019s lovely to dream about prolonging our stay in the Premier League and hanging on to about \u00a3100m worth of talent (Buendia, Cantwell, Aarons and Godfrey would fetch that collectively). But it just ain\u2019t going to happen. Our entire squad and stadium cost less than VVD and we can\u2019t even outspend the likes of Sheffield Utd - the relegation writing has been on the changing room wall since November. But ... but ... you never know. It\u2019s football - and what I love about Daniel Farke is that he will set us up to have a go, regardless of the likely battering it\u2019ll earn us. We\u2019re bottom-of-the-table box-office!\u201d The feature presentation is coming up soon. A word with that other charismatic German, Daniel Farke. \u201cToday is just the second time all season that we have had three centre backs available. That says a lot about our injury crisis. There is good competition and the lads have done fantastic in recent games, so hopefully we can put in a good performance today. We are playing the best team in the world, the floodlights are on, it\u2019s a home game, everyone should enjoy it. We will go out brave and try to be ourselves today. A win would be great, but we are realistic, we know everything has to come together today and put in an outstanding performance.\u201d Weather report. Seeing we\u2019re watching the Canaries tonight ... In other news, Storm Dennis is doing its thing over East Anglia. Plenty of wind and rain. Jurgen Klopp, on record as disliking windy conditions, reacts to events: \u201cWe had a week of wind in training, so we have to deal with it. Both teams have to. We\u2019ll see how strong it will be. The direction can change everything. We just have to find the right attitude and fight, if possible to play. If not, to play long balls and fight for second balls. Adapt to the situation. You have to use the situation and not suffer from it.\u201d It\u2019s as you were for Norwich. Daniel Farke names the same side that earned a point at Newcastle two weeks ago. Liverpool make one change to the side that beat Southampton 4-0 on the first day of the month. Naby Keita comes in for Fabinho, who drops to the bench. Sadio Mane is back from injury, and named as a sub. Norwich City: Krul, Aarons, Zimmermann, Hanley, Byram, Tettey, McLean, Rupp, Duda, Cantwell, Pukki. Subs: Godfrey, Vrancic, Hernandez, Lewis, Emi, Drmic, Fahrmann. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, van Dijk, Robertson, Keita, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Oxlade-Chamberlain. Subs: Fabinho, Lovren, Milner, Mane, Adrian, Lallana, Origi. Referee: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire). Norwich City need some points, and they need them damn fast. Having only won one of their last dozen matches, they\u2019re seven points and eight goals adrift of safety. Three points this evening aren\u2019t a must, not yet, but how they would help. One, never mind three, might be so precious come the end of the season. A small problem tonight: they\u2019re facing Liverpool, who have won 34 of their last 35 matches in this division. An even bigger problem: that\u2019s not the most nerve-shredding stat Norwich have to wrestle with! Liverpool have won seven of their last eight games against Norwich, rattling in 33 goals along the way. In recent years, the Canaries have been Liverpool\u2019s bunnies. But this is football, and so there\u2019s always hope. For a start, Liverpool can often look a little rusty coming off the back of a break. On the opening day of this season, Norwich gave a better account of themselves at Anfield than a 4-1 result suggests. And early on in Jurgen Klopp\u2019s reign, City pushed the Reds all the way in a psychedelic mindbender that ended 4-5. That game, in January 2016, was the last time these teams met at Carrow Road. Klopp, who had his glasses memorably clipped off his startled face during the melee that ensued after Adam Lallana\u2019s late, late winner, won\u2019t forget that one in a hurry. Norwich will also point to their home record this season. They\u2019ve drawn with Arsenal and Spurs, gave Chelsea a fright, and stunned the champions Manchester City on a Saturday evening back in September. It\u2019ll surely count as a huge shock if they get something out of this match tonight ... and yet on the other hand, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big surprise at all. Can the bottom club stun the leaders? Or will Liverpool stretch their lead at the top to a wholly preposterous 25 points? It should be fun finding out the answer. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm.",

      "body": "<p>Dominic Cummings\u2019s dislike of anyone who gets in his way, whether they be civil servants, ministers, MPs, special advisers or journalists, has a long history. His abrasive style and combustible dealings with those around him were the reason David Cameron\u2019s director of communications, Andy Coulson, a former editor of the <em>News of the World</em> and no soft touch himself, refused to allow him a role as an adviser in the Tory/Lib Dem coalition government in 2010.</p> <p>Coulson\u2019s red-top instincts told him Cummings was trouble. But after Coulson had to resign in early 2011 over phone-hacking allegations at his former newspaper, Cummings did return as a special adviser to Michael Gove, then education secretary. As he and Gove set about trying to reform the education system in a hurry, hugely expanding the academies programme and introducing free schools, Cummings tore into anyone who questioned anything he and the boss were doing.</p> <p>For education reforms then, read plans to \u201clevel up\u201d the country now. In Cummings\u2019s mind, nothing was allowed to stop him and Gove and anyone who got in their way had to be removed. Now he is at the heart of power it is precisely the same.</p> <p>In the coalition\u2019s early days, it was widely believed in Whitehall that Cummings was behind a Twitter account called @toryeducation (formerly run from Conservative central office) which attacked Gove\u2019s critics, including journalists and ministers. For a special adviser to launch such attacks clearly breached the civil service code. Cummings denied involvement, saying he was \u201cnot @toryeducation\u201d, while never specifically refuting that he posted on the account. </p> <p>There were also staff disputes in the education department to which he was directly linked. In February 2013, the <em>Observer</em> revealed that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/09/michael-gove-bullying-claims-payout1\" title=\"\">civil servant in Gove\u2019s department had received a secret payoff</a> of about \u00a325,000 from public funds, after launching a lengthy grievance procedure involving Cummings and the department\u2019s former head of communications James Frayne.</p> <p>While a departmental investigation cleared both men and said no disciplinary action was needed, the final judgment made clear that their conduct had on occasions fallen short of the levels expected and \u201cbeen perceived as intimidating\u201d.</p> <p>The civil servant also lodged a case with a tribunal, where allegations would have been heard in public. A date was set but, after negotiations, the official accepted the payment in return for going quietly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When he worked for Michael Gove, his view was that the Department for Education held the power and it was up to him what he would tell No 10. Now, it is that No 10 has absolute control</p> <footer> <cite>Sean Kemp, former adviser to Nick Clegg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to papers relating to the case, Cummings undertook \u201crandom acts of verbal aggression\u201d and could be \u201crude and threatening\u201d. A few weeks before the <em>Observer </em>revealed the settlement, Gove \u2013 who, under the ministerial and special advisers\u2019 codes, was responsible for his advisers\u2019 behaviour \u2013 denied all knowledge of allegations of misconduct in an appearance before the education select committee.</p> <p>Today, as Thursday\u2019s reshuffle and Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation as chancellor clearly showed, Cummings\u2019s objective is to centralise as much power in 10 Downing Street as possible. When he worked for Gove, however, it was different.</p> <p>Special advisers who worked for the coalition remember how Cummings sent emails to No 10 advisers complaining that Downing Street was not showing the necessary urgency about school reform. Sean Kemp, a special adviser at the time to the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, sees similarities in Cummings\u2019s attitude but also a glaring contradiction. \u201cComparing it with now, either one can see it as hypocritical or he has changed his mind. Then, his view was that the Department for Education held the power and it was up to him what he would tell No 10. Now, it is that No 10 has absolute control over all the departments.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks after Boris Johnson became prime minister, Cummings began a purge of those he believed out of line. In late August, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/sajid-javid-was-not-told-in-advance-of-advisers-sacking-by-cummings\" title=\"\">sacked a 27-year-old Treasury special adviser working for Javid, Sonia Khan</a>, without informing her boss. He summoned her to No 10 and demanded to see her mobile phone before asking a police officer to march her off the premises. He is thought to have concluded that Khan had been dishonest about her contacts with her ex-boss, the former chancellor Philip Hammond, who was strongly opposed to a hard Brexit, and one of his ex-aides \u2013 accusations that Khan denied. She is now pursuing a case for unfair dismissal.</p> <p>There is talk of other complaints against Cummings. On Friday, two more special advisers in No 10\u2019s policy unit were dismissed.</p> <p>Before the reshuffle, the Whitehall view was that Cummings\u2019s power might have peaked. But when Javid resigned, having refused to sack all his advisers as Johnson and Cummings demanded, it was clear that Johnson\u2019s faith in the man who helped deliver victory in both the Brexit referendum and the general election was stronger than ever. </p>",

Today, as Thursday\u2019s reshuffle and Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation as chancellor clearly showed, Cummings\u2019s objective is to centralise as much power in 10 Downing Street as possible. When he worked for Gove, however, it was different. Special advisers who worked for the coalition remember how Cummings sent emails to No 10 advisers complaining that Downing Street was not showing the necessary urgency about school reform. Sean Kemp, a special adviser at the time to the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, sees similarities in Cummings\u2019s attitude but also a glaring contradiction. \u201cComparing it with now, either one can see it as hypocritical or he has changed his mind. Then, his view was that the Department for Education held the power and it was up to him what he would tell No 10. Now, it is that No 10 has absolute control over all the departments.\u201d A few weeks after Boris Johnson became prime minister, Cummings began a purge of those he believed out of line. In late August, he sacked a 27-year-old Treasury special adviser working for Javid, Sonia Khan, without informing her boss. He summoned her to No 10 and demanded to see her mobile phone before asking a police officer to march her off the premises. He is thought to have concluded that Khan had been dishonest about her contacts with her ex-boss, the former chancellor Philip Hammond, who was strongly opposed to a hard Brexit, and one of his ex-aides \u2013 accusations that Khan denied. She is now pursuing a case for unfair dismissal. There is talk of other complaints against Cummings. On Friday, two more special advisers in No 10\u2019s policy unit were dismissed. Before the reshuffle, the Whitehall view was that Cummings\u2019s power might have peaked. But when Javid resigned, having refused to sack all his advisers as Johnson and Cummings demanded, it was clear that Johnson\u2019s faith in the man who helped deliver victory in both the Brexit referendum and the general election was stronger than ever.",

There are dozens of national polls, run by commercial organisations, media outlets and universities, sometimes in combination with each other. Frequently they also compete with smaller state-specific polls in trying to call particular races.</p> <p>They may all indicate the same trends, but their methods and therefore their numbers, are often different. The diehard political junkies wait on tenterhooks for each new set of data; the rest of us might want a more digestible overview. Luckily there are a number of websites that provide just this.</p> <p>Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight went from 2012 heroes to 2016 zeroes after they and every other polling-focused site predicted that Hillary Clinton was a shoo-in. He also made some wrong calls on the primary races that year. Since then, Silver has done himself no favours by <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/155761/fall-nate-silver\">engaging on Twitter</a> in the kind of punditry he once described as \u201cuseless\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b486ab2583fdfe898e8180848d062d334eeb11a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b486ab2583fdfe898e8180848d062d334eeb11a8/0_74_2000_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">During the 2016 election, most polling-focused sites predicted Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton as a shoo-in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But some of the criticisms were not entirely fair, and Silver has perhaps been caught up in a backlash against expertise in a moment dominated by gut feel populism. (He never said Trump had no chance of winning, just that it was very small, and he wasn\u2019t alone.)</p> <p>Ignore his Twitter tirades and go to the <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight website</a>, where there is still a wealth of detailed polling information for primary races and the election as a whole.</p> <p>You can also check out some other useful one-stop resources for quantitative information.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The diehard political junkies wait on tenterhooks for each new set of data.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although the site has <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/realclear-media-has-a-secret-facebook-page-filled-with-far-right-memes\">strange rightwing connections</a>, RealClearPolitics has <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\">comprehensive, aggregated polling data</a>.

      "bodyText": "Whether we like it or not, the upcoming US election concerns all of us, and Australians would do well to pay attention. There are the usual, practical reasons: the US is Australia\u2019s most powerful ally, a major trading partner and the two countries have significant cultural and political affinities. What happens in America affects Australia pretty directly. For some of us, what happens in the world\u2019s most powerful anglophone liberal democracy also has an emotional resonance. Previously Australia\u2019s political junkies have looked to the US election as the most lavish political spectacle that democracy can provide. The drama is underpinned by the knowledge that any political outcome in the US will have a world-historical dimension. But there\u2019s a darker tinge to it this time after Donald Trump\u2019s shock victory in 2016. In the past four years we have had a practical demonstration that none of us can hide from US politics. An unstable US doesn\u2019t send ripples around the world \u2013 it dispatches tsunamis. So how best to understand what is happening from a distance? In a bitterly divided country, who should you listen to for accurate information (besides Guardian US, of course)? Who should you look to for an insight into the mindset of voters? And where can you go for the colour of the race? The top line In general, the most comprehensive, authoritative and influential coverage comes from a relative handful of outlets. Newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post are in effect international news organisations in the internet age. And of course, there\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s own US home page. The big change over the past few election cycles is the rise of the podcast. Some of the best and most important are independent \u2013 more on them below \u2013 but major media organisations now have a full complement of podcasts on all topics, including politics and elections, including the New York Times. A second tier of metropolitan newspapers \u2013 among them the LA Times, the Houston Chronicle, the Boston Herald, the Chicago Tribune and the Seattle Times \u2013 provide a similar service not only for their home cities, but wider regions that will be crucial in deciding the election. Cable television news outlets such as CNN and MSNBC now have mountains of print content on their websites. The two public broadcasters National Public Radio and PBS offer credible online coverage. Big city affiliates of national broadcast TV networks such as CBS also offer some of the most well-read news websites in the country. And internet-native outlets like Politico, Huffington Post and Yahoo News also provide reliable election-focused news. Bookmarking the election coverage on these sites, or plugging their feeds into an RSS reader, will offer a much more reliable real time guide to what is happening than your Facebook feed. Be aware that some credible sounding sites \u2013 such as Newsweek or the Washington Times \u2013 are either much-diminished or less impartial than their name might suggest. The numbers US election season is awash with polls. There are dozens of national polls, run by commercial organisations, media outlets and universities, sometimes in combination with each other. Frequently they also compete with smaller state-specific polls in trying to call particular races. They may all indicate the same trends, but their methods and therefore their numbers, are often different. The diehard political junkies wait on tenterhooks for each new set of data; the rest of us might want a more digestible overview. Luckily there are a number of websites that provide just this. Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight went from 2012 heroes to 2016 zeroes after they and every other polling-focused site predicted that Hillary Clinton was a shoo-in. He also made some wrong calls on the primary races that year. Since then, Silver has done himself no favours by engaging on Twitter in the kind of punditry he once described as \u201cuseless\u201d. But some of the criticisms were not entirely fair, and Silver has perhaps been caught up in a backlash against expertise in a moment dominated by gut feel populism. (He never said Trump had no chance of winning, just that it was very small, and he wasn\u2019t alone.) Ignore his Twitter tirades and go to the FiveThirtyEight website, where there is still a wealth of detailed polling information for primary races and the election as a whole. You can also check out some other useful one-stop resources for quantitative information. Although the site has strange rightwing connections, RealClearPolitics has comprehensive, aggregated polling data. At the New York Times, the Upshot carries out analysis that goes beyond polling numbers into electoral maths, and statistical deep dives into the political and demographic issues that bear on voting behaviour. The detail By necessity, national coverage leaves out a lot. Even a well-resourced colossus such as the New York Times can only cram in so much information about what might be happening in particular states during primary season, especially during the sprawling events of Super Tuesday. If you want to have your ear closer to the ground, you may want to tune into local sources. But in a media market the size of the US, it can be hard to know where to start. There are a few ways in. Some sites, such as Mondo Times, systematically list and link to local news organisations. In the listing for Oregon, where I am based, it handily shows the large cities in bold type; if you click through to a locality, such as Portland, you\u2019ll see all active media organisations listed. The listing for each outlet then has a link directly to the source. From there you can save time with a few pointers. Yellow crosses by the name on Mondo\u2019s site indicate locally popular outlets. The news section generally lists the more reliable, news-focused sources. From there you can use some rules of thumb. If you look for the radio station with NPR beside its name, such as KOPB, you will find a public broadcaster roughly equivalent to a combination of local ABC Radio and Radio National \u2013 comprehensive, with national resources, and safely down the middle. The more popular news sources will often be papers of record for a city or a state \u2013 in our example, the Oregonian. These can also generally be relied on, and will usually allow you to read at least a few articles free of charge. But don\u2019t overlook the so-called \u201calt weeklies\u201d \u2013 scrappy, independent giveaways like Portland\u2019s Willamette Week \u2013 which Mondo lists in the entertainment listings. Yes, they do provide listings and entertainment guides, much like street press giveaways in Australia. But they also offer edgier, less risk-averse coverage of local news than some of their big brother outlets \u2013 go to the street press for the real skinny. The law One feature of the Trump administration has been the large number of legal proceedings brought against the president, his associates and members of the administration. Many of these cases are yet to be resolved, and developments over the next few months may have a significant impact on the result. For straight up reporting, keep an eye on Courthouse News. For sharper coverage of the legal travails of Trump world, try EmptyWheel, the blog of independent journalist Marcy Wheeler.

Australia\u2019s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, wrote in an opinion piece this week that it was \u201cfrankly pretty surprising that a government needs to request that measures be in place to protect against the livestreaming of murder\u201d. Australia is preparing to introduce an online safety act, which will create rules around terrorist-related material, as well as cyber-abuse, image-based abuse and other kinds of harmful content. But while the question of whether to take down a livestream of murder is an obvious one, decisions about other kinds of take-down requests can be fraught. \u201cSome of those requests are kind of scary,\u201d says John Graham-Cumming, the chief technology officer of US web security company Cloudflare. \u201cIn Spain you have Catalonia trying to be independent, and the Spanish government saying \u2018that is sedition, can you remove it?\u2019\u201d \u2018I woke up and decided to kick them off the internet\u2019 Cloudflare doesn\u2019t host content itself, rather it protect sites that do from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that could take them offline. Yet, Cloudflare has found itself at the centre of debates around what sort of content is acceptable online, and whether tech companies should be making those decisions. After American woman Heather Heyer was killed in 2017 while counter-protesting a Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Cloudflare came under pressure to stop providing protection for the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince ultimately pulled protection for the website, but not without reflecting on the implications of his decision. Let me be clear: this was an arbitrary decision. It was different than what I\u2019d talked talked with our senior team about yesterday. I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet \u2026 It was a decision I could make because I\u2019m the CEO of a major Internet infrastructure company. Having made that decision, we now need to talk about why it is so dangerous. I\u2019ll be posting something on our blog later today. Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn\u2019t be allowed on the Internet. No one should have that power. After the Christchurch shooting, Cloudflare again debated whether to stop providing services to 8chan, the forum where the perpetrators in the El Paso and Christchurch shootings had posted about their plans. Again the company decided to accede to demands it cut ties, and 8chan was taken offline. Six months on, Cloudflare\u2019s chief technology officer, John Graham-Cumming, tells Guardian Australia the company would like to see a legal framework in each jurisdiction that sets out what a company\u2019s obligations are \u2013 particularly for companies that don\u2019t host the content themselves. Countries are beginning to legislate After the Christchurch shooting, Australia quickly passed laws in that could result in company executives being jailed for three years, and the companies fined up to 10% of global revenue, for failing to quickly remove material when alerted by the eSafety commissioner. In the UK, the government will appoint Ofcom to issue fines to social media companies that fail to remove harmful content. The online safety act the Australian government is consulting on will give the e-safety commissioner the power to: direct internet providers to block domains containing terrorism material \u201cin an online crisis event\u201d ask search engine providers to de-rank websites that provide access to harmful material force sites to remove cyber abuse or image-based abuse of adults within 24 hours It will also allow the minister to set via legislative instrument a set of online safety expectations social media companies will need to comply with. While this will makes things clearer for tech companies, it doesn\u2019t spell the end of their headaches. Global internet versus local policing As Graham-Cumming points out, when one government has a law in place, then other governments can make similar demands. \u201cIf the law in Australia says we have to hand over all our [encryption] keys then, for example, China or Saudi Arabia or Russia or Brazil or India or Germany could say \u2018well you did it for Australia, how are we different from Australia?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere is this tension between this sense of global internet, and then local policing.\u201d Graham-Cumming says the world is still getting to grips what role tech companies should play in determining what should be allowed online. \u201cWe are in the middle of this massive change in the world where everything has gone online \u2013 good and bad \u2013 and as a society and as governments [we] don\u2019t yet know what the answer is,\u201d he says. \u201cI think what has happened is some quarter of the public is saying to technology companies: \u2018you decide for me\u2019. And that\u2019s an unusual situation where private companies are being asked to make public policy like that.\u201d Correction: this article was updated on Monday 17 February 2020. The original article stated that the Thailand attack was livestreamed for five hours, which was incorrect.",

      "bodyText": "Over summer I spent weeks reporting on the bushfire crisis in northern New South Wales, including the ferocious blazes close to Taree that near destroyed the towns of Bobin and Killabakh through to the Myall Creek fire in the state\u2019s north, which menaced New Italy and Woombah. I met families with small children who had to flee burning homes in the night. I visited suburban homes filled to the brim with burnt native animals, needing care around the clock. And I interviewed firefighters who broke down and cried recounting efforts to save the homes of friends. These people are regional Australians on the frontline of climate change \u2013 climate change that is propelled by burning coal \u2013 and while the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has acknowledged the government\u2019s climate policies must \u201cevolve\u201d, he maintains that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwriting off a $70bn industry on which regional Australians depend for their livelihood\u201d. It\u2019s true that many regional Australians rely on jobs created by coalmining. Coalminers are among Australia\u2019s higher paid earners \u2013 average salary $125,000. The Bowen Basin coalmining town of Moranbah is the sixth wealthiest postcode in Queensland, with a median weekly average household income of $2,421. But the regional towns affected by these fires are suffering tremendous economic, emotional and environmental impacts, not least because scores of people in these areas don\u2019t have the resources to deal with hardship. Many of the towns and regions worst hit by summer\u2019s bushfires are among the least prosperous in the country. The story of coal and climate change is not a tale of two cities, but a tale of two regional Australias. Page, in northern New South Wales, consistently rates as one of Australia\u2019s most disadvantaged electorates. (According to the University of Canberra\u2019s Natsem data it is the regional electorate with the greatest proportion of people living under the poverty line in NSW.) In the shires of Richmond Valley and the Clarence Valley, 239 homes burnt, while another 84 were damaged A \u2018baptism of fire\u2019 In the village of Rappville, west of Casino, around one in three houses (more than a dozen homes) were destroyed by fires in October. Rappville\u2019s household median weekly income is $725 \u2013 less than a third of that in the mining town of Moranbah. Tina Haag and her four children evacuated their rented house in 90 minutes after her neighbour warned her the fire was fast approaching on 8 October. Her partner, Robert Collier, was at work at his family\u2019s air-conditioning business. Haag, who comes from Sweden, met Collier when he was studying in her country. Their two eldest sons, Jesse, now aged six, and Villiam, five, were born there. They moved to the Richmond Valley, where Collier grew up, four years ago. Their two youngest children, Nora, aged two, and Edward, six months, were born in northern New South Wales. Haag describes the Rappville fire as her \u201cAussie baptism of fire\u201d. \u201cYou could see the huge ball of smoke over the pub. I tried to pack, but I ended leaving three of the bags I packed. I just grabbed random clothes \u2026 the kids went crazy, grabbing everything.\u201d The family\u2019s possessions were uninsured and Haag says they are now putting themselves together \u201cfrom scratch\u201d with the support of the government and the Red Cross. Friends have found the family a nearby house to live in rent-free. Haag describes the process of recovery as ongoing. \u201cIn the beginning it was just pure shock and you don\u2019t realise what you\u2019ve lost ... I lost all my children\u2019s baby books, their early art work, my things from Sweden. Robert\u2019s father had died the year before and he lost everything his dad had given him.\u201d They visited the ruins of their home the day after the fire. Her two-year-old was the most affected, refusing to eat and not wanting to have her hair brushed. \u201cI think it was easier for the older one, they had their words and could talk about it, but Nora couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t understand.\u201d Four months on and all the children are doing well. Nora now talks about the experience. \u201cShe tells everyone she meets, \u2018my house burnt\u2019.\u201d Haag is convinced the severity of the fires was connected to climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in Sweden, the weather is crazy. The last time we were there, there was a drought. It hasn\u2019t been that dry in 400 years and now they have a winter without snow. And here we also have long droughts.\u201d She describes the push for new coalmines and a power plant in Queensland as \u201cstrange\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s time the politicians came out with something new, especially after this. They need to look for other solutions, apart from coal, something that\u2019s better for the environment. Living in rural places like this the only thing you hear is \u2018stop the coalmining, lock the gates\u2019, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about too. We believe there are other options.\u201d The family are committed to staying in Rappville and are looking to buy land and build a new home. \u201cWe want to buy a block and put something nice there. Inspire the town,\u201d Collier says. Counting the cost of climate change Coalition ministers have consistently rejected the idea that renewable industries could create more jobs and disperse wealth more evenly across regional Australia than coalmining or that the government could more effectively lobby for global emissions cuts if Australia wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s second biggest coal exporter. The ALP accepts that \u201ccoal will continue to play a part within our economy for decades to come\u201d. When defending coal as a cheap power source and major Australian export, Morrison again and again cites the need to protect the jobs of regional Australians: \u201cI\u2019m not going to put someone\u2019s job at risk, a region\u2019s, town\u2019s future at risk.\u201d About 7 million people live in regional Australia. The statistics show that on average regional Australians earn less than urban Australians, and also have a lower life expectancy, higher rates of disease and injury, double the national suicide rate, and poorer access to services and infrastructure, and now \u2013 as evidenced from the worst bushfire season on record and recent flooding \u2013 we are increasingly impacted by the climate crisis.

In its shires of Nambucca, Bellingen, Kempsey and Coffs Harbour, 176 homes burnt in the November bushfires, another 60 houses were damaged. The seat of Lyne, further south again, taking in Taree and Forster is number three on the regional disadvantage scale. There, 125 houses were destroyed, 62 damaged.

The 58-year-old and his dog are living with friends while he considers his future. He had less than half an hour to evacuate. \u201cI left with my laptop, a plastic lunchbox that had my mobile phone, chargers and credit cards, and a small suitcase with two pairs of jeans and a few shirts. I don\u2019t know what my mentality was. I was sure I was coming back. I regret not packing more jeans and shoes.\u201d Goodfellow has been told his insurance wouldn\u2019t cover all losses, and he is still grappling with the destruction. Goodfellow doubts he will rebuild on his 22 acres and is instead looking to buy in town. He believes climate change played a role in the fires, but also wonders if more hazard reduction burns could have reduced the fuel load in the forests.

I don\u2019t think it was only me who skipped the Turbine Hall installation and, just a little guiltily, went straight up to the now permanent display of London life, sanctioned by the courts: Couples in \u00a32m Apartments Who Realise They Might be Extras in Damien Hirst Vitrines. Day of the jackal When I interviewed Gina Miller last month, she mentioned that one of the ways she had stayed sane through the prorogation court case and the online trolling was by reading Dickens. Invariably, he had seen it all before. \u201cGo back to A Tale of Two Cities,\u201d she told me, \u201cand you\u2019ll find Dominic Cummings.\u201d I have done just that in the past week and, sure enough, it is hard now to read the machinations of Sydney Carton, the \u201cjackal\u201d who gets things done on behalf of the vain and foolish Mr Stryver, without thinking of our national henchman. Dissolute, drunken and dishevelled and with a manner \u201cso careless as to be insolent\u201d, Carton is \u201cthe fellow of no delicacy\u201d who \u201ccares for nothing and no one\u201d and whose \u201cnegligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill\u201d. You\u2019ll remember from the novel that Carton eventually finds redemption by voluntarily going to the guillotine to save the neck of his aristocratic doppelganger. There are, however, plenty of heads that have rolled before his. Sleeping sickness My new watch \u2013 35 quid off eBay \u2013 not only has a nifty dial that reminds you just how few steps you have done in a day but also connects to an app that monitors sleeping habits. A graph indicates the hours of shut-eye, and also \u2013 somehow \u2013 the depth and quality of it. I\u2019ve always been a light sleeper \u2013 the creak of a radiator or the prospect of an early morning deadline are often enough to have me staring at the ceiling. Over the course of the month I have been wearing my watch though, I\u2019ve noticed a slight \u2013 but surely significant \u2013 increase in the number of restless minutes. Last night, with the wind rattling the windows, I lay awake wondering, inevitably, whether I was sleeping more shallowly because I was anxious about waking up to check the app.",

We are now exposing them to new risks for opioid overdose, for suicidality, for actual suicide, for withdrawal symptoms, for increased pain.\u201d</p> <p>People living in chronic pain are a highly marginalised group. They tend to be more isolated, and live in lower-socioeconomic and regional areas. Nearly half of chronic pain patients also suffer anxiety and depression. <a href=\"https://www.painaustralia.org.au/about-pain/painful-facts\">Suicide rates</a> are two to three times higher than the general population. And for a cohort that Painaustralia says already has a high prevalence of a key suicide risk factor \u2013 a lack of a fear of death \u2013 the fear and anxiety associated with withdrawing from a medication that they believe has been helping them manage their pain can be overwhelming..</p> <p>Darnall says the risks associated with de-prescribing depend on the extent to which a patient is participating voluntarily. When they have little or no control, a patient\u2019s pain and symptoms can be amplified, and they can feel abandoned and victimised by the medical profession, she says.</p> <p>While Holliday would like to see fewer patients started on opioids, he says that it is unreasonable to expect some long-term users to be able to entirely cease their use. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be there,\u201d he says. \u201cJust saying to people \u2018Stop them. They\u2019re a bad drug. You\u2019re a bad person for using this drug,\u2019 is a disastrous, unethical approach. I think that precipitous thing does happen; it\u2019s happening in the United States and it\u2019s happening in Australia. I think it\u2019s really wicked.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The problem with pain</strong></h2> <p>The tricky thing about pain is that it is created in the brain. Pain is a distress signal from the body relayed to the brain, which responds with physical discomfort. <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/108331907X223010\">Studies have suggested </a>that pain is formed by a combination of bodily, psychological and social factors, and the extent of pain may not necessarily correlate to the extent of injury. Nevertheless, the pain is real.</p> <p>Chronic pain is an increasing issue in Australia and the developed world. With an ageing population, increasing rates of cancer survivorship and advancing rates of obesity, the risk factors for pain are growing. Some <a href=\"https://www.painaustralia.org.au/static/uploads/files/national-action-plan-11-06-2019-wfflaefbxbdy.pdf\">3.37 million people live in chronic pain</a> in Australia today. By 2050 it is estimated there will be 5.23 million. A report by Deloitte put the <a href=\"https://www.painaustralia.org.au/static/uploads/files/the-cost-of-pain-in-australia-final-report-12mar-wfxbrfyboams.pdf\">annual cost of chronic pain in Australia</a> at $139.3bn. Globally the cost is estimated to be equivalent to the cost of cancer and diabetes combined.</p> <p>And yet, pain is not widely understood for what the most recent science tells us it is.</p> <p>\u201cPain is a negative sensory and emotional experience \u2013 but we don\u2019t treat the other half of the definition of pain,\u201d says Darnall. \u201cWe have applied an overwhelmingly biomedical approach to treating pain, and this has not served our patients well over the past few decades.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tapering is not harmful if done well \u2013 but that\u2019s a big \u2018if'</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Claire Ashton-James</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The emotional dimension of pain and pain treatment is critical, and while a placebo is often understood as a sugar pill, Darnall says it is more complex than that. The placebo effect is the belief that a treatment will work. That belief in turn improves the chances of a treatment working.</p> <p>However, it holds true in reverse.</p> <p>\u201cIf you taper off opioids and you expect nausea, you\u2019re expecting vomiting, you expect all sorts of pain flare-ups, then that will exacerbate your experience of those side effects,\u201d says Ashton-James. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean those side effects aren\u2019t real, but that\u2019s the mind-body connection.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018What will fill the vacuum left by opioids?\u2019</strong></h2> <p>And in facilitating that mind-body, multidimensional and whole-person approach to pain, Ashton-James says the current Australian system falls short. Up to 80% of chronic pain sufferers are not able to access specialist pain services, so most chronic pain is managed by GPs.</p> <p>\u201cThe absolute crux of the problem is the funding model, because GPs aren\u2019t incentivised to provide good pain management,\u201d says Ashton-James. \u201cThe system isn\u2019t set up to be able to necessarily do patients justice.\u201d</p> <p>She says that while it takes a few minutes to write a prescription for a pain condition, it can take an hour to sit with a patient and understand the context of their pain, its origins, what makes their pain feel less, what exacerbates it, what they do in the morning, what they did up until that appointment, what they eat, how much caffeine they drink. And then, from that point, develop strategies such as lifestyle changes, cognitive behavioural therapies, mindfulness, physiotherapy and so on. These strategies require multiple professionals, multiple visits to doctors, and education on the part of GPs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/05/chronic-pain-prescribe-mental-health-support-as-well-as-drugs-say-experts\">Chronic pain: prescribe mental health support as well as drugs, say experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Holliday says it is unrealistic to expect GPs to reproduce these time-intensive strategies within a local surgery environment, particularly when GPs have had their <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-medicare-rebate-freeze-and-what-does-it-mean-for-you-114169\">benefits schedule effectively frozen for six years</a>. But, with adequate funding and education, GPs can provide good chronic condition care, pain or otherwise.</p> <p>Painaustralia\u2019s Bennett says while opioids are not recommended for long-term pain management, something needs to fill the vacuum left when they are taken away. \u201cIf we want to change the situation around overreliance on medication, we must build alternative pathways for both practitioners and patients,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a big gap in what alternative supports currently exist or are accessible, and an even bigger gap in practitioner awareness of best practice pain management.\u201d</p> <p>At present, while drugs such as tramadol and fentanyl are available subsidised by the PBS, psychological and allied health treatments for chronic pain are, in general, available only in limited subsidised form and difficult to access outside of metropolitan centres.</p> <p>The national strategic action plan for pain management, authored by Painaustralia and endorsed by state health ministers, aims to address this by funding subsidised individual and group specialist treatments for patients. The plan also intends to improve education and resources for clinicians and the public regarding effective pain management, with limited emphasis on pharmaceutical intervention.</p> <p>\u201cForced tapering is a problem,\u201d says Ashton-James. \u201cTapering in and of itself is not harmful if done well \u2013 but that\u2019s a big \u2018if\u2019. It takes quite a bit of resources to do it well.</p> <p>\u201cBut I believe it is the responsibility of our healthcare system to do it well, because we\u2019re the ones who been prescribing for the last 25 years and creating the problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

But for many chronic pain patients swept up in a tide of opioid overprescription, the Stanford pain psychologist believes the system failed to uphold this oath. And now, as the world grapples with weaning itself off a deadly epidemic of opioid overuse, the question is: are we letting those people down again? Opioid prescription increased rapidly in Australia and elsewhere up until a few years ago. Opioid-related deaths increased, too, claiming three lives a day in 2018 nationally.

She says the greatest level of harm has come from illicit use of pharmaceutical opioids, but that legitimate pain patients simply following their doctor\u2019s advice have been caught up in the crackdown. Doctors and pain organisations tell Guardian Australia that there is a growing anti-opioid climate in this country, too. Alongside elevated concerns about harms and the science and marketing behind opioids for chronic pain, a letter from the Chief Medical Officer sent to 4,800 GPs in 2018 notifying them that they were among the highest opioid prescribers in the country has had a particularly chilling effect. The department of health is still assessing the impact of this letter on prescribing rates. A spokeswoman told Guardian Australia that, as a result, some doctors had been considered for compliance action that could involve further scrutiny of their prescribing and possible partial disqualification from Medicare or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for a period, but that none have so far been disqualified. In the meantime, various moves are under way to monitor and reduce opioid prescribing.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration has announced more restrictions and safety measures related to opioids due to come into effect this year.

But while the TGA and action plan both state that opioids have a role to play in the treatment of certain patients, the mood has shifted in relation to the drugs. Carol Bennett, CEO of Painaustralia, says: \u201cIn short, there appears to be a general reluctance across the medical community to prescribe opioids, even in instances where it may be clinically indicated.\u201d Dr Simon Holliday, a GP and addiction medicine specialist in Taree, which has high rates of opioid use and chronic pain, says that up until a few years ago there was a permissiveness about opioid prescribing. However, following the CMO letter and growing concerns about harms and addiction, he says that a \u201clot of people said: \u2018Right. No opiates at all.\u2019\u201d \u201cThere is almost a crusading zeal to stop people using bad stuff,\u201d he argues; a well-intentioned pushback against opioid prescribing by patients who have been harmed, or by police, hospitals and regulators concerned by the increasing numbers of people being hospitalised in relation to the drugs. Holliday fears the rise of a 21st century temperance movement. In its 20th century incarnation the movement resulted in severe limitations on how physicians could use opiates, following an era where they were a commonly used, unrestricted medicine and recreational drug. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to see my beloved profession harming patients by pumping them with addictive opiates where we haven\u2019t got the evidence.\u201d \u2018A social and medical experiment\u2019 The evidence, according to the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care is that \u201cmodest clinical benefit from opioid use declines over time and can be outweighed by harms\u201d.

For the most part, the side effects make you less able to function in society, as a family member, as a co-worker, as a friend, less able to take care of yourself physically.

And for a cohort that Painaustralia says already has a high prevalence of a key suicide risk factor \u2013 a lack of a fear of death \u2013 the fear and anxiety associated with withdrawing from a medication that they believe has been helping them manage their pain can be overwhelming.. Darnall says the risks associated with de-prescribing depend on the extent to which a patient is participating voluntarily. When they have little or no control, a patient\u2019s pain and symptoms can be amplified, and they can feel abandoned and victimised by the medical profession, she says. While Holliday would like to see fewer patients started on opioids, he says that it is unreasonable to expect some long-term users to be able to entirely cease their use. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be there,\u201d he says. \u201cJust saying to people \u2018Stop them. They\u2019re a bad drug. You\u2019re a bad person for using this drug,\u2019 is a disastrous, unethical approach. I think that precipitous thing does happen; it\u2019s happening in the United States and it\u2019s happening in Australia. I think it\u2019s really wicked.\u201d The problem with pain The tricky thing about pain is that it is created in the brain. Pain is a distress signal from the body relayed to the brain, which responds with physical discomfort. Studies have suggested that pain is formed by a combination of bodily, psychological and social factors, and the extent of pain may not necessarily correlate to the extent of injury. Nevertheless, the pain is real. Chronic pain is an increasing issue in Australia and the developed world. With an ageing population, increasing rates of cancer survivorship and advancing rates of obesity, the risk factors for pain are growing. Some 3.37 million people live in chronic pain in Australia today. By 2050 it is estimated there will be 5.23 million. A report by Deloitte put the annual cost of chronic pain in Australia at $139.3bn. Globally the cost is estimated to be equivalent to the cost of cancer and diabetes combined. And yet, pain is not widely understood for what the most recent science tells us it is. \u201cPain is a negative sensory and emotional experience \u2013 but we don\u2019t treat the other half of the definition of pain,\u201d says Darnall. \u201cWe have applied an overwhelmingly biomedical approach to treating pain, and this has not served our patients well over the past few decades.\u201d The emotional dimension of pain and pain treatment is critical, and while a placebo is often understood as a sugar pill, Darnall says it is more complex than that. The placebo effect is the belief that a treatment will work. That belief in turn improves the chances of a treatment working. However, it holds true in reverse. \u201cIf you taper off opioids and you expect nausea, you\u2019re expecting vomiting, you expect all sorts of pain flare-ups, then that will exacerbate your experience of those side effects,\u201d says Ashton-James. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean those side effects aren\u2019t real, but that\u2019s the mind-body connection.\u201d \u2018What will fill the vacuum left by opioids?\u2019 And in facilitating that mind-body, multidimensional and whole-person approach to pain, Ashton-James says the current Australian system falls short. Up to 80% of chronic pain sufferers are not able to access specialist pain services, so most chronic pain is managed by GPs. \u201cThe absolute crux of the problem is the funding model, because GPs aren\u2019t incentivised to provide good pain management,\u201d says Ashton-James. \u201cThe system isn\u2019t set up to be able to necessarily do patients justice.\u201d She says that while it takes a few minutes to write a prescription for a pain condition, it can take an hour to sit with a patient and understand the context of their pain, its origins, what makes their pain feel less, what exacerbates it, what they do in the morning, what they did up until that appointment, what they eat, how much caffeine they drink. And then, from that point, develop strategies such as lifestyle changes, cognitive behavioural therapies, mindfulness, physiotherapy and so on. These strategies require multiple professionals, multiple visits to doctors, and education on the part of GPs. However, Holliday says it is unrealistic to expect GPs to reproduce these time-intensive strategies within a local surgery environment, particularly when GPs have had their benefits schedule effectively frozen for six years. But, with adequate funding and education, GPs can provide good chronic condition care, pain or otherwise. Painaustralia\u2019s Bennett says while opioids are not recommended for long-term pain management, something needs to fill the vacuum left when they are taken away. \u201cIf we want to change the situation around overreliance on medication, we must build alternative pathways for both practitioners and patients,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a big gap in what alternative supports currently exist or are accessible, and an even bigger gap in practitioner awareness of best practice pain management.\u201d At present, while drugs such as tramadol and fentanyl are available subsidised by the PBS, psychological and allied health treatments for chronic pain are, in general, available only in limited subsidised form and difficult to access outside of metropolitan centres. The national strategic action plan for pain management, authored by Painaustralia and endorsed by state health ministers, aims to address this by funding subsidised individual and group specialist treatments for patients. The plan also intends to improve education and resources for clinicians and the public regarding effective pain management, with limited emphasis on pharmaceutical intervention. \u201cForced tapering is a problem,\u201d says Ashton-James. \u201cTapering in and of itself is not harmful if done well \u2013 but that\u2019s a big \u2018if\u2019. It takes quite a bit of resources to do it well. \u201cBut I believe it is the responsibility of our healthcare system to do it well, because we\u2019re the ones who been prescribing for the last 25 years and creating the problem.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

It is a stench that pervades much of what is said and policy that is enacted. There are two particular types \u2013 the hypocrisy where politicians pretend they care about something and then do nothing, and the one where they pretend to think something and do the opposite. We have seen it this week with former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop suddenly discovering climate change. She told Guardian Australia \u201cthat I\u2019ve always been of the view that Australia, as a leading industrialised and developed nation, with one of the best standards of living in the world, needs to be a leader in the international response to climate change\u201d. The nation as one responded with a resounding, \u201cSeriously, what?\u201d Name one instance during her time as foreign minister or even just as a member of the Howard or Abbott-Turnbull governments where she ever proffered such a view or supported such a policy position. Her very last mention of \u201cclimate change\u201d in parliament came in 2017 when she lovingly talked up \u201chigh efficiency, low emissions\u201d coal plants and decried in loud tones the ALP\u2019s \u201cobsession with a 50% renewable energy target\u201d which she said was \u201cdestroying business confidence in South Australia, threatening jobs and threatening industries\u201d. Gotta love that leadership. Or perhaps she was leading in 2015 when she told parliament: \u201cI think it is important not to engage in hyperbole when one is talking about climate change. I remember in 2011 when the deputy leader [Tanya Plibersek] tried to scare the senior citizens on the Central Coast by saying that they were going to be subject to the ravages of climate change.\u201d Or maybe she suggested being a \u201cleader in the international response\u201d was what she was doing when she told parliament that the government\u2019s 26% to 28% target of emissions cuts, \u201cis a responsible contribution\u201d and that \u201cwhat is not responsible is Labor\u2019s endorsement of a carbon reduction target of up to 60% on 2000 levels by 2030\u201d. Do nothing but say you care about doing lots. The other hypocrisy was writ large across the LNP this week with regards to the budget surplus. Gone is the boasting of a surplus already delivered, now the Treasurer says \u201cwell the surplus has never been an end in itself\u201d and \u201cdelivering a surplus has not been our priority in the face of these crises\u201d and \u201cour focus is on is not necessarily delivering the surplus\u201d. Last year, when David Speers questioned Frydenberg about the government\u2019s boast of delivering a surplus that had actually yet to happen, Speers suggested \u201cthere might be a collapse in China, there might be another terrible drought \u2026 things can happen that could prevent you actually achieving this\u201d. The treasurer responded by arguing: \u201cWell this is not a wafer thin surplus. This is a very significant surplus.\u201d Don\u2019t expect to hear such arguments being made now. Now the talk is of things outside the control of the government \u2013 indeed they will use all the arguments they criticised the ALP for making when the GFC smashed the economy and the budget. Hypocrisy? Yep. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 we actually want them to be hypocrites, it is better for the nation if they are \u2013 so long as it is this brand of hypocrisy. The absolute worst thing the government could do right now is desperately try to deliver a surplus. Forget stories such as those that appeared on the front page of the Australian this week about new taxes \u2013 nothing on the revenue side will help the government now because any new taxes will only come into effect next financial year at the earliest. But they can stop spending right now. The only reason the government has been able to project a surplus is because they project that they will be awash with tax revenue. The government was not projecting a budget surplus because of big austerity campaigns, but because of factors outside their control that looked set to deliver a massive increase in tax. In the face of less than expected revenue, the only way to still deliver a surplus is to cut government spending \u2013 but that would further reduce economic activity and thus further reduce revenue, which would necessitate further cuts. The smart thing to do is to accept a budget deficit, because that will help keep the economy afloat. Will the government attempt to sell such a move with hypocritical statements? For sure. But that is better than the alternative. And so it is with climate change. Members of the LNP have spent more than a decade warning about not getting ahead of the rest of the world, or that a carbon price is actually a tax, or that we need to think more about adaptation than lowering emissions, or that electric cars will kill weekends or that renewable energy will deliver blackouts. It would be a measure of gross hypocrisy for them now to start shouting about the need to do more on emissions, that we need to lead the world and we need to put a price on carbon and to stop faffing about. The LNP account for around 99% of everyone in Australian politics who is to blame for the lost decade of climate change policy inaction. Were they to turn around now and argue there is no time to waste, we would be able to fill the MCG with print outs of transcripts that demonstrate their hypocrisy. And yet, bring it on. Because while hypocrisy should be addressed, I would much prefer the hypocrisy of a Liberal party pretending that their past actions did not contradict their new outlook on climate change than the current version we have of the LNP saying we need to do something but then purposefully and perpetually doing the opposite. The hypocrisy of their position on the budget surplus looks to have been forced on them. With luck all sides may use this as a moment to remember that it is actually true that \u201cthe surplus has never been an end in itself\u201d. And on climate change we can only hope the LNP discover a new fragrance of hypocrisy. Yes it would be best if they were to admit their errors, and apologise for the past decade of waste that has cost us all so greatly. But if they start to act on reducing emissions and actually do attempt to lead the world, then I\u2019ll take the emissions cuts and live with the hypocrisy.",

The company\u2019s president and chief executive, Yoshinori Isozaki, said in a statement the company recognised the \u201cchallenges of operating in frontier markets\u201d and was working to improve its practices. \u201cHuman rights is fundamental to all of our business activities \u2026 we are reviewing strategic options for our operations in Myanmar.\u201d Kirin\u2019s review of its partnership with the Myanmar military is being led by its international advisory board, whose members include Australians Sir Rod Eddington and Paula Dwyer.

Kirin was named in a United Nations fact-finding mission report as having donated money to the Myanmar military \u2013 known as the Tatmadaw. The donations came at a time the military sought to raise money it then used in so-called \u201cclearance operations\u201d against the Rohingya, which included mass murder, including of children, gang rape, torching of villages in a scorched earth policy, and widespread systemic torture.

In addition to the direct donations, totalling about US$12,000 ($17,000), the report warned that Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited\u2019s (MEHL) revenue was funnelled to the military, further enabling the armed forces\u2019 crackdown against the country\u2019s minority Rohingya. The UN report said \u201cany engagement in any form\u201d with the Myanmar military was \u201cindefensible\u201d. Isozaki said Kirin had met with the management of MEHL to discuss the UN fact-finding report. \u201cWe have requested that MEHL provide Kirin with updated details on MEHL\u2019s financial and governance structures. \u201cThe Kirin Group takes its responsibilities in Myanmar seriously and will take necessary action to ensure our business activities in the region adhere to the highest standards. A further update on our position will be provided once Kirin has reviewed the information provided by MEHL.\u201d Australian craft beer brewer Lion Little World \u2013 a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kirin \u2013 faced criticism last year, when it took over a US craft brewer, over its parent company\u2019s association with the Tatmadaw. Lion Little World Beverages is the global craft beer division of Australasian brewer Lion, which brews beers such as XXXX, Tooheys, James Boag, James Squire and Little Creatures. In December, the employee shareholders of New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, approved its acquisition by Lion Little World. The New Belgium chief executive, Kim Jordan, said the company was \u201cdedicated to being a force for good\u201d, but others in the Fort Collins community, and around the world, condemned the deal. \u201cThe sale of New Belgium to the conglomerate of Lion Little World Beverages and Kirin is shameful,\u201d the Fort Collins Community Action Network wrote in an open letter. \u201cYou must certainly know that Kirin has been internationally condemned for its human rights abuses and connection to ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.\u201d Also in December, Myanmar\u2019s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi \u2013 whose father, the independence hero General Aung San, is regarded as the founder of the country\u2019s military \u2013 appeared before the international court of justice in The Hague to respond to charges of genocide over the military\u2019s campaign that drove 700,000 members of ethnic and religious minority Rohingya community to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. Suu Kyi acknowledged in court there may have been some war crimes or crimes against humanity but insisted they did not rise to the level of genocide. She also maintained Myanmar\u2019s official line that the crackdown on the Rohingya was a legitimate military operation, not aimed at civilians but at armed Muslim militants in Rakhine state. The UN fact-finding mission urged the international community to cut off all financial support to Myanmar\u2019s military, saying its commanders needed to be isolated and brought before a credible court to answer charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. \u201cThe actions of the Tatmadaw (Burmese military) in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states, in particular in the context of the \u2018clearance operations\u2019 in northern Rakhine state in 2016 and 2017, have so seriously violated international law that any engagement in any form with the Tatmadaw, its current leadership, and its businesses, is indefensible,\u201d it said.",

      "body": "<p>The greatest mistake opponents of Boris Johnson made was assuming he couldn\u2019t threaten British democracy because \u201che wants to be loved\u201d. He\u2019s a performing <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boris-johnson-hospital-public-whipps-cross-no-deal-brexit-a9111051.html\" title=\"\">clown</a>, they told us, a needy celebrity who just wants to hear the audience\u2019s applause. They did not grasp that there is no more dangerous desire than the need for others to love you. When love is refused, the needy turn nasty. What is an egomaniacal fault in the actor or the singer becomes a public menace when a celebrity assumes power.</p> <p>Democratic politicians should not expect to be loved. The best they should hope for is the respect of a part of the electorate and a modicum of sympathy from the historians of the future. When they demand love, instead of earning respect, they see the usual constraints of a free society as insults. The personal becomes political. The neurotic strongman casts himself as the embodiment of the people\u2019s will. All who question him are insulting the nation he, in his vainglory, thinks he personifies.</p> <p>You can feel the craving for affection in Johnson\u2019s willingness to promote nobodies who love him (or can pretend to love him) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-any-self-respecting-minister-would-reject-pms-demands-video\" title=\"\">sack Conservative</a> politicians with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/13/irish-pm-says-sacked-northern-ireland-secretary-julian-smith-one-of-britains-finest\" title=\"\">spirit to argue back</a>. Johnson\u2019s Britain is closer to an absolute monarchy than a democracy. And palace politics always leads to mediocrity, sycophancy and, in the end, ignominy. Fear replaces intellect as the motor of public life. Acquiescent courtiers push aside the talented and the independent-minded.</p> <p>In 2005, <a href=\"https://montgomery.dartmouth.edu/doris-kearns-goodwin\" title=\"\">Doris Kearns Goodwin</a> won the Pulitzer prize for <em>Team of Rivals</em>, her account of how Abraham Lincoln persuaded Republican party adversaries to join his government, win the American civil war and abolish slavery. Johnson does not want a team of rivals. He wants a team of toadies. For only toadies will give him the love he needs.</p> <p>Opposition politicians and ordinary citizens remain free to denounce Johnson in the strongest terms. But they cannot threaten him. Anyone who can hears a voice familiar to all who have lived in dictatorships or worked for bosses who are dictators of the workplace. \u201cI know you think I\u2019m a jerk. I know you find me obscene. But I know that you know that you can never say so.\u201d</p> <p>In a perfect example of the humiliating subservience demanded by unconstrained power, Dominic Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/dominic-cummings-answers-hs2-questions-with-pj-masks-quotes\" title=\"\">told reporters</a> asking about high-speed rail last week: \u201cThe night time is the right time to fight crime. I can\u2019t think of a rhyme.\u201d</p> <p>What?</p> <p>\u201cI thinks we need PJ Masks,\u201d he continued as he babbled catchphrases from a children\u2019s television show. \u201cPJ Masks. They\u2019re your guys.\u201d</p> <p>The journalists might have told Cummings to go to hell. (I would have used stronger language.) They might have said that as chief special adviser to the prime minister he should uphold the dignity of his office. But just as Donald Trump believes the Republican base so loves him, \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/01/23/trump_i_could_stand_in_the_middle_of_fifth_avenue_and_shoot_somebody_and_i_wouldnt_lose_any_voters.html\" title=\"\">shoot somebody</a> and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters\u201d, so Cummings and Johnson believe Conservative voters so love them that there\u2019s nothing they cannot do. And if reporters don\u2019t love them back, Cummings and Johnson have shown that they will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/03/political-journalists-boycott-no-10-briefing-after-reporter-ban\" title=\"\">ban them from receiving government briefings</a> and ban ministers from appearing on their radio and television shows.</p> <p>Let one incident illustrate how freedom rots in countries where the leader wants to be loved. Last week, the unlikely figure of the Rt Hon Lady Justice Simler drove Johnson and Cummings to fury when she failed to show them the affection they are owed. Simler\u2019s decision at the court of appeal to temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/judicial-review-home-office-deportation-flight-jamaica\" title=\"\">halt the deportation of Jamaican criminals</a> produced <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/court-of-appeal-deportation-flight-jamaica-downing-street-anger-a4359211.html\" title=\"\">\u201cmolten anger\u201d</a> in No 10. Cummings said it was \u201ca perfect symbol of the British state\u2019s dysfunction\u201d and promised \u201curgent action on the farce that judicial review has become\u201d. He talked more sense when he gibbered about PJ Masks, but I doubt many realised it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b65ab49a3cd9855561864ea3db369798fd6610d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b65ab49a3cd9855561864ea3db369798fd6610d/0_115_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings: he and \u2018Johnson believe Conservative voters so love them that there\u2019s nothing they cannot do\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mirzoeff/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Johnson administration wanted the public to believe that the courts had intervened in politics. After the Windrush scandal, Labour MPs pointed out that a portion of the \u201cJamaican criminals\u201d were Jamaican in name only. They had been in Britain since they were children and the government was dumping them in a foreign land. As it happens, the courts took precisely no notice of the political debate. The charity <a href=\"https://detentionaction.org.uk/2020/02/07/press-release-home-office-admits-mobile-phone-outage-affected-hundreds-in-immigration-detention-including-those-facing-jamaica-removal-flight/\" title=\"\">Detention Action</a> went to the court of appeal because the mobile phone system covering the immigration removal centres near Heathrow had been disrupted for weeks and inmates could not contact their lawyers.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s Home Office accepted the \u201cJamaicans\u201d were entitled to legal representation. But it was forced to admit that, with characteristic negligence, \u201calthough it became aware of the communications outage on 13 January, it did not begin issuing working SIM cards to all those scheduled to be removed from the country until 5 February\u201d.</p> <p>The right of access to a lawyer is not a politically correct fad imposed on the poor old Home Office by elitist, leftist judges. It is an old and basic protection against the over-mighty state. The founders of the United States included the right to counsel in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" title=\"\">sixth amendment</a> to the US constitution in 1791.

      "bodyText": "The greatest mistake opponents of Boris Johnson made was assuming he couldn\u2019t threaten British democracy because \u201che wants to be loved\u201d. He\u2019s a performing clown, they told us, a needy celebrity who just wants to hear the audience\u2019s applause. They did not grasp that there is no more dangerous desire than the need for others to love you. When love is refused, the needy turn nasty. What is an egomaniacal fault in the actor or the singer becomes a public menace when a celebrity assumes power. Democratic politicians should not expect to be loved. The best they should hope for is the respect of a part of the electorate and a modicum of sympathy from the historians of the future. When they demand love, instead of earning respect, they see the usual constraints of a free society as insults. The personal becomes political. The neurotic strongman casts himself as the embodiment of the people\u2019s will. All who question him are insulting the nation he, in his vainglory, thinks he personifies. You can feel the craving for affection in Johnson\u2019s willingness to promote nobodies who love him (or can pretend to love him) and sack Conservative politicians with the spirit to argue back. Johnson\u2019s Britain is closer to an absolute monarchy than a democracy. And palace politics always leads to mediocrity, sycophancy and, in the end, ignominy. Fear replaces intellect as the motor of public life. Acquiescent courtiers push aside the talented and the independent-minded. In 2005, Doris Kearns Goodwin won the Pulitzer prize for Team of Rivals, her account of how Abraham Lincoln persuaded Republican party adversaries to join his government, win the American civil war and abolish slavery. Johnson does not want a team of rivals. He wants a team of toadies. For only toadies will give him the love he needs. Opposition politicians and ordinary citizens remain free to denounce Johnson in the strongest terms. But they cannot threaten him. Anyone who can hears a voice familiar to all who have lived in dictatorships or worked for bosses who are dictators of the workplace. \u201cI know you think I\u2019m a jerk. I know you find me obscene. But I know that you know that you can never say so.\u201d In a perfect example of the humiliating subservience demanded by unconstrained power, Dominic Cummings told reporters asking about high-speed rail last week: \u201cThe night time is the right time to fight crime. I can\u2019t think of a rhyme.\u201d What? \u201cI thinks we need PJ Masks,\u201d he continued as he babbled catchphrases from a children\u2019s television show. \u201cPJ Masks. They\u2019re your guys.\u201d The journalists might have told Cummings to go to hell. (I would have used stronger language.) They might have said that as chief special adviser to the prime minister he should uphold the dignity of his office. But just as Donald Trump believes the Republican base so loves him, \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters\u201d, so Cummings and Johnson believe Conservative voters so love them that there\u2019s nothing they cannot do. And if reporters don\u2019t love them back, Cummings and Johnson have shown that they will ban them from receiving government briefings and ban ministers from appearing on their radio and television shows. Let one incident illustrate how freedom rots in countries where the leader wants to be loved. Last week, the unlikely figure of the Rt Hon Lady Justice Simler drove Johnson and Cummings to fury when she failed to show them the affection they are owed. Simler\u2019s decision at the court of appeal to temporarily halt the deportation of Jamaican criminals produced \u201cmolten anger\u201d in No 10. Cummings said it was \u201ca perfect symbol of the British state\u2019s dysfunction\u201d and promised \u201curgent action on the farce that judicial review has become\u201d. He talked more sense when he gibbered about PJ Masks, but I doubt many realised it. The Johnson administration wanted the public to believe that the courts had intervened in politics. After the Windrush scandal, Labour MPs pointed out that a portion of the \u201cJamaican criminals\u201d were Jamaican in name only. They had been in Britain since they were children and the government was dumping them in a foreign land. As it happens, the courts took precisely no notice of the political debate. The charity Detention Action went to the court of appeal because the mobile phone system covering the immigration removal centres near Heathrow had been disrupted for weeks and inmates could not contact their lawyers. Johnson\u2019s Home Office accepted the \u201cJamaicans\u201d were entitled to legal representation. But it was forced to admit that, with characteristic negligence, \u201calthough it became aware of the communications outage on 13 January, it did not begin issuing working SIM cards to all those scheduled to be removed from the country until 5 February\u201d. The right of access to a lawyer is not a politically correct fad imposed on the poor old Home Office by elitist, leftist judges. It is an old and basic protection against the over-mighty state. The founders of the United States included the right to counsel in the sixth amendment to the US constitution in 1791. British courts have recognised the right of defendants to have a lawyer represent them since the middle of the 18th century. Geoffrey Cox, as the attorney general, said ministers must not use the case as an excuse to rush \u201cheadlong\u201d into the \u201cimpetuous reform\u201d of the judicial system. Johnson promptly sacked him to make way for Suella Braverman, a nobody lawyer who showed the depth of her love for Johnson when she said that the Tory state must take power from the courts. If you are a judge, journalist, civil servant, Conservative MP or British citizen who needs the protection of the law, you should get ready for what is coming. If you challenge the lovelorn Johnson, he will hate you and do all he can to destroy you. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "A millionaire fashion executive accused of raping 10 women and girls at his Bahamas mansion reportedly hosted Prince Andrew and his family at the property in 2000. A class action lawsuit lodged in New York City claims that Peter Nygard lured \u201cyoung, impressionable, and often impoverished children and women\u201d to his Bahamas property with cash payments and promises of modeling opportunities, only to then \u201cassault, rape, and sodomize them\u201d. Nygard, 78, has hosted celebrities and politicians at the property, near the Bahamian capital of Nassau. Photos credited to Nygard\u2019s website appear to show such visitors included Prince Andrew, accompanied by his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their two daughters, 20 years ago. One photo shows Nygard talking with a shorts-wearing Andrew as the two stroll together. In another picture Nygard is posing with Sarah and her daughters, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice. The link is a potential further embarrassment for Prince Andrew, who has stepped back from public duties following an outcry over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and sex offender who died in a New York cell last year as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The prince, who has withdrawn from public life, categorically denies any form of sexual misconduct and has insisted he is \u201cwilling to help any appropriate law enforcement agency\u201d investigating matters relating to Epstein. Prince Andrew is not the subject of any alleged wrongdoing in connection with the proceedings against Nygard. The Canadian businessman\u2019s eponymous fashion empire has made him a multimillionaire. He has been previously accused of sexual harassment and tax evasion. In 2018, Bahamian authorities seized his mansion, Nygard Cay, following a legal battle with environmental groups over plans to dredge the sea floor in order to expand the property\u2019s size. This latest lawsuit, lodged by US law firm DiCello Levitt Gutzler, alleges that Nygard used his powerful position, along with drugs, alcohol and physical force, to lure girls as young as 14-years-old to \u201cpamper parties\u201d and then rape them. Of the 10 people cited as victims in the lawsuit, eight were teenage girls and two were adult employees on the Nassau estate. At least two of the alleged victims required medical treatment following their ordeals, the lawsuit states. Nygard\u2019s company is also a target of the lawsuit which accuses it of essentially committing sex trafficking by abetting and covering up the actions of its founder and chairman. Threats and bribery were used to prevent the rapes from being reported, the complaint alleges. A spokesman for Nygard has denied the claims in the lawsuit, telling the New York Post they are \u201cjust the latest in a 10-plus-year string of attempts to try to destroy the reputation of a man through false statements. The allegations are completely false, without foundation, and are vigorously denied.\u201d The Guardian contacted Nygard\u2019s company for comment and also attempted to put questions to Buckingham Palace.",

It\u2019s one of my strengths when I play well.\u201d England lost the opening game in East London by one run when they seemed on course while South Africa lost by two runs on Friday after also looking like a late burst would see them home. \u201cIt is a different type of pressure, chasing is always harder,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cIt was a better wicket here. No wind really and a smaller ground. So you have to take those things into consideration.\u201d The challenge for England is to become champions at both white-ball formats, after last year\u2019s 50-over success. Moeen believes that it is within the team\u2019s capabilities. \u201cOne hundred per cent. That\u2019s what we\u2019re gunning for. There are players who have won the Ashes and won the 50-over World Cup and this is our target, for sure. We were so close in India and that still hurts us as a team. You look back and think we could have won that one, but hopefully we\u2019ll win the next one.\u201d This will be Moeen\u2019s last England game before the summer, as he chose not to make himself available for next month\u2019s Tests in Sri Lanka. \u201cI want to give myself a bit more time. I want to make sure. Test cricket is not a place for tired minds or if you\u2019re not fully into it. It is the hardest format by a mile and I want to make sure when I come back that I\u2019m at my best.\u201d Keaton Jennings (141) and Dominic Sibley (103), who are going to Sri Lanka, made centuries as England Lions started their match against a Cricket Australia XI in Hobart. Dan Lawrence was 103 not out in a total of 367 for four.",

His first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/03/my-cat-yugoslavia-pajtim-statovci-review\" title=\"\"><em>My Cat Yugoslavia</em></a>, won the prestigious Helsingin Sanomat literature prize for the best Finnish debut. In 2016 he won the Toisinkoinen literature prize, awarded for second novels, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/07/crossing-pajtim-statovci-review\" title=\"\"><em>Crossing</em></a>, the story of two teenage boys trying to leave post-communist Albania. In <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/the-story-of-a-queer-european-refugee-who-insists-on-self-invention\" title=\"\">a review</a> in the <em>New Yorker</em>, Garth Greenwell compared its main character, a pathological liar who exploits assumptions about victimhood, to \u201canother queer criminal, Patricia Highsmith\u2019s Tom Ripley\u201d. In 2018 Statovci won the Helsinki writer of the year award. <em>Crossing</em> is out in paperback next month.</p> <p><strong>Your first novel, <em>My Cat Yugoslavia</em>, featured a racist, homophobic talking cat. Why did you turn away from magic realism in <em>Crossing</em>?</strong><br>There\u2019s something very liberating about magic realism. It doesn\u2019t care about rules. But operating inside the universe of a magic realist novel can be hard for both writer and reader: it\u2019s so easy to get lost in the pool of metaphors. In <em>Crossing</em> I wanted to tell a more rational story. In this book there\u2019s a fair amount of fear, violence, desperation and unfulfilment, which stems from a sense of not belonging, and shame.</p> <p><strong>Was that your own experience?</strong><br>At the age of seven I started attending a Finnish school. Even though I didn\u2019t have my own memories of life in Kosovo, to my peers I became the face of my culture as the media kept covering the stories of tragedy and violence. I didn\u2019t want pity. I learned that it\u2019s one thing to say you are French or English, and another to say you come from a country with a wounded history. To not stand out, I tried to hide my Albanian background [his parents are Albanian]. It\u2019s the starting point of <em>Crossing</em>. The two boys of the book, pierced by the same shame, spend their lives trying to run away from it. One of them, Bujar, ends up stealing other people\u2019s lives, hopes and dreams.</p> <p><strong>We can\u2019t pin him down. He\u2019s a victim but also an aggressor\u2026</strong><br>One of the biggest challenges in creating this shape-shifting, trickster-like character was: how much can the reader digest? It\u2019s sad that it\u2019s rather common for victims of oppression to adapt to it. It takes so much more strength to fight for what is right, and many people don\u2019t have the fortitude for it. Violence follows violence. People who are victims of violence sometimes become guilty of violent acts.</p> <p><strong>Does writing about migration bring any particular responsibility?</strong><br>The two protagonists of <em>Crossing</em> believe life in a western country is better than their life outside it. I wanted to show the brutality of being forced to start over in a new place, having to battle against prejudice. I\u2019ve been asked countless times about the gratitude I feel towards Finland for giving me and my family shelter. I\u2019m grateful, of course. But demanding gratitude is hurtful because it ignores the traumas of one\u2019s personal life. The requirement of gratitude many migrants face feels so dismissive, unfair and disrespecting.</p> <p>I don\u2019t tell a story to preach. But you can\u2019t control how readers read: when I published my first book in Finland, there were pieces about me and my work saying things like \u201cto a migrant Finland is cold and racist\u201d.</p> <p><strong>At one point in the novel Bujar</strong><strong> enters a reality</strong><strong> show talent contest\u2026</strong><br>Being on television used to be an achievement; the cameras weren\u2019t filming just anyone. Then the people behind the camera started shooting ordinary people and presenting them in more and more alarming ways. There\u2019s one show where a group of couples travel to a remote island where they are tested on whether they cheat on their loved ones\u2026 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more worrying: that people are treated like this, that people want to take part, or that viewers keep consuming these stories. I wanted to dive into this world with a character who is aware of the mechanics by which producers carefully select a point of view. Bujar makes up a backstory he thinks they want, and participates in the competition as someone else after they reject him when he auditions as himself.</p> <p><strong><em>Crossing</em>\u2019s original Finnish title translates as <em>Heart of Tirana</em>\u2026</strong><br>That wasn\u2019t ambiguous enough in English. When my US editor called to tell me he had <em>Crossing</em> in mind, I immediately said yes \u2013 this word in all its meanings truly captures the essence of a book about shifting borders, fluid identities, about the complexity of gender, sexuality and nationality, and the right to self-definition.</p> <p><strong>Tell us which other Finnish writers we should be reading.</strong><br>Rosa Liksom, Olli Jalonen and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/18/sofi-oksanen-interview-russia-finland-estonia-putin\" title=\"\">Sofi Oksanen</a> are all fascinating and highly original.

The truth was finally discovered in 1959. Court documents tucked away in a descendant\u2019s attic revealed that Richard\u2019s 23-year-old father, Samuel More, the owner of two large estates in Shropshire, had accused his 31-year-old wife Katharine of adultery with a local yeoman farmer.</p> <p>Samuel and Katharine were second cousins, and Brogden thinks they are likely to have had an arranged, or even a forced, marriage in 1610, in order to keep Katharine\u2019s estate within the family.

Events planned in July and September to celebrate the Shropshire Mayflower children include talks, a play, an evening of 17th-century choral music and a guided walk from the village where Katharine\u2019s lover lived towards the More ancestral home. There will be a display of documents, pictures and objects relating to the children in a museum in Much Wenlock, and Brogden is raising funds via a Justgiving page to erect a brass plaque dedicated to the children.",

On Saturday the rightwing Drudge Report website caused a stir when it said \u201csources close to the Bloomberg campaign\u201d said he was considering Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate beaten by Trump in 2016, as his running mate this year. But with such increasing prominence, fuelled in part by a massive TV and Facebook advertising effort, has come increasing scrutiny of the former Republican\u2019s record in office and his comments and views. In one comment printed in the 1990 booklet, the businessman turned politician is said to have said of Britain\u2019s royal family: \u201cWhat a bunch of misfits \u2013 a gay, an architect, that horsey faced lesbian, and a kid who gave up Koo Stark for some fat broad.\u201d The tone of the comment \u2013 seemingly about Prince Edward, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and the scandal-ridden Prince Andrew \u2013 is typical of a booklet which a female aide presented when Bloomberg, now 78, was celebrating his 48th birthday. Of the Bloomberg Terminal, the computer system on which a fortune estimated at $60bn was built, Bloomberg is quoted as saying: \u201cIt will do everything, including give you a blowjob. I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.\u201d He is also quoted as comparing \u201ca good salesperson\u201d to \u201cthe guy who goes into a bar, and walks up to every gorgeous girl there, and says, \u2018Do you want to fuck?\u2019 He gets turned down a lot \u2013 but he gets fucked a lot, too!\u201d Attempts to contact Buckingham Palace for comment were unsuccessful. The Post said Bloomberg declined to be interviewed. A spokesman was quoted as saying: \u201cMike openly admits that his words have not always aligned with his values and the way he has led his life and some of what he has said is disrespectful and wrong. \u201cMike simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift, which has been circulating for 30 years and has been quoted in every previous election Mike has been in.\u201d In September 2001, however, when Bloomberg first ran for mayor in New York, a position he would fill for three terms, the New York Daily News quoted a spokesman as saying: \u201cSome of the things he might have said. He says he can\u2019t recall saying many of the things he was asked about.\u201d Bloomberg was also reported to have called the remarks a \u201cbunch of Borscht Belt jokes\u201d. The publication of the booklet comes during a Democratic primary influenced by the #MeToo movement, which seeks redress against men in positions of power accused of mistreating women. Trump has enraged opponents with offensive remarks about women and minorities, as well as his history of accusations of sexual misconduct and assault. Bloomberg has been taken to court by a number of female employees. \u201cA number of the cases,\u201d the Post said, \u201chave either been settled, dismissed in Bloomberg\u2019s favour or closed because of a failure of the plaintiff to meet filing deadlines. \u201cThe cases do not involve accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct; the allegations have centred around what Bloomberg has said and about the workplace culture he fostered.\u201d The Post report also quoted a witness as saying Bloomberg told a female employee who was pregnant to \u201ckill it\u201d, a claim his spokesman denied. On the campaign trail, Bloomberg has faced criticism from the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren for refusing to release female former employees from non-disclosure agreements. In January, the billionaire told ABC News: \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk away from it. They\u2019re legal agreements, and for all I know the other side wouldn\u2019t want to get out of it.\u201d \u201cWe can always do better,\u201d Bloomberg said, adding: \u201cI can parade out a whole bunch of any group that you want that will tell you [the company is] a great place to work.\u201d On Saturday, accompanying the release of a video of testimonials from female employees, Bloomberg said on Twitter: \u201cI would not be where I am today without the talented women around me. I\u2019ve depended on their leadership, their advice and their contributions. As I\u2019ve demonstrated throughout my career, I will always be a champion for women in the workplace.\u201d In a statement to the Post, Patricia Harris, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign chair, said: \u201cIn any large organisation there are going to be complaints \u2013 but Mike has never tolerated any kind of discrimination or harassment, and he\u2019s created cultures that are all about equality and inclusion.\u201d In the 1990 booklet, Bloomberg is quoted as saying: \u201cWhenever my wife catches me eyeing some broad, she\u2019s very careful to turn to me and say \u2018That\u2019s the most expensive piece of ass in the world!\u2019\u201d",

Soon afterwards, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 only just hooked away from Molina, worried whistles following from the stands. The ball had been Barcelona\u2019s, perhaps, but the game was not. And then, suddenly, it was. A wonderful, deft touch from Messi unlocked the area for Griezmann to cleverly steer past Soria after 33 minutes. It was the sixth successive Barcelona goal assisted by Messi but there would not be a seventh. Junior delivered for Sergi Roberto to score the second, the disbelieving look on Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s face telling a story. Not that he gave up. Getafe sent on Kenedy and \u00c1ngel \u2013 the striker Barcelona may yet sign as an emergency replacement for Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 \u2013 and if they were still doubting his value, he offered them a superb side-footed volley. It was his 10th goal of the season, nine off the bench, and one he did not really celebrate. A calling card, perhaps; a call to action, certainly. Revived, Getafe came at Barcelona again. There was belief now \u2013 and then disbelief when Ter Stegen somehow slapped the ball away from Mata on the line. Nerves returned, a few more whistles too. Griezmann could have eased them when he blasted wildly over first and well wide next. Between those two chances Piqu\u00e9 pulled on \u00c1ngel\u2019s shirt as the striker pressed, stole possession and headed into the area alone. There was a game on here, that was for sure. There just was not much time to play it. With a minute left Messi bent a shot wide. It was his 33rd in a row without a goal and no one else would get one either. Surveying the scene, aware of how they had suffered, Barcelona settled for that.",

      "bodyText": "Sabri Lamouchi, the Nottingham Forest manager, called for the Championship to embrace VAR as his team capped off a turbulent week by holding the leaders to a draw. After a physical, contentious game, the result was decided in the dying minutes by a searing strike from Matty Cash after almost endless pressure from the home side. Callum Robinson had scored the opening goal with a smooth finish after a moment of magic by Matheus Pereira before Kyle Bartley and Tobias Figueiredo traded own goals. In the end, Cash denied the league leaders a fourth straight win that would have put them six points clear at the top and there was still time for drama even deeper into injury time, with Robinson\u2019s effort ruled out for offside despite the ball hitting his teammate Bartley when over the line. \u201cTo come back two times and to come back in the game with this kind of scenario, with some wrong decisions, proud about the performance, proud about the mentality, personality and never giving up,\u201d said Lamouchi. \u201cThis league is just a crazy league and we need to be consistent until the end. Never give up. Believe in your chances like the players have done this afternoon.\u201d Lamouchi was criticised in the lead-up to the game for his decision to rotate his squad in their midweek loss to Charlton, meaning even more was resting on this meeting. The game\u2019s importance was reflected in a contentious opening 20 minutes as tackles flew in from every direction. Pereira, Cash and Yuri Ribeiro all hit the floor under heavy challenges. Words were exchanged and points made, and the staccato start did not benefit the home team as their early pressure became sterile. Throughout the season, Pereira has demonstrated that he can create anything from anywhere and it took a typically transformative moment from nothing to invigorate his impotent team. Samba Sow was unhurriedly carrying the ball forward when suddenly it was snatched from him. By the time Sow looked down, Pereira had burst forward and slipped a lovely ball to Robinson, who was composed with his far-post finish. Before the match, Lamouchi responded to anticipation of West Brom dominating possession with a simple phrase: \u201cPossession is not the most important thing.\u201d By the end of the first half West Brom\u2019s possession had topped 64% but Forest took their time and generated chances themselves, rallying each time to peg back the league leaders. The home side seemed to settle into the second half, generating wave after wave of pressure before finally converting their second goal after Jake Livermore\u2019s wicked cross rolled through the legs of two players, hit the Forest defender Figueiredo and went into his own goal. West Brom celebrated while the away team raged that a foul had not been called at the beginning of the move after Sammy Ameobi was taken down in the buildup. Lamouchi said the blame did not rest on the shoulders of the referee, instead calling for VAR to be used in the Championship. \u201cI\u2019m so surprised because we play football but not with the same rules,\u201d he said. \u201cPremier League play with the VAR and without the VAR, you can finish some games with this tension. \u201cSome referees can make mistakes, like some managers. Probably I did some mistakes on Tuesday and probably more in the season. So, we should understand that and help them.\u201d The goal did not stop West Brom from chasing a third to kill the game, nor did it weaken Forest\u2019s resolve.

      "body": "<p>Disabled and chronically ill benefit claimants who were left thousands of pounds out of pocket by a government error may have also been overcharged by their local authorities for social care, it has emerged.</p> <p>At least 110,000 benefit claimants were underpaid an average of \u00a35,000 following a botched overhaul of incapacity benefits which began in 2011, according to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esa-underpayments-progress-on-checking-january-2020/january-2020-esa-underpayments-forecast-numbers-affected-forecast-expenditure-and-progress-on-checking\">the latest figures</a>.</p> <p>The error occurred when Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) officials transferred people from older benefits on to the wrong kind of employment support allowance (ESA), meaning they missed out on premium payments they were eligible for.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that, as a knock-on effect, the error will have skewed financial assessments many councils undertake to determine how much these claimants should have contributed towards their social care costs.</p> <p>Pat Sawh, 65, has received a refund of more than \u00a32,000 from Enfield council, in north London, which is believed to be the first to begin addressing this issue. Her sons Stephen, 31, and Kris, 29, both have autism, while Stephen also has epilepsy and multiple allergies.</p> <p>\u201cBoth my sons still live at home and my husband and I are pensioners,\u201d she said. \u201cThis extra money is helping them a lot \u2013 without it they could not do as much.\u201d</p> <p>Wendy Berry, 75, helps run a group for carers of learning disabled adults in Enfield and helped Sawh bring her case to the attention of the council.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem with this issue is that councils probably do not even realise that the DWP error had an impact on social care charging. It is very complicated. We suspect that very few councils have really thought about it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cCharging for social care is always a difficult area because it takes money from the disability benefits paid to the most vulnerable people, who need support to live in their own homes. To ensure people are paying what they are supposed to be paying is critical.\u201d</p> <p>Enfield council has since sent letters to other residents it suspects have been affected by this issue, which could number as many as 200 people, according documents seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>In 2014, local authorities <a href=\"https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/charging-community-care\">gained the power</a> to introduce charges to recoup costs they incur from contracting care and support services. These charges are typically deducted from the benefits of people receiving social care.</p> <p>Councils who charge must conduct financial assessments to ensure that they do not cause a person\u2019s income to drop below the statutory minimum set by <a href=\"https://mylife.enfield.gov.uk/media/25120/minimum-income-guarantee-web-breakdown.pdf\">the Department of Health</a> (pdf), although they also have discretion to have more generous charging rules.</p> <p>Many, though not all, councils now charge for adult social care. Among the factors considered when calculating a person\u2019s minimum income guarantee is whether they are receiving a premium, such as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/disability-premiums/what-youll-get\">enhanced disability premium</a>.</p> <p>Those who, like the Sawhs, missed out on premiums because the DWP transferred them on to the wrong type of ESA, may have had a reduced minimum income guarantee. As a result, they may have been overcharged for care by their local authority.</p> <p>While the DWP has compensated those who missed out on premiums \u2013 to the tune of \u00a35,000 on average \u2013 there appears to have been no government effort to address this knock-on effect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/11/universal-credit-could-steamroll-vulnerable-into-poverty-salvation-army\">Universal credit could 'steamroll vulnerable into poverty'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Marsha de Cordova, the Labour MP and disability rights campaigner, said: \u201cThis is a scandal. It is a responsibility of the DWP to ensure that all local authorities are compensating or refunding any ill or disabled persons affected.</p> <p>\u201cI would worry for the ill and disabled people that have fallen into debt, destitution or poverty because of this error by the DWP.\u201d</p> <p>Kamran Mallick, Disability Rights UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cNow that the DWP have finally recognised the thousands of disabled people who have been underpaid ESA, we urge local authorities to refund the overpaid charges for social care that have been paid by many of these same disabled people.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s monstrous that many of the poorest people in our society have faced a double whammy of not receiving their full entitlement and being hit by social care overcharging.\u201d</p> <p>A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWe have worked hard to ensure that all those entitled to ESA receive the benefits they are entitled to.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge anyone who believes their social care payments may have been affected by this issue to contact their local council.\u201d</p> <p>Figures released last month revealed that 5,000 people died before they could be reimbursed for the DWP\u2019s ESA error.</p> <p>Enfield council was contacted for comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Disabled and chronically ill benefit claimants who were left thousands of pounds out of pocket by a government error may have also been overcharged by their local authorities for social care, it has emerged. At least 110,000 benefit claimants were underpaid an average of \u00a35,000 following a botched overhaul of incapacity benefits which began in 2011, according to the latest figures. The error occurred when Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) officials transferred people from older benefits on to the wrong kind of employment support allowance (ESA), meaning they missed out on premium payments they were eligible for. The Guardian understands that, as a knock-on effect, the error will have skewed financial assessments many councils undertake to determine how much these claimants should have contributed towards their social care costs. Pat Sawh, 65, has received a refund of more than \u00a32,000 from Enfield council, in north London, which is believed to be the first to begin addressing this issue. Her sons Stephen, 31, and Kris, 29, both have autism, while Stephen also has epilepsy and multiple allergies. \u201cBoth my sons still live at home and my husband and I are pensioners,\u201d she said. \u201cThis extra money is helping them a lot \u2013 without it they could not do as much.\u201d Wendy Berry, 75, helps run a group for carers of learning disabled adults in Enfield and helped Sawh bring her case to the attention of the council. \u201cThe problem with this issue is that councils probably do not even realise that the DWP error had an impact on social care charging. It is very complicated. We suspect that very few councils have really thought about it,\u201d she said. \u201cCharging for social care is always a difficult area because it takes money from the disability benefits paid to the most vulnerable people, who need support to live in their own homes. To ensure people are paying what they are supposed to be paying is critical.\u201d Enfield council has since sent letters to other residents it suspects have been affected by this issue, which could number as many as 200 people, according documents seen by the Guardian. In 2014, local authorities gained the power to introduce charges to recoup costs they incur from contracting care and support services. These charges are typically deducted from the benefits of people receiving social care. Councils who charge must conduct financial assessments to ensure that they do not cause a person\u2019s income to drop below the statutory minimum set by the Department of Health (pdf), although they also have discretion to have more generous charging rules. Many, though not all, councils now charge for adult social care. Among the factors considered when calculating a person\u2019s minimum income guarantee is whether they are receiving a premium, such as the enhanced disability premium. Those who, like the Sawhs, missed out on premiums because the DWP transferred them on to the wrong type of ESA, may have had a reduced minimum income guarantee. As a result, they may have been overcharged for care by their local authority. While the DWP has compensated those who missed out on premiums \u2013 to the tune of \u00a35,000 on average \u2013 there appears to have been no government effort to address this knock-on effect. Marsha de Cordova, the Labour MP and disability rights campaigner, said: \u201cThis is a scandal. It is a responsibility of the DWP to ensure that all local authorities are compensating or refunding any ill or disabled persons affected. \u201cI would worry for the ill and disabled people that have fallen into debt, destitution or poverty because of this error by the DWP.\u201d Kamran Mallick, Disability Rights UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cNow that the DWP have finally recognised the thousands of disabled people who have been underpaid ESA, we urge local authorities to refund the overpaid charges for social care that have been paid by many of these same disabled people. \u201cIt\u2019s monstrous that many of the poorest people in our society have faced a double whammy of not receiving their full entitlement and being hit by social care overcharging.\u201d A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWe have worked hard to ensure that all those entitled to ESA receive the benefits they are entitled to. \u201cWe urge anyone who believes their social care payments may have been affected by this issue to contact their local council.\u201d Figures released last month revealed that 5,000 people died before they could be reimbursed for the DWP\u2019s ESA error. Enfield council was contacted for comment.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s Clockwatch. Thanks for your company and emails - please join Scott Murray for Norwich v Liverpool. Still want more? Bet you do. League Two The leaders Swindon did not play - their match was postponed - and Exeter moved level on points with a dramatic 3-2 win at Macclesfield. Plymouth came from behind to beat Crewe 2-1 in the battle of the promotion contenders. League One Rotherham stay top despite a frustrating 2-2 draw at home to AFC Wimbledon. Coventry move up to second, level on points and with a game in hand, after a 2-0 win at Southampton. Championship Leeds were the only team in the top seven to win today. Fulham were hammered 3-0 at home by the bottom club Barnsley. Full time: Birmingham 1-1 Brentford Full time: Barcelona 2-1 Getafe It was a bit tense towards the end, but Barcelona held on to move level on points with the leaders Real Madrid. Full time: Leeds 1-0 Bristol City A big win for Leeds, only their second this year. Luke Ayling scored the only goal, though Leeds had enough chances to win by three or four. Kwesi Appiah has pinched a point for AFC Wimbledon. Barcelona 2-1 Getafe The League One leaders have come from 1-0 down at half-time to lead. They have been brilliant in the second half. It\u2019s now Fulham 0-3 Barnsley, with Cauley Woodrow getting his second. Sensational stuff! Championship Leeds are still the only team in the top seven who are ahead. The shock of the day is at Craven Cottage, where the bottom club Barnsley lead Fulham 2-0. The scoreline doesn\u2019t flatter them. Fleetwood are back in front, deservedly so according to the man on Sky Sports. Plymouth have come from behind to lead in the big League Two game. Angel has brought Getafe back into the match at the Nou Camp with a lovely goal. Championship QPR, who were 2-0 at home to Stoke, now lead 3-2. Bright Osayi-Samuel has put them ahead with a cracking goal. League One Doncaster\u2019s Cameron John has scored his second own goal of the afternoon at Priestfield. Gillingham lead 2-1, and John is one away from a very rare hat-trick. Bundesliga The five 2.30pm games have finished, with Leipzig\u2019s victory moving them to the top of the table. These are the final scores: Augsburg 1-1 Freiburg Hoffenheim 2-3 Wolfsburg Paderborn 1-2 Hertha Berlin RB Leipzig 3-0 Werder Bremen Union Berlin 2-3 Bayer Leverkusen Karim Bellarabi has won it for Leverkusen! League Two It\u2019s Plymouth 1-1 Crewe, with Luke Jephcott equalising for the home side. League One Matt Crooks has scored a deserved equaliser for Rotherham at home to AFC Wimbledon, while Callum O\u2019Hare has put Coventry ahead at Southend. Marius Bulter scores a dramatic late equaliser for Union Berlin! Dan Butler equalises for Peterborough in the big League One match. Championship Fulham are now trailing 2-0 at home to Barnsley, with Jacob Brown scoring early in the second half. One-nil! It\u2019s there! Serie A There was one early game in Italy, where Lecce beat the bottom club SPAL 2-1. Bundesliga RB Leipzig are 3-0 up and cruising to victory at home to Werder Bremen. They will go two points clear of Bayern Munich, who play at FC Koln tomorrow. League One As things stand, with Rotherham losing and Fleetwood winning, only five points separate the top eight. Now that\u2019s a competitive league. Bundesliga The match between Union Berlin and Leverkusen was suspended for a couple of minutes because of some pyrotechnics in the away end. Play has resumed now. These are the latest scores in our featured games (all 3pm kick-offs unless stated): Championship West Brom 2-2 Nottm Forest (FT) Birmingham City 1-1 Brentford Leeds United 1-0 Bristol City League One Rotherham 0-1 AFC Wimbledon League Two Plymouth 0-0 Crewe La Liga Barcelona 2-0 Getafe Bundesliga RB Leipzig 3-0 Werder Bremen (2.30pm) Union Berlin 1-1 Bayer Leverkusen (2.30pm) It\u2019s turning into a comfortable afternoon for Barcelona. For all their problems, they could be top of the league tonight. Championship There have been four goals in 12 minutes at Loftus Road. Stoke were 2-0 up against QPR; it\u2019s now 2-2. Antoine Griezmann, set up by Messi, puts Barcelona ahead with a classy finish. Nordi Mukiele has wrapped up for the points for RB Leipzig, who will wake up tomorrow morning as the Bundesliga leaders. The League One leaders are behind. It was a fine goal from Max Sanders, on loan from Brighton. It\u2019s been a good day for Leeds so far. They are winning at home to Bristol City and Fulham are 1-0 down at home to Barnsley. In fact, as of this precise moment, Leeds and Blackburn are the only teams in the top 15 of the Championship who are leading. Oh no he hasn\u2019t. VAR has struck again. Oh my. Allan Nyom, erstwhile West Brom full-back, has given Getafe the lead at the Nou Camp! That didn\u2019t take long. Ethan Pinnock heads Brentford level, four minutes after they went behind at Birmingham. Luke Ayling gives Leeds a deserved lead in the big game at Elland Road. Lukas Jutkiewicz has given the home side the lead against fourth-placed Brentford. It looks like Leipzig are going top of the Bundesliga. Patrik Schick has doubled their lead with a header from Dani Olmo\u2019s excellent corner. A few early goals to report Oxford 0-1 Sunderland Bristol Rovers 0-1 Blackpool Ipswich 0-1 Burton Hearts 0-1 Hamilton You can follow all of today\u2019s goals with our live scoreboard. Peep peep! The 3pm games are under way. Let us have some. The in-form Kai Havertz has equalised for Leverkusen. Leipzig, who will go top of the Bundesliga if they win today, are ahead. The right-back Lukas Klostermann got the goal, tapping home from close range after a free-kick from the right was knocked back across the area. A bad start for title-chasing Bayer Leverkusen, who have gone behind to a stonking goal from Christian Gentner. A pulsating finish at the Hawthorns, where West Brom had a goal disallowed for a dubious offside in the last minute of injury time. West Brom go seven points clear at the top, but it\u2019s Forest who are celebrating. Premier League: Southampton 1-2 Burnley Matej Vydra\u2019s storming goal gave Burnley an excellent victory at St Mary\u2019s. As a result they move into the top ten, ahead of Arsenal among others. Matty Cash has equalised for Forest in injury time! It was their first shot on target in the whole match (their first equaliser was an own goal) - and it was a screamer from Matty Cash, a spectacular rising drive into the far corner. League Two Swindon v Scunthorpe has been called off, just over an hour before the scheduled kick off. Tobias Figueiredo\u2019s unfortunate own goal has given West Brom the lead at the Hawthorns. It\u2019s a controversial goal, because Forest\u2019s Sammy Ameobi was clearly fouled in the build-up. Premier League There\u2019s been a third goal in the match between Southampton and Burnley. Can you resist this little bit of clickbait? Can you now? Oh. On the subject of that there Europe, Manchester City\u2019s European ban is front-page news. La Liga There\u2019s a really big game in Spain: 2nd v 3rd, also known as Barcelona v Getafe. A win would put Barcelona level on points with the leaders Real Madrid, who play at home to Celta Vigo tomorrow night. Bundesliga RB Leipzig will go top, at least for 24 hours, if they win at home to Werder Bremen. The leaders Bayern visit FC Koln tomorrow. Premier League It\u2019s also 1-1 in the lunchtime match between Southampton and Burnley. Scott Murray is on Danny Ingswatch. Championship There\u2019s a helluva promotion race developing, with only three points separating Leeds in second and Bristol City in seventh. And, as if by magic, they meet at Elland Road today. The leaders West Brom, who started the day six points clear, are at home to Nottingham Forest in the early game; it\u2019s 1-1 at half-time. Hello and welcome to another bumper Clockwatch.

We\u2019re going to focus on a few games, a grudging acknowledgement of the limitations of having only two hands, but you can see a full list of today\u2019s matches here. These are our featured games (all 3pm kick-offs unless stated): Championship West Brom v Nottingham Forest (12.30pm) Birmingham City v Brentford Leeds United v Bristol City League One Fleetwood Town v Peterborough United League Two Plymouth v Crewe La Liga Barcelona v Getafe Bundesliga RB Leipzig v Werder Bremen (2.30pm) Union Berlin v Bayer Leverkusen (2.30pm)",

      "body": "<p>Cho Nam-joo, 41, is a former television scriptwriter whose novel <em>Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982</em> became a hotly debated bestseller in South Korea when it was published in 2016, coinciding with the country\u2019s #MeToo movement. Now published in English, Cho\u2019s book uses the story of one woman to reveal gender inequality in all parts of South Korean society, from the privileging of male children to workplace discrimination and harassment. (Despite having the world\u2019s 12th largest economy, a recent gender gap report ranks South Korea 108 out of 153.) Cho lives with her family in Seoul. </p> <p><strong>What was the reaction to the book </strong><strong>in South Korea?</strong><br>Readers said they could really relate to the story \u2013 women said that it was like their own life. There were some cases where celebrities were attacked [online] for reading it. It provided an opportunity for public debate, so I have some pride for making a small contribution.</p> <p><strong>What was the #MeToo movement like in South Korea?</strong><br>In May 2016, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seocho-dong_public_toilet_murder_case\" title=\"\">a woman was murdered at Gangnam station</a>, and in October that year there were a lot of sexual harassment scandals in various areas of society, including literary circles and the arts. People started to speak about the horrors and threats women have felt \u2013 which had not been discussed earlier. Then a female prosecutor, Seo Ji-hyeon, participated in the #MeToo movement, revealing what she had experienced [during an interview on Korean television, Seo discussed her experience of being sexually harassed at work, a revelation that prompted other women to come forward].</p> <p><strong>Do you see things changing \u2013 or do young women face the same problems today?</strong><br>There is still sexual abuse and discrimination. Recently in the news, there was an applicant who couldn\u2019t get a job because the public officials gave her a lower score just because she was female. But there has been some change. Women have been protesting and petitioning; they have begun to gather in solidarity. Recently, it was ruled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/south-korean-court-rules-abortion-ban-must-be-lifted\" title=\"\">abortion being a crime was unconstitutional</a>. Although change is slow, I believe that we will not go backwards.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve said that your father and uncle struck a deal before you were born: had you been a boy, your uncle \u2014 who </strong><strong>already had five daughters \u2013 would have taken you as his own. How does it feel to know you might have been raised in a different family?</strong><br>Actually, that didn\u2019t matter to me. As long as I was a woman, it didn\u2019t matter whether I was living with my uncle or my dad. But if I were born as a son, I think I wouldn\u2019t have been able to understand this life, the world that I live in, in the same way \u2013 living as a person on the weaker side, we see the world a lot more broadly.</p> <p><strong>Was it a common practice that a daughter and a son might be swapped?</strong><br>It was more common in my mum\u2019s generation. Hearing about that pact between my uncle and my dad, I was really surprised. But as I say in the book, there was this trend where women would get an abortion if they were pregnant with a girl \u2013 which peaked during the 1980s and early 90s.</p> <p><strong>The novel has sold millions of copies and been translated into 18 languages. How </strong><strong>does such global success feel?</strong><br>When my novel was made into a film, the director [Kim Do-young] said that she felt like the book has a life of its own, and I agree! It is more progressive and brave than I am. </p> <p><strong>Several K-pop stars, such as </strong><strong>Soo-young</strong><strong> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/nov/04/girls-generation-youtube-awards-best-video-k-pop\" title=\"\">Girls\u2019 Generation</a> and </strong><strong>RM of BTS</strong><strong>, have praised the book. What was the </strong><strong>effect</strong><strong> \u2013 and are you a K-pop fan?</strong><br>We have a newly coined word in Korea: \u201cidol-seller\u201d. Like a bestseller, but we say K-pop stars are idols. The celebrity endorsement has a lot of impact. I have long been a K-pop fan: I\u2019m a fan of the group Mamamoo, and the singer Taeyeon.</p> <p><strong>The novel includes a scene where women are secretly filmed in the bathroom at work. How widespread is this </strong><strong>in Korea ?</strong><br>There used to be a big website where members shared illegal recordings, but it was closed down in 2016. But even today, there is constant news about people caught making illegal recordings.</p> <p><em><strong>Parasite</strong></em><strong> director Bong Joon-ho recently </strong><strong>said</strong><strong>: \u201cKorea, on the surface, seems like a very rich and glamorous country</strong><strong>... but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening. The younger generation, in particular, feels a lot of despair.\u201d Do you </strong><strong>agree?</strong><br>Yes, I think that the younger male generation have a certain sense of loss because they think they don\u2019t have as much power, capital or opportunity compared to earlier generations. But I believe that these men should not belittle women, who have even less opportunity.</p> <p><strong>Why are birth rates </strong><strong>very low in South Korea</strong><strong>?</strong><br>The price of real estate is really high, and we don\u2019t have a lot of job security. Young people find it quite a burden just to live by themselves. Also, our systems for company benefits like maternity leave aren\u2019t very good, so it is hard for both men and women to juggle work and domestic chores. </p> <p><strong>You</strong><strong> talk about the challenges of parenting \u2013 how do you find being a mother?</strong><br>Usually in Korean society, people do not view women who raise children very favourably. In my case, after I had a career break, I really didn\u2019t have any hope that I could go back to the working me. I had a hard time. But if our social structure changes, so that we all place more value on raising children, I think we can enjoy having children more.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 </em>by Cho Nam-joo, translated by Jamie Chang, is published by Scribner (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "Cho Nam-joo, 41, is a former television scriptwriter whose novel Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 became a hotly debated bestseller in South Korea when it was published in 2016, coinciding with the country\u2019s #MeToo movement. Now published in English, Cho\u2019s book uses the story of one woman to reveal gender inequality in all parts of South Korean society, from the privileging of male children to workplace discrimination and harassment. (Despite having the world\u2019s 12th largest economy, a recent gender gap report ranks South Korea 108 out of 153.) Cho lives with her family in Seoul. What was the reaction to the book in South Korea? Readers said they could really relate to the story \u2013 women said that it was like their own life. There were some cases where celebrities were attacked [online] for reading it. It provided an opportunity for public debate, so I have some pride for making a small contribution. What was the #MeToo movement like in South Korea? In May 2016, a woman was murdered at Gangnam station, and in October that year there were a lot of sexual harassment scandals in various areas of society, including literary circles and the arts. People started to speak about the horrors and threats women have felt \u2013 which had not been discussed earlier. Then a female prosecutor, Seo Ji-hyeon, participated in the #MeToo movement, revealing what she had experienced [during an interview on Korean television, Seo discussed her experience of being sexually harassed at work, a revelation that prompted other women to come forward]. Do you see things changing \u2013 or do young women face the same problems today? There is still sexual abuse and discrimination. Recently in the news, there was an applicant who couldn\u2019t get a job because the public officials gave her a lower score just because she was female. But there has been some change. Women have been protesting and petitioning; they have begun to gather in solidarity. Recently, it was ruled that abortion being a crime was unconstitutional. Although change is slow, I believe that we will not go backwards. You\u2019ve said that your father and uncle struck a deal before you were born: had you been a boy, your uncle \u2014 who already had five daughters \u2013 would have taken you as his own. How does it feel to know you might have been raised in a different family? Actually, that didn\u2019t matter to me. As long as I was a woman, it didn\u2019t matter whether I was living with my uncle or my dad. But if I were born as a son, I think I wouldn\u2019t have been able to understand this life, the world that I live in, in the same way \u2013 living as a person on the weaker side, we see the world a lot more broadly. Was it a common practice that a daughter and a son might be swapped? It was more common in my mum\u2019s generation. Hearing about that pact between my uncle and my dad, I was really surprised. But as I say in the book, there was this trend where women would get an abortion if they were pregnant with a girl \u2013 which peaked during the 1980s and early 90s. The novel has sold millions of copies and been translated into 18 languages. How does such global success feel? When my novel was made into a film, the director [Kim Do-young] said that she felt like the book has a life of its own, and I agree! It is more progressive and brave than I am. Several K-pop stars, such as Soo-young of Girls\u2019 Generation and RM of BTS, have praised the book. What was the effect \u2013 and are you a K-pop fan? We have a newly coined word in Korea: \u201cidol-seller\u201d. Like a bestseller, but we say K-pop stars are idols. The celebrity endorsement has a lot of impact. I have long been a K-pop fan: I\u2019m a fan of the group Mamamoo, and the singer Taeyeon. The novel includes a scene where women are secretly filmed in the bathroom at work. How widespread is this in Korea ? There used to be a big website where members shared illegal recordings, but it was closed down in 2016. But even today, there is constant news about people caught making illegal recordings. Parasite director Bong Joon-ho recently said: \u201cKorea, on the surface, seems like a very rich and glamorous country... but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening. The younger generation, in particular, feels a lot of despair.\u201d Do you agree? Yes, I think that the younger male generation have a certain sense of loss because they think they don\u2019t have as much power, capital or opportunity compared to earlier generations. But I believe that these men should not belittle women, who have even less opportunity. Why are birth rates very low in South Korea? The price of real estate is really high, and we don\u2019t have a lot of job security. Young people find it quite a burden just to live by themselves. Also, our systems for company benefits like maternity leave aren\u2019t very good, so it is hard for both men and women to juggle work and domestic chores. You talk about the challenges of parenting \u2013 how do you find being a mother? Usually in Korean society, people do not view women who raise children very favourably. In my case, after I had a career break, I really didn\u2019t have any hope that I could go back to the working me. I had a hard time. But if our social structure changes, so that we all place more value on raising children, I think we can enjoy having children more. \u2022 Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 by Cho Nam-joo, translated by Jamie Chang, is published by Scribner (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "Manchester City\u2019s hierarchy surpassed themselves with the aggression and ferocity of their response to the Valentine\u2019s Day blow from Uefa, the two-year ban from the Champions League and \u20ac30m fine for deceit in their financial submissions. City have been hostile and adversarial in their public statements, and conduct of their case, throughout the investigation by European football\u2019s governing body that followed the leaks of the club\u2019s emails published by Der Spiegel in November 2018. This time City went further and made it personal, reacting to the very serious finding that they did mislead Uefa by overstating their sponsorship revenue, principally from the Abu Dhabi state airline Etihad, between 2012 and 2016. The statement City unleashed immediately included the same notes of a tune the club has been playing for a year now, but with added volume. The Uefa club financial control body (CFCB), two semi-independent panels of distinguished lawyers, politicians and professors which oversees financial fair play compliance, had run a \u201cflawed\u201d, \u201cconsistently leaked\u201d and \u201cprejudicial\u201d process, which was totally biased. The statement singled out \u201cthe Uefa Chief Investigator\u201d, the former Belgian prime minister Yves Leterme, alleging that by a comment he made in December 2018, he \u201cpublicly previewed the outcome and sanction he intended to be delivered, before any investigation had even begun\u201d. The club claimed Leterme oversaw a biased process with \u201clittle doubt in the result that he would deliver\u201d and that \u201cthis is a case initiated by Uefa, prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa\u201d. City are angry and indignant, of course, particularly as the emails that have damned them were exposed by Der Spiegel\u2019s source, Rui Pinto, who is now on remand in his native Portugal accused of 147 criminal offences including computer hacking, which he denies. But this attack looks intemperate in two principal ways: in the specifics of the allegation that Uefa\u2019s scrutineers acted improperly, and more broadly, in the magnitude of disrespect for European football\u2019s governing body. To take the second first, perhaps somebody who loves City might have tried to reason with the club\u2019s hierarchy that now is not a great time in Britain to be whipping up their supporters, and anybody else prepared to listen, to believe the worst of a European institution. The perception they are generating of Uefa, the sporting bureaucracy which has organised Europe\u2019s elite football competitions since 1955, and introduced FFP in 2011 to encourage financial sustainability, has parallels with the toxic Brexit campaign. Actual facts struggle for proper recognition, while misinformation and sweeping allegations are easier to digest. Financial fair play, the injunction to spend within revenues which has transformed European football from basket-case losses for many clubs to general financial health, is depicted as a wicked European plot by elite clubs to pull up the drawbridge. The contradictions in this argument are rarely acknowledged: it was no kind of fair competition anyway pre-2011 that the only clubs able to compete with the elite had to be funded by a Gulf state interest or an oligarch. Fairer \u201ccompetitive balance\u201d is a different issue from FFP; from the beginning of professional football, it has been achieved only with an equitable sharing of the game\u2019s money, not by a flawed dream to find a rich owner. That battle should be fought with the elite clubs \u2013 including City, who now Sheikh Mansour has funded them into the grounds of the gilded castle, were among the most aggressive in the \u201cbig six\u201d to demand a greater slice of the Premier League\u2019s international TV rights. Then there are the specific allegations, that this European body is flawed, its processes and officials improper and prejudiced, for reasons unexplained. On the specific allegation against Leterme, City\u2019s hierarchy understand \u2013 clearly \u2013 that in framing the statement they were alleging bias, prejudice and impropriety by every member of the CFCB\u2019s two \u201cchambers,\u201d who looked at City\u2019s \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d and found themselves unconvinced. The 2018 comment by Leterme that City have escalated into proof of institutional bias was brief and quite noncommittal, given to a magazine, Sport and Strategy, in Belgium, where he was prime minister from 2009-11. \u201cIf it is true what has been written, there might be a serious problem,\u201d he said to questions about the Der Spiegel coverage. \u201cThis can lead to the heaviest punishment: exclusion from the Uefa competitions. If the information is correct, this possibly goes against truthful reporting.\u201d So there were two ifs, one might and a possibly in his brief reply, which was little more than a general note that if City had lied in their financial reporting of the sponsorships, that is serious and can lead to the most severe punishment.

Yet City, having welcomed the investigation when it was announced in March, are now telling their supporters that now their \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d was not deemed convincing, it shows the process was biased due to a brief comment made by Leterme four months earlier. A genuine look at Uefa\u2019s FFP system has to acknowledge it is quite sophisticated for a sporting body. The rules themselves were developed with Deloitte and other legal and accounting experts. Serious efforts were made to clear them in principle and avoid an anti-competition challenge from the European commission, which succeeded largely because the prime purpose, to encourage financial sustainability, is recognised to be valid.

He is president of the UK\u2019s National Anti-Doping Panel and trusted enough in Abu Dhabi\u2019s neighbouring emirate of Dubai to be a director of its financial services authority. So City\u2019s reaction to the considered conclusion of these distinguished European professionals was to allege that all were biased, and reached a prejudged conclusion signalled by Leterme. City will go furiously to the court of arbitration for sport, where they say three other European judges will see what those serving the Uefa panels were unwilling to: that contrary to the meaning of their own emails, Sheikh Mansour was not subsidising a significant portion of the Etihad sponsorship. Due process means they have the right to make their case at Cas, and both City and Uefa must accept the result. In the meantime, City might consider the tone and scale of the allegations they are making, in a time of already undermined trust in Brexit Britain for great European institutions.",

Two days after Sajid Javid resigned as chancellor after refusing a demand from Johnson to sack all his special advisers, the FDA (formerly the First Division Association) told the Observer it expected Johnson and Cummings to give evidence under oath to an employment tribunal in a case involving former Treasury aide Sonia Khan. The announcement of action by the FDA on behalf of Khan was seen as a warning to Johnson of serious legal consequences and further potential actions if Cummings is not reined in. It came as the cull of aides at the top of government increased on Saturday with the sacking of two more special advisers from the No 10 policy unit, Christopher Brannigan and Elliot Roy. With a culture of fear spreading in Whitehall, the FDA\u2019s general secretary, Dave Penman, said it was up to the prime minister to explain what had happened to Khan, and it was his responsibility that staff were treated decently.

In 2012 a senior civil servant received a payout of \u00a325,000 in a bullying case she took against Cummings and a senior member of Michael Gove\u2019s team when Cummings was a special adviser at the Department for Education. An internal investigation found no grounds for disciplinary action. At the time of Khan\u2019s dismissal last September, the terms of employment for special advisers made it clear that it was only the prime minister who had the power to sack them. This was then changed after Khan left, giving Cummings ultimate \u201cresponsibility for disciplinary matters\u201d.",

Prof Christl Donnelly, of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling, Imperial College London, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our modern interconnected world, it is not surprising for imported Covid-19 cases to be detected in previously unaffected countries. It is encouraging that the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) are working with the World Health Organization and African member states to support diagnostic and surveillance capabilities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician, Cardiff University School of Medicine, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was always inevitable that the virus would spread to the African continent. Indeed, there may well already be more cases in other African countries that have evaded detection. The concern is that it may prove impossible to contain the spread of Covid-19 in developing countries with less robust health systems; this, in turn, could lead to wider global spread.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Prof Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The WHO declared this to be a PHE [public health emergency] because they wanted to support less well resourced nations in responding and preparing for cases. This first case in Africa is important but not unexpected. The patient is isolated and contacts found and tested (all negative). The response of the Africa CDC shows the strong networks and collaboration that there is in place across Africa and these organisations are working now to train and prepare staff in order to maximise capabilities to detect and isolate cases. A key challenge is diagnostic capacity across much of Africa and here is where global support and research to find validated, inexpensive kits that can be used in the community is going to be critical.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cairo is the destination typically receiving the most visitors and workers from China, so it is unsurprising the first case on the African continent is seen in Egypt. There have been concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak when it arrives in Africa. Therefore, it is reassuring that there has been some rapid contact tracing and all contacts have tested negative. This gives confidence that this might be an isolated case with minimal transmission.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-15T15:41:44.805Z\">at 3.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e47fef98f0811db2faf84e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-15T14:34:29.404Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">American woman on cruise ship turned away by five countries tests positive for coronavirus</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An American passenger on a cruise ship that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/westerdam-cruise-ship-with-2000-onboard-refused-port-by-four-countries-amid-coronavirus-fears\">was turned away from five countries, despite no reports at the sickness on board at the tim</a>e, has tested positive for coronavirus. </p> <p>The 83-year-old female holidaymaker tested positive in Malaysia, the country\u2019s health ministry confirmed.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s main coronavirus developments, as the outbreak continues across the globe: Europe has its first confirmed death from the disease as France\u2019s health minister announced that an 80-year-old Chinese man who travelled from the coronavirus-hit Hubei province to Paris last month had died. Eight of the nine patients in the UK who tested positive for the coronavirus have been discharged, NHS England has confirmed. Five of the patients released a statement saying that they were \u201cfeeling well and looking forward to being home\u201d. Health secretary Matt Hancock said the fact that eight patients had been successfully treated and discharged from hospital was \u201cevidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. An American passenger on a cruise ship, turned away from five countries despite no reports of the sickness on board at the time before finally docking in Cambodia, has tested positive for coronavirus. Here\u2019s some experts views on yesterday\u2019s confirmation of the first coronavirus case in Africa, after a patient tested positive in Egypt. Prof Christl Donnelly, of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling, Imperial College London, said: In our modern interconnected world, it is not surprising for imported Covid-19 cases to be detected in previously unaffected countries. It is encouraging that the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) are working with the World Health Organization and African member states to support diagnostic and surveillance capabilities. Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician, Cardiff University School of Medicine, said: It was always inevitable that the virus would spread to the African continent. Indeed, there may well already be more cases in other African countries that have evaded detection. The concern is that it may prove impossible to contain the spread of Covid-19 in developing countries with less robust health systems; this, in turn, could lead to wider global spread.\u201d Prof Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said: The WHO declared this to be a PHE [public health emergency] because they wanted to support less well resourced nations in responding and preparing for cases. This first case in Africa is important but not unexpected. The patient is isolated and contacts found and tested (all negative). The response of the Africa CDC shows the strong networks and collaboration that there is in place across Africa and these organisations are working now to train and prepare staff in order to maximise capabilities to detect and isolate cases. A key challenge is diagnostic capacity across much of Africa and here is where global support and research to find validated, inexpensive kits that can be used in the community is going to be critical.\u201d Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: Cairo is the destination typically receiving the most visitors and workers from China, so it is unsurprising the first case on the African continent is seen in Egypt. There have been concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak when it arrives in Africa. Therefore, it is reassuring that there has been some rapid contact tracing and all contacts have tested negative. This gives confidence that this might be an isolated case with minimal transmission.\u201d An American passenger on a cruise ship that was turned away from five countries, despite no reports at the sickness on board at the time, has tested positive for coronavirus. The 83-year-old female holidaymaker tested positive in Malaysia, the country\u2019s health ministry confirmed. She had flown there along with 144 others from the ship on Friday from Cambodia, where the Westerdam cruise ship eventually docked. The woman\u2019s husband tested negative for the disease, Malaysia\u2019s health ministry added. The Westerdam, operated by US-based Holland America Line, docked in the port of Sihanoukville, Cambodia on Thursday after being turned away by several countries on fears that passengers could be carrying the virus. The vessel, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, spent two weeks at sea. Passengers were tested regularly on board and 20 were also tested once the ship docked in Cambodia. However, no one tested positive at the time. The coronavirus outbreak is still an emergency for China and it is impossible to tell where the epidemic will spread, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general has said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreye told the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday that he was encouraged by actions China had taken to slow the spread of virus but was still concerned about the increasing number of cases, with the total hitting 66,000. Five members of a ski group who stayed at a French chalet visited by the businessman Steve Walsh, who has been linked to 11 cases of coronavirus, say they are looking forward to returning home after beating the disease. The patients, who are among eight released from hospital in the UK after recovering from coronavirus, said in a joint statement that they were \u201cfeeling well and looking forward to being home\u201d. They were at the same chalet as Walsh, a scout leader from Hove, who was the first British national identified as having caught the virus. He said on Tuesday that he had fully recovered. In a statement, the five group members said: \u201cAll of our group, including the six in other countries, have recovered quickly from the virus having required minimal medical treatment during our time in isolation. \u201cWe understand the virus can be dangerous for some, but we also want to share the important facts of our situation to help reassure people. \u201cWe want to thank everybody who has been involved in our care, in particular the NHS nurses and doctors who have looked after us over the past few days. \u201cWe would also like to thank our families, friends, work colleagues and members of the public for their support.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has responded to the news that all but one of the UK\u2019s nine coronavirus patients have been discharged from hospital and the release of quarantined returnees from China. He said: As the last group leave supported isolation in the Wirral today, I want to express my thanks for their patience in these unique circumstances. The overwhelming gratitude expressed by those who left earlier this week is a testament to the exceptional support and tireless dedication of our NHS in trying circumstances. I am also pleased that 8 of the 9 individuals who tested positive for coronavirus have now been successfully treated and discharged from hospital. Again, this is evidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus. I want to stress that any individuals who are discharged from hospital are now well and do not pose any public health risk to the public. UK citizens on board the locked-down cruise ship in Japan are appealing to be brought home for quarantine in Britain but the government has not yet said if it would follow the US lead in flying them out. Earlier, the US embassy in Tokyo announced it would fly out an estimated 380 Americans currently onboard the vessel, which has been in quarantine since the start of the month. Asked if the UK was planning an evacuation flight for British nationals on board the Diamond Princess, a Foreign Office spokesperson said only that officials are \u201cworking around the clock to ensure the welfare of the British nationals on board\u201d and \u201curgently speaking to authorities in Japan and the UK\u201d. Yesterday, a British man stuck with his wife onboard the luxury cruise ship appealed to billionaire Richard Branson to save them. In a Facebook live video, David Abel asked the Virgin boss to charter a plane to fly all British nationals on the ship home to carry out their quarantine. Appealing directly to Branson, he said: \u201cIf you and your family were in this situation, what would you do? And please don\u2019t say \u2018chill out, stay calm\u2019, that\u2019s not what we want to hear. \u201cI\u2019m asking: what would it cost to hire one of your smaller planes, put all the Brits onboard, no flight attendants, packaged food?\u201d Australia is dispatching a medical expert to Japan to assist the country\u2019s response to the quarantined cruise ship in Yokohama on which there are more than 200 confirmed coronavirus cases. The infectious disease expert will bolster an international team gathering details about the Diamond Princess\u2019s 3,000-plus passengers and crew, including 200 Australians. It follows the Australian government extending the country\u2019s two-week travel ban from mainland China for another seven days this week to prevent the spread of the disease. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says keeping Australians safe from the virus is \u201cabsolutely paramount\u201d, but concedes that it is a \u201csavage blow\u201d to tourism. \u201cThe ban on passenger air travel also impacts on a range of other industries that depend on frequent air movements to shift goods, including perishable products,\u201d the body\u2019s tourism executive chair, John Hart, said in a statement. \u201cTourism and trade would greatly benefit from even a partial lifting of the ban from provinces in China that present a much lower risk to Australians.\u201d Eight of the nine patients in the UK who tested positive for the coronavirus have been discharged, NHS England has confirmed. The last of those being quarantined at Arrowe Park after returning from China have left hospital, NHS England added. More than 100 people remain in isolation at the Kents Hill Park Hotel, Milton Keynes. Prof Keith Willet, NHS strategic incident director, said: The last guests have left Arrowe Park hospital and I would once again like to thank them for the calm, patient and responsible way that they have responded to what must have been a trying situation. Over the coming weeks many more of us may need to spend some time at home to reduce the spread of the virus and they have set a great example. I would like to thank all those NHS staff and partners, as well as Public Health England, who have worked so hard to make their stay as comfortable as possible, those still caring for guests in Milton Keynes and all the doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals who have successfully treated patients at other hospitals. We must not forget the local residents, council staff, volunteers and numerous others who have rallied round to help our guests in their time of need. Thank you all. My colleague, Lily Kuo, has written a heart-wrenching piece detailing the story of a 25-year-old Chinese woman who could only look on as her relatives were ravaged by the virus. Liu Mengdi has been keeping a diary of the past few weeks about the impact of coronavirus in her home town of Wuhan, but has now been warned to stop posting about the trauma. Writing movingly in her diary about her 90-year-old grandfather\u2019s death, Mengdi recorded: \u201cGrandpa really is strong. We knew he must have been in a lot of pain, but he still insisted and pretended he was fine. Before his results could come back, he couldn\u2019t hold on any more and closed his eyes for the last time.\u201d A further 67 passengers have come down with coronavirus on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan, the country\u2019s health minister confirmed earlier. The Diamond Princess, which already had more than 200 people on board who tested positive for the disease, has been in lockdown since the start of the month. It had 3,700 passengers and crew when it went into quarantine on 3 February. It comes as the US embassy in Tokyo said earlier that it would fly nearly 400 of its citizens stuck onboard the ship home. As news filters through of Europe\u2019s first coronavirus death, here\u2019s some expert reaction. Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician, Cardiff University School of Medicine, said: This first reported death in Europe from Covid-19 in an 80-year-old man comes as no surprise. Although the mortality rate is low \u2013 probably less than 2%, we know that the risk of severe disease and death is greatest in the elderly as well as those with underlying co-morbidities such as diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. It is still the case that the vast majority of infections are relatively mild with full recovery.\u201d Dr Robin Thompson, junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology, University of Oxford, added: Given that we have now seen 46 coronavirus cases in total in Europe, it is unsurprising that we have seen our first death. The most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn\u2019t been sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe. As a result, the risk to individuals in the UK remains low.\u201d The confirmed coronavirus fatality in France is the first among 46 cases of the disease in Europe. According to the latest figures released by the World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday, Germany tops the list of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the continent at 16, followed by 11 in France and nine in the UK. There have been three cases in Italy, two in each of Russia and Spain, as well as individual cases in Sweden, Finland and Belgium. Here\u2019s some advice released by WHO on Twitter this morning on how to cope with stress during the outbreak: Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus live blog, where we will be bringing readers rolling coverage throughout the day, furnishing you with the latest developments on the outbreak. The death toll has now topped 1,500 with an additional 143 fatalities in the 24 hours to midnight on Friday. There have been more than 66,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Significantly, it emerged this morning that Europe has its first confirmed death from the disease as France\u2019s health minister announced that an 80-year-old Chinese man who travelled from the coronavirus-hit Hubei province last month had died. Meanwhile, nearly 400 American passengers stuck onboard a cruise liner quarantined in Japan due to the coronavirus outbreak will be flown home on chartered aircraft, the US embassy in Tokyo has said. Beijing has also ordered people returning to the city from holidays to quarantine themselves for 14 days. And, finally, in another bid to halt the coronavirus spread, China is disinfecting and isolating used banknotes.",

      "body": "<p>A writing class with a twist is taking place in a community centre in Washington DC. A group of men and women, young and old, are learning the art of writing an obituary. Their own obituary.</p> <p>None of them is at death\u2019s door \u2013 in fact, most are in fine shape \u2013 but the workshop\u2019s organiser, Sarah Farr, has asked them to think what their obituary might look like if, let\u2019s say, they were run over by a bus tomorrow.</p> <p>Obituary workshops, as they are known, have taken hold across America, the latest incarnation of the <a href=\"https://www.deathpositivedc.com/\" title=\"\">\u201cdeath positivity\u201d movement,</a> which aims to stamp out \u201cdeath denial\u201d by forcing people to think about dying while they are still alive.</p> <p>The idea of writing his own obituary terrified Bob Hoffman, who for years has struggled with his fear of death.

      "bodyText": "A writing class with a twist is taking place in a community centre in Washington DC. A group of men and women, young and old, are learning the art of writing an obituary. Their own obituary. None of them is at death\u2019s door \u2013 in fact, most are in fine shape \u2013 but the workshop\u2019s organiser, Sarah Farr, has asked them to think what their obituary might look like if, let\u2019s say, they were run over by a bus tomorrow. Obituary workshops, as they are known, have taken hold across America, the latest incarnation of the \u201cdeath positivity\u201d movement, which aims to stamp out \u201cdeath denial\u201d by forcing people to think about dying while they are still alive. The idea of writing his own obituary terrified Bob Hoffman, who for years has struggled with his fear of death. Yet something about putting pen to paper, and the sense of control it gave him, began to turn that pain into pleasure. \u201cHoff has transitioned to the next adventure,\u201d he starts his obituary. \u201cAfter many years of \u2018end-of-life\u2019 preparation, Hoff is now exploring the best ways to continue his energy and spirit in a new realm.\u201d Now on a roll, Hoffman leaves well-wishers a list of places to visit his ashes \u2013 Washington DC, New York and Vermont are among the more scenic options on a list of 13 possible day trips. But he reminds them: \u201cWhenever you desire, simply think of him \u2013 because he will still be with you.\u201d Back in the land of the living, 74-year-old Hoffman says he relished the idea of defining his own legacy before someone else beat him to it. It also helped him get over his dread of the unknown. \u201cI thought of death as an empty hole of black nothingness \u2013 it put me into a very negative mind-set,\u201d he says. Choosing what he wants to be remembered for, and attending death cafes \u2013 where likeminded customers chat about mortality over coffee and cake \u2013 have forced him to think about dying in a more positive way, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s giving me a lot of late-life pleasure,\u201d he says. Thinking about your death can really help you get clear about your life, agrees Farr, a trained death doula.\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to do but the idea is to see where your pen and paper take you, and run with it,\u201d she says. Farr sets the group another exercise: to write what she calls a \u201cfantasy obit\u201d \u2013 the death notice they would like to see written about themselves if they live a full life, imagining all the things they are yet to achieve. \u201cWhat it comes down to is that society will be better if we have frank, open conversations around death,\u201d says Caitlin Doughty, the founder of the death positivity movement, in a phone call from her Los Angeles funeral home. \u201cEverybody\u2019s thinking about death all the time \u2013 it\u2019s the preoccupation of universal human experience\u201d, she says. \u201cThe goal isn\u2019t about not being scared of it \u2013 the goal is to grow awareness through education.\u201d Those sentiments resonate with retired hospice nurse Barbara Wagner, one of those at the Washington workshop. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me find a way to look at my bumpy life in a humorous way,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels freeing and cathartic and just joyful.\u201d Wagner describes in her obituary how she married high school sweetheart Buzz and had two children by the age of 21. \u201cWhen Buzz got a motorcycle and rode off with the Hells Angels at the age of 22, Barbara was called to re-consider her life \u2013 an act she did regularly from then until her death last week at age 100.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not much fantasy in there, it\u2019s mostly true,\u201d she says. The workshops are not just attracting older people. In fact, Farr says, people in their 20s and 30s are the fastest growing group. One of them, Rachel Wynn, a social media entrepreneur, believes that younger people are more open than their parents\u2019 generation to talking about death. In part, she thinks, this is because there\u2019s so much exposure to death on social media; she remembers, for example, the shared online grief with friends when actor Heath Ledger died in 2008. Writing her own obituary has been an epiphany, she believes, because, despite being only 30, it made her feel that she hadn\u2019t achieved enough in her life. \u201cIt was like, wow, I really need to get my shit together,\u201d she says. Wynn has even gone to the next extreme and attended a workshop where she \u201cwent to her own funeral\u201d. She recalls having to lie down on a blanket cut into the shape of a coffin, while a shroud was placed over her body and a beanbag over her eyes. \u201cThat was intense,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like we really had died and were being buried.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like a harsh wake-up call. Are you living the life you\u2019re happy with?\u201d she says. \u201cBecause you could die any minute.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><strong>I always lived with rationing </strong><strong>in Cuba </strong>\u2013 I was born in 1973. We used the term \u201cthe three musketeers\u201d to mean rice, chicharos [split peas] and eggs, although at one point eggs disappeared completely.</p> <p><strong>I had two rabbits as pets</strong> and I arrived home from school one day and there was that smell I\u2019d almost forgotten, of meat. Then I realised that Mam\u00e1 had roasted my pets and I cried a lot. My mother pressed us to eat them and we all did. The rabbits tasted very good, obviously \u2013 I was a kid and I sort of got distracted. I was very sad, but I ate.</p> <p><strong>The essential food on the ration coupon was rice. </strong>A meal might be rice with beans, rice with plantain, rice with sugar water, rice with egg and sometimes rice with meat. But rice, rice, rice. And sugar, which the country grows a lot of. The motto at the time was: \u201cEat sugar in order to grow.\u201d Sometimes, during the scarcity of the Special Period [1991-2000], a meal might be just plain bread covered with sugar. I became addicted to sugar.</p> <p><strong>During meals at ballet school </strong>I\u2019d keep one eye on those ballerinas who wanted to be thinner, because they didn\u2019t always finish their meals. Sometimes we\u2019d circle around them like starving hyenas. Nowadays my wife, Charlotte, says I eat far too quickly and suggests it\u2019s rooted in my past. So I\u2019ll tell myself: \u201cCalm down, Carlos. This food is not going to run away.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Around age 10, I tasted chocolate for the first time.</strong> We didn\u2019t have chocolate at home and there was nowhere in Los Pinos [a suburb of Havana] to get it. But it had taken on a very special appeal. A teacher gave me a small bar and I remember going home, sitting with my sister and cutting each piece of chocolate into four. Then each small square we made even smaller. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/18/yuli-carlos-acosta-cuba-dance-film-ballet-castro\">Yuli: this portrait of Carlos Acosta and Cuba is a dance film like no other</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>My father gave food to the saints</strong> in his shrine; food we could have eaten. He sometimes cooked for us, but it was like a chemical experiment. It was bad news, pretty much unbearable. We\u2019d even pray Father wouldn\u2019t cook. But Mam\u00e1 got ill and went to hospital for quite a while. So for months Dad made terrible meals. </p> <p><strong>I wanted to be a footballer.</strong> I played truant one week out of four and was thrown out of the school in Havana. At 13 I was sent to a boarding school in another city. Each Wednesday the students\u2019 parents could visit, bringing homemade food for them, but my parents never visited. It was very hard seeing other students eating homemade food as well as that from the state\u2019s centre for school food distribution. But sometimes they\u2019d share with me some really yummy steak. It would tide me over until Friday, when I had a pass to stay with my older half-brother in Pinar del Rio. His mother made good but very limited food. It just wasn\u2019t enough and we fought over it.</p> <p><strong>I felt starving after dancing</strong> \u2013 each ballet class was one and a half hours. In fact, I felt constant hunger. Breakfast was often a toasted bread roll which we\u2019d put into milk and add sugar. I\u2019d try and join the lunch queue \u2013 of 300 students \u2013 a second time in the hope that someone wouldn\u2019t say: \u201cHey Carlos, you\u2019ve eaten already!\u201d I\u2019d reply: \u201cNo, no. It wasn\u2019t me.\u201d I always had that argument.</p> <p><strong>I practically lived in </strong><strong>Chinatown </strong>when I was with the Royal Ballet in London. Yes, you have Indian food which is amazing, and I love a thin-crust pizza in an Italian, but I was most often eating Chinese. I had a lot of peking duck \u2013 with rice obviously. And there was a really nice Cuban restaurant in Kensington High Street, which was very popular but is sadly not there any more, where you could have pork crackling and all kinds of lovely tamales. </p> <p><strong>I take porridge to Cuba</strong><strong> for me to eat, </strong>and all sorts of grains and fruits as fuel and energy. As presents I take chocolates. When it was recommended to me that I needed to travel to see my mother [because she was very ill], it was quite sad because I spoke to her on the phone and asked, \u201cWhat do you want me to bring?\u201d She replied: \u201cA lasagne.\u201d So, I flew from London with a lasagne but when I got there she was dead.</p> <p><strong>The Acosta Dance Company eats a free lunch</strong><strong>, </strong>everyone sitting down together in a tiny room at 1pm. It\u2019s important we see ourselves as a collective and have good vibes for each other but that we can disconnect from dancing and each of us bring their own life and its thoughts and problems to the table. I think it enhances the dance by breaking from it for food together.</p> <p><strong>We have a seven-year-old and identical twins</strong> who are three. Twins can be 10 times the work. When my wife was pregnant with the twins she suffered twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Now they eat the same foods but want them at different times or in different combinations, based on one being sick or on lots of individual growing and appetite. From one meal to another, one of them wants the toast and the other the fruit. I personally wasn\u2019t very good with salads, growing up. But across any week you would see our children happily eating salads. And carrots, broccoli and cucumber.

      "bodyText": "I always lived with rationing in Cuba \u2013 I was born in 1973. We used the term \u201cthe three musketeers\u201d to mean rice, chicharos [split peas] and eggs, although at one point eggs disappeared completely. I had two rabbits as pets and I arrived home from school one day and there was that smell I\u2019d almost forgotten, of meat. Then I realised that Mam\u00e1 had roasted my pets and I cried a lot. My mother pressed us to eat them and we all did. The rabbits tasted very good, obviously \u2013 I was a kid and I sort of got distracted. I was very sad, but I ate. The essential food on the ration coupon was rice. A meal might be rice with beans, rice with plantain, rice with sugar water, rice with egg and sometimes rice with meat. But rice, rice, rice. And sugar, which the country grows a lot of. The motto at the time was: \u201cEat sugar in order to grow.\u201d Sometimes, during the scarcity of the Special Period [1991-2000], a meal might be just plain bread covered with sugar. I became addicted to sugar. During meals at ballet school I\u2019d keep one eye on those ballerinas who wanted to be thinner, because they didn\u2019t always finish their meals. Sometimes we\u2019d circle around them like starving hyenas. Nowadays my wife, Charlotte, says I eat far too quickly and suggests it\u2019s rooted in my past. So I\u2019ll tell myself: \u201cCalm down, Carlos. This food is not going to run away.\u201d Around age 10, I tasted chocolate for the first time. We didn\u2019t have chocolate at home and there was nowhere in Los Pinos [a suburb of Havana] to get it. But it had taken on a very special appeal. A teacher gave me a small bar and I remember going home, sitting with my sister and cutting each piece of chocolate into four. Then each small square we made even smaller. My father gave food to the saints in his shrine; food we could have eaten. He sometimes cooked for us, but it was like a chemical experiment. It was bad news, pretty much unbearable. We\u2019d even pray Father wouldn\u2019t cook. But Mam\u00e1 got ill and went to hospital for quite a while. So for months Dad made terrible meals. I wanted to be a footballer. I played truant one week out of four and was thrown out of the school in Havana. At 13 I was sent to a boarding school in another city. Each Wednesday the students\u2019 parents could visit, bringing homemade food for them, but my parents never visited. It was very hard seeing other students eating homemade food as well as that from the state\u2019s centre for school food distribution. But sometimes they\u2019d share with me some really yummy steak. It would tide me over until Friday, when I had a pass to stay with my older half-brother in Pinar del Rio. His mother made good but very limited food. It just wasn\u2019t enough and we fought over it. I felt starving after dancing \u2013 each ballet class was one and a half hours. In fact, I felt constant hunger. Breakfast was often a toasted bread roll which we\u2019d put into milk and add sugar. I\u2019d try and join the lunch queue \u2013 of 300 students \u2013 a second time in the hope that someone wouldn\u2019t say: \u201cHey Carlos, you\u2019ve eaten already!\u201d I\u2019d reply: \u201cNo, no. It wasn\u2019t me.\u201d I always had that argument. I practically lived in Chinatown when I was with the Royal Ballet in London. Yes, you have Indian food which is amazing, and I love a thin-crust pizza in an Italian, but I was most often eating Chinese. I had a lot of peking duck \u2013 with rice obviously. And there was a really nice Cuban restaurant in Kensington High Street, which was very popular but is sadly not there any more, where you could have pork crackling and all kinds of lovely tamales. I take porridge to Cuba for me to eat, and all sorts of grains and fruits as fuel and energy. As presents I take chocolates. When it was recommended to me that I needed to travel to see my mother [because she was very ill], it was quite sad because I spoke to her on the phone and asked, \u201cWhat do you want me to bring?\u201d She replied: \u201cA lasagne.\u201d So, I flew from London with a lasagne but when I got there she was dead. The Acosta Dance Company eats a free lunch, everyone sitting down together in a tiny room at 1pm. It\u2019s important we see ourselves as a collective and have good vibes for each other but that we can disconnect from dancing and each of us bring their own life and its thoughts and problems to the table. I think it enhances the dance by breaking from it for food together. We have a seven-year-old and identical twins who are three. Twins can be 10 times the work. When my wife was pregnant with the twins she suffered twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Now they eat the same foods but want them at different times or in different combinations, based on one being sick or on lots of individual growing and appetite. From one meal to another, one of them wants the toast and the other the fruit. I personally wasn\u2019t very good with salads, growing up. But across any week you would see our children happily eating salads. And carrots, broccoli and cucumber. It\u2019s wonderful to see. My favourite things Food I first ate sushi in Houston, when I moved there from Cuba to join the ballet company. I thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s all this about? Raw fish \u2013 how terrible.\u201d But by the third time I was absolutely hooked. Drink A 15-year-old dark rum; a good Chilean merlot; a mojito. Restaurant The River House in Frome for breakfast; the Smokehouse or Roka in London for dinner; the Talbot Inn in Frome for Sunday roast. In Havana, you can\u2019t beat La Guardia for atmosphere and food. Dish I haven\u2019t mastered the art of cooking. I don\u2019t cook for myself. If pushed by someone else, I\u2019d make them scrambled egg, rice and beans. Or a pasta \u2013 spaghetti with onions, tomato sauce and parmesan cheese on top and there you go.

      "bodyText": "With the coronavirus outbreak spreading far beyond its source in China, companies are braced for a hit on profits as demand slumps and production is disrupted in the world\u2019s second largest economy and beyond. Executives face weeks of uncertainty over how many people will catch the virus worldwide and what the full impact will be. Daniel Zhang, the boss of China\u2019s biggest listed company, Alibaba, described the coronavirus outbreak as a potential \u201cblack swan\u201d event that could derail the global economy. Here are some of the main industries affected so far. Airlines The virus has prompted 21 airlines to cancel all flights to mainland China, including Delta, United, Qantas and Air France/KLM. According to travel data and analytics firm Cirium, more than 85,000 flights touching China have been cancelled in the three weeks since the outbreak closed Wuhan airport on 23 January, the vast majority of which were domestic. British Airways has cancelled its daily Beijing and Shanghai services, and Virgin has suspended Shanghai flights, both until the end of March. BA will have lost 24,000 passengers scheduled to fly before the end of this month. With the suspension of flights extended through March, that number could double. Among the big international carriers, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has been hit hardest, cancelling 90% of flights to the Chinese mainland bar the biggest cities. About 30% of its network capacity has been cut, and it has asked its 27,000 employees to take unpaid leave to help it stay afloat. With China\u2019s airline industry at the heart of the outbreak, its carriers have been looking to refinance, according to aviation leasing companies. Gwyn Topham Luxury goods London fashion week is in full swing but Chinese journalists and buyers are conspicuous by their absence. Their decision to stay away is a major blow to a \u00a3230bn personal luxury goods industry that has come to rely on China\u2019s massive spending power. Chinese shoppers are the biggest buyers of designer clothing and handbags \u2013 but as they stay away from the shops, and travel restrictions curb overseas shopping sprees, the big fashion brands are starting to suffer. Bad news is being drip-fed into the market by the luxury brands. Burberry has closed a third of its 64 Chinese stores, with reduced hours at those still open because shopper numbers have plunged 80%. The company has suspended its financial guidance for this year, saying it is too early to gauge what the impact on profits will be. Tapestry, whose brands include Coach and Kate Spade, and Capri, the owner of Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo, have also cut their profit forecasts. Analysts at investment bank Jefferies have slashed their 2020 sales growth forecast for the industry from 5% to just 1%. Morningstar\u2019s equity analyst Jelena Sokolova predicts the short-term impact of coronavirus will be greater than Sars in 2002-03 because Chinese buyers now account for 35% of the spending on designer fashion, compared with just 2% nearly 20 years ago. Zoe Wood Factory shutdowns Data company Dun &amp; Bradstreet say an estimated 5 million companies have Chinese suppliers \u2013 from Apple, whose supplier Foxconn postponed the reopening of its Shenzhen factory, to food companies Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo, which have closed Chinese factories. The outbreak could barely have come at a worse time for struggling carmakers. Wuhan is a major centre of automotive manufacturing.

Kalyeena Makortoff Oil The economic slowdown has dampened commodity markets, particularly given China\u2019s key role as the driver of demand growth.

I love a patina, I love seeing someone else\u2019s touch, or seeing a stain, or seeing a nick or a chip. Materials get soft and they get round and they change colour,\u201d she says. This passionate embrace of imperfection can be seen throughout her three-bedroom loft in New York\u2019s SoHo neighbourhood, which she spent two years renovating.</p> <p>When she was looking for a new home, a long stint living in a Brooklyn brownstone informed her list of prerequisites \u2013 she wanted it to be all on one floor and large enough to accommodate the \u201cmain parts of life\u201d, like cooking, eating and hanging out. \u201cI rent the apartment downstairs as my office, but when I bought the loft above it was all open plan and hadn\u2019t been touched in about 40 years,\u201d recalls Lyons, who is currently working on a top-secret beauty project, designing a hotel in the Bahamas and gearing up to launch a lifestyle television series and e-commerce site in the summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5e7f8e0dfbe594ac0047c913363e1463af04e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5e7f8e0dfbe594ac0047c913363e1463af04e67/0_1745_3744_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Taking a chance and trying something is valuable\u2019: Jenna Lyons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Taking a chance and trying something is valuable\u2019: Jenna Lyons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danielle Levitt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When you walk into the apartment, there is so much to take in visually that your eye doesn\u2019t land on any one thing. This is not accidental, but rather a testament to her skill at layering. A Serge Mouille sconce peeks out from behind a jungle-motif Dimore Studio screen; a leopard-print pouf sits next to a pink Milo Baughman sofa. There is an artful mastery and playfulness in her placement and mix of objects, materials and finishes, yet this particular mix still reads bohemian. The way she famously married sequins and camouflage in fashion mirrors her rule-breaking tendencies at home. She deliberately disrupts the symmetry of the architecture by hanging her artwork off-centre, or leaning it against the wall, and the eccentric placement highlights the work.</p> <p>After finding the Milo Baughman sofa \u2013 the anchor of the main living space \u2013 she altered it by removing the tufting and upholstering it in pink cotton velvet.</p> <p>\u201cIn my job, I got used to having to say, \u2018This is what we\u2019re gonna do, it\u2019s gonna be OK, we\u2019re gonna try it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cTaking a chance and trying something is probably more valuable than just staying within the borders and what the rules are.\u201d</p> <p>Green and pink \u2013 a combination that has a preppy reputation \u2013 is a recurring colour pairing in her home. However, it\u2019s made fresh and cool in Lyons\u2019s hands: an Aldo Tura pale malachite-hued goatskin cube is positioned by the pink sofa; avocado-green lacquer covers the powder-room walls; French 18th-century threadbare peridot mohair chairs are dotted throughout the living room; plants add to this surprising colour palette. Lyons credits the Milan-based design duo behind Dimore Studio for influencing her brazen colour choices. \u201cI\u2019m so taken by their unapologetic colour mixing and unusual textures and combinations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9188631212547d904103a50644248b25c08c5a43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9188631212547d904103a50644248b25c08c5a43/0_2711_4315_2589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soft touch: the bedroom with glass doors to the bathroom, which was inspired by Venice\u2019s Gritti Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soft touch: the bedroom with glass doors to the bathroom, which was inspired by Venice\u2019s Gritti Palace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Franzen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Working at the nexus of fashion, art, design and travel, Lyons brings all these elements into her home. She commissioned her builder to make floating brass-clad bedside tables in homage to Donald Judd, and a bathroom at the Gritti Palace in Venice inspired her to source veined marble for her own. She channels and filters ideas between the various disciplines in an original way.</p> <p>She worked with her contractor to finesse the millwork, mouldings and add extra-tall doors and high doorknobs (Lyons is 5ft 11in). In all of the finishes \u2013 the unlacquered brass splashbacks in the kitchen, the honed marble countertops, the unfinished oak floors \u2013 she wants life to be visible.</p> <p>\u201cI had long conversations with my contractor about making sure the floors weren\u2019t too perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted them to wear enough to show spills and reveal the markings of people\u2019s footsteps walking down the hall. Once I left a window open and spatters of rain came in so now that corner of the floor looks dappled and I like it. I\u2019ve never felt comfortable looking perfect or being perfect. My taste is weird and I couldn\u2019t make a perfect room if I tried.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"horizontal rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">horizontal rule</a> </figure>  <h2>Changing spaces: Jenna Lyons\u2019s top tips for refreshing a room, by Emma Love</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> When I\u2019m shopping for vintage furniture online I have a trick of typing in a colour instead of a specific piece. It pulls up a whole different search and I\u2019ll find all kinds of crazy stuff. In the living room, I knew I wanted something green so I put in the colour and discovered a cube by designer Aldo Tura which I never knew existed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa07290a7f7a68ff0e3d19f310bba97b71ae8cdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa07290a7f7a68ff0e3d19f310bba97b71ae8cdd/0_1628_4378_4378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen confidential: unlacquered brass splashbacks and honed marble countertops create a strong aesthetic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kitchen confidential: unlacquered brass splashbacks and honed marble countertops create a strong aesthetic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Franzen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2. </strong>Don\u2019t be afraid of re-upholstering vintage furniture. Mohair velvet or cotton velvet are my favourite materials to use. Also, re-upholstering isn\u2019t always cheap to do, but it is easy to change, so it\u2019s not the end of the world if you decide that you don\u2019t want to live with it forever.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Use your walls to represent you. Artwork doesn\u2019t have to be properly framed or perfect; take Polaroids and just pin them up. I have a bathroom that only I use where the wallpaper is covered in push pins holding up notes from people, photographs and pictures.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/\">Artsy.net</a> is really good for buying art, but I also find lots of amazing pieces at studio sales, art school shows and on Instagram. Recently, I came across Atelier MVM, the studio of Matthias Vriens-McGrath, who makes shell pieces. I\u2019m obsessed with his work.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> I have a problem with making the television a focal point of a room; instead, I\u2019ve made a big effort to make the space about people (in the living room, my TV is hidden behind the fireplace).</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>If you aren\u2019t confident with colour, it\u2019s helpful to look at a painting or drawing that you love and work with that. Take those colours that you think are beautiful, then pull them out elsewhere in the room.</p> <p><em>Live Beautiful by Athena Calderone is published on 3 March by Abrams at \u00a330.

A Serge Mouille sconce peeks out from behind a jungle-motif Dimore Studio screen; a leopard-print pouf sits next to a pink Milo Baughman sofa. There is an artful mastery and playfulness in her placement and mix of objects, materials and finishes, yet this particular mix still reads bohemian. The way she famously married sequins and camouflage in fashion mirrors her rule-breaking tendencies at home. She deliberately disrupts the symmetry of the architecture by hanging her artwork off-centre, or leaning it against the wall, and the eccentric placement highlights the work. After finding the Milo Baughman sofa \u2013 the anchor of the main living space \u2013 she altered it by removing the tufting and upholstering it in pink cotton velvet. \u201cIn my job, I got used to having to say, \u2018This is what we\u2019re gonna do, it\u2019s gonna be OK, we\u2019re gonna try it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cTaking a chance and trying something is probably more valuable than just staying within the borders and what the rules are.\u201d Green and pink \u2013 a combination that has a preppy reputation \u2013 is a recurring colour pairing in her home. However, it\u2019s made fresh and cool in Lyons\u2019s hands: an Aldo Tura pale malachite-hued goatskin cube is positioned by the pink sofa; avocado-green lacquer covers the powder-room walls; French 18th-century threadbare peridot mohair chairs are dotted throughout the living room; plants add to this surprising colour palette. Lyons credits the Milan-based design duo behind Dimore Studio for influencing her brazen colour choices. \u201cI\u2019m so taken by their unapologetic colour mixing and unusual textures and combinations.\u201d Working at the nexus of fashion, art, design and travel, Lyons brings all these elements into her home. She commissioned her builder to make floating brass-clad bedside tables in homage to Donald Judd, and a bathroom at the Gritti Palace in Venice inspired her to source veined marble for her own. She channels and filters ideas between the various disciplines in an original way. She worked with her contractor to finesse the millwork, mouldings and add extra-tall doors and high doorknobs (Lyons is 5ft 11in). In all of the finishes \u2013 the unlacquered brass splashbacks in the kitchen, the honed marble countertops, the unfinished oak floors \u2013 she wants life to be visible. \u201cI had long conversations with my contractor about making sure the floors weren\u2019t too perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted them to wear enough to show spills and reveal the markings of people\u2019s footsteps walking down the hall. Once I left a window open and spatters of rain came in so now that corner of the floor looks dappled and I like it. I\u2019ve never felt comfortable looking perfect or being perfect. My taste is weird and I couldn\u2019t make a perfect room if I tried.\u201d Changing spaces: Jenna Lyons\u2019s top tips for refreshing a room, by Emma Love 1. When I\u2019m shopping for vintage furniture online I have a trick of typing in a colour instead of a specific piece. It pulls up a whole different search and I\u2019ll find all kinds of crazy stuff. In the living room, I knew I wanted something green so I put in the colour and discovered a cube by designer Aldo Tura which I never knew existed. 2. Don\u2019t be afraid of re-upholstering vintage furniture. Mohair velvet or cotton velvet are my favourite materials to use. Also, re-upholstering isn\u2019t always cheap to do, but it is easy to change, so it\u2019s not the end of the world if you decide that you don\u2019t want to live with it forever. 3. Use your walls to represent you. Artwork doesn\u2019t have to be properly framed or perfect; take Polaroids and just pin them up. I have a bathroom that only I use where the wallpaper is covered in push pins holding up notes from people, photographs and pictures. 4. Artsy.net is really good for buying art, but I also find lots of amazing pieces at studio sales, art school shows and on Instagram. Recently, I came across Atelier MVM, the studio of Matthias Vriens-McGrath, who makes shell pieces. I\u2019m obsessed with his work. 5. I have a problem with making the television a focal point of a room; instead, I\u2019ve made a big effort to make the space about people (in the living room, my TV is hidden behind the fireplace). 6. If you aren\u2019t confident with colour, it\u2019s helpful to look at a painting or drawing that you love and work with that. Take those colours that you think are beautiful, then pull them out elsewhere in the room. Live Beautiful by Athena Calderone is published on 3 March by Abrams at \u00a330.

The case has been dismissed for lack of evidence, and Tony will be flying home to the UK on the next available flight from Cairo.\u201d</p> <p>Camoccio was arrested at airport security in the Egyptian resort town of Hurghada last week. His family maintained that he faced serious accusations, after patting an official on the back after a routine pat-down at a security checkpoint before boarding his flight.</p> <p>Egyptian officials, including those at Hurghada airport, insisted that Camoccio had made sexual and inappropriate gestures at a police officer, and that CCTV footage of the incident supported their case against him. </p> <p>While staff at Hurghada airport were unwilling to share the footage when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/british-man-held-in-egypt-for-patting-police-officer-on-back-sexual-assault\">requested to do so by the Guardian</a>, officials insisted that the officer felt he had been harmed and wanted to receive legal recompense.</p> <p>Egyptian authorities have attempted to combat the widespread problem of sexual harassment in the country, where an estimated 99.3% of Egyptian women and girls reported experiencing sexual harassment in a 2013 UN study.</p> <p>Camoccio\u2019s case has also shone a spotlight on Egypt\u2019s legal system, often criticised by observers for its lack of transparency and due process, especially for Egyptian citizens.</p> <p>The World Justice Project\u2019s <a href=\"http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/\">rule of law index</a> ranks Egypt\u2019s judicial system the lowest out of all countries in the region, and 121 out of 126 countries worldwide. The Egyptian judiciary is considered independent but co-opted by state interests, often used as a tool to bludgeon the government\u2019s political opponents or enact mass incarcerations without objective merit.</p> <p>Egypt holds an <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/01/07/egypt-little-truth-al-sisis-60-minutes-responses\">estimated</a> 60,000 political prisoners, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/threat-of-jail-shapes-egyptian-lives-nine-years-after-uprising\">threat of prison</a> has been used to intimidate even the mildest critics. American citizen Mustafa Kassem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/mustafa-kassem-us-citizen-dies-egypt-prison-hunger-strike\">died in a Cairo prison</a> in January after a prologued hunger strike in protest at his treatment.</p> <p>Stirling said international attention on Camoccio\u2019s case was the deciding factor. She said: \u201cWhile the charges were clearly without merit, we have to emphasise that had British authorities and the international press not paid attention to this case, there is no reason to believe that Tony would be a free man today.</p> <p>\u201cAs is so often the case for foreigners in the region, unless an international spotlight is shone on their plight, they have no guarantee of safe resolutions when suffering in obscurity.\u201d</p> <p>Camoccio said: \u201cI\u2019m very excited to be heading home and can\u2019t wait to see all of my family and rest after the past week\u2019s events. I\u2019m very thankful to everyone for their support, my friends and family, my lawyer, Elezab Ali Elezab, John Kenny from the consulate, and Radha Stirling, who have done their best to get me home.\u201d</p>",

The case has been dismissed for lack of evidence, and Tony will be flying home to the UK on the next available flight from Cairo.\u201d Camoccio was arrested at airport security in the Egyptian resort town of Hurghada last week. His family maintained that he faced serious accusations, after patting an official on the back after a routine pat-down at a security checkpoint before boarding his flight. Egyptian officials, including those at Hurghada airport, insisted that Camoccio had made sexual and inappropriate gestures at a police officer, and that CCTV footage of the incident supported their case against him. While staff at Hurghada airport were unwilling to share the footage when requested to do so by the Guardian, officials insisted that the officer felt he had been harmed and wanted to receive legal recompense. Egyptian authorities have attempted to combat the widespread problem of sexual harassment in the country, where an estimated 99.3% of Egyptian women and girls reported experiencing sexual harassment in a 2013 UN study. Camoccio\u2019s case has also shone a spotlight on Egypt\u2019s legal system, often criticised by observers for its lack of transparency and due process, especially for Egyptian citizens. The World Justice Project\u2019s rule of law index ranks Egypt\u2019s judicial system the lowest out of all countries in the region, and 121 out of 126 countries worldwide. The Egyptian judiciary is considered independent but co-opted by state interests, often used as a tool to bludgeon the government\u2019s political opponents or enact mass incarcerations without objective merit. Egypt holds an estimated 60,000 political prisoners, and the threat of prison has been used to intimidate even the mildest critics. American citizen Mustafa Kassem died in a Cairo prison in January after a prologued hunger strike in protest at his treatment. Stirling said international attention on Camoccio\u2019s case was the deciding factor. She said: \u201cWhile the charges were clearly without merit, we have to emphasise that had British authorities and the international press not paid attention to this case, there is no reason to believe that Tony would be a free man today. \u201cAs is so often the case for foreigners in the region, unless an international spotlight is shone on their plight, they have no guarantee of safe resolutions when suffering in obscurity.\u201d Camoccio said: \u201cI\u2019m very excited to be heading home and can\u2019t wait to see all of my family and rest after the past week\u2019s events. I\u2019m very thankful to everyone for their support, my friends and family, my lawyer, Elezab Ali Elezab, John Kenny from the consulate, and Radha Stirling, who have done their best to get me home.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Pretending to be dead for this long is definitely Jeremy\u2019s worst extended joke so far,\u201d writes Sandi Toksvig in her tribute to Jeremy Hardy, one of a series of reflections from his friends that pepper a new anthology of his writing, <em>Jeremy Hardy Speaks Volumes</em>. A year after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/01/comedian-jeremy-hardy-dies-of-cancer-aged-57\" title=\"\">death on 1 February 2019</a>, it\u2019s a sentiment shared by Hardy\u2019s wife, the film-maker Katie Barlow, who co-edited the book.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still half-expecting him to come back from touring,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I read something funny, or that might interest him, I go to call out to him to come and look, as if he\u2019s just working in his study \u2013 \u201d she gestures to a door through the kitchen of their south London home \u2013 \u201cand then I have to stop myself.\u201d</p> <p>A box of books has just arrived from the publisher, the first time she has seen finished copies, and for a while she couldn\u2019t bring herself to open it. It\u2019s partly the finality of what the book represents, as she explains in her afterword: \u201cBy agreeing to edit this book, it felt like I was accepting that Jeremy has gone. But I will never accept what happened to Jeremy\u2026 Jeremy didn\u2019t want to die, and this book only exists because he did.\u201d</p> <p>How do you sum up a life \u2013 particularly one as multifaceted as Hardy\u2019s? So many friends and associates wanted to pay tribute at his memorial last year that it lasted more than six hours; along with fellow comedians, speakers included Jeremy Corbyn as well as Ahmad and Jawad, two young Afghan brothers Barlow met while making a documentary about refugees, and who became like family to her and Hardy. To put together a book that would do justice to Hardy\u2019s 30-plus years of comedy, as well as his journalism and activism, seemed a daunting task, especially so soon after his death.</p> <p>\u201cI would have liked more time,\u201d Barlow acknowledges. \u201cThe publishers approached me a few weeks after he died with the idea of doing something similar to a book they did for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/01/obituaries.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Linda Smith</a>, who was a great friend of Jeremy\u2019s. He wrote a reflection for that book, so I felt reassured that it would be in good hands and he\u2019d be with Linda. But at the time I was in no state to be trawling through all that material.\u201d The book was going to be co-edited by David Tyler, Hardy\u2019s longtime radio producer who had worked with him on his Radio 4 series <em>Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He'd passed into the digital world, where I saw him everywhere\u2026 it felt very strange</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDavid said we needed to give Jeremy back to the people, and I felt that I hadn\u2019t even begun to come to terms with the fact that he\u2019d gone, so how could I think about giving him back?\u201d she says. \u201cBut I realised I had to jump in and get involved or it wouldn\u2019t be the book that I wanted for Jeremy. I didn\u2019t want it just to be a radio anthology, although those shows are brilliant. But first and foremost Jeremy was a live standup, and he was also an activist and I wanted all those elements to be reflected. We had to find a compromise because I was adamant that more of his activism should be in there \u2013 it was such a big part of Jeremy\u2019s life and also how we met.\u201d</p> <p>In 2002 Barlow had a chance encounter with the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/04/open-bethlehem-review-leila-sansour\" title=\"\">Leila Sansour</a>, who was about to travel to Bethlehem with Hardy to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/jul/18/artsfeatures2\" title=\"\">a film</a> with the<a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/\" title=\"\"> International Solidarity Movement</a>, but her cameraman had pulled out at the last minute. Barlow offered to take his place, and a few days later she met Hardy for the first time at Heathrow airport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbaef13a4e2aad91b64e7e0558579f2acd290974\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbaef13a4e2aad91b64e7e0558579f2acd290974/0_320_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesting in London, July 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesting in London, July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kerrison/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI thought he was cute,\u201d she recalls, with a smile. \u201cWe were all quite nervous about what we were getting ourselves into, but Jeremy was so funny from the moment we set off, and he put us all at ease.\u201d</p> <p>They spent a week staying with a Palestinian family, filming in the camps, and fell in love among tanks and gunfire. The Palestinian cause remained a central part of their life, both personally and professionally; Hardy became an ambassador for <a href=\"https://www.map.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Medical Aid for Palestinians</a> and Barlow went on to make further films in the region. \u201cWhen Jeremy died, the Palestinian ambassador wrote to me saying Palestine has lost a great friend and supporter,\u201d Barlow says. She also shows me a moving condolence letter from Lord Alf Dubs, paying tribute to Hardy\u2019s work for refugees.</p> <p>The extraordinary public outpouring of affection for Hardy since his death has at times been difficult to reconcile with private grief. \u201cI really hadn\u2019t anticipated the scale of it,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cI knew he was loved but to that extent, I had no idea and I don\u2019t think he did. And it had been such an intense time during the last few weeks of his illness, nursing him and being in that zone with him, that it was quite overwhelming to suddenly find him everywhere. He was gone and I was devastated, I couldn\u2019t speak to him or hold him, but he\u2019d passed into this digital world where I saw him everywhere and everyone was talking about him. I was proud of him, but it felt very strange. There were so many people saying they looked up to him and that he inspired their career, and there are times when I think he could have done with hearing that himself, while he was alive. Because he never took his career for granted.\u201d</p> <p>In a corner of the room, propped on a coffee table, is a photograph of the couple on their wedding day in December 2018. They\u2019re captured kissing on a bus, half-hidden by a giant bouquet; they look giddy with happiness. Three days after his own wedding, Hardy walked Betty, his daughter from his first marriage, down the aisle on her wedding day. Six weeks later, he died.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy asked me to marry him in the last year of his life,\u201d Barlow explains. Though they had been together 17 years, they hadn\u2019t felt the need before \u2013 there\u2019s a piece in the book from a 2017 radio show where Hardy jokes about all the reasons it\u2019s best not to marry your partner. After his death Barlow was looking through the writing he left behind and found a diary he had started after his diagnosis in June 2018, which she had not seen before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"85e2df7791b6acdc4f9b32f5ba9928c15816c4fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e2df7791b6acdc4f9b32f5ba9928c15816c4fc/0_0_3313_5136/645.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hardy outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, 2010.\" width=\"645\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Hardy outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was exactly what I needed to read at the time,\u201d she says, her voice a little shaky for the first time since we\u2019ve been speaking. \u201cI was feeling quite lost and looking for a connection with him, something that was just ours, so I was thrilled to find this. It was incredibly emotional.\u201d</p> <p>The diaries have not been published, but Barlow shows me this extract from a longer piece written on 1 September, 2018, the day Hardy received what he called the \u201cbombshell consultation\u201d, when he learned the cancer had spread and could not be operated on:</p> <p>So, having resolved to go nowhere without a fight, I was able to be calm when I called Katie. I mustered all the composure I could. I did not sound too devastated. I needed to be a greater man than I had ever been, which you might not think was much of an achievement, but it was in the circumstances\u2026 I told her I wanted to marry her, and I do. Not just because that\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re going to die, but because I want to marry her and then not die\u2026 And I\u2019d have loved to be talking about marriage now, having just told her the cancer hasn\u2019t spread, talking about many years of being married, with a love that\u2019s renewed. But I\u2019m telling her with nothing to offer but what courage and determination I have\u2026 And \u2018till death do us part\u2019 is an easy pledge at this moment. But marrying her means something now, everything now.</p> <p>Even in death, Hardy continues to surprise her. Looking through his material for the book, she was saddened to find how few recordings of his live work apparently survived. But a few days after it went to press, she received a call from the University of Kent, asking if she knew that in 2016 Hardy had deposited an archive with them consisting of 103 VHS tapes and 79 audio cassettes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI told them, \u2018Your timing is impeccable.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It means that <em>Jeremy Hardy Speaks Volumes</em> doesn\u2019t have to be the last word. Because of the vast amount of material that necessarily had to be left out, and the new archive, there\u2019s scope for future compilations, and perhaps a biography at some point. While the process of editing the book has often been a painful reminder of Hardy\u2019s absence, it also gave Barlow an opportunity to appreciate his work in greater depth. \u201cIn the end it kept him close,\u201d she writes in the afterword.</p> <p>In the meantime, Hardy ensured that she would keep busy. She had been working on a virtual reality art project, <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/parwaz-vr\" title=\"\"><em>Parwaz</em></a>, with Ahmad and Jawad, but had put it on hold to concentrate on nursing her husband through his last months. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know was that Jeremy had been secretly fundraising for the project,\u201d she says. \u201cOn Christmas Day 2018 he told me he\u2019d raised more than \u00a320,000 so that we could finish it, so that it could be his legacy and his gift to me and the boys. I think he knew that I would need something to focus on when he\u2019d gone.

And they had this fantastic sort of ad hoc dining room carved out of volcanic lava that was still flowing. And they cooked us this wonderful meal.

      "bodyText": "Pretending to be dead for this long is definitely Jeremy\u2019s worst extended joke so far,\u201d writes Sandi Toksvig in her tribute to Jeremy Hardy, one of a series of reflections from his friends that pepper a new anthology of his writing, Jeremy Hardy Speaks Volumes. A year after his death on 1 February 2019, it\u2019s a sentiment shared by Hardy\u2019s wife, the film-maker Katie Barlow, who co-edited the book. \u201cI\u2019m still half-expecting him to come back from touring,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I read something funny, or that might interest him, I go to call out to him to come and look, as if he\u2019s just working in his study \u2013 \u201d she gestures to a door through the kitchen of their south London home \u2013 \u201cand then I have to stop myself.\u201d A box of books has just arrived from the publisher, the first time she has seen finished copies, and for a while she couldn\u2019t bring herself to open it. It\u2019s partly the finality of what the book represents, as she explains in her afterword: \u201cBy agreeing to edit this book, it felt like I was accepting that Jeremy has gone. But I will never accept what happened to Jeremy\u2026 Jeremy didn\u2019t want to die, and this book only exists because he did.\u201d How do you sum up a life \u2013 particularly one as multifaceted as Hardy\u2019s? So many friends and associates wanted to pay tribute at his memorial last year that it lasted more than six hours; along with fellow comedians, speakers included Jeremy Corbyn as well as Ahmad and Jawad, two young Afghan brothers Barlow met while making a documentary about refugees, and who became like family to her and Hardy. To put together a book that would do justice to Hardy\u2019s 30-plus years of comedy, as well as his journalism and activism, seemed a daunting task, especially so soon after his death. \u201cI would have liked more time,\u201d Barlow acknowledges. \u201cThe publishers approached me a few weeks after he died with the idea of doing something similar to a book they did for Linda Smith, who was a great friend of Jeremy\u2019s. He wrote a reflection for that book, so I felt reassured that it would be in good hands and he\u2019d be with Linda. But at the time I was in no state to be trawling through all that material.\u201d The book was going to be co-edited by David Tyler, Hardy\u2019s longtime radio producer who had worked with him on his Radio 4 series Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation. \u201cDavid said we needed to give Jeremy back to the people, and I felt that I hadn\u2019t even begun to come to terms with the fact that he\u2019d gone, so how could I think about giving him back?\u201d she says. \u201cBut I realised I had to jump in and get involved or it wouldn\u2019t be the book that I wanted for Jeremy. I didn\u2019t want it just to be a radio anthology, although those shows are brilliant. But first and foremost Jeremy was a live standup, and he was also an activist and I wanted all those elements to be reflected. We had to find a compromise because I was adamant that more of his activism should be in there \u2013 it was such a big part of Jeremy\u2019s life and also how we met.\u201d In 2002 Barlow had a chance encounter with the director Leila Sansour, who was about to travel to Bethlehem with Hardy to make a film with the International Solidarity Movement, but her cameraman had pulled out at the last minute. Barlow offered to take his place, and a few days later she met Hardy for the first time at Heathrow airport. \u201cI thought he was cute,\u201d she recalls, with a smile. \u201cWe were all quite nervous about what we were getting ourselves into, but Jeremy was so funny from the moment we set off, and he put us all at ease.\u201d They spent a week staying with a Palestinian family, filming in the camps, and fell in love among tanks and gunfire. The Palestinian cause remained a central part of their life, both personally and professionally; Hardy became an ambassador for Medical Aid for Palestinians and Barlow went on to make further films in the region. \u201cWhen Jeremy died, the Palestinian ambassador wrote to me saying Palestine has lost a great friend and supporter,\u201d Barlow says. She also shows me a moving condolence letter from Lord Alf Dubs, paying tribute to Hardy\u2019s work for refugees. The extraordinary public outpouring of affection for Hardy since his death has at times been difficult to reconcile with private grief. \u201cI really hadn\u2019t anticipated the scale of it,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cI knew he was loved but to that extent, I had no idea and I don\u2019t think he did. And it had been such an intense time during the last few weeks of his illness, nursing him and being in that zone with him, that it was quite overwhelming to suddenly find him everywhere. He was gone and I was devastated, I couldn\u2019t speak to him or hold him, but he\u2019d passed into this digital world where I saw him everywhere and everyone was talking about him. I was proud of him, but it felt very strange. There were so many people saying they looked up to him and that he inspired their career, and there are times when I think he could have done with hearing that himself, while he was alive. Because he never took his career for granted.\u201d In a corner of the room, propped on a coffee table, is a photograph of the couple on their wedding day in December 2018. They\u2019re captured kissing on a bus, half-hidden by a giant bouquet; they look giddy with happiness. Three days after his own wedding, Hardy walked Betty, his daughter from his first marriage, down the aisle on her wedding day. Six weeks later, he died. \u201cJeremy asked me to marry him in the last year of his life,\u201d Barlow explains. Though they had been together 17 years, they hadn\u2019t felt the need before \u2013 there\u2019s a piece in the book from a 2017 radio show where Hardy jokes about all the reasons it\u2019s best not to marry your partner. After his death Barlow was looking through the writing he left behind and found a diary he had started after his diagnosis in June 2018, which she had not seen before. \u201cIt was exactly what I needed to read at the time,\u201d she says, her voice a little shaky for the first time since we\u2019ve been speaking. \u201cI was feeling quite lost and looking for a connection with him, something that was just ours, so I was thrilled to find this. It was incredibly emotional.\u201d The diaries have not been published, but Barlow shows me this extract from a longer piece written on 1 September, 2018, the day Hardy received what he called the \u201cbombshell consultation\u201d, when he learned the cancer had spread and could not be operated on: So, having resolved to go nowhere without a fight, I was able to be calm when I called Katie. I mustered all the composure I could. I did not sound too devastated. I needed to be a greater man than I had ever been, which you might not think was much of an achievement, but it was in the circumstances\u2026 I told her I wanted to marry her, and I do. Not just because that\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re going to die, but because I want to marry her and then not die\u2026 And I\u2019d have loved to be talking about marriage now, having just told her the cancer hasn\u2019t spread, talking about many years of being married, with a love that\u2019s renewed. But I\u2019m telling her with nothing to offer but what courage and determination I have\u2026 And \u2018till death do us part\u2019 is an easy pledge at this moment. But marrying her means something now, everything now. Even in death, Hardy continues to surprise her. Looking through his material for the book, she was saddened to find how few recordings of his live work apparently survived. But a few days after it went to press, she received a call from the University of Kent, asking if she knew that in 2016 Hardy had deposited an archive with them consisting of 103 VHS tapes and 79 audio cassettes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI told them, \u2018Your timing is impeccable.\u2019\u201d It means that Jeremy Hardy Speaks Volumes doesn\u2019t have to be the last word. Because of the vast amount of material that necessarily had to be left out, and the new archive, there\u2019s scope for future compilations, and perhaps a biography at some point. While the process of editing the book has often been a painful reminder of Hardy\u2019s absence, it also gave Barlow an opportunity to appreciate his work in greater depth. \u201cIn the end it kept him close,\u201d she writes in the afterword. In the meantime, Hardy ensured that she would keep busy. She had been working on a virtual reality art project, Parwaz, with Ahmad and Jawad, but had put it on hold to concentrate on nursing her husband through his last months. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know was that Jeremy had been secretly fundraising for the project,\u201d she says. \u201cOn Christmas Day 2018 he told me he\u2019d raised more than \u00a320,000 so that we could finish it, so that it could be his legacy and his gift to me and the boys. I think he knew that I would need something to focus on when he\u2019d gone. At one point last year I thought, you bastard, this means I actually have to finish it now \u2013 haven\u2019t I got enough to deal with?\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut that was Jeremy \u2013 he was thinking of other people, right up to the end.\u2019 \u2022 Jeremy Hardy Speaks Volumes, edited by Katie Barlow and David Tyler, is published by John Murray Press (\u00a320).

Even if you live in the luxuriant Vale of Evesham and eat seasonally, it\u2019s likely that asparagus you buy in May, even if grown a mile from your supermarket, is driven to an airfield, flown to Algeria for trimming and enhanced interrogation, then to a secret black site in a former Warsaw Pact country, where it\u2019s hosed down and subjected to a cling-film restraint technique, before being rendered back to England and driven under cover of darkness back to the area where it was picked. Which is a good reason for eschewing supermarkets in favour of greengrocers and farmers\u2019 markets. We now have lovely farmers\u2019 markets in London.

Acknowledging that the challenge of rebuilding Scottish Labour \u2013 which polled 18.6% in last December\u2019s election, its worst result in recent history \u2013 was \u201cabsolutely enormous\u201d, she noted that voters in Aberdeen could still feel distant from Holyrood in Edinburgh, saying: \u201cWe give people power over their own lives by handing more power to councils.\u201d Long-Bailey said the party had to understand \u201cwhere our votes went\u201d both in the north of England and in Scotland. \u201cWe can\u2019t blame our voters for going to the SNP,\u201d she said, before calling for \u201cradical devolution\u201d, including more powers to Holyrood for additional borrowing and employment rights, reflecting the recommendations of Pauline Bryan, the Corbyn ally tasked last year with writing a detailed paper on how federalism could work.",

It\u2019s ten points out of the last 12 for Burnley. Saints are booed off. 90 min +3: Vydra takes the ball towards the flag out on the left, and tries to trick Vestrgaard into fouling him. He doesn\u2019t win a free kick, but the clock ticks on. 90 min +2: Four added minutes. The first two whistle by without Saints threatening. 90 min: Saints are leaving all sorts of gaps at the back now, as they chase the equaliser. Hendrick creams a pass towards Vydra, who is free down the middle, but McCarthy comes out of his box to clear. Then the home side go up the other end, Hojbjerg bringing down a left-wing cross, just to the right of the six-yard box. He slaps a shot straight at Pope, though take nothing away from the keeper\u2019s work. He made himself big, and looks to have secured the three points for Burnley. 89 min: Rodriguez rasps a rising shot towards the top right. McCarthy tips it over. Corner. It\u2019s swung towards the back post, but Vydra can\u2019t connect and the pressure\u2019s off the home side. 88 min: Obafemi goes up for a high ball with Bardsley, and leaves an elbow on the Burnley man\u2019s temple. He\u2019s extremely fortunate to get away with just a yellow card. He should be walking. 86 min: Long is replaced by Adams. Saints win a corner and do nothing with it. 85 min: Ralph Hasenhuttl is livid with the no-penalty decision, and he\u2019s got a point. On the one hand, Mee didn\u2019t move his arm towards the ball, in fact he was pulling it away. However, that arm was hanging well wide of the defender\u2019s body. Not a completely natural position. File under: You\u2019ve Seen Them Given. Burnley have got away with one there. 83 min: Stephens channels his inner Beckenbauer and dribbles down the inside-right channel. He reaches the byline and crosses. The ball clatters into Mee\u2019s arm. Saints demand a penalty kick, but there\u2019s a VAR check, and they\u2019re not getting it. 81 min: Djnepo drops a shoulder to make space down the left, but his cross is aimless. Cleared. 79 min: Ings gifts the ball to Vydra in the centre circle. Burnley flood forward. Eventually Taylor is released into acres down the left. He enters the box and fizzes a fine pass along the corridor of uncertainty. But neither Hendrick nor Rodriguez is on the front foot, and a ball that was begging to be poked home flies harmlessly out for a throw. Burnley really should have put Saints out of their misery, but the home side are still in this. 78 min: Armstrong cuts in from the right and has a dig. The shot\u2019s deflected over for a corner, from which the same player shoots, 25 yards out. The effort is as wild as the weather. 77 min: Obafemi makes off down the right and is barged over from behind by Tarkowski. Not for the first time this afternoon, the referee does nowt when he should be whistling like billy-o. He\u2019s been poor today. 75 min: McNeil sprints off down the left. He\u2019s got options in the box, where there are more green shirts than red. But his pullback for Hendrick is dismal, behind the man, and Hendrick can only drag a weak effort goalwards. Rodriguez intercepts and slots home, but he\u2019s clearly miles offside, and the flag goes up. Burnley should have put this game to bed. 74 min: Ings crosses deep from the left. It\u2019s a decent cross, but nobody\u2019s there at the back post. Nobody gambling. Nobody taking a chance. Ings gesticulates at his team-mates accordingly. 73 min: Saints throw on another attacker. Obafemi comes on for Walker-Peters. 72 min: Taylor burns down the left and wins a corner, from which McCarthy flaps thin air. More displeasure in the stands. Then Bardsley has a crack from the best part of 40 yards. Even in these conditions, that was at the very limit of realistic ambition. 70 min: Bardsley nearly feeds Rodriguez down the right. McCarthy comes to the edge of his box to gather, then shanks a clearance straight out of play. The home crowd groan, hoot and holler. They\u2019re not happy with the way Southampton are going about their business right now. They\u2019ve been dismal since conceding the second goal. 68 min: Djenpo concedes possession cheaply in the centre circle. Had Vydra been a little livelier, a break was on, but he dawdles and Saints swarm him to rescue the situation. The home crowd are getting a little antsy. 66 min: Ward-Prowse and Walker-Peters combine down the right again, the latter whipping a low cross into the mixer. Ings is sniffing around, but it\u2019s Tarkowski who is brightest and snuffs out the attack. 64 min: Walker-Peters and Ward-Prowse probe down the right, but can\u2019t find a chink in the Burnley armour. Saints have dominated possession this afternoon, but once again they\u2019re not getting any reward for it. Same old story. 62 min: Saints try to strike back immediately, Bertrand having a dig from 25 yards. It looks as though the shot is deflected behind by Tarkowski, but Saints aren\u2019t getting the corner. On the touchline, with the rain flattening his Conan O\u2019Brien quiff, Ralph Hasenhuttl openly seethes. What a goal this is! With the rain swirling like mad, Hendrick launches long from the right, finding Vydra on the edge of the Saints box, with his back to goal. He takes two touches to nudge the ball to the left, turns and larrups a stunner into the top left past a sprawling McCarthy. That\u2019s some finish, and out of nothing, Burnley regain the lead. 59 min: McCarthy blooters long. Ings gets the better of Tarkowski down the inside-right channel, but there\u2019s no angle for a shot and his cross is way too high for his partner Long in the centre. 58 min: Latest score: Match 0-1 Storm Dennis. More when we have it. 56 min: Bardsley goes clattering into Djnepo, becoming the latest player to get away with one. The referee\u2019s decisions are becoming positively psychedelic. 54 min: Taylor goes sliding in on Armstrong, out on the right touchline, catching both ball and man. It\u2019s a clear foul, but not given by either lino or ref. The referee is beginning to flirt with Shocker territory. 52 min: Vestergaard, quarterbacking from deep, sprays a stunning diagonal ball towards Ings on the right. Ings can\u2019t bring it down. He\u2019d have been clear. What a pass, though. 50 min: Vydra turns cutely on the byline, just to the left of the Saints box. Stephens trips him clumsily, but gets away with the foul. Vydra is furious, and he\u2019s got every right. He\u2019d have been away. 48 min: Saints establish a modicum of control. They stroke it around the midfield for a while, then Djnepo dribbles down the left and slips a pass inside for Bertrand, who slaps an instant shot into the side netting. He had more time than he thought, and should have done better. 47 min: Hectic nonsense in the early stages of this half, as the teams try to come to terms with the wind again. Burnley get the second half underway. No changes. Half-time entertainment. Nick Ames has been poking around Ralph Hasenhuttl\u2019s old gaff. Here\u2019s his report. Saints have been the better team, and Danny Ings scored a marvellous goal. But he was also at fault for Burnley\u2019s preposterous opener, so here we are. 45 min +4: The wind is swirling around St Mary\u2019s, and the players are beginning to struggle. Passing sequences at a premium right now. Half time can\u2019t come soon enough. 45 min +2: Ings nearly closes down Pope as the keeper dallies over a launch upfield. Not quite, but full marks for the press. 45 min: There will be five added minutes. 43 min: Mee is booked for his agricultural obstruction of Ings in midfield. No complaints about that one. 42 min: Hojberg sends a diagonal ball into the Burnley box from a deep position on the left. Walker-Peters zips in from the other flank and isn\u2019t far away from getting on the end of the cross, but Pope reads the danger well to claim. 41 min: The rain continues to fall. The wind still blows. The players are trying their best. 39 min: Boufal can\u2019t continue. He limps off and disappears down the tunnel, to be replaced by Djnepo. 37 min: Boufal is down, having tweaked something while sending in that second cross. A shake of the head as he gets some treatment. In the dugout, Ralph Hasenhuttl curses his luck. Boufal has looked very dangerous. 36 min: Boufal dribbles with great purpose down the left, but there\u2019s nobody in the middle to convert his pullback. Boufal tries again with another run, and loops long, but Long\u2019s header at the far stick is soft and easy meat for Pope. 34 min: Westwood slips a cute pass down the middle for Vydra, who should do better with his attempt to poke the ball towards the bottom left. McCarthy gathers with ease. 33 min: So having mentioned how entertaining the match has been, it\u2019s now gone a bit scrappy. Pulitzer, please! 31 min: Now it\u2019s Vydra\u2019s turn to attempt a homage to Bergkamp\u2019s aforementioned goal against Newcastle! There must be something in the air. But Vestergaard stands firm as Vydra traps and spins, and puts an end to the Burnley striker\u2019s ambition. 29 min: Cork comes straight through the back of Ward-Prowse, wrapping his leg around his opponents. That looked painful, though the Saints man isn\u2019t hurt badly. For some reason, the referee doesn\u2019t book Cork; it wouldn\u2019t have been a completely absurd decision to send him off. But it\u2019s just a firm word. Very strange. 28 min: Armstrong chips a pass down the inside-left channel for Boufal, who nearly executes a Bergkampesque trap and spin to free himself in the box. Not quite. The ball runs out of play. But nearly. Boufal was clearly of a mind to replicate this: 26 min: Hendrick is booked for a cynical clip on Boufal\u2019s heel. From the resulting free kick, Ward-Prowse slips Boufal into space down the left. Boufal curls a cross onto the head of Stephens, who rattles the crossbar with a fine header. Burnley escape. This is great to-and-fro entertainment, despite, or perhaps because of, the conditions. 24 min: Saints have done very well to work their way back into this match after that ridiculous start. Especially when you consider what happened to them the last time they played at St Mary\u2019s in a tempest. That Leicester City game must have crossed their minds, albeit briefly. Top marks for mental fortitude. 22 min: Vydra comes on for the stricken Wood. 21 min: Burnley get the game going again, and nearly regain the lead immediately. Bardsley pearls a low diagonal shot from distance on the right. The lurking Rodriguez sticks out a boot, but can\u2019t guide it into the bottom left. The ball flies inches wide. 20 min: The game hasn\u2019t restarted yet, because Wood is down clutching his hamstring. Up he gets, and off he goes, shaking his head. He won\u2019t take any further part in this. Danny Ings makes up for his role in Burnley\u2019s goal! And how. He snatches onto a loose ball, on the edge of the Burnley D. He shifts it right, taking three Burnley defenders out of the game, and curls a stunning shot into the bottom corner. That\u2019s a delightful finish, the shot set outside the post and curled back in, leaving Pope with no chance. 16 min: Vestergaard is caught faffing around 25 yards from his own goal by Hendrick. Rodriguez nearly makes off with the ball, but loses control. Vestergaard is booked for following through while being robbed by Hendrick. 14 min: The wind is picking up. That\u2019s quite the state of affairs, given that Hojbjerg took a shot earlier that basically took a u-turn in mid-air. This could get interesting. 12 min: A free kick for Burnley out on the right. Hendrick sends a big diagonal towards Tarkowski, who brings the ball down with a deft touch. He\u2019s in space, but slams his cross into the first man. A waste, because Saints\u2019 high line had been busted open and the home defence was all over the shop. 11 min: Burnley\u2019s goal was timed at one minute and 35 seconds. According to BT Sport, it\u2019s their fastest start in an away match in the Premier League. The statistician earning their corn with that one. 9 min: The set piece comes to nothing. But Long\u2019s soon skedaddling down the inside-left channel to win another corner for Saints. That\u2019s a bit of a non-event as well, but this is a decent response to falling behind in farcical circumstances from the home side. 7 min: Armstrong has a dig from 25 yards, just to the right of centre. Tarkowski sticks out a leg to divert away for a corner, Southampton\u2019s first of the match. 5 min: Saints try to hit back quickly, Boufal looping a cross from the right towards Long at the far post. Long heads back across goal, but with Pope out of position, there\u2019s nobody there to poke home. 4 min: What a bizarre cock-up. I have no idea what Ings was doing. A deliberate decision to let the ball past. Did McCarthy give him a shout to leave it. A bum steer? It\u2019s one explanation. It won\u2019t be easy for Saints, that is. Wood powers his way down the left and wins the first corner of the game. Westwood takes, and curls it towards the near post. Ings is guarding, but decides the ball is hitting the side netting. It\u2019s not, though. Ings opts to let the ball through. In it curls, direct from the corner. Ings puts his head in his hands, as well he might. What a fiasco, and he can\u2019t blame the wind. A huge misjudgement. And we\u2019re off! Saints get the party started. The conditions are appalling, it\u2019s tipping down, and the wind\u2019s up. The ball is immediately hoicked into the stand. That may or may not be a sign of things to come. It won\u2019t be easy. The teams are out! Saints are in their famous red and white stripes, while Burnley sport their third-choice evergreen. We\u2019ll be off in a minute. Meanwhile, speaking of jazz-fusion bassist Alphonso Johnson, as we were, sort of, at 12.08pm: \u201cOMG! That is so weird!\u201d begins Derek Smalls Colin Young. \u201cI have had that image of Weather Report\u2019s Mysterious Traveller LP cover as my computer desktop image for as long as I have had a computer. Never seen it anywhere else. Nobody I know knows what it is ... so obviously it has to turn up on the Guardian\u2019s football blog for a Saints vs Burnley game. Clearly. But I do agree, \u2018Cucumber Slumber\u2019 I mean that bassline, it, erm, blows away (sorry) most other basslines in the world. So obviously this game is going to be a breeze.\u201d The managers have their say. First up, Ralph Hasenhuttl: \u201cNathan Redmond has a muscle injury. It\u2019s hard to say how long he will be out. But this is a chance for other players to show up. This is an important game. We lost the first game 3-0 so we want to show we\u2019re better now.\u201d And then Sean Dyche: \u201cWe will find out a bit more about Matt Lowton\u2019s knee injury later this week. But the good news is Charlie Taylor is back from a niggling hamstring. It\u2019s not easy to knock out wins all the time, you\u2019re going to have spells, and it\u2019s about how you come out of them. And we have come out with an edge to our performances, with a little x-factor.\u201d Weather report: That is some bassline. In other news, Storm Dennis has arrived on the south coast, and my oh my it\u2019s a good old blow. So the wind and the rain may play some part this afternoon. This could be a jazz odyssey. Saints make four changes to the side that went down bravely at Spurs a couple of weeks ago. Alex McCarthy replaces Angus Gunn in goal. Kyle Walker-Peters makes his debut at right back. Jannik Vestergaard and Stuart Armstrong return. Missing out: Jan Bednarek, Oriol Romeu and Nathan Redmond. Burnley make just the one change to the XI named for the goalless draw with Arsenal. Matt Lowton is replaced by Phil Bardsley. Southampton: McCarthy, Walker-Peters, Stephens, Vestergaard, Bertrand, Armstrong, Ward-Prowse, Hojbjerg, Boufal, Long, Ings. Subs: Adams, Djenepo, Romeu, Obafemi, Smallbone, Gunn, Bednarek. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Rodriguez, Wood. Subs: Brownhill, Brady, Hart, Pieters, Lennon, Vydra, Long. Referee: Simon Hooper (Wiltshire). Saints and Burnley don\u2019t put on a show when they get together that often. Their last six meetings have produced a grand total of nine goals, and three of those came in a lopsided 3-0 win for Burnley on the opening day of this season. Needless to say, the goalscorers in that one, Ashley Barnes and Johann Berg Gudmundsson, are missing today. There\u2019s not a whole load riding on this game, either. It\u2019s true that neither side is totally safe from relegation worry. But it\u2019s also surely the case that, relatively comfy in mid-table and seven clear of the drop zone, both sides are far too good to be seriously concerned about their fate. Saints deserved far more than the square root of eff all they got from recent visits to Anfield and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, while Burnley have recently won at Old Trafford. So there\u2019s little jeopardy in this. What I\u2019m doing here, brazenly, dear reader, is tempting fate. If this low-energy preamble doesn\u2019t earn us a rollocking seven-goal thriller, nothing will. Come on, footballing gods, teach the MBM some humility. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm.",

And so the portrayal of Mr Knightley, hero of the latest big-screen version of Austen\u2019s Emma, has been the subject of much speculation ahead of the film\u2019s opening on 14 February.

Among other recent Flynn successes has been his stage performance in the West End and on Broadway in the acclaimed Martin McDonagh play Hangmen, and his 2017 film role opposite Jessie Buckley in the psychological thriller Beast, set on Jersey.

John Lewis, the British chain of department stores, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/warpaint-for-men-make-up-rolled-out-across-the-uk-after-successful-trial-11930769\">recently announced</a> that it is opening a permanent makeup counter for men. This follows a hugely successful trial in its flagship London store; demand for War Paint for Men, a range of male-focused cosmetics, was 50% higher than expected.</p> <p>\u201cWe are finally starting to see men\u2019s makeup become the norm and break the stigma that has been around for years,\u201d said Daniel Gray, the founder of War Paint.</p> <p>Male makeup hasn\u2019t been entirely destigmatized. There\u2019s a reason that the brand is called War Paint, after all. You\u2019re not buying girly cosmetics, fellas, this is camouflage! But Gray is right; attitudes are changing fast. The male personal care market has grown exponentially over the past decade, and is expected to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/men-are-a-multibillion-dollar-growth-opportunity-for-the-beauty-industry.html\">hit $166bn</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/men-are-a-multibillion-dollar-growth-opportunity-for-the-beauty-industry.html\"> by 2022</a>, according to Allied Market Research. Big brands have starting to cash in on the trend; the likes of Tom Ford and Chanel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/oct/13/makeup-for-men-beauty-trend\">have launched male beauty products</a> in recent years.</p> <p>Social media has been a big factor driving this change in attitudes. High-profile male beauty influencers like Jeffree Star and James Charles, who became the first male face of Covergirl in 2016, have helped redefine the category, demonstrating that makeup isn\u2019t just for women. The <a href=\"https://www.eonline.com/ap/news/1076719/men-in-makeup-korean-male-celebrities-are-changing-the-perception-of-male-beauty\">global rise of K-pop</a>, known for its pretty boys in full faces of makeup, has further propelled the cultural shift.</p> <p>The growth of male makeup is also linked to a broader shakeup of the gender binary. Younger generations are embracing gender-fluidity and there\u2019s been an increased demand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/nov/16/generation-z-signs-up-to-non-binary-catwalk-revolution\">gender-neutral fashion</a>. According to Mintel, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/male-makeup-is-catching-more-mens-eyes-in-the-u-s/\">more than two-thirds of Gen Z males</a> have said they\u2019re interested in gender-free beauty products, rather than traditionally male packaging. So, when it comes to younger guys, War Paint may want to rethink its marketing strategy.</p> <p>Generally speaking, the rise of male makeup is a positive thing. It\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re moving away from rigid gender role towards a more fluid future. However, there\u2019s also a dark side to the trend. As male beauty standards evolve, men are under increasing pressure to conform to these standards, and are becoming <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/28/new-standards-of-male-beauty-in-mens-cosmetics-sector.html\">more image-conscious</a> than ever. Male body image issues are <a href=\"https://this.deakin.edu.au/society/why-are-male-body-image-issues-on-the-rise\">on the rise</a> and <a href=\"https://time.com/4352400/men-women-body-image/\">studies suggest</a> men are now just as likely to be insecure about their appearance as women. The only true winner in the rise of male makeup, it would seem, is capitalism.</p> <h2>Rose McGowan labels Natalie Portman a \u2018fraud\u2019</h2> <p>McGowan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/12/rose-mcgowan-natalie-portman-oscars-dress-protest-female-directors\">was not impressed</a> by Portman wearing a cape to the Oscars embroidered with the name of female film-makers who had been passed over for best director nominations. In a Facebook post, McGowan accused Portman of failing to support female film-makers by hiring them through her production company and said she was the \u201clatest in a long line of actresses who are acting the part of a woman who cares about other women. Actresses who supposedly stand for women, but in reality do not do much at all.\u201d Owch.</p> <h2>Cupid is a capitalist</h2> <p>Valentine\u2019s Day spending this year rose 21% to an average of $196.31 among Americans who said they were celebrating the holiday, according to a survey by the <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/confident-consumers-and-broader-buying-lead-record-valentines-day\">National Retail Federation</a>. Maybe I\u2019m a grinch but that seems like an enormous amount to spend on a made-up holiday. Interestingly, the share of spending on significant others has gone down in the past decade (from 61% to 52%) while spending on co-workers (7%) and pets (6%) has doubled.</p> <h2>Barclays CEO, Jes Staley, regrets his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein</h2> <p>UK banking regulators are investigating whether Jes Staley truthfully disclosed his links to the convicted sex offender, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/ca5f1be3c8e67e2a4bb08cb216003073\">AP reports</a>. \u201cObviously I thought I knew [Epstein] well and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Staley said on Thursday. So weird how all these extremely powerful men had absolutely no idea about what Epstein was really like.</p> <h2>Female homicide victims in England and Wales at record highs</h2> <p>There were 241 female victims of homicide (murder, manslaughter or infanticide) in the year ending March 2019 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/13/female-homicide-victims-england-wales\">the highest number since 2006</a>. The number of women (80) killed by a current or former partner also rose by nearly a third. An executive at homeless charity Crisis noted that \u201cThese figures are a devastating reminder of why it\u2019s so important for women experiencing domestic violence to have somewhere safe to escape to, and how our continued failure to act is having fatal consequences.\u201d</p> <h2>Iraqi women protest gender segregation</h2> <p>Hundreds of Iraqi women <a href=\"https://apnews.com/d584ba1f43af00804d32db7c436f4622\">marched in the streets of Baghdad</a> on Thursday after an influential cleric called for anti-government protests to be gender-segregated. Iraqis have been protesting against government corruption since last October.</p> <h2>Is animal rights activism a white boys\u2019 club?</h2> <p>It\u2019s been estimated that <a href=\"https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/why-79-percent-u-s-vegans-are-women.htm\">79% of American vegans are women</a>. \u201cYet often, the female activists that play an integral role in the biggest achievements of the [animal rights] movement have gone unrecognized,\u201d <a href=\"https://qz.com/1800439/the-rise-of-vegan-food-tech-still-has-gender-issues/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=daily-brief\">writes Quartz</a>.</p> <h2>The 1975 will only play gender-balanced music festivals</h2> <p>Matt Healy, who fronts the pop band, explains: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/12/the-1975-commit-to-playing-only-gender-balanced-music-festivals-matt-healy\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/12/the-1975-commit-to-playing-only-gender-balanced-music-festivals-matt-healy\">This is how male artists can be true allies.\u201d</a></p> <h2>Sister Act: felon version</h2> <p>An Italian woman convicted of fraud <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/nun-on-the-run-italian-woman-evades-justice-by-living-in-convents\">evaded arrest for two years</a> by pretending to be a nun and hiding in convents across northern Italy.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Here come the beauty boys Masculinity is getting a makeover. John Lewis, the British chain of department stores, recently announced that it is opening a permanent makeup counter for men. This follows a hugely successful trial in its flagship London store; demand for War Paint for Men, a range of male-focused cosmetics, was 50% higher than expected. \u201cWe are finally starting to see men\u2019s makeup become the norm and break the stigma that has been around for years,\u201d said Daniel Gray, the founder of War Paint. Male makeup hasn\u2019t been entirely destigmatized. There\u2019s a reason that the brand is called War Paint, after all. You\u2019re not buying girly cosmetics, fellas, this is camouflage! But Gray is right; attitudes are changing fast. The male personal care market has grown exponentially over the past decade, and is expected to hit $166bn by 2022, according to Allied Market Research. Big brands have starting to cash in on the trend; the likes of Tom Ford and Chanel have launched male beauty products in recent years. Social media has been a big factor driving this change in attitudes. High-profile male beauty influencers like Jeffree Star and James Charles, who became the first male face of Covergirl in 2016, have helped redefine the category, demonstrating that makeup isn\u2019t just for women. The global rise of K-pop, known for its pretty boys in full faces of makeup, has further propelled the cultural shift. The growth of male makeup is also linked to a broader shakeup of the gender binary. Younger generations are embracing gender-fluidity and there\u2019s been an increased demand for gender-neutral fashion. According to Mintel, more than two-thirds of Gen Z males have said they\u2019re interested in gender-free beauty products, rather than traditionally male packaging. So, when it comes to younger guys, War Paint may want to rethink its marketing strategy. Generally speaking, the rise of male makeup is a positive thing. It\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re moving away from rigid gender role towards a more fluid future. However, there\u2019s also a dark side to the trend. As male beauty standards evolve, men are under increasing pressure to conform to these standards, and are becoming more image-conscious than ever. Male body image issues are on the rise and studies suggest men are now just as likely to be insecure about their appearance as women. The only true winner in the rise of male makeup, it would seem, is capitalism. Rose McGowan labels Natalie Portman a \u2018fraud\u2019 McGowan was not impressed by Portman wearing a cape to the Oscars embroidered with the name of female film-makers who had been passed over for best director nominations. In a Facebook post, McGowan accused Portman of failing to support female film-makers by hiring them through her production company and said she was the \u201clatest in a long line of actresses who are acting the part of a woman who cares about other women. Actresses who supposedly stand for women, but in reality do not do much at all.\u201d Owch. Cupid is a capitalist Valentine\u2019s Day spending this year rose 21% to an average of $196.31 among Americans who said they were celebrating the holiday, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation. Maybe I\u2019m a grinch but that seems like an enormous amount to spend on a made-up holiday. Interestingly, the share of spending on significant others has gone down in the past decade (from 61% to 52%) while spending on co-workers (7%) and pets (6%) has doubled. Barclays CEO, Jes Staley, regrets his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein UK banking regulators are investigating whether Jes Staley truthfully disclosed his links to the convicted sex offender, AP reports. \u201cObviously I thought I knew [Epstein] well and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Staley said on Thursday. So weird how all these extremely powerful men had absolutely no idea about what Epstein was really like. Female homicide victims in England and Wales at record highs There were 241 female victims of homicide (murder, manslaughter or infanticide) in the year ending March 2019 \u2013 the highest number since 2006. The number of women (80) killed by a current or former partner also rose by nearly a third. An executive at homeless charity Crisis noted that \u201cThese figures are a devastating reminder of why it\u2019s so important for women experiencing domestic violence to have somewhere safe to escape to, and how our continued failure to act is having fatal consequences.\u201d Iraqi women protest gender segregation Hundreds of Iraqi women marched in the streets of Baghdad on Thursday after an influential cleric called for anti-government protests to be gender-segregated. Iraqis have been protesting against government corruption since last October. Is animal rights activism a white boys\u2019 club? It\u2019s been estimated that 79% of American vegans are women. \u201cYet often, the female activists that play an integral role in the biggest achievements of the [animal rights] movement have gone unrecognized,\u201d writes Quartz. The 1975 will only play gender-balanced music festivals Matt Healy, who fronts the pop band, explains: \u201cThis is how male artists can be true allies.\u201d Sister Act: felon version An Italian woman convicted of fraud evaded arrest for two years by pretending to be a nun and hiding in convents across northern Italy. Police were nun the wiser until a suspicious sister in Lombardy blew the outlaw\u2019s cover.",

He also said he doubted Russia had ended its direct and indirect interference in democratic elections, saying the best response was to defend Europe\u2019s networks and adding: \u201cI do not believe in miracles, but in policies.\u201d Macron confirmed he was willing to lift French objections \u2013 he denied it was a veto \u2013 to opening EU membership talks with North Macedonia, so long as the EU agreed to the accession process becoming less teleological, long-winded and bureaucratic. The bloc\u2019s current review of its accession procedures should do away with the idea that progress to accession was not reversible, he said. Macron was speaking after two leading German politicians affirmed Germany needed to do more to respond to Macron\u2019s offer of dialogue. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: \u201cGermany is ready to get more involved, including militarily.\u201d He called for the \u201cconstruction of a European security and defence union as a strong, European pillar of Nato\u201d. Europe needed to respond, he said, due to the sudden emergence of a geo-strategic gap to which the continent had closed it eyes. He explained: \u201cThe real gamechanger is that the era of omnipresent American global policemen is over. Everyone can see that. It is not due to US lack of military power, but to the commitment of those responsible in the White House.\u201d Decisions on the Middle East were being taken by countries that did not share European values, he said. In Iraq, Libya, Ukraine and the Sahel, Europe \u201cshould not cede these crises to those who bring weapons and mercenaries, not peace\u201d, he added. The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Friday warned that Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy had shaken up the international order and fuelled insecurity in an unstable world. \u201cWe are witnessing today an increasingly destructive momentum in global politics,\u201d Steinmeier said, adding: \u201cEvery year we are getting further and further away from our goal of creating a more peaceful world through international cooperation. \u201cUnder its current administration, the USA rejects the very concept of an international community. Every country, it believes, should look after itself and put its own interests before all others.\u201d Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial but serves as a moral compass for Germany, said Europe needed to take more control of its own security, including through higher military spending. \u201cOnly a Europe that is able and willing to credibly protect itself, will keep the US in Nato,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February to replace the word \u2018theological\u2019 (relating to the study of the nature of God and of religion and religious beliefs) with \u2018teleological\u2019 (relating to the doctrine that there is evidence of purpose or design in the universe).",

      "bodyText": "The first thing I can remember is riding my tricycle around the balcony of our very small apartment in Brussels. Looking back, it seems so dangerous. My dad taught me that struggle can inspire achievement. He fought the regime of Mobutu [in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo] and was forced into a labour camp, but he escaped to Belgium and later became the first black mayor in the country\u2019s history. My mother grew up in rural Belgium and one day she brought home my father \u2013 the kid from Africa. That was a big contrast for a local family then. But it shows we can all progress and keep progressing. As the child of a migrant, you quickly learn about inequality. My parents told me: \u201cYou will have to work twice as hard as kids from other backgrounds.\u201d I thought: \u201cOK, if I work twice as hard, I will be twice as good.\u201d My neighbourhood had a lot of gangs, but I would remind kids in the same situation that the world is a lot bigger than the place you know and want to dominate, and it is full of opportunities.

      "body": "<p>Liu Mengdi, 25, has been keeping a diary of the past few weeks as the coronavirus has ravaged her home town of Wuhan.</p> <p>\u201cToday is the sixth day of the Wuhan lockdown [the city has been under quarantine for the last three weeks]. I thought my family, prevented from going out, would at least be safe,\u201d she wrote on 29 January from Italy, where she is in her last year of university. \u201cIt never occurred to me they would not be able to escape this.\u201d</p> <p>Liu\u2019s 54-year-old father, Liu Daoyu, who developed a sore throat and cough five days earlier, had just tested positive for the virus. Her 90-year-old grandfather, Lei Ruting, was showing even more serious symptoms: a fever that wouldn\u2019t relent and breathing difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone in the family is extremely worried,\u201d she wrote. Still, she ended her entry on a positive note: \u201cWe believe everything will be okay. Thank you to the frontline people fighting this. Thank you to those who have helped us.\u201d</p> <p>Three days later, that optimism had disappeared. \u201cOn 2 February 2020 at 3:08pm Beijing time, my grandfather passed away from \u2018unknown pneumonia\u2019. He just turned 90 last month. He was always healthy,\u201d Liu, distraught, wrote. \u201cFar more than grief, I feel lost and angry.\u201d</p> <p>The coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19, has claimed at least 1,380 lives in China, with more than 1,300 in Hubei province. Wuhan, the provincial capital, was where the virus emerged in December, and has suffered the worst, with 1,016 deaths.</p> <p>Liu\u2019s family is one of hundreds who have not only lost a loved one to the virus, but struggled to get them treatment. A few days before her grandfather died, he had a fever all through the night and fell out of bed. When her relatives called for an ambulance, they were told there was no use in sending him to the hospital.</p> <p>\u201cIf he really is suffering from the virus there is nothing that can be done. Going to the hospital where no one will take care of him may be even more difficult,\u201d Liu said, recounting the advice her family had been given. Following instructions, the family contacted the local neighbourhood committee \u2013 which is charged with arranging tests, quarantines and transport to the hospitals \u2013 but were given no help. Eventually, Liu posted her family\u2019s story on Weibo, pleading for help, and also contacted local media, which reported her account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fb6d877948eacf0f12eb36bada89031ee147102\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fb6d877948eacf0f12eb36bada89031ee147102/19_119_1421_853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lei Ruting celebrating his 90th birthday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lei Ruting celebrating his 90th birthday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Liu Mengdi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, health workers came to their home, took a blood sample from her grandfather and advised him to find somewhere to do the full diagnostic test, kits for which are in short supply across the city. But her family was advised to stop putting out online calls for help and to post only \u201cpositive\u201d messages.</p> <p>A journalist and friend of the family helped find a hospital that had testing kits available. Seeing photos and videos of him at the hospital, Liu felt relieved. But the next day, Lei died before the diagnosis could come back. His body was sent for immediate cremation after a short ceremony where staff set off firecrackers. The family was not allowed to go or collect the ashes.</p> <p>\u201cGrandpa really is strong. We knew he must have been in a lot of pain, but he still insisted and pretended he was fine,\u201d Liu said. \u201cBefore his results could come back, he couldn\u2019t hold on any more and closed his eyes for the last time.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Liu\u2019s family is fighting to save her father \u2013 an increasingly common scenario as sick patients are turned away from overcrowded hospitals and sent home to self-quarantine, where they often end up infecting other family members.</p> <p>The family is not sure how the two may have caught the virus. But just before the city was put under quarantine, both Liu\u2019s father and grandfather had visited friends and neighbours who were later found to be infected. More than 50,000 people in the province have been infected.</p> <p>Her father has been in the hospital since 29 January \u2013 they managed to find a bed through family friends. To get a diagnosis, he had to walk to the hospital and back, covering almost 18 miles on foot while in the grip of a fever. Liu spoke to him as he walked back until his phone\u2019s battery gave out.</p> <p>The doctors said her dad was the most cheerful person in the ward. He told the family he would be better in three weeks at the most. Her father is extremely active, doesn\u2019t drink or smoke and plays badminton three times a week. He always walks 10,000 steps a day.</p> <p>\u201cHe is 54 years old, but everyone says he looks like he is in his 40s,\u201d Liu said. When he was first admitted, she asked the hospital staff if they could give her father, who still had a good appetite, two lunch boxes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He liked to say that he fought with Mao Zedong. I wish my dear grandfather a safe journey</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But his condition has worsened dramatically. On 10 February, his birthday, Liu made a video with friends from around the world wishing her father well and an early recovery. But that day, the hospital asked her mother to sign a form confirming his critical state.</p> <p>Later, Liu\u2019s mother told her that his lungs had stopped working. Her father is now in an intensive-care unit connected to a machine that pumps and oxygenates his blood.</p> <p>Like many residents watching in desperation as their loved ones grow sicker, the family\u2019s views have started to shift. Liu is especially angry about being told not to post online. \u201cI can\u2019t even ask for help?\u201d she wrote in one of her diary entries.</p> <p>Earlier this month, her WeChat account was blocked \u2013 she suspects because she was posting about the virus. Her father\u2019s phone seems to have been taken away and she can no longer call him.</p> <p>\u201cThe epidemic has changed how some in my family view the news we get at home. In the past, my family always 100% believed the domestic reports. Even when I told them about overseas reports, they would never believe me,\u201d said Liu, who has lived in Italy for six years. \u201cAfter the outbreak, they said would believe me in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The outbreak, which has shown no signs of abating despite drastic quarantine measures implemented across the country, has inspired what is for the ruling Communist party a dangerous level of public anger. Residents are angry at local authorities for their slow response to the virus, allowing it to spread for weeks. People like Liu are angry at the government for leaving the people of Wuhan to struggle. Party leaders have promised to win the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against the virus, and last week fired several senior officials in Hubei province.</p> <p>\u201cFor the regime, this has been a Chernobyl moment. Immediately around the event, everything continued as before,\u201d said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese politics at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cHowever, in their hearts, many people lost the belief that the party is uniquely capable of governing China. If that is the case, the effectiveness of government decrees will decline over time as lower-level officials and the people resist passively. Only time will tell.\u201d</p> <p>Liu hopes that her father will recover soon, and that she can take him on a trip to Europe to relax.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/channel-4-worker-taken-to-hospital-for-coronavirus-test\">Channel 4 worker taken to hospital for coronavirus test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her family is still coping with the loss of her grandfather. Her mother, now alone at home, has taken to staying with her sister. She cries often. Liu herself has trouble focusing on her education in Italy, where she studies architecture, and her internship. She wants to go home to see her family, but her mother says it isn\u2019t safe.</p> <p>She remembers her grandfather fondly. He loved singing, and he was proud of his contributions to his country as a loyal party member and volunteer during the Cultural Revolution. \u201cHe liked to say that he fought with Mao Zedong,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He spoiled his grandchildren, including Liu, bringing her KFC when he picked her up from school and giving her change to buy snacks. The family, of about 20 members, is close. In one of her last conversations with her grandfather, he laughed over the phone and told her to take good care of herself.</p> <p>\u201cI will never forget why my grandfather died. I will never forget his smile. I wish my dear grandfather a safe journey,\u201d she wrote on the day he passed away.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu</em></p>",

Her 90-year-old grandfather, Lei Ruting, was showing even more serious symptoms: a fever that wouldn\u2019t relent and breathing difficulties. \u201cEveryone in the family is extremely worried,\u201d she wrote. Still, she ended her entry on a positive note: \u201cWe believe everything will be okay. Thank you to the frontline people fighting this. Thank you to those who have helped us.\u201d Three days later, that optimism had disappeared. \u201cOn 2 February 2020 at 3:08pm Beijing time, my grandfather passed away from \u2018unknown pneumonia\u2019. He just turned 90 last month. He was always healthy,\u201d Liu, distraught, wrote. \u201cFar more than grief, I feel lost and angry.\u201d The coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19, has claimed at least 1,380 lives in China, with more than 1,300 in Hubei province. Wuhan, the provincial capital, was where the virus emerged in December, and has suffered the worst, with 1,016 deaths. Liu\u2019s family is one of hundreds who have not only lost a loved one to the virus, but struggled to get them treatment. A few days before her grandfather died, he had a fever all through the night and fell out of bed. When her relatives called for an ambulance, they were told there was no use in sending him to the hospital. \u201cIf he really is suffering from the virus there is nothing that can be done. Going to the hospital where no one will take care of him may be even more difficult,\u201d Liu said, recounting the advice her family had been given. Following instructions, the family contacted the local neighbourhood committee \u2013 which is charged with arranging tests, quarantines and transport to the hospitals \u2013 but were given no help. Eventually, Liu posted her family\u2019s story on Weibo, pleading for help, and also contacted local media, which reported her account. Eventually, health workers came to their home, took a blood sample from her grandfather and advised him to find somewhere to do the full diagnostic test, kits for which are in short supply across the city. But her family was advised to stop putting out online calls for help and to post only \u201cpositive\u201d messages. A journalist and friend of the family helped find a hospital that had testing kits available. Seeing photos and videos of him at the hospital, Liu felt relieved. But the next day, Lei died before the diagnosis could come back. His body was sent for immediate cremation after a short ceremony where staff set off firecrackers. The family was not allowed to go or collect the ashes. \u201cGrandpa really is strong. We knew he must have been in a lot of pain, but he still insisted and pretended he was fine,\u201d Liu said. \u201cBefore his results could come back, he couldn\u2019t hold on any more and closed his eyes for the last time.\u201d Now, Liu\u2019s family is fighting to save her father \u2013 an increasingly common scenario as sick patients are turned away from overcrowded hospitals and sent home to self-quarantine, where they often end up infecting other family members. The family is not sure how the two may have caught the virus. But just before the city was put under quarantine, both Liu\u2019s father and grandfather had visited friends and neighbours who were later found to be infected. More than 50,000 people in the province have been infected. Her father has been in the hospital since 29 January \u2013 they managed to find a bed through family friends. To get a diagnosis, he had to walk to the hospital and back, covering almost 18 miles on foot while in the grip of a fever. Liu spoke to him as he walked back until his phone\u2019s battery gave out. The doctors said her dad was the most cheerful person in the ward. He told the family he would be better in three weeks at the most. Her father is extremely active, doesn\u2019t drink or smoke and plays badminton three times a week. He always walks 10,000 steps a day. \u201cHe is 54 years old, but everyone says he looks like he is in his 40s,\u201d Liu said. When he was first admitted, she asked the hospital staff if they could give her father, who still had a good appetite, two lunch boxes. But his condition has worsened dramatically. On 10 February, his birthday, Liu made a video with friends from around the world wishing her father well and an early recovery. But that day, the hospital asked her mother to sign a form confirming his critical state. Later, Liu\u2019s mother told her that his lungs had stopped working. Her father is now in an intensive-care unit connected to a machine that pumps and oxygenates his blood. Like many residents watching in desperation as their loved ones grow sicker, the family\u2019s views have started to shift. Liu is especially angry about being told not to post online. \u201cI can\u2019t even ask for help?\u201d she wrote in one of her diary entries. Earlier this month, her WeChat account was blocked \u2013 she suspects because she was posting about the virus. Her father\u2019s phone seems to have been taken away and she can no longer call him. \u201cThe epidemic has changed how some in my family view the news we get at home. In the past, my family always 100% believed the domestic reports. Even when I told them about overseas reports, they would never believe me,\u201d said Liu, who has lived in Italy for six years. \u201cAfter the outbreak, they said would believe me in the future.\u201d The outbreak, which has shown no signs of abating despite drastic quarantine measures implemented across the country, has inspired what is for the ruling Communist party a dangerous level of public anger. Residents are angry at local authorities for their slow response to the virus, allowing it to spread for weeks. People like Liu are angry at the government for leaving the people of Wuhan to struggle. Party leaders have promised to win the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against the virus, and last week fired several senior officials in Hubei province. \u201cFor the regime, this has been a Chernobyl moment. Immediately around the event, everything continued as before,\u201d said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese politics at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cHowever, in their hearts, many people lost the belief that the party is uniquely capable of governing China. If that is the case, the effectiveness of government decrees will decline over time as lower-level officials and the people resist passively. Only time will tell.\u201d Liu hopes that her father will recover soon, and that she can take him on a trip to Europe to relax. But her family is still coping with the loss of her grandfather. Her mother, now alone at home, has taken to staying with her sister. She cries often. Liu herself has trouble focusing on her education in Italy, where she studies architecture, and her internship. She wants to go home to see her family, but her mother says it isn\u2019t safe. She remembers her grandfather fondly. He loved singing, and he was proud of his contributions to his country as a loyal party member and volunteer during the Cultural Revolution. \u201cHe liked to say that he fought with Mao Zedong,\u201d she said. He spoiled his grandchildren, including Liu, bringing her KFC when he picked her up from school and giving her change to buy snacks. The family, of about 20 members, is close. In one of her last conversations with her grandfather, he laughed over the phone and told her to take good care of herself. \u201cI will never forget why my grandfather died. I will never forget his smile. I wish my dear grandfather a safe journey,\u201d she wrote on the day he passed away. Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu",

      "body": "<p><br>Question: which bit of the Guardian has published regularly for the best part of 90 years, but has only ever had two editors?</p> <p>The answer? Nine letters, something, R, something, S, something, something, something, something, D.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s the crossword. First published by the Manchester Guardian in 1929 (prize: two guineas), the cryptic puzzle has been a staple of the newspaper ever since. Ours may be one of the most popular cryptic crosswords in the world, as they are readily available online and not hidden behind a paywall.</p> <p>And now they are poised for a new era, as we roll them and the entire stable of puzzles into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2020/feb/11/the-guardian-launches-puzzles-a-new-app-for-crosswords-and-puzzles\">a digital app</a> that will help fund Guardian journalism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/feb/11/welcome-to-the-new-guardian-puzzles-app\">Welcome to the new Guardian Puzzles app</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have a very big, loyal crossword audience and we wanted to give them another way to support our journalism,\u201d said Savannia Flynn-Naidoo, head of operations for corporate development at Guardian Media Group.</p> <p>She said that a total of 15,000 puzzles from a 20-year archive would be available on the app, including five different levels of sudokus and other brain teasers. New crosswords will be added once published.</p> <p>Solvers will be able to join forces remotely to crack a puzzle with the app\u2019s \u201cplay together\u201d feature. They can also play against the clock, brag about their mental agility by sharing how quickly they solved a grid, and even cheat by revealing the answers (though not on prize puzzles). And all this for \u00a33.49 a month (or \u00a332.99 a year).</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s come together in less than six months,\u201d said David Blishen, the product manager for the app. An external partner, Amuse Labs, helped develop the product, coming up with a prototype within two days. The app has been tested with some of the Guardian\u2019s best-loved setters, who have assisted the development process.</p> <p>Crosswords may look like ancient things to be fussed at with bitten pencils in hospital waiting areas. But at their best, they are an art form with a whole subculture of their own, an hour of delicious diversion riddled with deliberate attempts to confuse and deflect, like a good whodunnit or a difficult child.</p> <p>In other papers, crosswords tend to refuse to move with the times (in one, setters are banned from using the names of real people in answers unless they are dead). But the Guardian prefers a more modern approach. Ours are a paean to an ever-evolving language. Individual setters have their own style that takes a while to figure out, but which then becomes the basis of a silent conversation that you have, back and forth, over months.</p> <p>They are supposedly good for preserving an agile brain into one\u2019s advancing years. And for someone who works with words, I always feel that a completed crossword grid is like limbering up for a day at the coalface. (I once set crosswords and wrote headlines for a living at the same time, and felt there was a delicious overlap between the two disciplines.)</p> <p>At first glance, a cryptic crossword may be a disconcerting experience.

      "bodyText": "Question: which bit of the Guardian has published regularly for the best part of 90 years, but has only ever had two editors? The answer? Nine letters, something, R, something, S, something, something, something, something, D. Yes, it\u2019s the crossword. First published by the Manchester Guardian in 1929 (prize: two guineas), the cryptic puzzle has been a staple of the newspaper ever since. Ours may be one of the most popular cryptic crosswords in the world, as they are readily available online and not hidden behind a paywall. And now they are poised for a new era, as we roll them and the entire stable of puzzles into a digital app that will help fund Guardian journalism. \u201cWe have a very big, loyal crossword audience and we wanted to give them another way to support our journalism,\u201d said Savannia Flynn-Naidoo, head of operations for corporate development at Guardian Media Group. She said that a total of 15,000 puzzles from a 20-year archive would be available on the app, including five different levels of sudokus and other brain teasers. New crosswords will be added once published. Solvers will be able to join forces remotely to crack a puzzle with the app\u2019s \u201cplay together\u201d feature. They can also play against the clock, brag about their mental agility by sharing how quickly they solved a grid, and even cheat by revealing the answers (though not on prize puzzles). And all this for \u00a33.49 a month (or \u00a332.99 a year). \u201cIt\u2019s come together in less than six months,\u201d said David Blishen, the product manager for the app. An external partner, Amuse Labs, helped develop the product, coming up with a prototype within two days. The app has been tested with some of the Guardian\u2019s best-loved setters, who have assisted the development process. Crosswords may look like ancient things to be fussed at with bitten pencils in hospital waiting areas. But at their best, they are an art form with a whole subculture of their own, an hour of delicious diversion riddled with deliberate attempts to confuse and deflect, like a good whodunnit or a difficult child. In other papers, crosswords tend to refuse to move with the times (in one, setters are banned from using the names of real people in answers unless they are dead). But the Guardian prefers a more modern approach. Ours are a paean to an ever-evolving language. Individual setters have their own style that takes a while to figure out, but which then becomes the basis of a silent conversation that you have, back and forth, over months. They are supposedly good for preserving an agile brain into one\u2019s advancing years. And for someone who works with words, I always feel that a completed crossword grid is like limbering up for a day at the coalface. (I once set crosswords and wrote headlines for a living at the same time, and felt there was a delicious overlap between the two disciplines.) At first glance, a cryptic crossword may be a disconcerting experience. You will recognise the words as being English, but strung together they generally make little sense. This is a whole new lexicon to be learned, where the word \u201cfirst\u201d might mean \u201ctake the first letter of the next word\u201d, or the word \u201cupset\u201d might mean \u201cjumble the letters of the adjacent words around\u201d. Fortunately there are blogs that can help you on your way. \u201cWhat I would recommend is doing it in a group and talking to people about it \u2013 that is how you learn it and come to enjoy it,\u201d says Hugh Stephenson, one of the aforementioned two crossword editors. (The other was John Perkin, who held the post from 1959-1996.) At their most artful, cryptic crosswords are an entire story in themselves.

She works for an online magazine, Foof \u2013 \u201cas awful as it sounds\u201d \u2013 and has a famous photographer boyfriend. She is obsessed with Suzy Brambles, an Instagram influencer whose \u201ckickboxing lessons and almond eyes\u201d induce compulsive envy.

And while some characters (Carmen, Jenny\u2019s friend Nicolette) assume a vivid shape, others (Art, terrifying boss Mia) remain somewhat insubstantial, more pastiches than people. In all her focus on the frantic pace and paranoid intensity of relationships in a social-media age, Unsworth occasionally neglects the groundwork of characterisation. Thematically, however, <em>Adults</em> and <em>Animals</em> resonate: both ruminate on the tension between reckless abandon and adult responsibility, and on friendships as a form of romance. How do friendships survive grief and disappointment? How do we nurture and protect them, just as we might do a romance? These are the questions that pulse, urgently, through Unsworth\u2019s writing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a624dd50b5f8edb3ac448caa311f1a5e055f9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a624dd50b5f8edb3ac448caa311f1a5e055f9c/0_215_2740_1644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holliday Grainger (left) and Alia Shawkatin Sophie Hyde\u2019s film of Animals (2019).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holliday Grainger (left) and Alia Shawkat in Sophie Hyde\u2019s film of <em>Animals </em>(2019).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Allstar/Bonsai Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Jenny is musing on her mother, Unsworth\u2019s prose is cut through with a darker lyricism. Carmen \u201cwas my end-of-level boss, the obstacle between me and some higher plane, some outside; and I would defeat her eventually, and she knew it\u201d.</p> <p>The writing can be gorgeously shiver-inducing. Jenny describes riding in the car with her mother as a child \u201cto and from the satellite towns where she performed: Sale, Altrincham, Eccles, Weaste ... Me, riding shotgun, solemn as a priestess.\u201d And the connections between childhood, home, and mother-daughter relationships are beautifully evoked. \u201cI missed the North: its winds and mosses; its cool, thirsty cities \u2026 I was an astronaut out on the arm of the mothership, umbilicus stretching, stretching, stretching.\u201d When she\u2019s working in this register, Unsworth\u2019s phrases gain a richness and fullness that enhances the novel.</p> <p>The last third, in which Jenny recounts her miscarriage, is almost unbearably moving, in part through its directness. Alone in the hospital, Jenny describes the \u201csingle small bed with grey sheets and a plastic bucket in the corner ... They took the blood out of my arm, which was funny because so much of it was falling out of me anyway.\u201d Here, the internet \u2013 the target of so much clear-sighted satire elsewhere in the novel \u2013 glows as a beacon of companionship for women. After the miscarriage, Jenny stalks message boards. Their confessions and advice \u201cmade me love the internet, briefly. It made me love women, everywhere, protectively. Maternally.\u201d</p> <p><em>Adults</em> has much packed into it: romance, grief and betrayal, with several twists and turns and shifting loyalties. The path between the jaunty humour and gut-wrenching sadness that Unsworth steered so precisely in <em>Animals</em> feels more unsteadily managed here; the form seems unresolved. But her writing surprises, delights and moves. I will remember, for a long time, this novel\u2019s lacerating wit and its melancholy sorrow.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Katherine Angel\u2019s Daddy Issues is published by Peninsula.

How do friendships survive grief and disappointment? How do we nurture and protect them, just as we might do a romance? These are the questions that pulse, urgently, through Unsworth\u2019s writing. When Jenny is musing on her mother, Unsworth\u2019s prose is cut through with a darker lyricism. Carmen \u201cwas my end-of-level boss, the obstacle between me and some higher plane, some outside; and I would defeat her eventually, and she knew it\u201d. The writing can be gorgeously shiver-inducing. Jenny describes riding in the car with her mother as a child \u201cto and from the satellite towns where she performed: Sale, Altrincham, Eccles, Weaste ... Me, riding shotgun, solemn as a priestess.\u201d And the connections between childhood, home, and mother-daughter relationships are beautifully evoked. \u201cI missed the North: its winds and mosses; its cool, thirsty cities \u2026 I was an astronaut out on the arm of the mothership, umbilicus stretching, stretching, stretching.\u201d When she\u2019s working in this register, Unsworth\u2019s phrases gain a richness and fullness that enhances the novel. The last third, in which Jenny recounts her miscarriage, is almost unbearably moving, in part through its directness. Alone in the hospital, Jenny describes the \u201csingle small bed with grey sheets and a plastic bucket in the corner ... They took the blood out of my arm, which was funny because so much of it was falling out of me anyway.\u201d Here, the internet \u2013 the target of so much clear-sighted satire elsewhere in the novel \u2013 glows as a beacon of companionship for women. After the miscarriage, Jenny stalks message boards. Their confessions and advice \u201cmade me love the internet, briefly. It made me love women, everywhere, protectively. Maternally.\u201d Adults has much packed into it: romance, grief and betrayal, with several twists and turns and shifting loyalties. The path between the jaunty humour and gut-wrenching sadness that Unsworth steered so precisely in Animals feels more unsteadily managed here; the form seems unresolved. But her writing surprises, delights and moves. I will remember, for a long time, this novel\u2019s lacerating wit and its melancholy sorrow. \u2022 Katherine Angel\u2019s Daddy Issues is published by Peninsula.

Esper also warned future intelligence cooperation would be at risk, as the US would no longer be certain its communications networks were secure. His remarks at the Munich security conference on Saturday, bolstered by similar warnings from the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, remove any doubt that the US sees finding an alternative to Huawei as central to its own security. Australia\u2019s intelligence and security committee has pulled out of a visit to Britain next month over the fallout from Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial decision to allow Huawei to help build the UK\u2019s 5G network, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Australia, like the US, has banned Huawei from its communication networks over security concerns. Esper said he had not looked at the UK\u2019s specific plans to incorporate Huawei into part of its 5G network in detail, and admitted the US was vulnerable to the charge that it had not produced an alternative to Huawei for Europe. He said he was willing to work with European partners to see if firms such as Ericsson could develop an alternative, and that Washington is currently working to support the development of other options. \u201cWe are encouraging allied and US tech companies to develop alternative 5G solutions and we are working alongside them to test these technologies at our military bases as we speak,\u201d he said. \u201cDeveloping our own secure 5G networks will outweigh any perceived gains from partnering with heavily subsidised Chinese providers that answer to party leadership.\u201d Esper admitted the response to US demands to stay clear of Huawei had been mixed, and said too many countries were focused on short-term economic gain rather than the long-term threat to security.

It could also jeopardise our intelligence and communication-sharing capabilities, and by extension it could jeopardise our alliances. \u201cThe Chinese Communist party is heading even faster and further in the wrong direction with more internal repression, more predatory behaviour, more heavy-handedness and a more aggressive military posture. It is essential that the international community wake up to the challenge.\u201d Pompeo said the Chinese Communist party \u201crepresented an enormous risk to the idea of the west\u201d. He added: \u201cEuropeans care deeply about privacy. We cannot allow information to travel across networks if we do not have confidence that it will not be hijacked by the Chinese Communist party. It is just unacceptable and we all know that.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s speech, in which he warned that Chinese officials were trying to infiltrate US networks, came a day after the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, suggested the US rejected \u201ceven the idea of an international community\u201d and was acting \u201cat the expense of neighbours and partners\u201d. Pompeo hit back, paraphrasing a famous Mark Twain quote: \u201cThose statements don\u2019t reflect reality. I\u2019m happy to report that the death of the transatlantic alliance is grossly overexaggerated.\u201d He pointed out that nearly 40 American congressmen and women were attending the conference in a show of transatlantic unity. Pompeo said Washington played a key role in keeping Europe safe by reinforcing Nato\u2019s eastern flank on the border with Russia, and had led a multinational effort to defeat Islamic State. \u201cIs this an America that \u2018rejects the international community\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe free west has a brighter future than illiberal alternatives.\u201d He also warned of the threats posed by Russia\u2019s territorial ambitions, China\u2019s military buildup in the South China Sea and Iran\u2019s \u201ccampaigns of terror\u201d through proxy conflicts in the Middle East. Reflecting US concern over plans to increase European reliance on Russian natural gas through the Nord Stream 2 project, which will pipe Russian gas into Europe, bypassing Ukraine, Pompeo also announced the US would finance energy projects in eastern EU countries. \u201cThe United States \u2013 through our International Development Finance Corporation, and with the support of the US Congress \u2013 intends to provide up to $1bn in financing to the central and eastern European countries of the Three Seas Initiative.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "So, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave Sportwatch. A very packed dancecard across the codes, with plenty of action across Australasia. A big result in the Super Rugby with the Highlanders halting a ten-game winning streak for the Brumbies, as the Australian conference leaders succumbed to their first loss of the season in the dying seconds. Key wins in the AFLW for the Kangaroos, Suns and Dockers, by reasonably comfortable margins - especially in the inaugural Western derby in front of a bumper 35,000+ crowd in Perth. A key win in the A-League for Wellington as they look to cement their place in the top six, while Wanderers did their finals chances no benefit in a lacklustre home draw with Newcastle. Sydney FC sent a warning shot to the W-League that they\u2019re not done despite losing key players to overseas leagues and the Brumbies won well in the Super W. And that\u2019s a wrap! Wow! A great upset in the NRL Nines women\u2019s final as the Dragons down the much-fancied Broncos 28-4 to land their inaugural Nines title. A try just before half-time from Kezie Apps might have been a morale-booster for St George - but they\u2019ve got it done in both halves, against a hugely experienced outfit from Queensland. What a result for the women\u2019s game - great to have challengers. It\u2019s a result that does neither team any favours, and a chorus of boos rings around Parramatta Stadium. They\u2019ve not won at home since October, the Wanderers. A new coach - but the same old result. The Jets were good value for their point in the end - some might say they even deserved all three. A decent first showing under Carl Robinson and his staff - that point takes Newcastle off the bottom of the table. They did hit the post at 1-0 the Wanderers, before really going into their shells. The margins on which football games turn. Another frustrating evening for Western Sydney faithful - a finals push, on this form, looks beyond them. A-League - 88 min: It\u2019s still Newcastle making the late running as Petratos looks to pick out his teammate, Hoffman. A last sub from JP de Marigny who brings on youngster Mo Adam as playmaker Nikolai Mueller succumbs to cramp. Petratos with another shot-on-sight, but it flashes over - a tough one from that distance. A-League - 82 min: They\u2019re starting to really press, the Jets. Petratos lines up shots from distance in quick succession, but on both occasions they\u2019re blocked by some desperate defence. They\u2019re looking a bit ropey, the Wanderers. What\u2019s happened here? Was it one of those cases of scoring a little too early and then looking to sit and hold a lead? They need to lift - they\u2019re home fans won\u2019t tolerate a loss against the bottom-placed side. A-League - Goal! Western Sydney 1-1 Newcastle (Millar) 74 min: Hello! We\u2019re back level, and on balance of play - you\u2019d have to say a fair reward for the visitors? New coach Carl Robinson has emphasised the need for heart and he\u2019s been one of their best, the right back, Millar. Some question marks on the \u2018keeping - it was a shot that beat Lopar at his near post. Could the Swiss have done more to prevent that? Eep - some ugly news out of the NRL Nines, where there\u2019s a bad injury for Dragons hard-man Korbin Sims. His side still get up over the Titans, 8-6 though, and have booked their spot in the final against the Cowboys who win the all-Queensland semi-final 19-10. A-League - 62 min: So, we\u2019ve hit the hour mark in Western Sydney where there\u2019s still a bit of bite in this one. Steven Ugarkovic comes together with Keanu Baccus to the chagrin of the homefans. They\u2019ve registered seven shots on target the visitors - to the seven of their hosts - so we\u2019ve not been starved of action. As we\u2019ve seen across recent months though, for the Jets it\u2019s one thing to get shots away, it\u2019s another to turn them into goals. Oh my, this is a nervy finish here. They\u2019re besieging the line, the Highlanders, and after a series of penalties the Brumbies have been reduced a man! Yellow card for repeated fouls, that last an early contact in the line out. They look to use their man advantage - and have they got over the line here?! Yes they have! It\u2019s a try in front, and it\u2019s converted to boot! Heartbreak at the death - they\u2019ve done the Brumbies for a fifth consecutive time! It finishes 9.6 (60) to 2.3 (15) in favour of the original WA team, the Dockers. They go 2/2, having led from start to finish against the Eagles. They\u2019re the benchmark for the new club who showed plenty of promise despite the scoreline mismatch. They\u2019ll learn from this, and hopefully come back stronger for the footballing education handed down by their rivals. My, oh my - just saw the crowd figure for this one. Incredible - great work to all involved. Super Rugby - Try! Brumbies 19-16 Highlanders (Fainga\u2019a) - 68\u2019 Unbelievable - it\u2019s another hattrick of tries for the hooker Folau Fainga\u2019a! Check the record books on that, this kid\u2019s prolific. And they\u2019re back in front the Brumbies: can they stay so from here? It\u2019s beginning to really team down with rain in the ACT and now Josh Ioane has a chance to level things from the boot.. but he hooks it left! It\u2019ll be a tight finish from here, you\u2019d warrant. A-League - half-time: Western Sydney 1-0 Newcastle 45 min: There\u2019s the major break, and for the home side it comes at a good time with the Jets building in confidence later in that half. Burns\u2019 foul on Bruce Kamau and the subsequent penalty the difference thus far. He was a peripheral figure under Markus Babbel, but he\u2019s made an impact in recent weeks, Kamau, playing in this new unfamiliar role at right wing-back. AFLW - 3/4 time: West Coast 1.2 (8) trail Fremantle 7.6 (48) They have to hang tough here, the new side, or we could be on for a big score. They were competitive for large swathes of the early play but it\u2019s the Dockers that continue to bother the scorers. All about playing for self-respect now - let\u2019s see if the Eagles can lift and get on the board once again. A-League - 33 min: That\u2019s not a million miles away! Arroyo looks to flick on a Burns cross, and it angles just past Lopar\u2019s left-hand post. They\u2019ve come back into this a little the Jets, despite going behind to that early penalty. A key 10 minutes before half-time - can Newcastle drag their way back into this contest? So - let\u2019s wrap some results from the men\u2019s comp at the NRL Nines over in Perth: Knights 7-14 Eels, Dragons 17-14 Panthers, Titans 24-0 Sea Eagles, Cowboys 20-6 Rabbitohs. Which makes the semis: Eels v Dragons &amp; Titans v Cowboys. Cody Ramsey continuing his fine tournament with a hattrick of tries against the Panthers, while Titans v Cowboys could be a tasty all-Queensland clash. And in the women\u2019s draw it will be a Dragons v Brisbane final - despite the Red V narrowly going down to the Roosters in their last hitout, 14-13. Broncos strong favourites there, you\u2019d have to say after dominating the group pool. Super Rugby - half-time: Brumbies 12-13 Highlanders They\u2019re scratching their heads a little, the home side - having worked so hard twice to get ahead, they go into the sheds behind. That fortuitous charge-down try and a few penalties has the visitors with their noses in front. \u201cWe still back ourselves and our skills\u201d says skipper James Slipper. We\u2019ll see if he\u2019s right. A-League - Goal! Western Sydney 1-0 Newcastle (Duke, pen) 5 min: Well, it hasn\u2019t taken long for first blood! It\u2019s a foul from the young left back Bobby Burns who\u2019s beaten for pace inside the box and downs his man. The Wanderers\u2019 skipper Mitch Duke steps up and slots it calmly past Lewis Italiano. And that\u2019s the tea. AFLW - half-time: West Coast 1.1 (7) trails Fremantle 5.3 (33) More of the same from the Dockers in that second quarter, but great to see the West Coast on the board for their home fans. It\u2019s pretty even across the statistical indicators but Freo leading well in terms of inside 50 marks and really dominating in the tackle count. Gemma Houghton, Roxanne Roux and Jasmin Stewart with the goals; McKenzie Dowrick with the Eagles sole effort. Super Rugby - Try! Brumbies 10-3 Highlanders - 3o\u2019 And there over again men from the capital, and it\u2019s the driving maul again that gets it done. But oh my - can you believe this! From the kickoff there\u2019s a charge-down and Jona Nareki has one of the simplest finishes you\u2019ll see! Highlanders hit straight back: 12-10! Okay, we are ready for A-League action in Western Sydney. A first home-game in charge for JP de Marigny, a first game in charge for Carl Robinson with the Jets. Great contest this could be - all players will be 100% raring to earn their places - we\u2019ll keep a close eye on this. AFLW - quarter-time: West Coast 0.0 (0) trails Fremantle 2.2 (14) First blood to the old heads, as new kids on the blocks the Eagles are second to the bounce. Katie-Jayne Grieve and Gabby O\u2019Sullivan the goalscorers for the Dockers. It\u2019s $3 tickets in the West with proceeds going to the bushfire appeal. Great stuff, and great to see a very big crowd roll in to support this initial derby. And as soon as I\u2019ve written that - we\u2019ve a delay in the A-League as a fierce electrical storm rolls through Sydney\u2019s west. Kick-off will be 20 minutes later. Better news from the Super Rugby (from an Australian perspective) where Folau Fainga\u2019a has just crossed for the opening try. A great rolling maul from the lineout and the big hooker crashes over. 5-3 the early score, about 15 played. So - plenty more ahead! We have the late fixture in the A-League where it\u2019s Western Sydney Wanderers hosting Newcastle Jets. A first game in charge for Welshman Carl Robinson, while WSW\u2019s interim coach JP de Marigny is only a few weeks in the chair himself since Markus Babbel\u2019s departure. Key game for both these clubs - for the Jets to get off the bottom of the table, for the Wanderers to spark a late run for the finals. In the AFLW my spies are telling me there\u2019s a uuuge crowd in attendance for the first Western derby - great to hear. It\u2019s West Coast v Freo (in case you\u2019re new to this) there - lots to look forward to. And in the Super Rugby, it\u2019s the Brumbies playing host to the south islanders from Otago - the Highlanders - looking to arrest an already worrisome run of results for Australian clubs, you\u2019d warrant. Clare Lawrence has written in regarding that Sydney derby in the W-League: Big statement from Sydney leading into finals and what a way to show that we can score without Foord and Logarzo. Amy Sayer showing that she can step up and deliver in her first start for the club. Great game to be at (for a Sydney fan). Cheers Clare, love the extra intel. And you\u2019re right - with the UK\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League clubs coming knocking for leading Matildas there have been a few departures from the W-League lately; but as you say - one door closing, another door opening. And here\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the golf from the Royal Adelaide Golf Club - courtesy our partners at the Australian Associated Press: South Korean golfing icon Inbee Park will have to hold off her country\u2019s new guard to capture the Women\u2019s Australian Open. Former world No 1 Park, a seven-time major winner, holds a three-shot lead after a superb third round at Royal Adelaide on Saturday. As hopes of an Australian winner faded, Park, eyeing her 20th LPGA title, carded three-under to gain precious breathing space from a chasing pack. But that pack is headed by Park\u2019s 19-year-old compatriot Ayean Cho at 12-under. Cho is yet to play fulltime on the LPGA Tour but has won twice on the Korean tour, where she was rookie of the year last year. The teen fired a four-under 69 on Saturday to take outright second, while American Marina Alex is at 11-under and French duo Perrine Delacour and Celine Boutier lurking at 10-under Delacour produced the round of the day, firing a six-under par 67 highlighted by six birdies on her initial 10 holes. Chasing her maiden LPGA title, Delacour deliberately avoided looking at the leaderboard throughout her hot streak. \u201cI was just trying to hit a good shot and be in the present, which is hard because I was playing pretty good golf,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to keep making some birdies but don\u2019t really look at the leaderboard. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty happy with what I did.\u201d Perth\u2019s Hannah Green is the best-placed Australian local at seven-under. Green endured a topsy-turvy Saturday, her one-under 72 containing four birdies and three bogeys. World No 8 Minjee Lee, the top-ranked Australian a field boasting 15 major winners, and 21-year-old compatriot Robyn Choi are three-under. The only other Australians to make the cut, Katherine Kirk (two-over) and Karis Davidson (six-over) are out of contention. A very different story to what happened the last time these two met. In December it was a 5-0 shellacking handed out by the upstarts from out West, but a few months on it\u2019s a sharp turnaround. Sofia Huerta adding an injury-time third goal to rub salt into the wounds. Their season has plateaued a little in recent weeks, the Wanderers, after a very bright start. Their opponents leap past them into second on the table, with City still on top of the pile. They\u2019re untouchable in Auckland (which can\u2019t be said for their predecessors the Knights, alas) the Phoenix - a seventh game undefeated in the north of the north island at Eden Park. A big win in the scheme of their season, having lost two of their last three and beginning to look over their shoulder down the table at clubs like Brisbane and Adelaide charging up the table. A fine defensive effort from both sides, but City\u2019s inconsistent season continues, despite sitting near the top of the pile. A maiden AFLW win for the Suns and a great response to last week\u2019s low-scoring defeat. They were out on their feet in the last quarter at Metricon but held firm, and benefitted from some poor kicking for goal for Richmond, to take the points. Kate Surman is an absolute gem. The Suns are belting out the club song right now. And I mean belting out. Think one of the girls might have popped a larynx. They are pumped. And rightly so. So - a quick around the grounds. In the A-League we\u2019ve about 15 to play in Auckland, where it\u2019s Wellington Phoenix holding a slim 1-0 lead courtesy David Ball\u2019s goal. In Sydney in the W-League we\u2019re still at 2-0 in the Sydney derby between FC and Western Sydney Wanderers. Amy Harrison\u2019s rattle of the crossbar is as close as the visitors have come, they still trail 2-0, and are down to 10 women after Kristen Hamilton\u2019s sending off. On the Gold Coast, it\u2019s the home side still leading visitors Richmond in the AFLW on the home stretch by just under two goals. Let\u2019s take a closer look at that one as it comes to a close. Kia ora! A hearty welcome to you and yours from wherever around the world you\u2019re following our coverage. Are you one of the 15,347 watching the Phoenix from Eden Park in Auckland? There\u2019s a lovely crowd in there - and a decent spectacle going on between the Nix and Melbourne City. Plenty more sport going on from stadia around Australasia. As always on Sportwatch it is our duty, nay - privilege - to bring to you. Let\u2019s leap in. OK my lovelies, that\u2019s me for the day. The good news is Uncle Richard is in the house to take you through to stumps. Take it away, Mr Parkin! A-League: GOAL! Wellington 1-0 Melbourne City (Ball 58\u2019) A goal that was coming - well, it kind of did come in the first half but for VAR - and it was a pretty goal at that. A great run from Hooper down the right flank to latch onto Devlin\u2019s pass, and though the City defenders flooded back the cross to Ball\u2019s feet was centimetre perfect and the striker did the rest from close range. The scoring certainly dried up after that breathless beginning to the game, but the Brumbies did what they needed to for this opening-round victory. Plenty of positives for the Brumbies to take out of the game, including the excdellent debut performance of tennage debutant Ella Ryan. NRL Nines: No quarters given by Knights, Titans Newcastle and the Gold Coast have made a statement for their new coaches, winning through to the quarter finals of the NRL Nines after an undefeated run through the preliminary rounds in Perth. Adam O\u2019Brien and Justin Holbrook watched on after a pre-season of hard work as the Knights and Titans emerged along with North Queensland as the only teams to win both of their round robin games. Led by returning legend Kurt Gidley, the Knights will take on tournament favourites Parramatta in the first game of the finals after the Eels scraped through on their for-and-against differential. Newcastle followed up 34-0 thrashing of the Warriors on Friday with a 16-4 over Penrith while the Titans, conquerors of Canberra in game one, edged the West Tigers 14-13. St George Illawarra will take on the Panthers in the next game, but will be without star fullback Matt Dufty who has been rushed to hospital with a suspected fractured cheekbone. South Sydney have also made it through to the quarter finals and will play the undefeated Cowboys, while the Titans will play Manly. The winner of each game will progress through to the semi-finals later in the afternoon. - with thanks to AAP AFLW: HT: Gold Coast 4.3 (27) v Richmond 2.4 (16) A dominant quarter from the Suns, kicking two goals and restricting the Tigers to just two behinds. Kate Surman is playing a blinder and seems to be everywhere. Great skills and vision to set up this six-pointer. A-League: HT: Wellington 0-0 Melbourne City Plenty of intent, a few chances, a goal that wasn\u2019t but it\u2019s still zero plays zero at Eden Park. W-League: HT: Sydney FC 2-0 Western Sydney Those two early goals continue to separate these teams. Sydney FC could have had more to the break - Ellie Brush, scorer of the game\u2019s second goal, missed a shot towards the end of the half that she might normally score. But though Western Sydney are coming all honours are theirs, and a win here will see Sydney FC leapfrog the Wanderers into second spot. NRL Nines: Saturday women\u2019s results (so far) Roosters 0-16 Broncos Warriors 7-29 Dragons That\u2019s two pretty convincing wins for the Broncos, while the Dragons and Warriors have a win apiece. The Roosters are zip and two and would need a minor miracle to take part in tonight\u2019s grand final. In the men\u2019s game, here\u2019s how the quarter-finals are shaping up: A-League: 34 mins: Wellington 0-0 Melbourne City What was that about VAR being the thief of drama? The Phoenix faithful were cock-a-hoop, and convinced that Steinmann\u2019s scrambled goal was legit, but VAR deals in centimetres - not romance or drama or ambiguity - and offside is the ruling. No fun, VAR, no fun at all. AFLW: QT: Gold Coast 2.2 (14) v Richmond 2.2 (14) Not even a split cigarette paper between these teams at quarter time. The Suns got off to a flyer, which was good to see after their aggregate score of eight points in round one, but the Tigers enjoyed the better of proceedings as the term wore on to restore parity to the scoreline. Super W: HT: Brumbies 21-5 Rugby WA Three tries to one for the Brumbies, who are full value for their lead at a sodden GIO Stadium. Fyfe got the ball rolling when she crossed in the first minute of the game, with Smith (7 mins) and Burrows (19 mins) following suit. Hira-Herangi has Rugby WA\u2019s only try, doing so after 12 minutes in what was a frenetic start to this contest. Wood is having a good day with the boot, converting three-from-three for the Brumbies. W-League: GOAL! Sydney FC 2-0 Western Sydney (Brush 14\u2019) That\u2019s two goals for Sydney FC and the game has barely got going. Ellie Brush rises highest from a corner to head home and double the lead, leaving the Wanderers shellshocked and me thinking I should give my dad\u2019s dubious wisdom the basil brush. W-League: GOAL! Sydney FC 1-0 Western Sydney (Latsko 2\u2019) A (very) early goal in the Sydney derby with Veronica Latsko\u2019s trusty left boot beating the keeper after just two minutes. My father has a theory - the team (in any sport) which scores first and early never wins. We shall see, old man. I love it when Twitter does my job for me ... The Kangaroos notch their first win of the season, and though the win was richly deserved you wouldn\u2019t think the Giants players and coaching staff will sleep too well tonight. While North were generally clinical and polished, GWS had more scoring shots but squandered possession, missed easy shots and gave away one or two unnecessary free kicks. Still, take nothing away from the Kangas - this was a good response to their narrow defeat in round one. NRL Nines: Saturday men\u2019s results (so far) Knights 16-4 Panthers Roosters 14-8 Warriors Sharks 25-4 Bulldogs Eels 15-7 Dragons Rabbitohs 29-8 Raiders Titans 14-13 Tigers So where do these results leave the pool standings? I\u2019m glad you asked. The Knights are sitting pretty atop Pool 1 with the Panthers taking second spot; Pool 2 is a total mess with each team winning and losing a game - but the Dragons have the best points differential ahead of the Eels; the Titans are the kings of Pool 3 with the Rabbitohs snaring second spot; and Saturday\u2019s Pool 4 matches are yet to be played. AFLW: 3QT: North Melbourne 5.1 (31) v GWS Giants 2.4 (16) The Kangaroos extend their lead in Tassie, with the Giants continuing to waste much of their possession and North\u2019s Elisha King kicking a nice goal on the run after her set shot fell short and was returned straight back to her. NRL Nines: Dufty the latest to count the cost St George Illawarra fullback Matt Dufty has been taken to hospital with a suspected fractured cheekbone after an ugly collision against Parramatta in the NRL Nines in Perth. The 24-year-old was caught high in a collision at HBF Park and was immediately taken from the field for a head-injury assessment as his eye swelled. The incident happened soon after the kick-off as he chased the restart. If a fracture is confirmed, he is facing around a month on the sidelines. South Sydney forward Ethan Lowe will also undergo a fitness test on Saturday to assess whether he can take the field for day two of the tournament after he suffered a minor MCL sprain on Friday. Brisbane are still sweating on playmaker Anthony Milford, who was taken from the field after tweaking his left hamstring on Friday night. The Broncos star is yet to undergo a full assessment, but is out for the rest of Brisbane\u2019s program. Wests Tigers have confirmed Paul Momirovski will miss the next two to three weeks with an ankle sprain he suffered against the Rabbitohs on Friday. Meanwhile, St George Illawarra forward Holli Wheeler is facing a long recovery after suffering an ACL tear against the Broncos on Friday. The 30-year-old Australia and NSW representative twisted her knee in a tackle and was stretchered off the field. - with thanks to AAP Women\u2019s Australia Open golf: Park strolls into the lead Decorated South Korean golfer Inbee Park has taken outright leadership of the Women\u2019s Australian Open. The seven-time major winner moved to 12 under, two shots clear of the chasing pack, early in her third round at Royal Adelaide on Saturday. Park started her round as joint leader at 10 under with England\u2019s Jodi Ewart Shadoff, who double-bogeyed the third hole to slip to eight under. Frenchwoman Perinne Delacour is the big mover - she\u2019s six under through 14 holes to be 10 under for the tournament. Delacour shares second spot with American trio Elizabeth Szokol, Marina Alex and Jillian Hollis. Local hope Hannah Green is the best-placed Australian at seven under after 12 holes, as compatriot Minjee Lee slides from contention - the world No 8 is three under nearing the end of her round. Sydneysider Robyn Choi is two under through 13 holes while fellow Australians Katherine Kirk (two over) and Karis Davidson (six over) have completed their rounds. - with thanks to AAP AFLW: HT: North Melbourne 3.0 (18) v GWS Giants 1.3 (9) The scoreboard would suggest the Kangaroos have been doubly as good as the Giants, but general play would suggest this isn\u2019t the case. GWS had plenty of ball in that second term, but where North Melbourne were converting their chances the Giants were not. Haneen Zreika really should have two goals, not just the one, and the Sydney team will hope they don\u2019t look back on her incredible miss with regret. There\u2019s plenty of time for the Giants. But there\u2019s also plenty of time for Jasmine Garner to keep playing like this. When I was 15, I was sleeping in (a lot), starting to notice girls, getting excited about learning for my L-plates, transitioning from hair-removal cream to shaving blades and generally being awkward. I certainly wasn\u2019t scoring goals in a professional football league. AFLW: Q2: 5mins remaining: North Melbourne 2.0 (12) v GWS Giants 1.2 (8) Our first live update of the day and it\u2019s the Jasmine Garner show at York Park. She accounts for the entire Kangaroos score, two straight goals, but the Giants are breathing down their necks and in fact should, would, be in front had Haneen Zreika not missed a sitter from the top of the goal square. Still, she has plenty in the bank ... Hello and welcome to Sportwatch on this fine mid-February Saturday. There plenty to keep us busy and out of trouble, as ever. Australia\u2019s women\u2019s cricketers were to be playing a T20 World Cup warm-up against West Indies in Brisbane, but that game has been abandoned. So we are left with three AFLW matches, one of which is already under way, a couple of A-League contests, W-League, Super W and Super Rugby, NRL Nines, Australian Open women\u2019s golf and anything else we can poke our stick of curiosity at. Phew. I need a lie-down after that. While I rest my noggin, feel free to drop me an email or a tweet @scott_heinrich. I\u2019ll take a look when I stir.",

Seeds like heat; seedling roots not so much \u2013 they want cooler conditions, so make sure you get them off the heat as quickly as you can. And this is perhaps my favourite bit about the new mat: it rolls up for storage. A perfect solution for someone without a shed (that\u2019s my other fantasy).",

      "body": "<p>I live on the edge of England. You can\u2019t go any further south without falling into the sea, which is a long way down from the top of the high cliffs near my home. The walk over the backs of Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters is often named as one of the most beautiful in the country, with rolling downland that ends suddenly in bright, white chalk falls and a seascape horizon so wide you can see the Earth curve.</p> <p>For the last couple of years I have been privileged to be writer in residence at the Belle Tout lighthouse, which sits alone on one of these hills, almost on the edge of a 120m drop. This Georgian tower no longer shines a light, but it has been restored and transformed into a lovely place for bed and breakfast.</p> <p>I live just eight minutes\u2019 drive away in Eastbourne, but as often as possible, whatever the season, I have been going to the lantern room at the top of the lighthouse to write. From up there you can watch the sun rise in the morning and set in the evening. Lobster boats collect baskets close to shore, trawlers pass along a little further out and beyond them a ferry sets off from Newhaven for France twice a day. Way out in the distance, the giant freighters barely seem to move.</p> <p>This is a borderland, psychologically as well as geographically, where nature and the sublime seem to merge on bright spring days. But the weather changes fast as a storm sweeps in, a gale picks up and waves foam above the hidden dangers of the rocks and currents that have sunk so many ships over the centuries.</p> <p>I was up there in the tower watching the waves in early 2018 when I became aware of the new reality beginning to unfold out in the Channel, with increasing numbers of refugee men, women and even children risking their lives to cross in tiny boats. I heard on the news that nine people had been rescued from a sinking dinghy far out to sea and brought to safety near Eastbourne. As I thought about them, I happened to be watching a rigid inflatable RNLI dinghy fighting against the waves to get close to the rocks down below.</p> <p>Most of the visitors here come because of its beauty, but they can lose their footing. Some people are drawn to the area because they are desperate and seek an ending. There are volunteers who patrol in all weathers, night and day, saving hundreds of lives, but every year around 30 people go over. We are used to seeing the helicopters hover and the lifeboats go out to search for the bodies. But as I watched this one, the thought was shocking: if the rescuers were struggling in a state-of-the-art dinghy with the latest equipment and training, what hell would it be for cold, wet, frightened strangers to the sea in a far smaller, far flimsier boat?</p> <p>In the year that followed, more boats began to come. <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/insights/migrants-crossing-the-english-channel/\" title=\"\">The Home Office said 297 people made it across the Channel that way in 2018</a>. Last year <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50958713\" title=\"\">1,892 made the trip, according to the BBC</a>, and earlier this month 90 were rescued in a single day. They used to leave from Calais, but now they use more remote beaches and make longer, even more dangerous crossings. Most landings are still in Kent but some get as far as Sussex.</p> <p>I understand why they think it possible, because I have stood on the beach at Calais on a sunny day and seen Dover\u2019s white cliffs looking startlingly close. But I happened to be there with a French fisherman, while making a Radio 4 documentary, and was told a gale was starting out in the middle of La Manche, invisible to us. The sea looked calm enough to cross but when I asked if he would go that day he laughed and said: \u201cNon! That would be suicide.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s something hard-wired into the psyche locally about being constantly on guard against \u2018the invader\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the end of 2018, the then home secretary Sajid Javid sent more Border Force boats to the Channel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/28/channel-migrant-crossings-a-major-incident-says-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">and declared a \u201cmajor incident\u201d</a>. This was controversial, not only because the numbers involved are tiny compared with the millions seeking sanctuary in countries such as Turkey, but also because it came amid a fierce debate about Brexit and played into the fears of those who felt these shores were under threat from foreigners. Some even said the boats should be punctured and sunk to send a strong message of deterrent.</p> <p>That appalled Matt Coker, a fisherman from Dover who had been among the first to encounter a migrant boat out at sea and rescue those on board. \u201cThe only people who don\u2019t feel sorry for them are people on the land, who don\u2019t realise what they\u2019re actually going through when they\u2019re out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey come up with silly things like: \u2018You should burst the dinghy!\u2019 They should come out there with us. Whatever your politics, if someone\u2019s in trouble in front of you, most human beings would do whatever they could to help.\u201d</p> <p>His words highlight the paradox along these shores. Here, some places are closer to France than they are to Westminster, we can hear French voices on our radios and sometimes our phone signals even flip over to theirs. Yet town after town along the coast voted to leave the European Union. Much was said about shutting the door on foreigners, including our closest neighbours. In Folkestone and Dover <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results/local/d\" title=\"\">the vote for </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results/local/d\" title=\"\">leave</a> was 62%, slightly higher than the Kent total of 59%. Sussex was closer, nearly 50-50, because of remain places such as Brighton and Lewes, but in my town of Eastbourne the vote was 57% leave.</p> <p>Last summer, a self-styled vigilante group promised to patrol the beaches between Dungeness and Deal to intercept incoming migrants and hold them there until the authorities arrived, not seeming to realise that many want to contact the police as soon as possible, to start claiming asylum. Meanwhile, the Sun ran a photograph that, it claimed, captured The Moment Migrants Storm Kent Beaches, as if they were armed and not just scrambling ashore, grateful to still be alive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d5fdca647dfefa864cf020b64e89dc60e386e33d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5fdca647dfefa864cf020b64e89dc60e386e33d/142_117_1457_874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Border Force rescuing migrants in Dover, February 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Border Force rescuing migrants in Dover.

They go back much further than the second world war, to Martello towers from the Napoleonic era and even Pevensey Castle, where William the Conqueror set up his first post in the ruins of a Roman camp. Bridget Chapman, who works with refugees in Folkestone, says: \u201cThere\u2019s something hard-wired into the psyche locally about being constantly on guard against \u2018the invader\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s right, and yet there are many who don\u2019t feel this way, judging by the extraordinary generosity people have shown in raising money, finding food and donating clothes. She has invited me to take the train to Folkestone, where her group Kent Refugee Action Network has a portable building under the railway viaduct. A small group of late-teenagers is learning English with volunteers and being taught how to negotiate life in this new land. Adults and families are dispersed all over the country while they wait for their asylum claims to be heard, but unaccompanied youngsters who are under 18 on the day they arrive are usually kept in Kent, with foster families if there are places available, or in rented flats, in groups of five or six. Here then is a rare chance to meet some of the people who have crossed over. Who are they? And why have they taken such enormous risks to get here?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Akoy is dressed in skinny jeans and a roll-neck sweater, with a shaved neck but a big fat quiff. He\u2019s only 16, but his eyes say otherwise. Last summer, he made the long, perilous journey from his home town in Iran to the shores of northern France. There, he paid a smuggler \u00a33,000 for a place on a small boat leaving for England, with money wired by his big brother, but he was deceived. \u201cThe man told me lots of lies. He said: \u2018I send you by big boat, like the ferries they have in Dover. You have food, drink, everything you need on board.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Akoy found himself standing on a wet, windy beach in the dark with a group of others, looking in horror at a tiny craft. \u201cWe were all really scared when we saw this boat. Three metres.\u201d He identifies it on Google as the kind of inflatable meant for six or eight people. \u201cThere were 22 of us. The boat was in a big cardboard box. We had to unpack it and pump it up by hand. It took three hours. The man brought a small motor for the back and gave it diesel.\u201d A boy was chosen as the driver because he had worked as a fisherman back home in Afghanistan. \u201cThe man pointed to a red light on the other side and said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. Just aim for that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Akoy panicked. \u201cI said, \u2018Why did you lie to me? I\u2019m not going.\u2019 The man said, \u2018You must go. I won\u2019t give your money back.\u2019\u201d It was a terrible moment. That was all the money his family had. So he got on the boat, reluctantly, but it turned over in the surf and threw them out, three times. They were soaked. It was 2am. Out in the Channel, they realised they were in real trouble. \u201cWe were all saying the prayer we say as Muslims when we are going to die. The Afghan people texted their families to say goodbye. I would have texted my brother, but I didn\u2019t have my phone.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a narrative that these people are all Isis fighters. Most of them have come because they don\u2019t want to fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The boy driving had thrown some bags into the water during the journey, presumably to keep the boat afloat. There was huge relief when a large Border Force boat spotted them at dawn and sent a rescue launch. The people on board were all young men like Akoy, although the others were from Afghanistan. As they were given lifejackets and taken off the dinghy, Akoy braced himself for trouble. \u201cIn France, the police hit you. They come to the camp, put spray in your eyes and beat you up. The English police were not like that. They were so good. I was so cold. They helped me with a blanket, clothes and food. I didn\u2019t think it would be like this.\u201d</p> <p>The young men were taken to a reception centre in Dover harbour, where specialist immigration officers interviewed Akoy and asked why he was there. His answer is the same now as it was then: \u201cI come from a dangerous place. I am looking for a quiet place.\u201d</p> <p>Akoy comes from Sardasht, a majority Kurdish town in Iran near the border with Iraq, where Saddam Hussein once carried out chemical attacks. Lately, there have been violent clashes between the Kurds and Iranian security forces. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-statistics-year-ending-september-2019/how-many-people-do-we-grant-asylum-or-protection-to\" title=\"\">Home Office figures show that two-thirds of Iranians who apply here are given asylum</a>.</p> <p>The story Akoy tells is like an old folk tale. His mother died when he was five. His stepmother rejected him. His father got sick and he had to go to work at 13. He dreamed of escape and saved to do so, supported by his brother. Akoy made it to Turkey then tried to cross to Italy by sea, but the boat was stopped and sent back twice. Unwilling to give up, he paid to be locked with three other boys in the back of a sealed container lorry going to France, only to realise at the last moment how dangerous it was. \u201cI was scared to get in. I thought we were going to suffocate and die. The man hit me three times to make me get on.\u201d</p> <p>Akoy\u2019s eyes become red and glisten as he remembers the fear. He was 15 then. It was only last summer. \u201cWe were inside the lorry for four-and-a-half days. The driver, who was Turkish, would open the door and give bread and some drink then close it quickly.\u201d (Kent Refugee Action Network says Akoy\u2019s story rings true. We have changed his name.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b1c632a7abf36e5f6837115ffb87f4f4cf93ccc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b1c632a7abf36e5f6837115ffb87f4f4cf93ccc/0_863_3351_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zahra, 18, landed at Sunny Sands, Folkestone (above).

It was horrible. We were banging on the walls and the door, calling out to the driver, \u2018Please help us.\u2019 Three or four times, we called for him. He was not coming.\u201d</p> <p>They were finally let out in Lille, France. Confused and distressed, Akoy had no idea what to do. \u201cI saw Kurdish people at the train station and one boy said he was going to Dunkirk, where there was a place for Kurds. I needed to see people who spoke my language.\u201d Smugglers in Dunkirk openly offered places on boats. His brother sent the money through Western Union.</p> <p>On arrival in the UK, Akoy was lucky enough to be found a place with a foster family until he turns 18. \u201cI like my foster mother very much. She is like my mum. I cook for her. I am learning English food. It\u2019s hard. I miss my family.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Akoy is still waiting for his asylum claim to be processed by the Home Office, having been told there is a backlog. If he is granted refugee status, he will have five years\u2019 leave to remain in Britain, with the ability to work and apply for travel documents. He is determined to make a success of life here, if allowed. He is busy studying. \u201cI need to finish school and college then university. I would be a good chef. I can\u2019t go back, it is too dangerous.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI am glad to talk about this. I want to get all the bad memories out of my head.\u201d</p> <p>Listening to him, it strikes me that if people like Akoy were perceived as being \u201cus\u201d, we would tell their lives as adventure stories. Mostly, of course, they are not.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a narrative that says these people are all Isis fighters,\u201d Bridget Chapman says. \u201cLook around the classroom. Most of them have come precisely because they don\u2019t want to fight. We have people from Afghanistan who didn\u2019t want to be recruited by the Taliban and people from Eritrea escaping military service for life, which is slavery. They are peace-loving people with so much to offer us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e12ae5ed404dbf8b0ad049577316d608f0d3c3e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e12ae5ed404dbf8b0ad049577316d608f0d3c3e0/1372_110_2835_3544/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bridget Chapman, of the Kent Refugee Action Network\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bridget Chapman, of the Kent Refugee Action Network.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Browning/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These are not sentiments that were heard very often in Eastbourne before and after the Brexit referendum. I was invited on to the panel at a Brexit debate in May 2016, in front of 1,600 people at the town\u2019s Congress theatre. I was there as a neutral, because like so many people I had not yet got my head around the issues. I may have been undecided about how to vote, but I was alarmed and bemused by the full-throated shouts, groans and moans of those in the audience who said they felt under attack by foreigners.</p> <p>There were boos from the audience when I pointed out that the oldest known remains of an inhabitant of these parts belong to a woman discovered at Beachy Head who appears to be from sub-Saharan Africa. The other speakers on the panel were from out of town and didn\u2019t know this, but seeing a reconstruction of Beachy Head Lady\u2019s face in a local museum has challenged many people\u2019s perceptions of who we are. In a parallel way, Chapman says, opinions change when people meet individuals like Akoy. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to dislike this amorphous, faceless group of people: \u2018Them.\u2019 It\u2019s very different when you meet actual people, face-to-face.\u201d</p> <p>Coker, the Dover fisherman, would agree, having been surprised to find a dinghy full of migrants in trouble in September 2018. Now he sees the boats nearly every day, but then such encounters were a rarity. He and his father Mick were taking a dozen sporting anglers out to sea. \u201cI looked through my binoculars and I could see something. It was 10 in the morning on a flat, calm, sunny day. We were four miles off Dover. As we got closer, I could see they were waving a white T-shirt tied on an oar. It was obvious they were in distress. I thought holidaymakers had drifted out too far.\u201d As they got closer, he could see they were desperate. \u201cI got alongside, and one of them leapt for the boat. He was hanging on my railing as we were still moving. There was panic in the dinghy. They\u2019d obviously been out there a while. They didn\u2019t speak English so I pointed towards France and a woman nodded. I went straight into the wheelhouse and called the coastguard. They sent the Border Force out to meet me.\u201d</p> <p>The people on the dinghy were in a bad way. \u201cThe lady was being quite ill. There was a bloke bringing up blood, that might have been through dehydration. My anglers actually gave them some of their clothes, because the dinghy was half full of water.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>I wanted Coker to show me what it was like out there, so we set out at dusk with the wind picking up and the temperature dropping. Soon I was freezing cold and wet, despite being dressed appropriately. Six miles from shore, on the edge of the shipping lanes, he turned off the engines and let us drift. I knew I was safe on this modern fishing boat, but the inky blackness of the sea suddenly felt overwhelming and I had just a hint of how terrifying it might be to be stuck out here at night in an overloaded dinghy. Being that low in the water without proper lights or signals would put you in serious danger of getting run down by one of the many vessels using the lanes. The freighters looked to be moving very fast now and they were vast, like skyscrapers lying on their sides, heading for us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There has been at least one death, although it is impossible to know if others have slipped beneath the waters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHang on, we\u2019ve got company,\u201d said Coker as we drifted, having spotted the symbol for a Border Force cutter on his radio. The grey that camouflages these large patrol boats during the day must act like stealth paint at night, because all I could see was a black shape and a couple of lights. \u201cThey must think we\u2019re smugglers,\u201d he said, firing up the engines again. As we picked up speed, the Border Force must have been satisfied, because they left us alone. Five red lights in a vertical line dominated the darkness and I took them to be the lights Akoy\u2019s driver had been told to aim for. They were attached to the very high UHF mast at Church Hougham, near Dover. \u201cYou can see that all the way over on the other side, but it is so dangerous what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Coker. \u201cI\u2019m really surprised more people haven\u2019t died.\u201d</p> <p>There has been at least one death, although it is impossible to know if others have slipped beneath the waters. Mitra Mehrad was a 31-year-old PhD student from Iran who jumped over the side of a sinking dinghy in August last year to try to catch a rescue rope and save a baby. Nine days later, her body was washed up in a wind farm off the Dutch port city of IJmuiden, 100 miles away.</p> <p>A man from Afghanistan and another from the Netherlands <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-50855610\" title=\"\">were convicted of manslaughter</a> in Boulogne last December. The court heard Mehrad had paid them \u00a32,900 for a place in a Zodiac rib designed to hold six people; there were 17 on board when it was picked up off the coast of Ramsgate. The men had bought boats from Leboncoin, a French equivalent of eBay, and made up to \u00a350,000 for each crossing from the Calais coast. One wept in court and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know anyone was going to die. I just thought she<strong> </strong>would be able to get to England.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Thankfully for Zahra, an 18-year-old from Iran, the sea was flat when she crossed on Christmas Day 2018. Zahra, who also attends the sessions under the viaduct in Folkestone, set off for England after a year in a refugee camp with her mother. \u201cThe camp is very dangerous for young ladies. My mum decided to send me to another country.\u201d</p> <p>They believed the UK was the only country that would not send her back to the camp straight away. Zahra tried to jump lorries at Calais several times but was stopped. \u201cThere were lots of agents among the refugees, telling us we could go by boat.\u201d</p> <p>Her boat was unpacked and inflated on the beach like Akoy\u2019s, and this time she made it across. They landed on Sunny Sands in Folkestone, a wide, flat beach with a curving promenade that is built on distinctive brick arches. It\u2019s busy in summer but was deserted in the early hours of the morning. They were spotted, though, by someone living in a house on the hill above.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very wet and very cold. The police were very kind. They took us to Dover.\u201d After being given hot drinks, food and dry clothes, Zahra was eventually placed with an emergency foster family. She now lives independently with others. \u201cI came here to study, to get my dreams. When I was living in Iran, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to school, to study or to have my dream job. We do not come here to sleep. I want to be a pilot.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s ambitious but may not be impossible. Zahra has had three flying lessons already, sponsored by a generous company director who works in Greece and has been moved by the plight of refugees there. \u201cMost of the boys say women can\u2019t be pilots. I say, \u2018I can. You watch.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is something Chapman wants to show me, so we walk to the Folkestone Museum. A large, colourful painting called The Landing Of The Belgian Refugees illustrates people arriving in little boats in 1914, having fled the invading German army. It was painted that same year, by one of those who came.</p> <p>\u201cThere are obvious parallels with what is happening today,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the busiest day in 1914, 16,000 people arrived in Folkestone. Last year 1,800 people crossed the Channel and we called it a crisis. The Belgians were bedraggled and cold, hypothermic, arriving in boats as they are now. People gathered with food and clothes.

      "bodyText": "I live on the edge of England. You can\u2019t go any further south without falling into the sea, which is a long way down from the top of the high cliffs near my home. The walk over the backs of Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters is often named as one of the most beautiful in the country, with rolling downland that ends suddenly in bright, white chalk falls and a seascape horizon so wide you can see the Earth curve. For the last couple of years I have been privileged to be writer in residence at the Belle Tout lighthouse, which sits alone on one of these hills, almost on the edge of a 120m drop. This Georgian tower no longer shines a light, but it has been restored and transformed into a lovely place for bed and breakfast. I live just eight minutes\u2019 drive away in Eastbourne, but as often as possible, whatever the season, I have been going to the lantern room at the top of the lighthouse to write. From up there you can watch the sun rise in the morning and set in the evening. Lobster boats collect baskets close to shore, trawlers pass along a little further out and beyond them a ferry sets off from Newhaven for France twice a day. Way out in the distance, the giant freighters barely seem to move. This is a borderland, psychologically as well as geographically, where nature and the sublime seem to merge on bright spring days. But the weather changes fast as a storm sweeps in, a gale picks up and waves foam above the hidden dangers of the rocks and currents that have sunk so many ships over the centuries. I was up there in the tower watching the waves in early 2018 when I became aware of the new reality beginning to unfold out in the Channel, with increasing numbers of refugee men, women and even children risking their lives to cross in tiny boats. I heard on the news that nine people had been rescued from a sinking dinghy far out to sea and brought to safety near Eastbourne. As I thought about them, I happened to be watching a rigid inflatable RNLI dinghy fighting against the waves to get close to the rocks down below. Most of the visitors here come because of its beauty, but they can lose their footing. Some people are drawn to the area because they are desperate and seek an ending. There are volunteers who patrol in all weathers, night and day, saving hundreds of lives, but every year around 30 people go over. We are used to seeing the helicopters hover and the lifeboats go out to search for the bodies. But as I watched this one, the thought was shocking: if the rescuers were struggling in a state-of-the-art dinghy with the latest equipment and training, what hell would it be for cold, wet, frightened strangers to the sea in a far smaller, far flimsier boat? In the year that followed, more boats began to come. The Home Office said 297 people made it across the Channel that way in 2018. Last year 1,892 made the trip, according to the BBC, and earlier this month 90 were rescued in a single day. They used to leave from Calais, but now they use more remote beaches and make longer, even more dangerous crossings. Most landings are still in Kent but some get as far as Sussex. I understand why they think it possible, because I have stood on the beach at Calais on a sunny day and seen Dover\u2019s white cliffs looking startlingly close. But I happened to be there with a French fisherman, while making a Radio 4 documentary, and was told a gale was starting out in the middle of La Manche, invisible to us. The sea looked calm enough to cross but when I asked if he would go that day he laughed and said: \u201cNon! That would be suicide.\u201d At the end of 2018, the then home secretary Sajid Javid sent more Border Force boats to the Channel and declared a \u201cmajor incident\u201d. This was controversial, not only because the numbers involved are tiny compared with the millions seeking sanctuary in countries such as Turkey, but also because it came amid a fierce debate about Brexit and played into the fears of those who felt these shores were under threat from foreigners. Some even said the boats should be punctured and sunk to send a strong message of deterrent. That appalled Matt Coker, a fisherman from Dover who had been among the first to encounter a migrant boat out at sea and rescue those on board. \u201cThe only people who don\u2019t feel sorry for them are people on the land, who don\u2019t realise what they\u2019re actually going through when they\u2019re out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey come up with silly things like: \u2018You should burst the dinghy!\u2019 They should come out there with us. Whatever your politics, if someone\u2019s in trouble in front of you, most human beings would do whatever they could to help.\u201d His words highlight the paradox along these shores. Here, some places are closer to France than they are to Westminster, we can hear French voices on our radios and sometimes our phone signals even flip over to theirs. Yet town after town along the coast voted to leave the European Union. Much was said about shutting the door on foreigners, including our closest neighbours. In Folkestone and Dover the vote for leave was 62%, slightly higher than the Kent total of 59%. Sussex was closer, nearly 50-50, because of remain places such as Brighton and Lewes, but in my town of Eastbourne the vote was 57% leave. Last summer, a self-styled vigilante group promised to patrol the beaches between Dungeness and Deal to intercept incoming migrants and hold them there until the authorities arrived, not seeming to realise that many want to contact the police as soon as possible, to start claiming asylum. Meanwhile, the Sun ran a photograph that, it claimed, captured The Moment Migrants Storm Kent Beaches, as if they were armed and not just scrambling ashore, grateful to still be alive. Wartime defences are still visible along this stretch of coast. They go back much further than the second world war, to Martello towers from the Napoleonic era and even Pevensey Castle, where William the Conqueror set up his first post in the ruins of a Roman camp. Bridget Chapman, who works with refugees in Folkestone, says: \u201cThere\u2019s something hard-wired into the psyche locally about being constantly on guard against \u2018the invader\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s right, and yet there are many who don\u2019t feel this way, judging by the extraordinary generosity people have shown in raising money, finding food and donating clothes. She has invited me to take the train to Folkestone, where her group Kent Refugee Action Network has a portable building under the railway viaduct. A small group of late-teenagers is learning English with volunteers and being taught how to negotiate life in this new land. Adults and families are dispersed all over the country while they wait for their asylum claims to be heard, but unaccompanied youngsters who are under 18 on the day they arrive are usually kept in Kent, with foster families if there are places available, or in rented flats, in groups of five or six. Here then is a rare chance to meet some of the people who have crossed over. Who are they? And why have they taken such enormous risks to get here? * * * Akoy is dressed in skinny jeans and a roll-neck sweater, with a shaved neck but a big fat quiff. He\u2019s only 16, but his eyes say otherwise. Last summer, he made the long, perilous journey from his home town in Iran to the shores of northern France. There, he paid a smuggler \u00a33,000 for a place on a small boat leaving for England, with money wired by his big brother, but he was deceived. \u201cThe man told me lots of lies. He said: \u2018I send you by big boat, like the ferries they have in Dover. You have food, drink, everything you need on board.\u2019\u201d Instead, Akoy found himself standing on a wet, windy beach in the dark with a group of others, looking in horror at a tiny craft. \u201cWe were all really scared when we saw this boat. Three metres.\u201d He identifies it on Google as the kind of inflatable meant for six or eight people. \u201cThere were 22 of us. The boat was in a big cardboard box. We had to unpack it and pump it up by hand. It took three hours. The man brought a small motor for the back and gave it diesel.\u201d A boy was chosen as the driver because he had worked as a fisherman back home in Afghanistan. \u201cThe man pointed to a red light on the other side and said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. Just aim for that.\u2019\u201d Akoy panicked. \u201cI said, \u2018Why did you lie to me? I\u2019m not going.\u2019 The man said, \u2018You must go. I won\u2019t give your money back.\u2019\u201d It was a terrible moment. That was all the money his family had. So he got on the boat, reluctantly, but it turned over in the surf and threw them out, three times. They were soaked. It was 2am. Out in the Channel, they realised they were in real trouble. \u201cWe were all saying the prayer we say as Muslims when we are going to die. The Afghan people texted their families to say goodbye. I would have texted my brother, but I didn\u2019t have my phone.\u201d The boy driving had thrown some bags into the water during the journey, presumably to keep the boat afloat. There was huge relief when a large Border Force boat spotted them at dawn and sent a rescue launch. The people on board were all young men like Akoy, although the others were from Afghanistan. As they were given lifejackets and taken off the dinghy, Akoy braced himself for trouble. \u201cIn France, the police hit you. They come to the camp, put spray in your eyes and beat you up. The English police were not like that. They were so good. I was so cold. They helped me with a blanket, clothes and food. I didn\u2019t think it would be like this.\u201d The young men were taken to a reception centre in Dover harbour, where specialist immigration officers interviewed Akoy and asked why he was there. His answer is the same now as it was then: \u201cI come from a dangerous place. I am looking for a quiet place.\u201d Akoy comes from Sardasht, a majority Kurdish town in Iran near the border with Iraq, where Saddam Hussein once carried out chemical attacks. Lately, there have been violent clashes between the Kurds and Iranian security forces. Home Office figures show that two-thirds of Iranians who apply here are given asylum. The story Akoy tells is like an old folk tale. His mother died when he was five. His stepmother rejected him. His father got sick and he had to go to work at 13. He dreamed of escape and saved to do so, supported by his brother. Akoy made it to Turkey then tried to cross to Italy by sea, but the boat was stopped and sent back twice. Unwilling to give up, he paid to be locked with three other boys in the back of a sealed container lorry going to France, only to realise at the last moment how dangerous it was. \u201cI was scared to get in. I thought we were going to suffocate and die. The man hit me three times to make me get on.\u201d Akoy\u2019s eyes become red and glisten as he remembers the fear. He was 15 then. It was only last summer. \u201cWe were inside the lorry for four-and-a-half days. The driver, who was Turkish, would open the door and give bread and some drink then close it quickly.\u201d (Kent Refugee Action Network says Akoy\u2019s story rings true. We have changed his name.) \u201cWe had no toilet for four days,\u201d Akoy continues. \u201cSometimes there was no oxygen. It was horrible. We were banging on the walls and the door, calling out to the driver, \u2018Please help us.\u2019 Three or four times, we called for him. He was not coming.\u201d They were finally let out in Lille, France. Confused and distressed, Akoy had no idea what to do. \u201cI saw Kurdish people at the train station and one boy said he was going to Dunkirk, where there was a place for Kurds. I needed to see people who spoke my language.\u201d Smugglers in Dunkirk openly offered places on boats. His brother sent the money through Western Union. On arrival in the UK, Akoy was lucky enough to be found a place with a foster family until he turns 18. \u201cI like my foster mother very much. She is like my mum. I cook for her. I am learning English food. It\u2019s hard. I miss my family.\u201d * * * Akoy is still waiting for his asylum claim to be processed by the Home Office, having been told there is a backlog. If he is granted refugee status, he will have five years\u2019 leave to remain in Britain, with the ability to work and apply for travel documents. He is determined to make a success of life here, if allowed. He is busy studying. \u201cI need to finish school and college then university. I would be a good chef. I can\u2019t go back, it is too dangerous.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI am glad to talk about this. I want to get all the bad memories out of my head.\u201d Listening to him, it strikes me that if people like Akoy were perceived as being \u201cus\u201d, we would tell their lives as adventure stories. Mostly, of course, they are not. \u201cThere\u2019s a narrative that says these people are all Isis fighters,\u201d Bridget Chapman says. \u201cLook around the classroom. Most of them have come precisely because they don\u2019t want to fight. We have people from Afghanistan who didn\u2019t want to be recruited by the Taliban and people from Eritrea escaping military service for life, which is slavery. They are peace-loving people with so much to offer us.\u201d These are not sentiments that were heard very often in Eastbourne before and after the Brexit referendum. I was invited on to the panel at a Brexit debate in May 2016, in front of 1,600 people at the town\u2019s Congress theatre. I was there as a neutral, because like so many people I had not yet got my head around the issues. I may have been undecided about how to vote, but I was alarmed and bemused by the full-throated shouts, groans and moans of those in the audience who said they felt under attack by foreigners. There were boos from the audience when I pointed out that the oldest known remains of an inhabitant of these parts belong to a woman discovered at Beachy Head who appears to be from sub-Saharan Africa. The other speakers on the panel were from out of town and didn\u2019t know this, but seeing a reconstruction of Beachy Head Lady\u2019s face in a local museum has challenged many people\u2019s perceptions of who we are. In a parallel way, Chapman says, opinions change when people meet individuals like Akoy. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to dislike this amorphous, faceless group of people: \u2018Them.\u2019 It\u2019s very different when you meet actual people, face-to-face.\u201d Coker, the Dover fisherman, would agree, having been surprised to find a dinghy full of migrants in trouble in September 2018. Now he sees the boats nearly every day, but then such encounters were a rarity. He and his father Mick were taking a dozen sporting anglers out to sea. \u201cI looked through my binoculars and I could see something. It was 10 in the morning on a flat, calm, sunny day. We were four miles off Dover. As we got closer, I could see they were waving a white T-shirt tied on an oar. It was obvious they were in distress. I thought holidaymakers had drifted out too far.\u201d As they got closer, he could see they were desperate. \u201cI got alongside, and one of them leapt for the boat. He was hanging on my railing as we were still moving. There was panic in the dinghy. They\u2019d obviously been out there a while. They didn\u2019t speak English so I pointed towards France and a woman nodded. I went straight into the wheelhouse and called the coastguard. They sent the Border Force out to meet me.\u201d The people on the dinghy were in a bad way. \u201cThe lady was being quite ill. There was a bloke bringing up blood, that might have been through dehydration. My anglers actually gave them some of their clothes, because the dinghy was half full of water.\u201d * * * I wanted Coker to show me what it was like out there, so we set out at dusk with the wind picking up and the temperature dropping. Soon I was freezing cold and wet, despite being dressed appropriately. Six miles from shore, on the edge of the shipping lanes, he turned off the engines and let us drift. I knew I was safe on this modern fishing boat, but the inky blackness of the sea suddenly felt overwhelming and I had just a hint of how terrifying it might be to be stuck out here at night in an overloaded dinghy. Being that low in the water without proper lights or signals would put you in serious danger of getting run down by one of the many vessels using the lanes. The freighters looked to be moving very fast now and they were vast, like skyscrapers lying on their sides, heading for us. \u201cHang on, we\u2019ve got company,\u201d said Coker as we drifted, having spotted the symbol for a Border Force cutter on his radio. The grey that camouflages these large patrol boats during the day must act like stealth paint at night, because all I could see was a black shape and a couple of lights. \u201cThey must think we\u2019re smugglers,\u201d he said, firing up the engines again. As we picked up speed, the Border Force must have been satisfied, because they left us alone. Five red lights in a vertical line dominated the darkness and I took them to be the lights Akoy\u2019s driver had been told to aim for. They were attached to the very high UHF mast at Church Hougham, near Dover. \u201cYou can see that all the way over on the other side, but it is so dangerous what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Coker. \u201cI\u2019m really surprised more people haven\u2019t died.\u201d There has been at least one death, although it is impossible to know if others have slipped beneath the waters. Mitra Mehrad was a 31-year-old PhD student from Iran who jumped over the side of a sinking dinghy in August last year to try to catch a rescue rope and save a baby. Nine days later, her body was washed up in a wind farm off the Dutch port city of IJmuiden, 100 miles away. A man from Afghanistan and another from the Netherlands were convicted of manslaughter in Boulogne last December. The court heard Mehrad had paid them \u00a32,900 for a place in a Zodiac rib designed to hold six people; there were 17 on board when it was picked up off the coast of Ramsgate. The men had bought boats from Leboncoin, a French equivalent of eBay, and made up to \u00a350,000 for each crossing from the Calais coast. One wept in court and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know anyone was going to die. I just thought she would be able to get to England.\u201d * * * Thankfully for Zahra, an 18-year-old from Iran, the sea was flat when she crossed on Christmas Day 2018. Zahra, who also attends the sessions under the viaduct in Folkestone, set off for England after a year in a refugee camp with her mother. \u201cThe camp is very dangerous for young ladies. My mum decided to send me to another country.\u201d They believed the UK was the only country that would not send her back to the camp straight away. Zahra tried to jump lorries at Calais several times but was stopped. \u201cThere were lots of agents among the refugees, telling us we could go by boat.\u201d Her boat was unpacked and inflated on the beach like Akoy\u2019s, and this time she made it across. They landed on Sunny Sands in Folkestone, a wide, flat beach with a curving promenade that is built on distinctive brick arches. It\u2019s busy in summer but was deserted in the early hours of the morning. They were spotted, though, by someone living in a house on the hill above. \u201cWe were very wet and very cold. The police were very kind. They took us to Dover.\u201d After being given hot drinks, food and dry clothes, Zahra was eventually placed with an emergency foster family. She now lives independently with others. \u201cI came here to study, to get my dreams. When I was living in Iran, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to school, to study or to have my dream job. We do not come here to sleep. I want to be a pilot.\u201d That\u2019s ambitious but may not be impossible. Zahra has had three flying lessons already, sponsored by a generous company director who works in Greece and has been moved by the plight of refugees there. \u201cMost of the boys say women can\u2019t be pilots. I say, \u2018I can. You watch.\u2019\u201d There is something Chapman wants to show me, so we walk to the Folkestone Museum. A large, colourful painting called The Landing Of The Belgian Refugees illustrates people arriving in little boats in 1914, having fled the invading German army. It was painted that same year, by one of those who came. \u201cThere are obvious parallels with what is happening today,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the busiest day in 1914, 16,000 people arrived in Folkestone. Last year 1,800 people crossed the Channel and we called it a crisis. The Belgians were bedraggled and cold, hypothermic, arriving in boats as they are now. People gathered with food and clothes. They had empathy.\u201d They still do, but this was a big display of welcome led by the mayor of Folkestone in all his pomp. We don\u2019t do it like that any more, down on the edge of England. Brexit has cracked us open, allowed our strongest feelings to come out and left us polarised. There are still people who offer help and welcome, but they are not running the country. \u201cI wonder what\u2019s changed,\u201d says Chapman quietly. \u201cWhen did we become so hard?\u201d \u2022 Cole Moreton\u2019s novel The Light Keeper is published by Marylebone House; he is the co-host of the podcast Edge Of England.

I slip away undetected and ride down the narrow, slumbering streets of Chaussy, a village 70km north-west of Paris. The crisp morning air soon blows away the sleep and, as I ride past sun-painted fields with their neat rows of crops, the mist dissipates.</p> <p>This is day two of an eight-day ride from Dieppe to Nice, mainly following the river valleys of the Seine, Loire and Rh\u00f4ne. My bike is packed with everything I\u2019ll need: clothes, tent and flapjacks. I\u2019ve always felt riding a bicycle is the best way of exploring the world, but most of my touring so far has been within the UK, usually ending with a dip in the North Sea. But for this summer holiday, I would swap the North Sea for the Mediterranean. At the end of this I will lie on the beach in Nice, next to people who\u2019ve probably been lying on the beach in Nice since I started cycling. But this way, I\u2019ll have earned it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"459e6301200897a1a60dddbc3861d85c4befebf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459e6301200897a1a60dddbc3861d85c4befebf9/0_0_690_475/500.jpg\" alt=\"Map showing cycle route through France\" width=\"500\" height=\"344\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By day three, I\u2019ve hit a rhythm and the mileage is going well \u2013 233km down, 865km to go. The traffic-free <a href=\"https://www.avenuevertelondonparis.co.uk/cycle-route\" title=\"\">Avenue Verte</a> had guided me from Dieppe to Paris, then south of the city I followed the Seine, into rolling and windy hills over endless farmland. The sense of simplicity and freedom that cycle touring brings is here in abundance, and I love the wide skies and the cool mornings that burn off to leave long, sultry afternoons.</p> <p>Four hours south of the capital, I roll into Milly-la-For\u00eat. The central square heaves with fruit stalls. I buy some nectarines and eat beneath the market canopy, the taste transporting me back to family holidays. Someone exits the boulangerie clutching a French stick, and an old man rides by on a bike that looks as though it\u2019s held together with string.</p> <p>That evening I reach the Loire valley and find a campsite at Beaulieu-sur-Loire, but it\u2019s been a long day and it\u2019s dark by the time I pitch up. This site is really for motor vehicles, and there\u2019s no chance of getting my pegs into such hard ground, but I manage some kind of configuration of guy ropes tied to the hedge and my bike. Perhaps camping is not quite my thing.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.eurovelo.com/\" title=\"\">EuroVelo</a> network of cycle paths has 19 routes covering 70,000km across 42 countries. <a href=\"https://en.eurovelo.com/ev6\" title=\"\">EuroVelo 6</a> goes from Nantes in France all the way to Romania, and I follow it for 180km along the Loire, where a mixture of riverside paths, canal towpaths and old railway lines mean it\u2019s totally flat and almost all off-road. It\u2019s easy cycling, and easy navigation. \u201cJ\u2019aime le towpath!\u201d I post on Twitter, though by 100km my <em>amour</em> has cooled. At points it\u2019s nicer to just ride on the road \u2013 there\u2019s not much traffic, and France\u2019s high asphalt standards mean all the roads seem to have been newly resurfaced, lending rides smoothness and speed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adea155f2513ae3181ee711fe49d73424cfe7e98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adea155f2513ae3181ee711fe49d73424cfe7e98/0_280_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna\u2019s bicycle next to an idyllic stretch of the Loire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the level: Anna\u2019s bicycle next to an idyllic stretch of the Loire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Hughes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My fantasies of wild swimming, like those early dreams of wild camping, do not quite materialise \u2013 I\u2019m too busy cycling. But at Bourbon-Lancy, the last town before I leave the Loire, I take a detour to the river bank. It\u2019s sandy, and the water is wide and shallow with reeds bent by the fast flow; hardly deep enough for a proper swim but I strip and dip anyway, gasping at the freshness.</p> <p>The Rh\u00f4ne valley, which I reach on day six, could not be more different from the Loire. For one, it\u2019s much busier: <a href=\"https://en.eurovelo.com/ev8\" title=\"\">EuroVelo 8</a>, known on this stretch as La ViaRh\u00f4na, is a popular route for all kinds of cyclists, from couples to families to groups of friends heading out with a picnic and a bottle of wine. It\u2019s understandable: it\u2019s totally off-road, mostly next to the river, and often beneath tunnels of trees that provide much-needed shelter from the sun. The river is wide and very blue and endlessly draws the eye. Like the Loire, the route is flat, but instead of being in a wide river valley, it\u2019s hemmed in by dramatic slopes crammed with the famous vineyards of the region.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The simplicity and freedom of cycle touring is here in abundance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a Roman fort in Vienne where I stop in a small square beside the river for lunch. The buildings surrounding it are pale orange with terracotta roof tiles \u2013 in contrast with the chalk-white bricks of the north \u2013 and the land is noticeably more arid. I would like to stay here, beneath this tree, watching the river roll past, but I must cover at least 80km more today. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take it easy? Your sea swim will wait,\u201d someone says on Facebook. \u201cYes, but my train home won\u2019t,\u201d I reply, and keep pedalling. My knees hurt.</p> <p>By the time I reach Camping Les Deux Rives, 20km south of Valence in the Rh\u00f4ne valley, it\u2019s dark, again. I curse my ambition, yet I\u2019m pretty proud of my progress. The shower is long and hot and there\u2019s a game of p\u00e9tanque going on outside the bar. The thunk of the boules filters through as I settle down with my pizza, <em>sans fromage</em>. If vegetarianism isn\u2019t a thing in France, veganism certainly isn\u2019t \u2013 cue lots of blank looks when I say I don\u2019t eat cheese. Imagine! In France! So far I\u2019ve been surviving on <em>frites</em>, salad and pizza, with fresh fruit from the markets, and lots of bread. Tonight\u2019s pizza has been gradually growing colder and soggier in its box since I bought it back in Valence. But I\u2019m ravenous. It\u2019s the most delicious thing I\u2019ve ever eaten.</p> <p>South of Mont\u00e9limar it\u2019s away from the river valley and into the plains of Provence, where the hulk of Mont Ventoux looms. The plan is to take a small detour and ride each of Ventoux\u2019s three ascents in a single day \u2013 but that\u2019s another story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a12012103818905b68c8cae98eb18e15cea4defd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a12012103818905b68c8cae98eb18e15cea4defd/0_72_2030_1218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Hughes with her heavily laden bike at the station, the front of a train behind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">End of the line: Anna Hughes and trusty bike about to board the train home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Hughes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the eighth day I roll into Nice. A week of smashing out 130-plus kilometres per day has definitely taken its toll, as have the early starts and l ate nights, but I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way \u2013 slow travel teaches you how things connect and allows you to see so much more. In our must-have-everything-now society we tend to forget the journey\u2019s worth.</p> <p>The cycle route goes right along the Nice seafront, past the famous <a href=\"https://www.hotel-negresco-nice.com/en\" title=\"\">Negresco Hotel</a>, under the palm trees, and is soon crowded with the many people who flock to this part of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. After days of solitude it risks being overwhelming, but I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s a small price to pay for that sea swim I worked so hard for.</p> <p>The pebbled beach shelves sharply into the sea and in I go, rising and falling with the breakers, the water definitely cooler than I had anticipated. Kicking back under that intense sun I resolve to return to Nice one day.

Perhaps camping is not quite my thing. The EuroVelo network of cycle paths has 19 routes covering 70,000km across 42 countries. EuroVelo 6 goes from Nantes in France all the way to Romania, and I follow it for 180km along the Loire, where a mixture of riverside paths, canal towpaths and old railway lines mean it\u2019s totally flat and almost all off-road. It\u2019s easy cycling, and easy navigation. \u201cJ\u2019aime le towpath!\u201d I post on Twitter, though by 100km my amour has cooled. At points it\u2019s nicer to just ride on the road \u2013 there\u2019s not much traffic, and France\u2019s high asphalt standards mean all the roads seem to have been newly resurfaced, lending rides smoothness and speed. My fantasies of wild swimming, like those early dreams of wild camping, do not quite materialise \u2013 I\u2019m too busy cycling. But at Bourbon-Lancy, the last town before I leave the Loire, I take a detour to the river bank. It\u2019s sandy, and the water is wide and shallow with reeds bent by the fast flow; hardly deep enough for a proper swim but I strip and dip anyway, gasping at the freshness. The Rh\u00f4ne valley, which I reach on day six, could not be more different from the Loire. For one, it\u2019s much busier: EuroVelo 8, known on this stretch as La ViaRh\u00f4na, is a popular route for all kinds of cyclists, from couples to families to groups of friends heading out with a picnic and a bottle of wine. It\u2019s understandable: it\u2019s totally off-road, mostly next to the river, and often beneath tunnels of trees that provide much-needed shelter from the sun. The river is wide and very blue and endlessly draws the eye. Like the Loire, the route is flat, but instead of being in a wide river valley, it\u2019s hemmed in by dramatic slopes crammed with the famous vineyards of the region. There is a Roman fort in Vienne where I stop in a small square beside the river for lunch. The buildings surrounding it are pale orange with terracotta roof tiles \u2013 in contrast with the chalk-white bricks of the north \u2013 and the land is noticeably more arid. I would like to stay here, beneath this tree, watching the river roll past, but I must cover at least 80km more today. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take it easy? Your sea swim will wait,\u201d someone says on Facebook. \u201cYes, but my train home won\u2019t,\u201d I reply, and keep pedalling. My knees hurt. By the time I reach Camping Les Deux Rives, 20km south of Valence in the Rh\u00f4ne valley, it\u2019s dark, again. I curse my ambition, yet I\u2019m pretty proud of my progress. The shower is long and hot and there\u2019s a game of p\u00e9tanque going on outside the bar. The thunk of the boules filters through as I settle down with my pizza, sans fromage. If vegetarianism isn\u2019t a thing in France, veganism certainly isn\u2019t \u2013 cue lots of blank looks when I say I don\u2019t eat cheese. Imagine! In France! So far I\u2019ve been surviving on frites, salad and pizza, with fresh fruit from the markets, and lots of bread. Tonight\u2019s pizza has been gradually growing colder and soggier in its box since I bought it back in Valence. But I\u2019m ravenous. It\u2019s the most delicious thing I\u2019ve ever eaten. South of Mont\u00e9limar it\u2019s away from the river valley and into the plains of Provence, where the hulk of Mont Ventoux looms. The plan is to take a small detour and ride each of Ventoux\u2019s three ascents in a single day \u2013 but that\u2019s another story. On the eighth day I roll into Nice. A week of smashing out 130-plus kilometres per day has definitely taken its toll, as have the early starts and l ate nights, but I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way \u2013 slow travel teaches you how things connect and allows you to see so much more. In our must-have-everything-now society we tend to forget the journey\u2019s worth. The cycle route goes right along the Nice seafront, past the famous Negresco Hotel, under the palm trees, and is soon crowded with the many people who flock to this part of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. After days of solitude it risks being overwhelming, but I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s a small price to pay for that sea swim I worked so hard for. The pebbled beach shelves sharply into the sea and in I go, rising and falling with the breakers, the water definitely cooler than I had anticipated. Kicking back under that intense sun I resolve to return to Nice one day. In the interests of muscle fatigue, please forgive me if it\u2019s by train. \u2022 Ferries for Dieppe leave from Newhaven, East Sussex, and cost from \u00a330 one way (dfds.com), taking four hours Anna Hughes is director of Flight Free UK Looking for a holiday with a difference?

I\u2019d spent two years after leaving school on the minimum wage working in a chain-store stockroom. Her parents worked for a lender that called itself a \u201cpersonal loan company\u201d because it liked to think it bonded with clients by visiting them in their homes. I would have to canvas for custom by leafleting homes in impoverished postcodes. When someone applied for a loan I\u2019d go to their home bringing cash in an envelope and I\u2019d have to knock on doors collecting the repayments. I\u2019d earn commission which meant the more money I forced out of people the more money I would make. I saw families broken and people dying. I felt like a fly on a corpse.</p> <p>That experience has shaped my view of money and what it does to people. I was earning \u00a3800 a week, but realised that capitalism is not worth the damage it does. It also reinforced a lifelong feeling that I was the odd one out. Eventually it broke me. One New Year\u2019s Day I rang the office and told them I was done.</p> <p>I sold my collection of vintage video games and consoles for \u00a31,000 to self-publish a comic book about my mental health. Art helps me process situations and I found myself drawn to superheroes to escape myself. The sales funded print runs of more comics, culminating in a book about my experiences with the loan company. This earned me \u00a31,672 which gave me the confidence to approach big companies with samples and win commissions from Hollywood film studios illustrating official movie memorabilia. Comics never make much money so I took a \u00a312,000-a-year job in a shop which enabled me to get a mortgage on an \u00a380,000 flat, and I did my drawing in the evenings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/08/i-quit-my-teaching-job-and-am-now-running-chocolate-festivals\">\u2018I quit my teaching job and am now running chocolate festivals\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in 2017 I was hospitalised after a suicide attempt. Everything was breaking down at the same time. A car accident had left me in a leg brace. I left the job due to bullying and lost my partner and friends who could not cope with my self-harming, outbursts and panic attacks. It was only after that that I was diagnosed with autism. It hit me really hard. During the wait for a referral, I was housebound and supported by family and small employment and support allowance payments since I was deemed fit to work.</p> <p>I discovered that there were no books to help me that weren\u2019t academic or aimed at parents or children so I decided to use comics as a way of reinventing myself. I pitched the result, Reaffirmation: Coming to Terms with an Autism Diagnosis to a publisher but the process was taking too long so I pulled out and crowdfunded it. It raised \u00a34,758 after celebrity support on social media so I invested an extra \u00a3242 to print it in hardback.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/01/i-was-a-homeless-asylum-seeker-now-i-work-and-save-1000-a-month\">'I was a homeless asylum seeker; now I work and save \u00a31,000 a month'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Comics have given me a voice. They started out as escapism. I was a rebel without a cause and needed something to give me one. My autism has shown me a way to help make the world a better place. I\u2019ve gone from the guy taking money off people to an autism advocate. I still have a lot of phobias about leaving the house. I don\u2019t take holidays or eat out and I struggle to cook for myself. My parents drive me to Aldi at night when it\u2019s emptier and I spend about \u00a330 a week on microwavable food. But I\u2019m hungry to be going out and socialising.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always wanted to be secure by 30 and I feel I\u2019m on that path, scraping by on savings but with the potential to do something big. I\u2019m a consultant for a proposed new autism training hub for councils and I earn enough to pay my \u00a3345 a month mortgage from Amazon royalties and my film work. I\u2019d be worried if I wasn\u2019t scared about the future.

      "bodyText": "Name: Rees Finlay Age: 27 Income: \u00a310,000-\u00a315,000 Occupation: Comic book artist and publisher, Coventry It was an ex-partner who got me into payday lending. I\u2019d spent two years after leaving school on the minimum wage working in a chain-store stockroom. Her parents worked for a lender that called itself a \u201cpersonal loan company\u201d because it liked to think it bonded with clients by visiting them in their homes. I would have to canvas for custom by leafleting homes in impoverished postcodes. When someone applied for a loan I\u2019d go to their home bringing cash in an envelope and I\u2019d have to knock on doors collecting the repayments. I\u2019d earn commission which meant the more money I forced out of people the more money I would make. I saw families broken and people dying. I felt like a fly on a corpse. That experience has shaped my view of money and what it does to people. I was earning \u00a3800 a week, but realised that capitalism is not worth the damage it does. It also reinforced a lifelong feeling that I was the odd one out. Eventually it broke me. One New Year\u2019s Day I rang the office and told them I was done. I sold my collection of vintage video games and consoles for \u00a31,000 to self-publish a comic book about my mental health. Art helps me process situations and I found myself drawn to superheroes to escape myself. The sales funded print runs of more comics, culminating in a book about my experiences with the loan company. This earned me \u00a31,672 which gave me the confidence to approach big companies with samples and win commissions from Hollywood film studios illustrating official movie memorabilia. Comics never make much money so I took a \u00a312,000-a-year job in a shop which enabled me to get a mortgage on an \u00a380,000 flat, and I did my drawing in the evenings. But in 2017 I was hospitalised after a suicide attempt. Everything was breaking down at the same time. A car accident had left me in a leg brace. I left the job due to bullying and lost my partner and friends who could not cope with my self-harming, outbursts and panic attacks. It was only after that that I was diagnosed with autism. It hit me really hard. During the wait for a referral, I was housebound and supported by family and small employment and support allowance payments since I was deemed fit to work. I discovered that there were no books to help me that weren\u2019t academic or aimed at parents or children so I decided to use comics as a way of reinventing myself. I pitched the result, Reaffirmation: Coming to Terms with an Autism Diagnosis to a publisher but the process was taking too long so I pulled out and crowdfunded it. It raised \u00a34,758 after celebrity support on social media so I invested an extra \u00a3242 to print it in hardback. Comics have given me a voice. They started out as escapism. I was a rebel without a cause and needed something to give me one. My autism has shown me a way to help make the world a better place. I\u2019ve gone from the guy taking money off people to an autism advocate. I still have a lot of phobias about leaving the house. I don\u2019t take holidays or eat out and I struggle to cook for myself. My parents drive me to Aldi at night when it\u2019s emptier and I spend about \u00a330 a week on microwavable food. But I\u2019m hungry to be going out and socialising. I\u2019ve always wanted to be secure by 30 and I feel I\u2019m on that path, scraping by on savings but with the potential to do something big. I\u2019m a consultant for a proposed new autism training hub for councils and I earn enough to pay my \u00a3345 a month mortgage from Amazon royalties and my film work. I\u2019d be worried if I wasn\u2019t scared about the future. Things that have happened in my life have been bigger than me and the minute I start to become casual about what I\u2019m doing is the minute I should question whether I\u2019m doing it right. I want to prevent others from falling between the cracks as I did. Somebody shouldn\u2019t be found half dead on the floor before people take notice. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

It helps that when he speaks, Gibson added, \u201che has that cadence when he speaks that Obama has\u201d. By the time Buttigieg had wrapped up, Anand Prakash had tears in his eyes. The 43-year-old drove more than two hours from the Bay Area to see Mayor Pete. Prakash supported Sanders in the 2016 primaries, but this time around he said Buttigieg\u2019s ability to appeal to both the left and right won him over. \u201cWe need someone like him,\u201d Prakash said, showing off a selfie he\u2019d snagged with Buttigieg. Prakash has heard the critiques that Buttigieg lacks support among younger voters and people of color. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t even try to convince my friends to support him,\u201d he said. \u201cI just say to hear him out \u2013 his message, it appeals to everyone.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You can tell a true-born foodie by their urgency around a menu, and when the musician Jessie Ware meets me for lunch it is at a Middle Eastern restaurant with kitchen smells so good that she visibly quivers with impatience to order. \u201cI\u2019ve always been this way,\u201d says Ware, who was Mercury-nominated for her debut album \u2018Devotion\u2019 back in 2012, and has an as-yet-untitled fourth on the way. \u201cI\u2019ve always been controlling in food situations,\u201d she says. \u201cBasically a greedy cow.\u201d</p> <p>Ware, 35, has strict instructions from her management to talk up the new music instead of banging on about her life-long love of eating, but she is a gastronome to her core and can\u2019t help herself. \u201cOK!\u201d she tells a waiter (imagine the following spoken at rapid pace): \u201cWe\u2019ll get the aubergine. And the hummus? Some salad-y things. Which is your favourite out of the feta and the wedge\u2026 ? We\u2019ll get grilled halloumi. Ooh, and cauliflower. Is this still working for you? Is this working for me?\u201d</p> <p>She carries on: \u201cCrudit\u00e9s. Let\u2019s get some crudit\u00e9s. Ooh, fuck, hold on, those lamb fritters looked great until I saw the mention of offal, then I kind of checked out. What else? I. Am. Thinking. Bits. We need plates of bits. What\u2019s the deal with the clay oven? I love pickles. Can we get some pickles, please? Have I over-ordered? We\u2019ll get one more thing. You choose the last thing. You sign us out. Oh, falafel, lovely.\u201d</p> <p>The waiter asks if there\u2019s anything else. Ware says no. \u201cBut I may want to look in on the puds later.\u201d</p> <p>She has dark hair to her shoulders, a gold ring in one nostril and hoops in each ear. People tend to describe her, in the first instance, as a Mercury-nominated musician. In the early years of her career, this was shorthand that made sense. More recently, her job description has become more complicated \u2013 as Ware discovered for herself when she appeared before a judge during jury service recently, and was asked to explain what she did for a living.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f4540d58a8a1fae52ad6df5dd2e58bbb898f27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f4540d58a8a1fae52ad6df5dd2e58bbb898f27a/0_64_768_520/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jessie Ware and her mum Lennie recording an episode of their podcast Table Manners with TV presenter Stacey Dooley\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recording an episode of Table Manners with her mother Lennie and TV presenter Stacey Dooley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Jessie Ware</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo<em>,</em>\u201d she told the judge, \u201cI\u2019ve got an album due. I also record a podcast with my mum [Table Manners, launched in 2017]. We\u2019ve got a recipe book coming out [Table Manners: The Cookbook, due early March] and we\u2019re about to go on tour together [Table Manners Live, from late March].\u201d The judge, Ware says, \u201clooked at me as if I was about to claim I was a teapot in my spare time\u201d.</p> <p>We talk over her life, her work and how she got here. She grew up the middle child of three in a busy, noisy, secular Jewish household in south London. \u201cSo Jewish, we put up our tree in November,\u201d Ware said, recently. The household was dominated by her mother Lennie, a social worker, home cook and general mensch who gave as good as she got in boisterous conversations at the family dinner table.</p> <p>Her father, John Ware, is a reporter for BBC Panorama. (Last summer he presented an episode about antisemitism in the Labour Party that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/22/bbcs-john-ware-to-sue-labour-over-panorama-investigation-into-antisemitism\" title=\"\">made a lot of news</a>.) \u201cThis is not to say my dad was a bad person,\u201d Ware begins, carefully, \u201che just wasn\u2019t the <em>most</em> present parent because he was working a lot. My mum made up for it in leaps and bounds.\u201d</p> <p>Her parents separated when she was 10, and there was a period when she and her father were estranged. \u201cThat lasted a long time. We do have a relationship now. It\u2019s getting better and better. It\u2019s that feeling of, life\u2019s too short. And when he\u2019s not being annoying he can actually be quite funny and informative.\u201d</p> <p>She went to Alleyn\u2019s, a private school in south London, where she became friends with an Oasis-obsessed crowd that included Felix White and Jack Pe\u00f1ate, both of whom would become prominent musicians. Florence Welch was in the year below \u2013 the only one, in Ware\u2019s memory, who looked destined for some sort of stardom. For herself, Ware could pick her way through a jazz standard. She was a good bet for the third- or fourth-best part in school musicals<strong>.</strong> Beyond that, she didn\u2019t have much in the way of industry ambitions. \u201cI was a scaredy cat. I didn\u2019t write songs. Four albums in, it <em>still</em> seems odd that I make music like them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d981137b38b257daf48a1690a801a26054350c45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d981137b38b257daf48a1690a801a26054350c45/0_0_1745_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musician Jessie Ware performs onstage during day 3 of the 2013 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival at The Empire Polo Club on April 14, 2013 in Indio, California\" width=\"1000\" height=\"841\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Coachella in 2013. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Kempin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The foodie streak, the ravenous appetite, was always there, first evident publicly in the 1990s when Ware appeared with some school pals on a short-lived ITV children\u2019s quiz show called Eat Your Words. As her friend White has recalled, the rules were such that if a contestant answered a question incorrectly, they could still get a consolation point by forcing down a plate of horrid food. (Boiled carrots and custard was one.) As White remembered it, Ware made a series of elementary mistakes, fluffing her counting and her alphabet\u2026 but ate her way out of trouble and won. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time.<strong> </strong></p> <p>After graduation, White became part of a band, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/09/maccabees-split-british-guitar-rock-indie-future\" title=\"m\">Maccabees</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/01/jack-penate-after-you-review\" title=\"j\">Pe\u00f1ate</a> forged his way as a solo artist and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jun/24/florence-welch-interview-i-wonder-sometimes-did-i-dream-too-big\" title=\"f\">Welch</a> found the stardom they had all predicted. Meanwhile, Ware interned at the Jewish Chronicle. She had a degree in English literature and thought about training as a lawyer. Around 2010, Pe\u00f1ate asked her to join him on tour as a backing singer. Then a series of providential encounters led to Ware singing guest vocals for rising producers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sbtrkt\" title=\"s\">SBTRKT </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/18/disclosure-guy-howard-lawrence\" title=\"d\">Disclosure</a>.

I guess I was seen at the time as a slightly-alternative-pop-soul-girl, hiding behind the music, without much personality to dig your teeth into.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>It\u2019s a lingering orthodoxy of pop that for an artist to be considered credible they are better off staying unknowable. It was a trick that worked for Ware, \u201cback when I was so petrified in photoshoots that I looked miserable\u201d. The trouble was, it wasn\u2019t especially true to who she was in real life. Ware is blunt, funny; a gossip and a chatterbox. She\u2019s also a reality-TV obsessive with a knack for making interesting friends. (She\u2019s part of a semi-legendary WhatsApp group in which droll celebs such as Aisling Bea, Katherine Ryan and Lena Dunham commentate on episodes of Love Island.)</p> <p>She made a decision when she was making her second and third albums, Tough Love (2014) and Glasshouse (2017), to experiment with a more confessional style of songwriting. Ware has been with her partner, Sam Burrows, a personal trainer, since they were both 17-year-old ravers in south London. On autobiographical tracks such as Night Light and Sam, she wrote about them meeting, marrying and having their first child in 2016. But neither Tough Love nor Glasshouse did as well as her debut, and Ware says she lost quite a bit of money on a US tour in 2018.</p> <p>\u201cOn the first album, lots of wonderful things happened to me. Then, with album two, album three, I saw a different side. It was a bit more of a struggle. Fine. Nobody owed me anything. It was music, not saving lives. I always thought I\u2019d be quite matter-of-fact about it, if the music didn\u2019t work out. But people around me \u2013 people I trust \u2013 would say: \u2018You\u2019re miserable.\u2019</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4ddb97f82967fb3b70be8fc324484b81bd2eb415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ddb97f82967fb3b70be8fc324484b81bd2eb415/1871_0_3057_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessie Ware and husband Sam Burrows attend The BRIT Awards 2018 held at The O2 Arena on February 21, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"844\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With husband Sam Burrows in 2018.

Which is not what I wanted, or expected, to be.\u201d</p> <p>She felt especially guilty about her daughter, whom she had dragged around America for work, and then had to leave at home for part of the 2018 tour. As Ware tells it, the economics were such that they could not afford the extra zeroes it would take to bring husband and baby along, too. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have my daughter on the tour bus. And I couldn\u2019t cancel the tour. She was 18 months old. I was away for three weeks, and it nearly tore me apart. I did the shows. I appreciated everybody who came. But I would look out at the crowd and think, \u2018I\u2019m not enjoying myself. I\u2019m away from my family. I\u2019m losing loads of money. So, y\u2019know, this is shit.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, following the success of Devotion, Ware had been invited to play Coachella. The Californian music festival is staged over two consecutive weekends, so every performer plays twice. If your first weekend show is a hot one \u2013 as Ware\u2019s was in 2013 \u2013 you get to spend Monday to Friday basking in your own buzz before singing again. But if your first show turns out to be \u201can absolute Jesus Christ of a shocker\u201d? Ware drops her head at the memory of Coachella 2018.</p> <p>Groaning, slowly, she forces herself to tell the story. \u201cI clashed with Cardi B, a phenomenon that year, who was playing on another stage. Our equipment didn\u2019t work. You know how the audience at Coachella is, uh, pretty young? I\u2019m up there, 33 years old, singing about motherhood. It was just\u2026 tumbleweed. My mum was there with me.\u201d</p> <p>And what was Lennie\u2019s take? \u201cOh, she was honest. She said, \u2018Darling. Quit.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By now, mother and daughter had taken their brand of fond-but-brutal family banter public. They were making a weekly podcast together: \u201cNo agenda behind it, no business, we did it because it felt easy to do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The podcast has seen to my mystique. People know what I\u2019ve eaten and argued with my mum about this week</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The original idea was to gather a group of Ware\u2019s interesting mates for dinner, and record them all chatting, eating and gossiping. Lennie would cook; Ware would steer the conversation. By the time Table Manners went online, in late 2017, it had evolved into a one-guest-per-show format with Ware and her mother sharing hosting duties. Both cooked, both interrogated their guests with blasts of candid curiosity.</p> <p>Most of the guests on Table Manners have a drink while they are on, and their hosts certainly do. This means that episodes play out a bit like a Parkinson chat show, only recorded by the catering table with many glasses of red, no scripted questions, no pre-prepared anecdotes and endless conversational tangents. The comedian Alan Carr spilled the beans about his wedding (chief celebrant, Adele), while singer Sam Smith admitted he had always thought Mexico was in central Europe. Sadiq Khan broke the Ramadan fast with the Wares. Yannis Philippakis from the band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/26/yannis-philippakis-foals-interview-observer-music\" title=\"f\">Foals </a>spoke about getting stabbed by his uncle at a party.</p> <p>Listeners loved all this, and about 80m episodes of Table Manners have been downloaded since 2017. Ware, who has not yet had a top-10 single, got to experience a smash. The publisher Ebury signed the two Wares to a book deal. A live tour was arranged. Since Table Manners started turning a profit, Ware says, it has relieved some of the money-making imperatives on the music. \u201cMusic was my bread and butter. Now it isn\u2019t, not entirely \u2013 which has made it more enjoyable. Less do or die.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c46a81f3955c3635dedb58f4673328f157f9e004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c46a81f3955c3635dedb58f4673328f157f9e004/249_250_1528_2621/583.jpg\" alt=\"(L-R) Katy Perry (wearing Prada), Florence Welch (wearing Prada) and Jessie Ware (wearing Miu Miu) attend Catherine Martin And Miuccia Prada Dress Gatsby Opening Cocktail on April 30, 2013 in New York City\" width=\"583\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Katy Perry (left) and Florence Welch (centre) in 2013.

To make the new album, she booked time with a producer whose studio was walkable from her home. This meant that when Ware and her husband had a second child (a boy in spring 2019) the music carried on around the edges of their life, not the other way round. She says the new album will be about \u201cjoyful escapism\u2026sexy, seductive, late-night music that you can get lost in\u201d.</p> <p>Ware managed to cause a bit of family upset on the last record, when she wrote a line in a song addressed to her mum that seemed to criticise her dad. (\u201cI hope she knows / I found a man far from my father.\u201d) Ware had somehow convinced herself, she says, that if she didn\u2019t let her father come to any shows he would never find out: \u201cThat was silly of me. Someone sent him the song. He was really hurt.\u201d Her idea for the new album was that it would be confession-free, but without chasing any of the old mystique.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve fucked the mystique by now,\u201d says Ware. \u201cThe podcast has seen to my mystique. People know what I\u2019ve eaten. What I\u2019ve argued with my mum about this week. The mystique is not there. I\u2019m absolutely never going to be FKA Twigs. And that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>She looks aside, as if struck by a thought, and says: \u201cOoh, Twigs. We should try and get her on as a guest, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s time to leave the restaurant. Plates of pickles and veg have been picked clean, leaving no room to look in on puds after all. On her way out, Ware is stopped by a group of entertainment execs, who want to suggest some of their up-and-coming clients as guests for Table Manners. It\u2019s an unlikely course for a slightly-alternative-pop-soul-girl\u2019s career to have taken, but Ware seems chuffed with how it has panned out, as music, podcast, recipe-writing, daughterhood and parenthood come together in a big enjoyable mess. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve got five different jobs now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut like I told you, I\u2019ve always been greedy.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Spotlight, Jessie Ware\u2019s new single, is out on 28 February<strong>.</strong></p> <p><em>Top picture: shirt, \u00a3175, by Chloe, from <a href=\"https://www.harveynichols.com/brand/chloe/\">harveynichols.com</a>.

      "bodyText": "You can tell a true-born foodie by their urgency around a menu, and when the musician Jessie Ware meets me for lunch it is at a Middle Eastern restaurant with kitchen smells so good that she visibly quivers with impatience to order. \u201cI\u2019ve always been this way,\u201d says Ware, who was Mercury-nominated for her debut album \u2018Devotion\u2019 back in 2012, and has an as-yet-untitled fourth on the way. \u201cI\u2019ve always been controlling in food situations,\u201d she says. \u201cBasically a greedy cow.\u201d Ware, 35, has strict instructions from her management to talk up the new music instead of banging on about her life-long love of eating, but she is a gastronome to her core and can\u2019t help herself. \u201cOK!\u201d she tells a waiter (imagine the following spoken at rapid pace): \u201cWe\u2019ll get the aubergine. And the hummus? Some salad-y things. Which is your favourite out of the feta and the wedge\u2026 ? We\u2019ll get grilled halloumi. Ooh, and cauliflower. Is this still working for you? Is this working for me?\u201d She carries on: \u201cCrudit\u00e9s. Let\u2019s get some crudit\u00e9s. Ooh, fuck, hold on, those lamb fritters looked great until I saw the mention of offal, then I kind of checked out. What else? I. Am. Thinking. Bits. We need plates of bits. What\u2019s the deal with the clay oven? I love pickles. Can we get some pickles, please? Have I over-ordered? We\u2019ll get one more thing. You choose the last thing. You sign us out. Oh, falafel, lovely.\u201d The waiter asks if there\u2019s anything else. Ware says no. \u201cBut I may want to look in on the puds later.\u201d She has dark hair to her shoulders, a gold ring in one nostril and hoops in each ear. People tend to describe her, in the first instance, as a Mercury-nominated musician. In the early years of her career, this was shorthand that made sense. More recently, her job description has become more complicated \u2013 as Ware discovered for herself when she appeared before a judge during jury service recently, and was asked to explain what she did for a living. \u201cSo,\u201d she told the judge, \u201cI\u2019ve got an album due. I also record a podcast with my mum [Table Manners, launched in 2017]. We\u2019ve got a recipe book coming out [Table Manners: The Cookbook, due early March] and we\u2019re about to go on tour together [Table Manners Live, from late March].\u201d The judge, Ware says, \u201clooked at me as if I was about to claim I was a teapot in my spare time\u201d. We talk over her life, her work and how she got here. She grew up the middle child of three in a busy, noisy, secular Jewish household in south London. \u201cSo Jewish, we put up our tree in November,\u201d Ware said, recently. The household was dominated by her mother Lennie, a social worker, home cook and general mensch who gave as good as she got in boisterous conversations at the family dinner table. Her father, John Ware, is a reporter for BBC Panorama. (Last summer he presented an episode about antisemitism in the Labour Party that made a lot of news.) \u201cThis is not to say my dad was a bad person,\u201d Ware begins, carefully, \u201che just wasn\u2019t the most present parent because he was working a lot. My mum made up for it in leaps and bounds.\u201d Her parents separated when she was 10, and there was a period when she and her father were estranged. \u201cThat lasted a long time. We do have a relationship now. It\u2019s getting better and better. It\u2019s that feeling of, life\u2019s too short. And when he\u2019s not being annoying he can actually be quite funny and informative.\u201d She went to Alleyn\u2019s, a private school in south London, where she became friends with an Oasis-obsessed crowd that included Felix White and Jack Pe\u00f1ate, both of whom would become prominent musicians. Florence Welch was in the year below \u2013 the only one, in Ware\u2019s memory, who looked destined for some sort of stardom. For herself, Ware could pick her way through a jazz standard. She was a good bet for the third- or fourth-best part in school musicals. Beyond that, she didn\u2019t have much in the way of industry ambitions. \u201cI was a scaredy cat. I didn\u2019t write songs. Four albums in, it still seems odd that I make music like them.\u201d The foodie streak, the ravenous appetite, was always there, first evident publicly in the 1990s when Ware appeared with some school pals on a short-lived ITV children\u2019s quiz show called Eat Your Words. As her friend White has recalled, the rules were such that if a contestant answered a question incorrectly, they could still get a consolation point by forcing down a plate of horrid food. (Boiled carrots and custard was one.) As White remembered it, Ware made a series of elementary mistakes, fluffing her counting and her alphabet\u2026 but ate her way out of trouble and won. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time. After graduation, White became part of a band, the Maccabees, while Pe\u00f1ate forged his way as a solo artist and Welch found the stardom they had all predicted. Meanwhile, Ware interned at the Jewish Chronicle. She had a degree in English literature and thought about training as a lawyer. Around 2010, Pe\u00f1ate asked her to join him on tour as a backing singer. Then a series of providential encounters led to Ware singing guest vocals for rising producers such as SBTRKT and Disclosure. She had been accepted on to a law conversion course when PMR Records, Disclosure\u2019s label, offered her a deal. Devotion came out in summer 2012 and \u2013 impossibly, it seemed to her \u2013 was nominated for the Mercury within a month. \u201cEverything was magical and romantic around that record. I guess I thought, this is just what it\u2019s like!\u201d Lyrics-wise, Ware wasn\u2019t a very prominent presence on Devotion, which she describes now as \u201can ambiguous, metaphor-laden record. I guess I was seen at the time as a slightly-alternative-pop-soul-girl, hiding behind the music, without much personality to dig your teeth into.\u201d *** It\u2019s a lingering orthodoxy of pop that for an artist to be considered credible they are better off staying unknowable. It was a trick that worked for Ware, \u201cback when I was so petrified in photoshoots that I looked miserable\u201d. The trouble was, it wasn\u2019t especially true to who she was in real life. Ware is blunt, funny; a gossip and a chatterbox. She\u2019s also a reality-TV obsessive with a knack for making interesting friends. (She\u2019s part of a semi-legendary WhatsApp group in which droll celebs such as Aisling Bea, Katherine Ryan and Lena Dunham commentate on episodes of Love Island.) She made a decision when she was making her second and third albums, Tough Love (2014) and Glasshouse (2017), to experiment with a more confessional style of songwriting. Ware has been with her partner, Sam Burrows, a personal trainer, since they were both 17-year-old ravers in south London. On autobiographical tracks such as Night Light and Sam, she wrote about them meeting, marrying and having their first child in 2016. But neither Tough Love nor Glasshouse did as well as her debut, and Ware says she lost quite a bit of money on a US tour in 2018. \u201cOn the first album, lots of wonderful things happened to me. Then, with album two, album three, I saw a different side. It was a bit more of a struggle. Fine. Nobody owed me anything. It was music, not saving lives. I always thought I\u2019d be quite matter-of-fact about it, if the music didn\u2019t work out. But people around me \u2013 people I trust \u2013 would say: \u2018You\u2019re miserable.\u2019 \u201cAnd I was \u2013 I was angry, slightly bitter, resentful. Which is not what I wanted, or expected, to be.\u201d She felt especially guilty about her daughter, whom she had dragged around America for work, and then had to leave at home for part of the 2018 tour. As Ware tells it, the economics were such that they could not afford the extra zeroes it would take to bring husband and baby along, too. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have my daughter on the tour bus. And I couldn\u2019t cancel the tour. She was 18 months old. I was away for three weeks, and it nearly tore me apart. I did the shows. I appreciated everybody who came. But I would look out at the crowd and think, \u2018I\u2019m not enjoying myself. I\u2019m away from my family. I\u2019m losing loads of money. So, y\u2019know, this is shit.\u2019\u201d In 2013, following the success of Devotion, Ware had been invited to play Coachella. The Californian music festival is staged over two consecutive weekends, so every performer plays twice. If your first weekend show is a hot one \u2013 as Ware\u2019s was in 2013 \u2013 you get to spend Monday to Friday basking in your own buzz before singing again. But if your first show turns out to be \u201can absolute Jesus Christ of a shocker\u201d? Ware drops her head at the memory of Coachella 2018. Groaning, slowly, she forces herself to tell the story. \u201cI clashed with Cardi B, a phenomenon that year, who was playing on another stage. Our equipment didn\u2019t work. You know how the audience at Coachella is, uh, pretty young? I\u2019m up there, 33 years old, singing about motherhood. It was just\u2026 tumbleweed. My mum was there with me.\u201d And what was Lennie\u2019s take? \u201cOh, she was honest. She said, \u2018Darling. Quit.\u2019\u201d By now, mother and daughter had taken their brand of fond-but-brutal family banter public. They were making a weekly podcast together: \u201cNo agenda behind it, no business, we did it because it felt easy to do.\u201d The original idea was to gather a group of Ware\u2019s interesting mates for dinner, and record them all chatting, eating and gossiping. Lennie would cook; Ware would steer the conversation. By the time Table Manners went online, in late 2017, it had evolved into a one-guest-per-show format with Ware and her mother sharing hosting duties. Both cooked, both interrogated their guests with blasts of candid curiosity. Most of the guests on Table Manners have a drink while they are on, and their hosts certainly do. This means that episodes play out a bit like a Parkinson chat show, only recorded by the catering table with many glasses of red, no scripted questions, no pre-prepared anecdotes and endless conversational tangents. The comedian Alan Carr spilled the beans about his wedding (chief celebrant, Adele), while singer Sam Smith admitted he had always thought Mexico was in central Europe. Sadiq Khan broke the Ramadan fast with the Wares. Yannis Philippakis from the band Foals spoke about getting stabbed by his uncle at a party. Listeners loved all this, and about 80m episodes of Table Manners have been downloaded since 2017. Ware, who has not yet had a top-10 single, got to experience a smash. The publisher Ebury signed the two Wares to a book deal. A live tour was arranged. Since Table Manners started turning a profit, Ware says, it has relieved some of the money-making imperatives on the music. \u201cMusic was my bread and butter.

      "body": "<p>Some time towards the end of 2019, Archy Marshall, AKA King Krule, found himself in Warrington standing on a wide stretch of ankle-high grass. Behind him, smoke curled into the wintry sky above Fiddlers Ferry power station. With the sun setting over its chimneys, he picked out drowsy notes on his guitar, singing deeply over the top.</p> <p>What on earth was the flame-haired singer up to, miles from his south London home, his Fender Mustang hanging loosely over his shoulder? As it turns out, Marshall has a new stomping ground these days, having moved to the north-west after his partner became pregnant in 2018, to be closer to her family. \u201cI left this city and went up there and it feels great,\u201d he says as we settle at a table in the pub near his mum\u2019s house back south, to the west of Peckham Rye. It is another cold evening, and he is in London rehearsing in preparation to tour Man Alive!, his third album as King Krule. The story behind the trip to the power station became clear before Christmas, when Marshall uploaded a grainy video titled Hey World! to YouTube. Along with footage of four new songs were shots of snow, the moon and copious electricity pylons (Marshall\u2019s current fixation). His girlfriend \u2013 photographer Charlotte Patmore, who was heavily pregnant during parts of the recording \u2013 was behind the camera. \u201cI was super cold in front of that power station \u2013 I remember after five or six takes I was like: \u2018Fucking hell, my fingers are falling off.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But Marshall\u2019s freezing digits were worth it: Hey World! is both an intriguing intro to his new record and a window into a new, calmer stage of his life in Cheshire\u2019s wide expanses. Having left the grime and grind of London, things have changed for the 25-year-old, who first emerged as a snarling, hollow-cheeked teen in the 2011 video for the searing Out Getting Ribs and built a reputation for angry, tender songwriting, blackened by the stories of his young life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWnK2t_FxrY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bWnK2t_FxrY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That debut single sparked pandemonium, and after a self-titled EP laid out his untamable vision for a new sound built from jazz, hip-hop, punk and his beloved no-wave, 2013 debut album 6 Feet Beneath the Moon cemented him as a thrilling new voice. Bile and brilliance spewed from his lean frame in equal measure. Tracks such as Border Line and Ceiling had plenty of the former, while Baby Blue and Ocean Bed showed his deft touch for a love song. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/beyonce/photos/king-krulehttpwwwyoutubecomwatchv9i35kogbybo/10153054420270601/\">Beyonc\u00e9 posted a link</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRzlbh4or3c\">Easy Easy</a> (a bellowed rock\u2019n\u2019roll number about nicking stuff from Tesco in Surrey Quays) on Facebook, and Kanye West, Frank Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt began sniffing around for collaborations. Marshall, meanwhile, told MTV he \u201cwasn\u2019t surprised\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 was into his stuff.</p> <p>In 2014, under his real name, he released A New Place 2 Drown, a tripped-out LP that came with a companion art book made with his brother. The hype spread internationally as Marshall toured, and in 2017, his expansive second King Krule album The Ooz won him a Mercury nod, by which time he had become something of a counterculture icon. All the while, he drank in the same pubs and did his bit to promote the scene he came from, supporting south London music and ensuring that its bars and DIY venues still hosted King Krule shows.

Mostly, though, he wrote about his changing surroundings.

It arcs from the King Krule staples of guttural anger and noise (the rumbling Supermarch\u00e9, Stoned Again\u2019s rough and tumble, the nerve-jangling Comet Face), to lush guitars and zen-like contentment (Airport Antenatal Airplane, which samples Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s voice and is dedicated to his daughter, and Please Complete Thee, arguably Marshall\u2019s purest song yet). Even the sedative Alone, Omen 3, written about finding empowerment in depression, feels joyous. A patchwork of sampled voices and field recordings add to Man Alive!\u2019s pleasantly dazed atmosphere. On the record \u2013 which, at 40 minutes, is his shortest so far \u2013 there is a sense that something inside him is thawing. \u201cI see a beauty in everything that I knew was always there, but I can understand it a lot more now,\u201d he says. \u201cI really like the beauty in the lows, the highs, the hatred and the love, I appreciate humanity, the people around me and conversation. I\u2019m more open, accepting and interested.\u201d</p> <p>Marshall started down this path in the wake of The Ooz, a long, often tortured album that functioned as a purge, its title a tribute to the gunk the human body naturally produces. \u201cI\u2019m finding another way of expressing myself, a temperament [where] I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was on stage before anyone knew about me, and as soon as the [industry] machine caught wind, it didn\u2019t stop. It got to a point where I was being thrown into stuff like [New York music showcase] CMJ when I was really young. And, do you know what? It was fucking bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>Now more than ever, Marshall is endeavouring to stay bullshit-free. He\u2019s smoking and drinking less, too. Inside his head, he has barely deviated from the time back in 2012 when his mother Rachel, a costume designer and artist, doubled as his manager. He eventually signed up with XL Recordings and Adele\u2019s management company, but family has always been more important to King Krule. Marshall\u2019s brother Jack does his album art, while their dad Adam, an art director, contributed spoken word on The Ooz and paintings for the new record, the title of which was pilfered from the boys\u2019 musician uncle, whose images of pylons (see, we told you he was obsessed) also adorn the inlay. Pylons pop up again in the lyrics to The Dream, a mumbled lullaby about halfway through Man Alive! that sums up its entire mood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ad49a021a878232c867f3627b254867a3229c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ad49a021a878232c867f3627b254867a3229c5d/0_319_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"He\u2019s electric: King Krule performs at Electric Picnic, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He\u2019s electric...

His latest side project, he reveals, is \u201cwriting kids\u2019 songs that are stupid as hell; I make them up for her and translate them on to the guitar, 80s Robert Wyatt-style.\u201d That process started when Marshall would rock her to sleep. \u201cShe sleeps longer than me, man. I\u2019ve been blessed, it\u2019s been pretty easy because of how good she is,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe loves music. She loves to stare at the guitar and she loves to strum it and feel the vibration of the strings. She wants to climb it, she wants to hit it.\u201d</p> <p>Marshall approached Man Alive! in the same spirit. He enjoyed uprooting to a new studio in Stockport, where there was \u201ca comfier chair\u201d and two engineers who could go blow-for-blow with Marshall working through the night. The Hey World! film also finds him playing a small pink guitar with unicorns printed on it, borrowed from his partner\u2019s younger sister.

I think about one little image of me, writing something down or something happening to me and I\u2019m there,\u201d he says. \u201cThis record sounds really good live.

      "bodyText": "Some time towards the end of 2019, Archy Marshall, AKA King Krule, found himself in Warrington standing on a wide stretch of ankle-high grass. Behind him, smoke curled into the wintry sky above Fiddlers Ferry power station. With the sun setting over its chimneys, he picked out drowsy notes on his guitar, singing deeply over the top. What on earth was the flame-haired singer up to, miles from his south London home, his Fender Mustang hanging loosely over his shoulder? As it turns out, Marshall has a new stomping ground these days, having moved to the north-west after his partner became pregnant in 2018, to be closer to her family. \u201cI left this city and went up there and it feels great,\u201d he says as we settle at a table in the pub near his mum\u2019s house back south, to the west of Peckham Rye. It is another cold evening, and he is in London rehearsing in preparation to tour Man Alive!, his third album as King Krule. The story behind the trip to the power station became clear before Christmas, when Marshall uploaded a grainy video titled Hey World! to YouTube. Along with footage of four new songs were shots of snow, the moon and copious electricity pylons (Marshall\u2019s current fixation). His girlfriend \u2013 photographer Charlotte Patmore, who was heavily pregnant during parts of the recording \u2013 was behind the camera. \u201cI was super cold in front of that power station \u2013 I remember after five or six takes I was like: \u2018Fucking hell, my fingers are falling off.\u2019\u201d But Marshall\u2019s freezing digits were worth it: Hey World! is both an intriguing intro to his new record and a window into a new, calmer stage of his life in Cheshire\u2019s wide expanses. Having left the grime and grind of London, things have changed for the 25-year-old, who first emerged as a snarling, hollow-cheeked teen in the 2011 video for the searing Out Getting Ribs and built a reputation for angry, tender songwriting, blackened by the stories of his young life. That debut single sparked pandemonium, and after a self-titled EP laid out his untamable vision for a new sound built from jazz, hip-hop, punk and his beloved no-wave, 2013 debut album 6 Feet Beneath the Moon cemented him as a thrilling new voice. Bile and brilliance spewed from his lean frame in equal measure. Tracks such as Border Line and Ceiling had plenty of the former, while Baby Blue and Ocean Bed showed his deft touch for a love song. Beyonc\u00e9 posted a link to Easy Easy (a bellowed rock\u2019n\u2019roll number about nicking stuff from Tesco in Surrey Quays) on Facebook, and Kanye West, Frank Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt began sniffing around for collaborations. Marshall, meanwhile, told MTV he \u201cwasn\u2019t surprised\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 was into his stuff. In 2014, under his real name, he released A New Place 2 Drown, a tripped-out LP that came with a companion art book made with his brother. The hype spread internationally as Marshall toured, and in 2017, his expansive second King Krule album The Ooz won him a Mercury nod, by which time he had become something of a counterculture icon. All the while, he drank in the same pubs and did his bit to promote the scene he came from, supporting south London music and ensuring that its bars and DIY venues still hosted King Krule shows. After one riotous gig in Bermondsey before The Ooz came out, he left to tour the US. He remembers that period as \u201ca really inspiring time\u201d, and things would change dramatically once it was over. Upon his return to London Marshall found out he was becoming a father; the baby was born in March last year. He scratches his head as if to crank its contents into gear. \u201cWhen she was born, she was the biggest expression of life and love, but I also lost some good people last year,\u201d he says. \u201cThose juxtapositions between death and such extreme life must have had an effect on me.\u201d As much as this reclusive character might not favour the idea, for King Krule fans the new outlook represents big news.

      "body": "<p>In what now looks like a state of prelapsarian innocence, I hadn\u2019t heard of Joelle Joanie Siwa \u2013 or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2017/mar/07/jojo-bows-siwa-schools-ban\" title=\"\">JoJo Siwa</a>, as the five-year-olds know her \u2013 until my daughter asked for her on Alexa a few months ago. \u201cPlay JoJo Siwa,\u201d she said, and has been saying ever since. At my kids\u2019 birthday party in January, they received JoJo Siwa-branded diaries and accessories. In the local pharmacy, there is a whole rack of JoJo Siwa hair guff next to the milk. This week there was a book fair at their school, where you\u2019d think you\u2019d be safe, but no. In among the volumes of Pete the Cat and shark books, there she was \u2013 JoJo &amp; Bow Bow: The Posh Puppy Pageant, one of a series of books \u201cwritten\u201d by Siwa.</p> <p>There are worse kids\u2019 internet phenomena out there, but the breadth of the Siwa franchise, and the glittery hold she has on kindergarten-age girls, makes her one of the most annoying. Siwa, who is 16 and comes from Nebraska, sprang to fame on the back of the Lifetime TV show Dance Moms. But it was her YouTube channel, JoJo Siwa vlogs, that launched her pop career and everything that came afterwards: a 52-city US tour, endless spinoffs, and her presence in our house every day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/22/parents-exploiting-children-youtube-fame-easy-money\">Parents are exploiting their children on YouTube for fame and easy money | Emma Brockes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Siwa\u2019s image is brash and cartoonish, and the songs are horrible \u2013 ostensibly they\u2019re all about standing up to bullying (a typical line from her 2016 single Boomerang runs <a href=\"https://ok.ru/video/78666795527\" title=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t really care about what they say / I\u2019mma come back like a boomerang\u201d</a>). But, as with a lot of stars in that space, the cost of Siwa accessories has probably done more to encourage bullying than diminish it.</p> <p>Still, I tell myself she\u2019s harmless, particularly since my kids don\u2019t understand what celebrity is yet. \u201cIs JoJo Siwa real?\u201d they ask, and I have no idea what to say. \u201cI mean, she exists,\u201d I say. \u201cBut she\u2019s acting.\u201d They have no interest in this. And when they ask, \u201cCan we go on a playdate with her?\u201d I\u2019m actually relieved. I\u2019d rather they thought of her as a girl in the neighbourhood than as an unreachable star they aspire to be.</p> <p>I\u2019m also trying to stay open-minded. Even though Siwa looks like a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/08/matt-lucas-losing-my-hair-at-the-age-of-six-shaped-my-life-little-me-my-life-from-a-z\" title=\"\">Matt Lucas</a> character and sounds like someone doing an impression of their own tinnitus, going the full out-of-touch judge doesn\u2019t help anyone. I once overlooked the terrible gravitational weight of parental disapproval and bad-mouthed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/20/youtube-highest-earner-eight-year-old-guan-ryans-world\" title=\"\">Ryan\u2019s World</a> \u2013 a multimillion-dollar YouTube channel based on a kid called Ryan playing with toys \u2013 telling my daughter his mother\u2019s voice was annoying and the videos were dumb, and she burst into tears of sorrow.</p> <p>If I\u2019m going to get them off Siwa, it will have to be through stealth. It\u2019s tough to compete with the kind of marketing precision that throws unicorns, hair bows and \u201cgems\u201d at five-year-olds.

      "bodyText": "In what now looks like a state of prelapsarian innocence, I hadn\u2019t heard of Joelle Joanie Siwa \u2013 or JoJo Siwa, as the five-year-olds know her \u2013 until my daughter asked for her on Alexa a few months ago. \u201cPlay JoJo Siwa,\u201d she said, and has been saying ever since. At my kids\u2019 birthday party in January, they received JoJo Siwa-branded diaries and accessories. In the local pharmacy, there is a whole rack of JoJo Siwa hair guff next to the milk. This week there was a book fair at their school, where you\u2019d think you\u2019d be safe, but no. In among the volumes of Pete the Cat and shark books, there she was \u2013 JoJo &amp; Bow Bow: The Posh Puppy Pageant, one of a series of books \u201cwritten\u201d by Siwa. There are worse kids\u2019 internet phenomena out there, but the breadth of the Siwa franchise, and the glittery hold she has on kindergarten-age girls, makes her one of the most annoying. Siwa, who is 16 and comes from Nebraska, sprang to fame on the back of the Lifetime TV show Dance Moms. But it was her YouTube channel, JoJo Siwa vlogs, that launched her pop career and everything that came afterwards: a 52-city US tour, endless spinoffs, and her presence in our house every day. Siwa\u2019s image is brash and cartoonish, and the songs are horrible \u2013 ostensibly they\u2019re all about standing up to bullying (a typical line from her 2016 single Boomerang runs \u201cI don\u2019t really care about what they say / I\u2019mma come back like a boomerang\u201d). But, as with a lot of stars in that space, the cost of Siwa accessories has probably done more to encourage bullying than diminish it. Still, I tell myself she\u2019s harmless, particularly since my kids don\u2019t understand what celebrity is yet. \u201cIs JoJo Siwa real?\u201d they ask, and I have no idea what to say. \u201cI mean, she exists,\u201d I say. \u201cBut she\u2019s acting.\u201d They have no interest in this. And when they ask, \u201cCan we go on a playdate with her?\u201d I\u2019m actually relieved. I\u2019d rather they thought of her as a girl in the neighbourhood than as an unreachable star they aspire to be. I\u2019m also trying to stay open-minded. Even though Siwa looks like a Matt Lucas character and sounds like someone doing an impression of their own tinnitus, going the full out-of-touch judge doesn\u2019t help anyone. I once overlooked the terrible gravitational weight of parental disapproval and bad-mouthed Ryan\u2019s World \u2013 a multimillion-dollar YouTube channel based on a kid called Ryan playing with toys \u2013 telling my daughter his mother\u2019s voice was annoying and the videos were dumb, and she burst into tears of sorrow. If I\u2019m going to get them off Siwa, it will have to be through stealth. It\u2019s tough to compete with the kind of marketing precision that throws unicorns, hair bows and \u201cgems\u201d at five-year-olds. But last week, after watching videos of the astronaut Chris Hadfield on the international space station, we put on David Bowie. You\u2019d think they\u2019d never heard music before. One of my kids stopped in her tracks and looked as if she was about to cry. Every day, since then, she has asked for \u201cthe space song\u201d. The fightback has begun. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Times Radio\u2019s launch is being overseen by the Times Literary Supplement editor, Stig Abell, who said last month that he wanted to break free of traditional head-to-head arguments between pundits about politics. \u201cWe want to reach people who don\u2019t currently read the Times, people who don\u2019t consider the Times,\u201d said Abell. \u201cWe want people to think positively about the Times because we\u2019re offering a high-end luxurious product.\u201d A source at parent company News UK said: \u201cThere are lots of conversations going on but any names are speculative at the moment.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 February 2020. The original said Chris Mason hosted Any Answers. He is actually the host of Any Questions. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>A third of the way through this absorbing and engagingly written book, Albert Costa describes a family meal: \u201cThe father speaks Spanish with his wife and his son, but uses Catalan with his daughter. The daughter in turn speaks Catalan with her father but Spanish with the rest of the family, including the grandmother, who only speaks Spanish though she understands Catalan.\u201d It\u2019s what Costa calls \u201corderly mixing\u201d, and, depending on which restaurants you visit, a common enough situation: everyone is bilingual here, but the language used changes according to who it is directed at. Given that everyone at the table understands both languages, would it not be easier and less confusing if everyone just chose one language and stuck to it? That sounds logical, but the bilingual mind doesn\u2019t work that way. If you do not believe it, Costa suggests \u201chaving a conversation with a friend in the language you do not usually use and see how far you get\u201d.</p> <p>Not far, he observes. And Costa should know \u2013 not just because he was an expert in language acquisition (he died last year), but because the family he is describing is his own. One of the reasons this book makes sense of its complex material \u2013 from basic code-switching tests to the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/mar/26/brain-imaging-scan-fmri-academic-gimmick\" title=\"\">technology in brain imaging </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/07/us-military-successfully-tests-electrical-brain-stimulation-to-enhance-staff-skills\" title=\"\">transcranial magnetic stimulation </a>\u2013 is that Costa is such a charming and witty guide. This is a rigorous book about complex science, and much of it could have been intractably technical or riddled with statistics. But Costa has a winningly informal style, a deadpan wit, and mixes laboratory findings of cognitive neuropsychology with examples from everyday life, TV programmes, sports and politics. In one set of cognitive tests, he shows how people are more risk-averse in their second language, and more gung-ho in their first. Costa suggests the practical applicablity of such research by advising us to visit casinos where people speak a language we are less comfortable in \u2013 it substantially reduces the likelihood of our going home shirtless and barefoot.</p> <p>The family, of course, is where it all starts. As children growing up with a French-speaking mother and an English-speaking father, my sister and I would never have dreamed of speaking English to our mother and French to our father. When we were forced to, out of politeness or in social contexts, it felt instinctively wrong and against the grain. As for our parents, they only ever spoke to each other in French \u2013 they met in Li\u00e8ge in the 1960s \u2013 even though they lived for decades in Raynes Park, south-west London. Although everyone spoke two languages, no one spoke both languages to each other, and the lines were never crossed. The reasons for this had nothing to do with practicality or logic or economies of meaning. They were at once the most complex and the most basic questions of who we are when we speak, and which version of ourselves we become when we choose, or think we choose, a language.</p> <p>Costa\u2019s book starts in the womb. The human ear is already fully developed at around 20 weeks, which means the newborn baby has heard the world long before it has seen it. Costa describes how, during the \u201cpre-natal bilingual experience\u201d, the bilingual baby is already able to differentiate between languages \u2013 not just between the mother\u2019s language and other languages, but between its two \u201chome\u201d languages and others. \u201cNine months in the womb go a long way,\u201d Costa writes; he then tracks what happens in the bilingual cradle. One finding is that at eight months old the bilingual baby can discriminate between two different languages to which it has not been exposed. This facility isn\u2019t simply to do with hearing, since how we interpret sounds depends on other stimuli, notably the movement of lips (the bilingual baby can differentiate just by watching videos of people speaking with the sound turned down). The ability to read visual clues and articulatory movements is already in place. For an enjoyably destabilising proof of how we \u201chear\u201d by what we see, I recommend watching the audiovisual illusion called the McGurk effect (available on YouTube as a BBC science segment). Here, the same sound is produced by the same speaker but with different lip movements, thus visually tricking the brain into hearing a different sound. Even knowing that it\u2019s an illusion doesn\u2019t stop you mishearing the sound; the only way to hear it correctly it is not to watch the lips.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91917a512829e9417125b90c904ddc13bb6be088\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91917a512829e9417125b90c904ddc13bb6be088/0_115_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visit casinos where people speak a language you are less comfortable in \u2013 it reduces the likelihood of going home shirtless and barefoot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visit casinos where people speak a language you are less comfortable in \u2013 it reduces the likelihood of going home shirtless and barefoot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dmitry Feoktistov/Tass/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Costa also describes how a bilingual person\u2019s two languages can be in productive conflict, and how, even though only one language might be being used at any given time, the second language is still being cognitively exercised. Less encouragingly, he also describes experiments with people who have forgotten a childhood language. We assume \u2013 at any rate, I did \u2013 that a language we once knew, or had some fluency in as children, remains lodged in our minds. But some tests on adults who were adopted as children and lost their native language show there is no mental record of their mother tongue. It is as if they had never known it. The phenomenon that Costa calls, in a different context, one language \u201ceating\u201d another, is widespread, albeit less drastic, and not always negative. \u201cInterference\u201d, for instance, is an ambiguous gift: while one language might disrupt the other \u2013 jam its frequencies, as it were \u2013 the context determines whether it\u2019s advantageous or not. Think of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/23/incantata-review-pain-poetry-and-potatoes-with-paul-muldoon\" title=\"\">poetry of Paul Muldoon</a> or Dylan Thomas, where the interference from Irish and Welsh is often at the heart of the poem \u2013 a rich fund of material, as well as perhaps an impetus to write in the first place. In a different context \u2013 telephone banking or a situation involving paramedics \u2013 interference is a problem.</p> <p>Fifty years ago, there was a consensus \u2013 culturally enforced rather than scientifically supported \u2013 that bilingualism \u201cconfused\u201d children. It\u2019s hardly surprising that this consensus existed in Britain and, to an extent, France. The rest of the world barely even noticed that it was living bi- or multilingually, and got on with speaking one or two languages at home, another couple in school, and watching films or listening to music in yet more. The advantages of bilingualism, whether you come to it early or late, are discussed by Costa from various perspectives, not just the obvious ones such as agility and stimulation, learning for its own sake, access to other cultures, basic fluency on holiday, respecting your neighbours in your new Welsh cottage or Proven\u00e7al dream home.</p> <p>Costa twice quotes Nelson Mandela\u2019s famous comment that when you talk to someone in their first language, your message goes to their heart; talk to them in their second and it goes to their head. We don\u2019t need tests to tell us that greeting people, however ineptly, in their native language, rather than talking to them loudly and slowly in English as if they were stupid, will make them feel differently about us. But it\u2019s fascinating to see the cognitive mapping behind it.</p> <p>Costa goes on to discuss the long-term benefits to brain health of the exercise the mind does with language. It is what he calls \u201ccognitive savings\u201d, which work like (another analogy of his) a \u201cpension\u201d that makes the brain more resilient in ways that help it delay the ill-effects of ageing and stave off dementia. Those benefits are available late in life too \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter when you start a new language, or indeed what language you choose. Learning a second language gives you \u201ccognitive reserves\u201d that your brain continues to draw on.</p> <p>A regular excuse some monoglots make for not learning a language is that it\u2019s not \u201cuseful\u201d because \u201ceveryone speaks English\u201d. Happily, this is far from true, but the truer it is, the worse it is for the anglo-monoglot, because, as this book shows us, scientifically but also culturally, all languages are useful, and it doesn\u2019t really matter which second language you learn, or indeed when. It is concerned with what happens to our brains, from cradle to grave (sometimes via the nursing home, where several of Costa\u2019s tests are conducted), when we acquire another language. It turns out that opening our minds and preserving them are symbiotically linked.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The Bilingual Brain: And What It Tells Us About the Science of Language by Albert Costa, translated by John W Schwieter, is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320).

Costa describes how, during the \u201cpre-natal bilingual experience\u201d, the bilingual baby is already able to differentiate between languages \u2013 not just between the mother\u2019s language and other languages, but between its two \u201chome\u201d languages and others. \u201cNine months in the womb go a long way,\u201d Costa writes; he then tracks what happens in the bilingual cradle. One finding is that at eight months old the bilingual baby can discriminate between two different languages to which it has not been exposed. This facility isn\u2019t simply to do with hearing, since how we interpret sounds depends on other stimuli, notably the movement of lips (the bilingual baby can differentiate just by watching videos of people speaking with the sound turned down). The ability to read visual clues and articulatory movements is already in place. For an enjoyably destabilising proof of how we \u201chear\u201d by what we see, I recommend watching the audiovisual illusion called the McGurk effect (available on YouTube as a BBC science segment). Here, the same sound is produced by the same speaker but with different lip movements, thus visually tricking the brain into hearing a different sound. Even knowing that it\u2019s an illusion doesn\u2019t stop you mishearing the sound; the only way to hear it correctly it is not to watch the lips. Costa also describes how a bilingual person\u2019s two languages can be in productive conflict, and how, even though only one language might be being used at any given time, the second language is still being cognitively exercised. Less encouragingly, he also describes experiments with people who have forgotten a childhood language. We assume \u2013 at any rate, I did \u2013 that a language we once knew, or had some fluency in as children, remains lodged in our minds. But some tests on adults who were adopted as children and lost their native language show there is no mental record of their mother tongue. It is as if they had never known it. The phenomenon that Costa calls, in a different context, one language \u201ceating\u201d another, is widespread, albeit less drastic, and not always negative. \u201cInterference\u201d, for instance, is an ambiguous gift: while one language might disrupt the other \u2013 jam its frequencies, as it were \u2013 the context determines whether it\u2019s advantageous or not. Think of the poetry of Paul Muldoon or Dylan Thomas, where the interference from Irish and Welsh is often at the heart of the poem \u2013 a rich fund of material, as well as perhaps an impetus to write in the first place. In a different context \u2013 telephone banking or a situation involving paramedics \u2013 interference is a problem. Fifty years ago, there was a consensus \u2013 culturally enforced rather than scientifically supported \u2013 that bilingualism \u201cconfused\u201d children. It\u2019s hardly surprising that this consensus existed in Britain and, to an extent, France. The rest of the world barely even noticed that it was living bi- or multilingually, and got on with speaking one or two languages at home, another couple in school, and watching films or listening to music in yet more. The advantages of bilingualism, whether you come to it early or late, are discussed by Costa from various perspectives, not just the obvious ones such as agility and stimulation, learning for its own sake, access to other cultures, basic fluency on holiday, respecting your neighbours in your new Welsh cottage or Proven\u00e7al dream home. Costa twice quotes Nelson Mandela\u2019s famous comment that when you talk to someone in their first language, your message goes to their heart; talk to them in their second and it goes to their head. We don\u2019t need tests to tell us that greeting people, however ineptly, in their native language, rather than talking to them loudly and slowly in English as if they were stupid, will make them feel differently about us. But it\u2019s fascinating to see the cognitive mapping behind it. Costa goes on to discuss the long-term benefits to brain health of the exercise the mind does with language. It is what he calls \u201ccognitive savings\u201d, which work like (another analogy of his) a \u201cpension\u201d that makes the brain more resilient in ways that help it delay the ill-effects of ageing and stave off dementia. Those benefits are available late in life too \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter when you start a new language, or indeed what language you choose. Learning a second language gives you \u201ccognitive reserves\u201d that your brain continues to draw on. A regular excuse some monoglots make for not learning a language is that it\u2019s not \u201cuseful\u201d because \u201ceveryone speaks English\u201d. Happily, this is far from true, but the truer it is, the worse it is for the anglo-monoglot, because, as this book shows us, scientifically but also culturally, all languages are useful, and it doesn\u2019t really matter which second language you learn, or indeed when. It is concerned with what happens to our brains, from cradle to grave (sometimes via the nursing home, where several of Costa\u2019s tests are conducted), when we acquire another language. It turns out that opening our minds and preserving them are symbiotically linked. \u2022 The Bilingual Brain: And What It Tells Us About the Science of Language by Albert Costa, translated by John W Schwieter, is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320).

      "bodyText": "The wait is over for the new president of the all-important United Nations climate conference (Cop26) in Glasgow in November. Alok Sharma is set to take on this high-octane diplomatic role while also juggling the immensely powerful job of leading the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Some may see this as a herculean task, but the BEIS secretary is in a unique position to lead the charge in tackling the climate emergency. His portfolio now includes not just delivering net-zero carbon in the UK but also convincing the world to follow suit. Reportedly turned down by former Conservative heavyweights David Cameron and William Hague, the Cop26 presidency had been in a state of limbo. The sacked president, Claire O\u2019Neill, warned of a serious leadership gap in her departing missive to Boris Johnson. Having a cabinet minister now leading the charge is welcome, but the new minister\u2019s voting record on climate does not instil confidence. He has voted against support for carbon-capture projects and taxing polluting vehicles and dirty power stations, among other things. Cop26 is a different kettle of fish, and making it a success is vital to tackling climate change. In 2019, Cop25 ended in disappointment, as rich nations failed to enhance their carbon-cutting commitments or raise more money for countries struggling to cope with climate impacts. A similar outcome in Glasgow will mean inaction until 2025, and we simply cannot afford that. The new Cop26 president and the UK government face a major diplomatic task over the next few months to persuade high carbon-emitting nations, such as China and India, to commit to greater cuts, while getting the EU, US and other rich countries to meet the pledge made a decade ago to raise $100bn a year in climate finance. Existing contributions from all the nations combined put us on a path to increasing average global temperatures by 3.2C by 2100, while the Paris accord commits nations to a pathway of well below 2C. This will be the ultimate test of the conference in November. Every tenth of a degree makes a huge difference to the lives and livelihoods of millions at the frontline of climate change.

      "bodyText": "There are 723 pupils at the Jos\u00e9 Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Afanador school but no electricity, no computers, no tables and no chairs. The windows lack glass, the toilets have lost their sinks and its metal classroom doors have been plundered by thieves, allowing pigeons to colonize several of the filthy spaces. Even the school\u2019s political director has been condemned to darkness, a tangle of wires hanging from the ceiling of her gloomy office above a portrait of South America\u2019s liberation hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. \u201cIt\u2019s true, we\u2019re facing a pretty difficult situation,\u201d said Jetsica Benavides, as livid parents swarmed outside her door. In the staff room next door the mood was bleak among teachers who said they lacked even board markers. \u201cAll we have are the administrative staff and the teachers \u2013 and the walls,\u201d complained one. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Nothing else.\u201d The Jos\u00e9 Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Afanador school in El Palmar, a picturesque rural town 12 hours\u2019 drive from Venezuela\u2019s capital Caracas, is far from an aberration. Rather, it is the perfect example of a mouldering public education system, crippled by Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse. Thousands of schools across this oil-rich South American nation are in similarly dire straits as pauperized teachers abandon their profession or skip the country altogether amid one of the worst economic downturns in modern history. They leave behind students so malnourished they faint during class or fail to turn up; schools so neglected they often lack even water and electricity; and young lives put in jeopardy by the disintegration of what was once one of Latin America\u2019s better public schooling systems. \u201cWe\u2019re in the subsoil. It\u2019s a total catastrophe,\u201d said Olga Ramos, an expert and campaigner from the Venezuelan Education Observatory project. Ramos charted the roots of the crisis back well before the current economic slump began in 2013 and said the relentless politicization of Venezuela\u2019s education ministry during Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Bolivarian revolution had entrusted schooling to sycophants not specialists. But the unraveling that has played out in the last six years \u2013 since the 2014 collapse in global oil prices devastated Venezuela\u2019s economy \u2013 has proved a knockout blow. Activists claim as many as 120,000 teachers have left the profession in recent years, after hyperinflation rendered their salaries almost worthless. Doris Guzm\u00e1n, a teachers\u2019 union leader in Bol\u00edvar state, where El Palmar is located, said many teachers found it more profitable to work as buhoneros (street hawkers) than give class. Others are joining a gold rush currently gripping Bol\u00edvar or a historic exodus that has already robbed Venezuela of more than 4 million of its citizens. Guzm\u00e1n said those who remained faced a daily battle for survival; spending hours waiting for public transport to get to class; selling clothes at flea markets known as peroleros in order to eat. \u201cI get paid 249,000 bol\u00edvares [less than $4] per fortnight. It\u2019s nothing,\u201d she complained, noting that was about the same price as a kilo of meat. \u201cWe literally do not have shoes \u2013 and I include myself in this,\u201d added Guzm\u00e1n, 56, pointing to her scruffy sandals. Recently Guzm\u00e1n suffered a finger infection while cooking and was forced to sell her clothes in order to buy the antibiotics to treat it. \u201cIt\u2019s madness,\u201d she said. \u201cComplete madness.\u201d Venezuela\u2019s socialist government denies its schools are in crisis. \u201cVenezuela remains a reference point [in education],\u201d the education minister, Arist\u00f3bulo Ist\u00fariz, claimed last month, hitting out at what he called a foreign plot to \u201cdestroy\u201d the Bolivarian revolution\u2019s social achievements. In El Palmar parents are unimpressed by such claims, and on a recent morning their fury boiled over in the quadrangle at the heart of the Jos\u00e9 Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Afanador school. An emergency meeting - nominally called to discuss how parents might help pay for new tables and chairs \u2013 turned into a full-blown mutiny. Inside her dingy office, the political director, Benavides, tried to rebuff criticisms that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s Socialist party was to blame for the school\u2019s decrepitude. In fact, she suggested parents should shoulder some of the blame. \u201cWe all share responsibility for this situation \u2026 If this community felt the school was part of it, it would take care of it,\u201d Benavides said. \u201cI\u2019m totally optimistic,\u201d she said, before allowing that \u2013 since the school had no resources \u2013 ending its two-year-old seating crisis would be a mid- to long-term project. Such explanations failed to placate the parents. Pedro Garc\u00eda Bol\u00edvar, an evangelical preacher whose teenage daughter studies at the school, took to the stage to demand its closure. \u201cIt\u2019s the only solution,\u201d he bellowed, denouncing the school\u2019s \u201cshameful\u201d slide into disrepair and the mistreatment of its underpaid staff. \u201cWe don\u2019t have teachers here, we have slaves,\u201d Garc\u00eda fumed, declaring the school \u201ca time bomb\u201d about to explode. Benavides emerged from her office to insist parents had no right to shutter the school. \u201cThe only person authorized to close an institution is the Ministry of Popular Power for Education,\u201d she declared to snorts of derision. But Benavides was shouted down by Silvia M\u00e1rquez, the school\u2019s feisty parents\u2019 representative. \u201cWe\u2019re going to close this place so the ministry comes here!\u201d proclaimed M\u00e1rquez, 37, to loud cheers and applause. \u201cWe\u2019re sick to the back teeth,\u201d M\u00e1rquez added waving her arms in the air furiously. Benavides looked deflated and the parental insurgency prevailed. Minutes later they left the school\u2019s ramshackle campus and set off to continue their rebellion outside the town hall, shouting slogans as they marched through El Palmar\u2019s potholed streets. Behind them they left a school in ruins and a country\u2019s future in doubt.",

      "body": "<p>Just over three years ago, I walked into a house in Beverly Hills to meet a man I\u2019d wanted to interview for more than a decade. I am the inverse of ageist when it comes to dream interviewees: the older the better, in my book, because older people have more to say, and better stories. So I was especially excited because it\u2019s hard to find older than Kirk Douglas was then: a nice, round 100 years. We chatted for about 45 minutes, at which point he got tired and I left. Afterwards, I texted a friend to tell her about my brief brush with Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age. She replied immediately: \u201cDid you ask him if he raped Natalie Wood?\u201d</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t, for reasons I\u2019ll get to.

But these were followed swiftly \u2013 more swiftly than I\u2019d ever seen before \u2013 by the defiant rebels, insisting we would be failing humanity if we didn\u2019t acknowledge that Douglas was \u201ca rapist\u201d. Anyone who objected was, they claimed, clutching their pearls over logistical niceties. \u201cToo soon?\u201d was a typical tweet, above a photo of Wood.</p> <p>This question, of how quickly a person\u2019s problematic past can be mentioned after death arose just the week before, when the basketball star Kobe Bryant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/kobe-bryant-obituary\" title=\"\">died in a helicopter crash</a>, with his teenage daughter and seven others. A Washington Post reporter, Felicia Sonmez, posted a link to an article about the 2003 case in which Bryant was charged with sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman. He ended up settling and made a non-apology apology, saying he was sorry but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-rape-case.html\" title=\"\">he had thought the sex was consensual</a>.

Even though the New York Times\u2019 coverage of Bryant\u2019s death included a reference to the case, the Washington Post\u2019s executive editor told Sonmez her decision to tweet about it \u201cwas hurting this institution\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/felicia-sonmez-affair-was-not-journalism-finest-hour\" title=\"\">she was suspended</a>.

He was probably being unduly melodramatic but, if the Uefa verdict delivered on Friday stands up to the inevitable appeal, he now has only the one chance.</p> <p>Ban or no ban, Guardiola is unlikely to be in charge of City in 2023. His present contract runs out at the end of next season and at that point he will already have stayed longer at the club than at any of his previous managerial engagements. Should City have to endure two seasons in the European wilderness there will not be much point having Guardiola around anyway. He was brought in specifically for his Champions League expertise and, having won a domestic treble last season and set a points record in winning the Premier League the season before, there is little more he can do to impress on the home front.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/14/premier-leagues-fifth-place-in-line-for-champions-league-spot-after-manchester-city-ban\">Premier League's fifth place in line for Champions League spot after City ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given City\u2019s record of underachievement in Europe \u2013 Guardiola has admitted on several occasions it is the one area in which the club need to improve \u2013 they will do well to make it through the first round of the knockout stage starting this week. City play a week later but they have been drawn against Real Madrid in the round of 16.</p> <p>Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side are perhaps not quite the force they were since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo but they are the most successful European Cup side in history, won three successive Champions Leagues between 2016 and 2018 and sit on top of La Liga. Even if they are slightly past their best, they are packed with the sort of winning experience that City so patently lack, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool found out to their cost in the 2018 final</a>. As a former Champions League winner as a player and a coach of Barcelona, the City manager knows the value of that experience.</p> <p>Guardiola\u2019s present club have never been to a Champions League final, let alone won one, and whenever they have fallen short in recent seasons their manager has cited a lack of winning know-how as a contributory factor.</p> <p>If this is to be City\u2019s last European campaign with Guardiola at the helm, the scrutiny when the Catalan independence sympathiser meets the Castilians of Real Madrid is bound to be intense, and not just in Spain.</p> <p>There will also be much revisiting of City\u2019s European failures over the past three seasons. In their first Champions League campaign under Guardiola they were put out by Monaco over two ludicrously high-scoring legs. Those who accuse the manager of being better at organising attack and midfield rather than defence were given plenty of ammunition as City took a 5-3 lead to the away leg and went out on away goals after a 3-1 defeat. The first game at the Etihad was far too open for most people\u2019s liking. Yet, though conceding three times at home was asking for trouble, City should still have been able to see out the game in Monaco with a two-goal advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The following year Guardiola and his players bumped into a resurgent Liverpool at the quarter-final stage. This was City\u2019s record-breaking season in the Premier League but Liverpool were like men on a mission on their way to the 2018 final and three goals in quick succession in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">first match at Anfield</a> put the tie beyond their reach.

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola was speculating only a few days ago that he might be sacked if he does not win the Champions League with Manchester City soon. He was probably being unduly melodramatic but, if the Uefa verdict delivered on Friday stands up to the inevitable appeal, he now has only the one chance. Ban or no ban, Guardiola is unlikely to be in charge of City in 2023. His present contract runs out at the end of next season and at that point he will already have stayed longer at the club than at any of his previous managerial engagements. Should City have to endure two seasons in the European wilderness there will not be much point having Guardiola around anyway. He was brought in specifically for his Champions League expertise and, having won a domestic treble last season and set a points record in winning the Premier League the season before, there is little more he can do to impress on the home front. Given City\u2019s record of underachievement in Europe \u2013 Guardiola has admitted on several occasions it is the one area in which the club need to improve \u2013 they will do well to make it through the first round of the knockout stage starting this week. City play a week later but they have been drawn against Real Madrid in the round of 16. Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side are perhaps not quite the force they were since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo but they are the most successful European Cup side in history, won three successive Champions Leagues between 2016 and 2018 and sit on top of La Liga. Even if they are slightly past their best, they are packed with the sort of winning experience that City so patently lack, as Liverpool found out to their cost in the 2018 final. As a former Champions League winner as a player and a coach of Barcelona, the City manager knows the value of that experience. Guardiola\u2019s present club have never been to a Champions League final, let alone won one, and whenever they have fallen short in recent seasons their manager has cited a lack of winning know-how as a contributory factor. If this is to be City\u2019s last European campaign with Guardiola at the helm, the scrutiny when the Catalan independence sympathiser meets the Castilians of Real Madrid is bound to be intense, and not just in Spain. There will also be much revisiting of City\u2019s European failures over the past three seasons. In their first Champions League campaign under Guardiola they were put out by Monaco over two ludicrously high-scoring legs. Those who accuse the manager of being better at organising attack and midfield rather than defence were given plenty of ammunition as City took a 5-3 lead to the away leg and went out on away goals after a 3-1 defeat. The first game at the Etihad was far too open for most people\u2019s liking. Yet, though conceding three times at home was asking for trouble, City should still have been able to see out the game in Monaco with a two-goal advantage. The following year Guardiola and his players bumped into a resurgent Liverpool at the quarter-final stage. This was City\u2019s record-breaking season in the Premier League but Liverpool were like men on a mission on their way to the 2018 final and three goals in quick succession in the first match at Anfield put the tie beyond their reach. If that could be considered unlucky \u2013 not many teams would have lived with Liverpool at the time and mighty Barcelona were humbled at Anfield a year later \u2013 what happened last season was even worse. Once again City met an English team en route to the final, though no one realised at the time that Tottenham would go so far. They probably would not have done but for a late VAR goal decision that went in their favour and left City no time to react. The dream was over once again before it had properly gained momentum and, if Guardiola was starting to believe fate was conspiring against him adding with City to his Champions League medal collection, at the time he would have had many sympathisers. People will have less sympathy now the club have been thrown out of the competition, even if the irregularities that led to a \u20ac30m fine and two-season suspension were nothing to do with Guardiola. The manager has always said he would accept any Uefa ruling and just get on with his job, though that was when City were going relatively well in the Premier League. Now they are 22 points behind Liverpool, an embarrassing fall-off given the standards set in the past couple of seasons, with nothing to play for. Guardiola said last week that it was still a matter of pride for the club to finish second in the table to ensure automatic Champions League qualification for next season but, if there is not going to be any Champions League next season, there is even less incentive to keep going than there is at the moment. All that Guardiola and his players can do, assuming the punishment is upheld, is try to make the most of this season in Europe. Guardiola trying to progress at the expense of Real Madrid was always going to be big news \u2013 now it is enormous. And even if City survive that, there might be another English opponent lying in wait in the quarter-finals.",

      "body": "<p>According to Pinterest, \u201cvegan lipstick\u201d was among the most searched-for beauty terms in 2019. User searches for lip colours with no lanolin, beeswax or carmine (the crimson pigment, used in food, paint, cosmetics and more, that\u2019s traditionally obtained by crushing minuscule insects), and that are not sold in mainland China (where animal testing is broadly mandatory), were up 150% year-on-year. It\u2019s not a surprising figure, given the astronomical growth in vegan lifestyle. Accordingly, there are such a vast number of lipsticks for vegans that it\u2019s no longer a question of what are they, but which are the best.</p> <p>I always feel matte finishes are the truest measure of a lipstick brand, as they pose the biggest challenge \u2013 colour must be vivid and dense (any fool can make sheer tinted balm); lasting power should be long; lips should remain comfortable, not dry, rough and tight.</p> <p>In terms of colour saturation minus the busied bees and crushed beetles, it\u2019s hard to beat <strong><a href=\"https://www.smashbox.co.uk/product/6122/71567/lips/always-on-cream-to-matte-lipstick#/shade/Stepping_Out\" title=\"\">Smashbox\u2019s new Always On Cr</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.smashbox.co.uk/product/6122/71567/lips/always-on-cream-to-matte-lipstick#/shade/Stepping_Out\" title=\"\">eam to Matte Lipstick</a></strong> (<strong>3</strong>; \u00a319). The teardrop-shape bullet draws on colour sharply and precisely, and I found the colour (Fresca, a dirty mid-tone nude) remained unchanged all day, regardless of whether it had been applied over foundation or bare skin.

      "bodyText": "According to Pinterest, \u201cvegan lipstick\u201d was among the most searched-for beauty terms in 2019. User searches for lip colours with no lanolin, beeswax or carmine (the crimson pigment, used in food, paint, cosmetics and more, that\u2019s traditionally obtained by crushing minuscule insects), and that are not sold in mainland China (where animal testing is broadly mandatory), were up 150% year-on-year. It\u2019s not a surprising figure, given the astronomical growth in vegan lifestyle. Accordingly, there are such a vast number of lipsticks for vegans that it\u2019s no longer a question of what are they, but which are the best. I always feel matte finishes are the truest measure of a lipstick brand, as they pose the biggest challenge \u2013 colour must be vivid and dense (any fool can make sheer tinted balm); lasting power should be long; lips should remain comfortable, not dry, rough and tight. In terms of colour saturation minus the busied bees and crushed beetles, it\u2019s hard to beat Smashbox\u2019s new Always On Cream to Matte Lipstick (3; \u00a319). The teardrop-shape bullet draws on colour sharply and precisely, and I found the colour (Fresca, a dirty mid-tone nude) remained unchanged all day, regardless of whether it had been applied over foundation or bare skin. Natural oils make for an almost balmy creaminess rarely associated with mattes. My only gripe is that there\u2019s no tomatoey red in the lineup, which seems an unforgivable oversight. You\u2019re doubtless sick of my quacking on about e.l.f., so I shan\u2019t dwell, but this wholly vegan colour and skin brand is remarkably good and has helped me through myriad on-the-go beauty emergencies. Its Velvet Matte Lipstick (1; \u00a34.50), in an unsatisfactorily small range of colours, feels way more moisturising than many on the high street, and its only-a-whisper-shy-of-matte finish works in its favour, particularly if super-flat lipsticks feel too punchy a statement for work. The brand formerly known as Kat Von D has just bid its controversial founder farewell, but kept her vegan manifesto and rebranded as KVD Beauty. The offputtingly naff LA packaging looks set to go, with something more modern to take its place, and products may be renamed along with the brand. So if you\u2019re quick, the old incarnation of the excellent, comfy, almost-matte-but-not-quite Satin-Matte Cream Lipstick can be snagged at a clearance price (2; \u00a311.39 at Debenhams). If you don\u2019t get lucky, keep lips puckered and eyes peeled for the new rollout.",

She spent this morning at her Mayfair boutique overseeing the presentation of a new collection, and was thinking through the playing card strategy all the time. \u201cIt\u2019s given me a headache,\u201d she sighs.

But to do so would surely be to miss her point. Because for all her over-reach on the granular detail, Westwood grasps a truth that many others in the fashion industry and beyond fail to see. She gets that saving the planet is going to be about root-and-branch disruption, not making the odd tweak to schedules and shopping lists. For all her flamboyance and braggadocio, she has a clear-eyed view of the shape and size of the climate crisis.</p> \n<p>Westwood is an English rose, as delicate as she is doughty. Her pale skin seems to be lit from beneath, like a bone china teacup held up to the light. It\u2019s not that she looks young, more that there is something <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Puck-fictional-character\">Puck</a>-ishly ageless about her. She is spry and petite, wearing a check shirt in soft brushed cotton tucked neatly into nubbly woollen jogging bottoms in dusty pink, with thick orange socks and brown suede boots.</p> \n<p>The six-foot Austrian beefcake who strides across the room to take a seat next to her at the makeup table could not present more of a contrast. Andreas Kronthaler has olive skin, rakish salt and pepper curls, a lustrously Tyrolean accented voice. The two have been inseparable, in life and work, for over three decades. They met at art school in Vienna in 1988 \u2013 she was teaching fashion design, he was her star pupil \u2013 and married in 1993. Westwood was 52, divorced with two sons; Kronthaler was 27. After decades as a silent partner in the design studio, his creative role was recognised in 2016 when the high-end Gold Label line, which is shown at Paris fashion week, was renamed <a href=\"https://www.viviennewestwood.com/en/collections/ak-for-vivienne-westwood/ak-ss20-catwalk/\">Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dccf032ce6500e256313210debefdd5258b1599b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dccf032ce6500e256313210debefdd5258b1599b/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Andreas Kronthaler was Vivienne Westwood\u2019s star pupil at art school in Vienna, and has now been her partner for three decades\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andreas Kronthaler lies on a rug with a portrait of Vivienne Westwood on it.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Teller</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Over lunch, Westwood sits quietly, daintily eating tiny pieces of pizza with a knife and fork. Her hearing is not perfect these days and she finds it hard to follow conversation in noisy rooms. But half an hour later, hair and makeup done, laced into angular, teetering boots, she is in her element. Wearing a crown of straw and flowers \u2013 imagine a bird was let loose to make a nest in a very chic florist\u2019s \u2013 she smiles for Teller\u2019s camera, as sweet and tiny as a little girl lining up for her school portrait.</p> \n<p>It is perhaps worth noting that, for all her famed eccentricity, Westwood\u2019s label remains fully independent in an industry peppered with burnt-out talents and backfired business deals. Around 300 people are employed in Britain, many in the Battersea offices where I arrive the following morning to find Kronthaler, in a rainbow-striped sweater, breakfasting on pancakes and Nutella in the light-filled design studio on the top floor. His wife, who is to join us later, is for now two miles away, in the Queen Anne house in Clapham that once belonged to Captain Cook\u2019s mother and which has been the couple\u2019s home since 2000, when Kronthaler persuaded Westwood to move from the ex-council flat nearby where she had lived since the 70s, when she shared it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/malcolm-mclaren\">Malcolm McLaren</a>. The studio walls are covered with ideas for the forthcoming Paris show: a black and white photograph of a 20s showgirl, torso wrapped in furs, has been spliced with a clown in pantaloons. \u201cI\u2019m trying a few things. Who knows?!\u201d Kronthaler exclaims happily, with the abandon of a designer whose last show featured women in decorative codpieces and a five-foot sequined tuna worn as a hat. An assistant appears clutching swatches of lace in gold and black on which she urgently needs his opinion. She is working on a possible outfit for Beyonc\u00e9 to wear at the Oscars, he tells me. \u201cBut now I\u2019m gossiping.\u201d He grins. \u201cI must stop.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"203baad9f9735d38448576f6f7c41f0e1253518c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/203baad9f9735d38448576f6f7c41f0e1253518c/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Andreas Kronthaler and Vivienne Westwood\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I found a soulmate\u2019 \u2026 Andreas Kronthaler on the day he met Vivienne Westwood.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Teller</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Westwood has dressed punks, princesses and prime ministers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/siouxsieandthebanshees\">Siouxsie Sioux</a> wore Westwood T-shirts on stage with the Banshees, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/princess-eugenie\">Princess Eugenie</a> chose a Westwood dress for the 2011 royal wedding, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jan/18/feeling-rotten-the-meaning-of-theresa-mays-vivienne-westwood-suit\">Theresa May had a \u201clucky\u201d tartan Westwood trouser suit</a>.

Joining us in the studio \u2013 wearing a one-shouldered taupe knit dress layered over a fine-knit olive T-shirt, accessorised with a silk scarf at the throat and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\">Extinction Rebellion</a> badge \u2013 Westwood says she likes working with men (McLaren, and now Kronthaler) \u201cbecause men always want to put a woman on a pedestal\u201d. She loves a corset not just for the way it shapes the body, but because it is the best foundation piece on which to hang a truly imposing dress. \u201cYou can build something grand, if you start with a corset, because it holds up so much fabric. You can have a train that goes halfway down the catwalk, with a corset.\u201d Westwood not only revived the corset in the 80s, she reinvented it: she gave it a zip, so that a woman could get in and out herself, and elastic side panels \u201cso it pulls you in but you can still breathe, and you can do three sizes and it fits everyone\u201d. Kronthaler says he likes \u201cto form the body, but also to give it air. To fix it, but not too much. A corset can make small breasts look big and big breasts not so big. When you wear it, you can manipulate it how you like.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kronthaler says of the day he met Westwood, \u201cI found a soulmate. You go through life feeling isolated and alone, and then one day there is someone who says out loud all the things in your head. Suddenly I felt recognised. It was like bliss, pure bliss. Everything she liked, I liked. Everything she thought was interesting, I thought was interesting.\u201d After five years training as a goldsmith (\u201cI think I always wanted to do fashion, and where I grew up that was the nearest to it I could get\u201d), he had recently switched to the fashion course when Westwood arrived in Austria. \u201cShe asked me to help her on a project, and that was that.\u201d He arrived in a London slipping into recession, into an era of minimalism and grunge. \u201cEveryone wore flat shoes. The look was very unadored, you know?\u201d (I suspect the word he means is unadorned, but the slip of the tongue is more evocative.) Much of the couple\u2019s courtship was spent poring over the haute couture <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion\">dresses in the V&amp;A</a>, bonding over a shared passion for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dior\">Christian Dior</a>. (It is said Westwood would have liked the Dior job that went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/john-galliano\">John Galliano</a> in 1995.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b546e975a91dadef72890b039072ca85d60442f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b546e975a91dadef72890b039072ca85d60442f/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Andreas Kronthaler.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We already have enough clothes in the western world to last us for hundreds of years\u2019 \u2026 Andreas Kronthaler.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juergen Teller</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was Westwood\u2019s idea, four years ago, to change the name of her most high-end collection to reflect the de facto design primacy of Kronthaler, now that activism was her focus. \u201cReally we had an equal relationship right from the beginning, and I was perfectly happy when Vivienne was the figurehead,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I still struggle with it [having his name on the label] a little bit, because who cares about me? But maybe it has helped me grow up.\u201d He is happy to focus on fashion and leave broader issues to his wife. \u201cI might be\u2026 a bit more left, for sure\u201d is about as much detail as I can get out of him on his own politics. \u201cI found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> very strange, but I don\u2019t blame him, because who am I to blame\u2026\u201d He trails off, disappears momentarily and returns holding a box of chocolate-dipped orange slices which his assistant brought him from Naples, which are so distractingly delicious that he easily changes the subject to people he\u2019d like to dress: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett\">Cate Blanchett</a> (\u201cRavishing!\u201d) and \u201cthis very elegant man I saw on TV at the gym when I went to pilates the other day, what was he called, Stormy? He was at Glastonbury also. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\">Stormzy</a>! So tall. Such beautiful hands!\u201d</p> \n<p>Westwood, on the other hand, refuses to be deflected from politics on to fashion. She still oversees a separate collection, more accessibly priced than Kronthaler\u2019s, which is presented digitally during London fashion week, but she devotes most of her time to environmental causes. She parries and dodges my questions about her iconic shows, her career highlights, her place in fashion history and her take on the current scene like a politician on the Today programme. \u201cI\u2019ll come to that in a minute, but what I want to say is\u2026\u201d and so on. I ask her about <a href=\"https://blog.viviennewestwood.com/history/1981-1987/\">the Pirate collection of 1981</a> and she tells me about her friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/james-lovelock\">James Lovelock</a>\u2019s work on the coming age of superintelligence. I bring up her signature 18th-century silhouette and she launches into how the inequities of the global financial system are a cause of 21st-century terror. She does, however, still feel connected to her punk heritage, which is currently enjoying a renaissance as a new generation of designers rediscovers fashion\u2019s rebel spirit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci\">Riccardo Tisci</a>\u2019s first move on arriving at Burberry two years ago was to collaborate with Westwood on a collection that reimagined some of her most iconic pieces \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2013/nov/30/vivienne-westwood-sexpistols#img-12\">the platform boots that famously felled Naomi Campbell</a> \u2013 in Burberry check. \u201cPunk was a protest,\u201d Westwood says. \u201c[The clothes] said, \u2018We don\u2019t accept your taboos, we don\u2019t accept your hypocritical life.\u2019 I\u2019ve always been a rebel. I stopped traffic sometimes. I remember one time I was on the zebra crossing in front of the shop on Kings Road, in a rubber negligee with my hair all in spikes, and a man said to me \u2013 you won\u2019t believe this \u2013 he said to me, \u2018Does your bush look like that?\u2019\u201d Always one to relish shock value, she looks positively gleeful. \u201cVivienne,\u201d chimes in Kronthaler from across the table, \u201cpeople still look at you, wherever we go.\u201d</p> \n<p>Squaring environmental activism with the business of selling fashion is problematic when, as Kronthaler himself says, \u201cWe already have enough clothes in the western world to last us for hundreds of years.\u201d Westwood company policy is to downsize production \u2013 all collections are now 50% smaller than three years ago \u2013 and sell at a price point that encourages Westwood\u2019s mantra of choose well, buy less, make it last. \u201cI don\u2019t let my company print T-shirts any more unless they guarantee they can sell them for \u00a3100 or more. Cotton is a luxury product [because of its environmental footprint] and we can\u2019t keep exploiting it.\u201d Westwood is old enough to remember a culture far less in thrall to consumerism. In her Glossop girlhood \u2013 she was born in 1941 \u2013 the churn of disposable purchases was not yet normal, the craft of making clothes yourself not yet unusual. \u201cWe need to get back to having fewer things, and treasuring what we have. That\u2019s why I defend high fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cBut of course, we need a fair distribution of wealth\u2026\u201d and she\u2019s off again. Kronthaler has picked up a pencil and quietly begun to sketch. Paris fashion week is only a few weeks away, after all. But Vivienne Westwood has designs on a whole different kind of future.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Read more from the spring/summer 2020 edition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/series/the-fashion-spring-summer-2020\">The Fashion</a>, our biannual fashion supplement</p>",

Her pale skin seems to be lit from beneath, like a bone china teacup held up to the light. It\u2019s not that she looks young, more that there is something Puck-ishly ageless about her. She is spry and petite, wearing a check shirt in soft brushed cotton tucked neatly into nubbly woollen jogging bottoms in dusty pink, with thick orange socks and brown suede boots. The six-foot Austrian beefcake who strides across the room to take a seat next to her at the makeup table could not present more of a contrast. Andreas Kronthaler has olive skin, rakish salt and pepper curls, a lustrously Tyrolean accented voice. The two have been inseparable, in life and work, for over three decades. They met at art school in Vienna in 1988 \u2013 she was teaching fashion design, he was her star pupil \u2013 and married in 1993. Westwood was 52, divorced with two sons; Kronthaler was 27. After decades as a silent partner in the design studio, his creative role was recognised in 2016 when the high-end Gold Label line, which is shown at Paris fashion week, was renamed Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood. Over lunch, Westwood sits quietly, daintily eating tiny pieces of pizza with a knife and fork. Her hearing is not perfect these days and she finds it hard to follow conversation in noisy rooms. But half an hour later, hair and makeup done, laced into angular, teetering boots, she is in her element. Wearing a crown of straw and flowers \u2013 imagine a bird was let loose to make a nest in a very chic florist\u2019s \u2013 she smiles for Teller\u2019s camera, as sweet and tiny as a little girl lining up for her school portrait. It is perhaps worth noting that, for all her famed eccentricity, Westwood\u2019s label remains fully independent in an industry peppered with burnt-out talents and backfired business deals. Around 300 people are employed in Britain, many in the Battersea offices where I arrive the following morning to find Kronthaler, in a rainbow-striped sweater, breakfasting on pancakes and Nutella in the light-filled design studio on the top floor. His wife, who is to join us later, is for now two miles away, in the Queen Anne house in Clapham that once belonged to Captain Cook\u2019s mother and which has been the couple\u2019s home since 2000, when Kronthaler persuaded Westwood to move from the ex-council flat nearby where she had lived since the 70s, when she shared it with Malcolm McLaren. The studio walls are covered with ideas for the forthcoming Paris show: a black and white photograph of a 20s showgirl, torso wrapped in furs, has been spliced with a clown in pantaloons. \u201cI\u2019m trying a few things. Who knows?!\u201d Kronthaler exclaims happily, with the abandon of a designer whose last show featured women in decorative codpieces and a five-foot sequined tuna worn as a hat. An assistant appears clutching swatches of lace in gold and black on which she urgently needs his opinion. She is working on a possible outfit for Beyonc\u00e9 to wear at the Oscars, he tells me. \u201cBut now I\u2019m gossiping.\u201d He grins. \u201cI must stop.\u201d Westwood has dressed punks, princesses and prime ministers. Siouxsie Sioux wore Westwood T-shirts on stage with the Banshees, Princess Eugenie chose a Westwood dress for the 2011 royal wedding, Theresa May had a \u201clucky\u201d tartan Westwood trouser suit. Her dresses are especially beloved by women with breasts and bottoms: Nigella Lawson, Helena Bonham Carter, Daisy Lowe and Christina Hendricks are all fans. Joining us in the studio \u2013 wearing a one-shouldered taupe knit dress layered over a fine-knit olive T-shirt, accessorised with a silk scarf at the throat and an Extinction Rebellion badge \u2013 Westwood says she likes working with men (McLaren, and now Kronthaler) \u201cbecause men always want to put a woman on a pedestal\u201d. She loves a corset not just for the way it shapes the body, but because it is the best foundation piece on which to hang a truly imposing dress. \u201cYou can build something grand, if you start with a corset, because it holds up so much fabric. You can have a train that goes halfway down the catwalk, with a corset.\u201d Westwood not only revived the corset in the 80s, she reinvented it: she gave it a zip, so that a woman could get in and out herself, and elastic side panels \u201cso it pulls you in but you can still breathe, and you can do three sizes and it fits everyone\u201d. Kronthaler says he likes \u201cto form the body, but also to give it air. To fix it, but not too much. A corset can make small breasts look big and big breasts not so big. When you wear it, you can manipulate it how you like.\u201d Kronthaler says of the day he met Westwood, \u201cI found a soulmate. You go through life feeling isolated and alone, and then one day there is someone who says out loud all the things in your head. Suddenly I felt recognised. It was like bliss, pure bliss. Everything she liked, I liked. Everything she thought was interesting, I thought was interesting.\u201d After five years training as a goldsmith (\u201cI think I always wanted to do fashion, and where I grew up that was the nearest to it I could get\u201d), he had recently switched to the fashion course when Westwood arrived in Austria. \u201cShe asked me to help her on a project, and that was that.\u201d He arrived in a London slipping into recession, into an era of minimalism and grunge. \u201cEveryone wore flat shoes. The look was very unadored, you know?\u201d (I suspect the word he means is unadorned, but the slip of the tongue is more evocative.) Much of the couple\u2019s courtship was spent poring over the haute couture dresses in the V&amp;A, bonding over a shared passion for Christian Dior. (It is said Westwood would have liked the Dior job that went to John Galliano in 1995.) It was Westwood\u2019s idea, four years ago, to change the name of her most high-end collection to reflect the de facto design primacy of Kronthaler, now that activism was her focus. \u201cReally we had an equal relationship right from the beginning, and I was perfectly happy when Vivienne was the figurehead,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I still struggle with it [having his name on the label] a little bit, because who cares about me? But maybe it has helped me grow up.\u201d He is happy to focus on fashion and leave broader issues to his wife. \u201cI might be\u2026 a bit more left, for sure\u201d is about as much detail as I can get out of him on his own politics. \u201cI found Jeremy Corbyn very strange, but I don\u2019t blame him, because who am I to blame\u2026\u201d He trails off, disappears momentarily and returns holding a box of chocolate-dipped orange slices which his assistant brought him from Naples, which are so distractingly delicious that he easily changes the subject to people he\u2019d like to dress: Cate Blanchett (\u201cRavishing!\u201d) and \u201cthis very elegant man I saw on TV at the gym when I went to pilates the other day, what was he called, Stormy? He was at Glastonbury also. Stormzy! So tall. Such beautiful hands!\u201d Westwood, on the other hand, refuses to be deflected from politics on to fashion. She still oversees a separate collection, more accessibly priced than Kronthaler\u2019s, which is presented digitally during London fashion week, but she devotes most of her time to environmental causes. She parries and dodges my questions about her iconic shows, her career highlights, her place in fashion history and her take on the current scene like a politician on the Today programme. \u201cI\u2019ll come to that in a minute, but what I want to say is\u2026\u201d and so on. I ask her about the Pirate collection of 1981 and she tells me about her friend James Lovelock\u2019s work on the coming age of superintelligence. I bring up her signature 18th-century silhouette and she launches into how the inequities of the global financial system are a cause of 21st-century terror. She does, however, still feel connected to her punk heritage, which is currently enjoying a renaissance as a new generation of designers rediscovers fashion\u2019s rebel spirit. Riccardo Tisci\u2019s first move on arriving at Burberry two years ago was to collaborate with Westwood on a collection that reimagined some of her most iconic pieces \u2013 including the platform boots that famously felled Naomi Campbell \u2013 in Burberry check. \u201cPunk was a protest,\u201d Westwood says. \u201c[The clothes] said, \u2018We don\u2019t accept your taboos, we don\u2019t accept your hypocritical life.\u2019 I\u2019ve always been a rebel. I stopped traffic sometimes. I remember one time I was on the zebra crossing in front of the shop on Kings Road, in a rubber negligee with my hair all in spikes, and a man said to me \u2013 you won\u2019t believe this \u2013 he said to me, \u2018Does your bush look like that?\u2019\u201d Always one to relish shock value, she looks positively gleeful. \u201cVivienne,\u201d chimes in Kronthaler from across the table, \u201cpeople still look at you, wherever we go.\u201d Squaring environmental activism with the business of selling fashion is problematic when, as Kronthaler himself says, \u201cWe already have enough clothes in the western world to last us for hundreds of years.\u201d Westwood company policy is to downsize production \u2013 all collections are now 50% smaller than three years ago \u2013 and sell at a price point that encourages Westwood\u2019s mantra of choose well, buy less, make it last. \u201cI don\u2019t let my company print T-shirts any more unless they guarantee they can sell them for \u00a3100 or more. Cotton is a luxury product [because of its environmental footprint] and we can\u2019t keep exploiting it.\u201d Westwood is old enough to remember a culture far less in thrall to consumerism. In her Glossop girlhood \u2013 she was born in 1941 \u2013 the churn of disposable purchases was not yet normal, the craft of making clothes yourself not yet unusual. \u201cWe need to get back to having fewer things, and treasuring what we have. That\u2019s why I defend high fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cBut of course, we need a fair distribution of wealth\u2026\u201d and she\u2019s off again. Kronthaler has picked up a pencil and quietly begun to sketch. Paris fashion week is only a few weeks away, after all. But Vivienne Westwood has designs on a whole different kind of future. \u2022 Read more from the spring/summer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual fashion supplement",

      "body": "<p>Difficult. It\u2019s a word that rests on a knife-edge: when applied to a woman, it can be admiring, fearful, insulting and dismissive, all at once. In 2016, it was used of Theresa May (she was \u201ca bloody difficult woman,\u201d Ken Clarke said, when she ran for Tory leader). A year later, it gave the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\" title=\"\">US author Roxane Gay</a> the title for her short story collection.

I\u2019m not talking about being rude, thoughtless, obnoxious or a diva. First of all, difficult means complicated. A thumbs-up, thumbs-down approach to historical figures is boring and reductive. Most of us are more than one thing; no one is pure; everyone is \u201cproblematic\u201d. Look back at early feminists and you will find women with views that are unpalatable to their modern sisters. You will find women with views that were unpalatable to their contemporaries. They were awkward and wrong-headed and obstinate and sometimes downright odd \u2013 and that helped them to defy the expectations placed on them. \u201cThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself,\u201d wrote George Bernard Shaw in 1903. \u201cTherefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\u201d (Or, as I always catch myself adding, the unreasonable woman.) A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/29/fourth-wave-feminism-play-top-girls-feminism\" title=\"\">history of feminism</a> should not try to sand off the sharp corners of the movement\u2019s pioneers \u2013 or write them out of the story entirely, if their sins are deemed too great. It must allow them to be just as flawed \u2013 just as human \u2013 as men. Women are people, and people are more interesting than cliches. We don\u2019t have to be perfect to deserve equal rights.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In the name of inspiring little girls living in a male-dominated world, Rebel Girls doesn't so much airbrush Coco Chanel's story as sandblast it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/08/whoneedsrolemodels\" title=\"\">idea of role models</a> is not necessarily a bad one, but the way they are used in feminism can dilute a radical political movement into feelgood inspiration porn. Holding up a few exceptions is no substitute for questioning the rules themselves, and in our rush to champion historical women, we are distorting the past. Take the wildly successful children\u2019s book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-review-inspiring-stuff-elena-favilli-francesca-callo\" title=\"\">Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls</a></em>, which has sold more than a million copies. It tells 100 \u201cempowering, moving and inspirational\u201d stories, promising that \u201cthese are true fairytales for heroines who definitely don\u2019t need rescuing\u201d. Its entry for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/feb/24/top-10-amazing-facts-you-didnt-know-about-coco-chanel\" title=\"\">fashion designer Coco Chanel</a> mentions that she wanted to start a business, and a \u201cwealthy friend of hers lent her enough money to make her dream come true\u201d. It does not mention that Chanel was the lover of a Nazi officer and very probably a spy for Hitler\u2019s Germany. In the 1930s, she tried to remove that \u201cwealthy friend\u201d from the company under racist laws that forbade Jews to own businesses. In the name of inspiring little girls living in a male-dominated world, the book doesn\u2019t so much airbrush Chanel\u2019s story as sandblast it. Do you find her wartime collaboration with the Nazis \u201cempowering\u201d? I don\u2019t, although admittedly she does sound like a woman who \u201cdidn\u2019t need rescuing\u201d. The real Coco Chanel was clever, prejudiced, talented, cynical \u2013 and interesting. The pale version of her boiled down to a feminist saint is not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c74bd6df831360dbbfcdd6585ff480c7885ef1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c74bd6df831360dbbfcdd6585ff480c7885ef1f/0_0_3229_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The real Coco Chanel was clever, prejudiced, talented, cynical \u2013 and interesting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"991\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The real Coco Chanel was clever, prejudiced, talented, cynical \u2013 and interesting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Granger/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I can excuse that approach in a children\u2019s book, but it\u2019s alarming to see the same urge in adults. We cannot celebrate women\u2019s history by stripping politics \u2013 and therefore conflict \u2013 from the narrative. Unfurl the bunting, and don\u2019t ask too many questions! It creates a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/11/how-metoo-revealed-the-central-rift-within-feminism-social-individualist\" title=\"\">story of feminism</a> where all the opponents are either cartoon baddies or mysteriously absent, where no hard compromises have to be made and internal disagreements are kicked under the carpet. The One True Way is obvious, and all Good People follow it. Feminists are on the right side of history, and we just have to wait for the world to catch up.</p> <p>Life does not work like that. It would be much easier if feminist triumphs relied on defeating a few bogeymen, but grotesque sexists such as Donald Trump only have power because otherwise decent people voted for them. There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/06/1910s-suffragettes-suffragists-fern-riddell\" title=\"\">women who opposed female suffrage</a>; women are the biggest consumers of magazines and websites that point out other women\u2019s physical flaws; there is no gender gap among supporters of abortion rights. People are complicated, and making progress is complicated too. If modern feminism feels toothless, it is because it has retreated into two modes: empty celebration or shadow-boxing with outright bastards. Neither deals with difficulty, and so neither can make a difference.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mothers struggled to understand why their daughters were desperate to have a big wedding and wear high heels</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Women\u2019s history should not be a shallow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/14/gender.uk\" title=\"\">hunt for heroines</a>.

My crime was to say that his confirmation hearings had been turned into a media circus \u2013 and that even those accused of sexual assault deserved better. The criticism reflects a desperate desire to pretend that thorny issues are straightforward. No more flawed humans struggling inside vast, complicated systems: there are good guys and bad guys, and it\u2019s easy to tell them apart. We must restore the complexity to feminist pioneers. Their legacies might be contested, they might have made terrible strategic choices and they might have not have lived according to the ideals they preached. But they mattered.

A feminist, she said, is someone who believes in \u201cthe social, economic and political equality of the sexes\u201d. That sounds straightforward, but feminism is endlessly difficult. The last 10 years have been praised for \u201cchanging the culture\u201d, but led only to a few concrete victories. The #MeToo movement turned into a conversation about borderline cases and has not led to any substantial legal reforms. Abortion rights came under threat in eastern Europe and the southern United States. Gang-rape cases convulsed India and Spain. Free universal childcare was as much a dream as it had been in the 1970s. And the backlash has been brutal.

It is revolutionary, challenging the most fundamental structures of our society. It is deeply personal, illuminating our most intimate experiences and personal relationships. It rejects the division between the public and private spheres. It gets everywhere, from boardrooms to bedrooms. It leaves no part of our lives untouched. It is both theory and practice.</p> <p>And there is another problem, unique to feminism. It is a movement run by women, for women. And what do we expect from women? Perfection. Selflessness. Care. Girls are instructed to be \u201cladylike\u201d to keep them quiet and docile. Motherhood is championed as a journey of endless self-sacrifice. Random men tell us to \u201ccheer up\u201d in the street, because God forbid our own emotions should impinge on anyone else\u2019s day. If we raise our voices, we are \u201cshrill\u201d. Our ambition is suspicious. Our anger is portrayed as unnatural, horrifying, disfiguring: who needs to listen to the \u201cnag\u201d, the \u201chysteric\u201d or the \u201cangry black woman\u201d?</p> <p>All this is extremely unhelpful if you want to go out and cause trouble \u2013 the kind of trouble that leads to legal and cultural change. We pick apart feminism to see its failings, as if to reassure ourselves that women aren\u2019t getting above their station. We describe women who challenge authority or seek power as unladylike, talkative, insistent, self-obsessed. We accuse them of \u201cputting themselves forward\u201d. The critic Emily Nussbaum nailed the problem: \u201cWhen you\u2019re put on a pedestal, the whole world gets to upskirt you.\u201d</p> <p>For that reason, feminism has a particular duty to fight \u201cthe tyranny of niceness\u201d \u2013 which is, and has always been, one of the most potent forces holding women back. Feminism is not a self-help movement, dedicated to making everyone feel better about their lives. It is a radical demand to overturn the status quo. It sometimes has to cause upset. \u201cI cannot personally think of any widespread injustice that has been remedied by plodding worthily down the middle of the road, smiling and smiling,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/dec/07/jill-tweedie-on-promiscuity\" title=\"\">Jill Tweedie</a> in 1971. \u201cIf you are sure of the justice of your cause it must be better to have people thinking of it with initial anger than not thinking at all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"609ab257ae0a09238f845b432b5c1c9b8a0fbfbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/609ab257ae0a09238f845b432b5c1c9b8a0fbfbc/0_0_3474_2676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picket23rd August 1977: Treasurer of the Grunwick strike committee Mrs Jayaben Desai, she has been picketing for a year.

Some young activists saw the older generation as conservatives, wedded to fixed ideas of what men and women could be, whereas they felt gender was much more fluid and playful. Their mothers were equally bemused. They had tried to smash beauty standards and restrictive ideas about the nuclear family. They struggled to understand why their daughters were so desperate to have a big wedding, wear high heels, pore over Facetuned selfies. Feminism can, and must, contain all these contradictions, the differing priorities of difficult women. But one thing should unite us: we should still try to turn our outrage into political power. The fourth wave was beautifully noisy and attention-grabbing, but now we need concrete victories that will last in a way hashtag campaigns cannot. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/16/metoo-women-daughters-harassment-powerful-men\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement is a dead end</a> without structural change, such as ensuring full and free access to employment tribunals.</p> <p>The fifth wave, if there is to be one, should look again at the seven demands of the first <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/sisterhood/articles/womens-liberation-a-national-movement\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Liberation Movement </a><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/sisterhood/articles/womens-liberation-a-national-movement\" title=\"\">conference</a>, in Oxford 50 years ago this month. Equal pay. Equal educational and job opportunities. Free contraception and abortion on demand. Free 24-hour childcare. Legal and financial independence for all women. The right to a self-defined sexuality. Freedom from intimidation and violence. These are a reminder of how long the struggle has been \u2013 Northern Ireland only gained abortion rights last year \u2013 and how much there is left to do. Women are legally entitled to be paid the same as men, but as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/12/bbc-samira-ahmed-broadcaster-staff-tribunal\" title=\"\">Samira Ahmed\u2019s case against the BBC</a> showed, laws are worthless if they are not enforced. Single parents (who are overwhelmingly female) still face a high risk of poverty. Lesbians are still attacked for saying \u201cno\u201d to the Great Almighty Penis. Social media and smartphones have created new expressions of misogyny, such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/22/theres-no-end-and-no-escape-you-feel-so-so-exposed-life-as-a-victim-of-revenge-porn\" title=\"\">revenge porn</a>\u201d, which rely on the same old mechanisms of intimidation and shame.</p> <p>You might notice that I haven\u2019t said much about some of the hardy perennials of feminist commentary: leg-shaving, bra-burning, pube-waxing. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t care about them or haven\u2019t thought about them. I don\u2019t wear high heels (can\u2019t walk in them, and object to the principle of a shoe that makes your feet less comfortable). I didn\u2019t take my husband\u2019s surname. I don\u2019t watch pornography. I\u2019m 100% pro\u2011bra as I have a cup size that requires serious cantilevering. I shave my legs because my socialised disgust with female body hair runs so deep that I couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything else if I had furry calves. But all of these are ultimately personal decisions, rather than collective actions. And since we live in a deeply individualist society, debates over women\u2019s choices on these topics will never struggle to get airtime. My most hated headline format \u2013 \u201cCan you be a feminist and \u2026 \u201d \u2013 will never, ever die. In this climate, the most radical thing we can do is resist treating everything as a personal choice, and resist turning feminism into a referendum on those choices. Let\u2019s swim against the tide by talking instead about what we can do together.</p> <p>Change requires us to put aside our egos, and our differences, and focus on our shared goals. The suffragettes saw themselves as an army. Jayaben Desai did not go on strike alone. Erin Pizzey and her \u201cbattered wives\u201d made sure the government could not ignore them, by staging a sit-in at Downing Street. Feminism will never be free of infighting, of personality clashes and contests over priorities. It will never be perfect, or nice.

      "bodyText": "Difficult. It\u2019s a word that rests on a knife-edge: when applied to a woman, it can be admiring, fearful, insulting and dismissive, all at once. In 2016, it was used of Theresa May (she was \u201ca bloody difficult woman,\u201d Ken Clarke said, when she ran for Tory leader). A year later, it gave the US author Roxane Gay the title for her short story collection. The late Elizabeth Wurtzel took \u201cin praise of difficult women\u201d as the strapline for her feminist manifesto in 1998. The book\u2019s main title was, simply, Bitch. The word is particularly pointed since it recurs so often when women talk about the consequences of challenging sexism. The TV presenter Helen Skelton once described being groped on air by an interviewee while pregnant. She did not complain, she said, because \u201cthat\u2019s just the culture that television breeds. No one wants to be difficult.\u201d The actor Jennifer Lawrence told the Hollywood Reporter that she had once stood up to a rude director. The reaction to the incident left her worried that she would be punished by the industry. \u201cYeah,\u201d chipped in fellow actor Emma Stone: \u201cYou were \u2018difficult\u2019.\u201d All this is edging towards the same idea, an idea that is imprinted on us from birth: that women are called unreasonable, selfish and unfeminine when they stand up for themselves. \u201cI myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is,\u201d wrote Rebecca West in 1913. \u201cI only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute.\u201d So what does it mean to be a difficult woman? I\u2019m not talking about being rude, thoughtless, obnoxious or a diva. First of all, difficult means complicated. A thumbs-up, thumbs-down approach to historical figures is boring and reductive. Most of us are more than one thing; no one is pure; everyone is \u201cproblematic\u201d. Look back at early feminists and you will find women with views that are unpalatable to their modern sisters. You will find women with views that were unpalatable to their contemporaries. They were awkward and wrong-headed and obstinate and sometimes downright odd \u2013 and that helped them to defy the expectations placed on them. \u201cThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself,\u201d wrote George Bernard Shaw in 1903. \u201cTherefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\u201d (Or, as I always catch myself adding, the unreasonable woman.) A history of feminism should not try to sand off the sharp corners of the movement\u2019s pioneers \u2013 or write them out of the story entirely, if their sins are deemed too great. It must allow them to be just as flawed \u2013 just as human \u2013 as men. Women are people, and people are more interesting than cliches. We don\u2019t have to be perfect to deserve equal rights. The idea of role models is not necessarily a bad one, but the way they are used in feminism can dilute a radical political movement into feelgood inspiration porn. Holding up a few exceptions is no substitute for questioning the rules themselves, and in our rush to champion historical women, we are distorting the past. Take the wildly successful children\u2019s book Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, which has sold more than a million copies. It tells 100 \u201cempowering, moving and inspirational\u201d stories, promising that \u201cthese are true fairytales for heroines who definitely don\u2019t need rescuing\u201d. Its entry for the fashion designer Coco Chanel mentions that she wanted to start a business, and a \u201cwealthy friend of hers lent her enough money to make her dream come true\u201d. It does not mention that Chanel was the lover of a Nazi officer and very probably a spy for Hitler\u2019s Germany. In the 1930s, she tried to remove that \u201cwealthy friend\u201d from the company under racist laws that forbade Jews to own businesses. In the name of inspiring little girls living in a male-dominated world, the book doesn\u2019t so much airbrush Chanel\u2019s story as sandblast it. Do you find her wartime collaboration with the Nazis \u201cempowering\u201d? I don\u2019t, although admittedly she does sound like a woman who \u201cdidn\u2019t need rescuing\u201d. The real Coco Chanel was clever, prejudiced, talented, cynical \u2013 and interesting. The pale version of her boiled down to a feminist saint is not. I can excuse that approach in a children\u2019s book, but it\u2019s alarming to see the same urge in adults. We cannot celebrate women\u2019s history by stripping politics \u2013 and therefore conflict \u2013 from the narrative. Unfurl the bunting, and don\u2019t ask too many questions! It creates a story of feminism where all the opponents are either cartoon baddies or mysteriously absent, where no hard compromises have to be made and internal disagreements are kicked under the carpet. The One True Way is obvious, and all Good People follow it. Feminists are on the right side of history, and we just have to wait for the world to catch up. Life does not work like that. It would be much easier if feminist triumphs relied on defeating a few bogeymen, but grotesque sexists such as Donald Trump only have power because otherwise decent people voted for them. There were women who opposed female suffrage; women are the biggest consumers of magazines and websites that point out other women\u2019s physical flaws; there is no gender gap among supporters of abortion rights. People are complicated, and making progress is complicated too. If modern feminism feels toothless, it is because it has retreated into two modes: empty celebration or shadow-boxing with outright bastards. Neither deals with difficulty, and so neither can make a difference. Women\u2019s history should not be a shallow hunt for heroines. Too often, I see feminists castigating each other for admiring the Pankhursts (autocrats), Andrea Dworkin (too aggressive), Jane Austen (too middle-class), Margaret Atwood (worried about due process in claims of sexual harassment) and Germaine Greer (where do I start?). I recently read a piece about how I was \u201cproblematic\u201d for having expressed sympathy for the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. My crime was to say that his confirmation hearings had been turned into a media circus \u2013 and that even those accused of sexual assault deserved better. The criticism reflects a desperate desire to pretend that thorny issues are straightforward. No more flawed humans struggling inside vast, complicated systems: there are good guys and bad guys, and it\u2019s easy to tell them apart. We must restore the complexity to feminist pioneers. Their legacies might be contested, they might have made terrible strategic choices and they might have not have lived according to the ideals they preached. But they mattered. Their difficulty is part of the story. Then there\u2019s the second meaning of \u201cdifficult\u201d. Any demand for greater rights faces opponents, and any advance creates a backlash. Changing the world is always difficult. At Dublin Castle in May 2018, waiting for the results of the Irish referendum on abortion law, I saw a banner that read: \u201cIf there is no struggle, there is no progress.\u201d Those words come from a speech by Frederick Douglass, who campaigned for the end of the slave trade in the US. He wanted to make clear that \u201cpower concedes nothing without a demand\u201d. In other words, campaigners have to be disruptive. They cannot take no for an answer. \u201cThose who profess to favour freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without ploughing up the ground,\u201d said Douglass. \u201cThey want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.\u201d Changing the world won\u2019t make people like you. It will cause you pain. It will be difficult. It will feel like a struggle. You must accept the size of the mountain ahead of you, and start climbing it anyway. Then there is the difficulty of womanhood itself. In a world built for men, women will always struggle to fit in. We are what Simone de Beauvoir called \u201cthe second sex\u201d. Our bodies are different from the standard (male) human. Our sexual desires have traditionally been depicted as fluid, hard to read, unpredictable. Our life experiences are mysterious and unknowable; our minds are Freud\u2019s \u201cdark continent\u201d. We are imagined to be on the wrong side of a world divided in two. Men are serious, women are silly. Men are rational, women are emotional. Men are strong, women are weak. Men are steadfast, women are fickle. Men are objective, women are subjective. Men are humanity, women are a subset of it. Men want sex and women grant or withhold it. Women are looked at; men do the looking. When we are victims, it is hard to believe us. \u201cAt the heart of the struggle of feminism to give rape, date rape, marital rape, domestic violence and workplace sexual harassment legal standing as crimes has been the necessity of making women credible and audible,\u201d wrote Rebecca Solnit in Men Explain Things to Me. \u201cBillions of women must be out there on this six-billion-person planet being told that they are not reliable witnesses to their own lives, that the truth is not their property, now or ever.\u201d \u00b6 My favourite definition of feminism comes from the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. A feminist, she said, is someone who believes in \u201cthe social, economic and political equality of the sexes\u201d. That sounds straightforward, but feminism is endlessly difficult. The last 10 years have been praised for \u201cchanging the culture\u201d, but led only to a few concrete victories. The #MeToo movement turned into a conversation about borderline cases and has not led to any substantial legal reforms. Abortion rights came under threat in eastern Europe and the southern United States. Gang-rape cases convulsed India and Spain. Free universal childcare was as much a dream as it had been in the 1970s. And the backlash has been brutal. Across the world, from Vladimir Putin in Russia to Narendra Modi in India to Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, populists and nationalists are pushing a return to traditional gender roles, while the US president boasted of grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d. Today\u2019s feminist movement might be louder than previous generations, but is also more fractured, making it harder to achieve progress on any individual issue. \u201cCancel culture\u201d ensures that any feminist icon\u2019s reputation feels fragile and provisional. We barely anoint a new heroine before we tear her down again. \u201cSisterhood is powerful,\u201d the activist Ti-Grace Atkinson once said. \u201cIt kills. Mostly sisters.\u201d Feminism often feels mired in petty arguments, with younger women casually denigrating the achievements of their predecessors. \u201cCancel the second wave,\u201d read one headline. When I talked at an event about the fights for equal pay and domestic-violence shelters, one twentysomething woman casually replied: \u201cYeah, but all that stuff is sorted.\u201d Feminism will always be difficult because it tries to represent half of humanity: 3.5 billion people (and counting) drawn from every race, class, country and religion. It is revolutionary, challenging the most fundamental structures of our society. It is deeply personal, illuminating our most intimate experiences and personal relationships. It rejects the division between the public and private spheres. It gets everywhere, from boardrooms to bedrooms. It leaves no part of our lives untouched. It is both theory and practice. And there is another problem, unique to feminism. It is a movement run by women, for women. And what do we expect from women? Perfection. Selflessness. Care. Girls are instructed to be \u201cladylike\u201d to keep them quiet and docile. Motherhood is championed as a journey of endless self-sacrifice. Random men tell us to \u201ccheer up\u201d in the street, because God forbid our own emotions should impinge on anyone else\u2019s day. If we raise our voices, we are \u201cshrill\u201d. Our ambition is suspicious. Our anger is portrayed as unnatural, horrifying, disfiguring: who needs to listen to the \u201cnag\u201d, the \u201chysteric\u201d or the \u201cangry black woman\u201d? All this is extremely unhelpful if you want to go out and cause trouble \u2013 the kind of trouble that leads to legal and cultural change. We pick apart feminism to see its failings, as if to reassure ourselves that women aren\u2019t getting above their station. We describe women who challenge authority or seek power as unladylike, talkative, insistent, self-obsessed. We accuse them of \u201cputting themselves forward\u201d. The critic Emily Nussbaum nailed the problem: \u201cWhen you\u2019re put on a pedestal, the whole world gets to upskirt you.\u201d For that reason, feminism has a particular duty to fight \u201cthe tyranny of niceness\u201d \u2013 which is, and has always been, one of the most potent forces holding women back. Feminism is not a self-help movement, dedicated to making everyone feel better about their lives. It is a radical demand to overturn the status quo. It sometimes has to cause upset. \u201cI cannot personally think of any widespread injustice that has been remedied by plodding worthily down the middle of the road, smiling and smiling,\u201d wrote Jill Tweedie in 1971. \u201cIf you are sure of the justice of your cause it must be better to have people thinking of it with initial anger than not thinking at all.\u201d In the early 20th century, the contraception pioneer Marie Stopes showed thousands of women how to enjoy sex \u2013 and how to stop risking their lives through endless pregnancies. She was also a domineering, self-mythologising eugenicist. The suffragettes helped to secure the vote for women, but the cost was bombings, arson, criminal damage and, in one case, throwing a hatchet at the prime minister. Today, we would call them terrorists. Jayaben Desai \u2013 who led the strikes at Grunwick in the 1970s, and showed Britain that \u201cworking class\u201d was not synonymous with white and male \u2013 ultimately failed, and her protest contributed to the Thatcherite backlash against trade unions. The woman who founded the first domestic violence refuge in Britain, Erin Pizzey, is now a men\u2019s rights activist who says feminism is destroying the family. Selma James preached the gospel of universal basic income: only she called it \u201cwages for housework\u201d and wanted it to go to women, so she was ignored. Caroline Norton, who fought so hard to reform Britain\u2019s child custody laws, relied on her own middle-class respectability to make her arguments. All of these women belong in the history of feminism, not in spite of their flaws, but because we are all flawed. We have to resist the modern impulse to pick one of two settings: airbrush or discard. \u00b6 In the past decade, the internet \u2013 and particularly social media \u2013 has prompted a flowering of feminist activism. The Everyday Sexism project website, #MeToo and the Caitlin Moran-inspired publishing boom awakened a new generation to the idea that, no, sexism hadn\u2019t been solved by their mothers and grandmothers. Their anger, their creativity and the power of their voices renewed feminism, creating its fourth wave. Underneath all the energy, though, a split could be observed. Some young activists saw the older generation as conservatives, wedded to fixed ideas of what men and women could be, whereas they felt gender was much more fluid and playful. Their mothers were equally bemused. They had tried to smash beauty standards and restrictive ideas about the nuclear family. They struggled to understand why their daughters were so desperate to have a big wedding, wear high heels, pore over Facetuned selfies. Feminism can, and must, contain all these contradictions, the differing priorities of difficult women. But one thing should unite us: we should still try to turn our outrage into political power. The fourth wave was beautifully noisy and attention-grabbing, but now we need concrete victories that will last in a way hashtag campaigns cannot. The #MeToo movement is a dead end without structural change, such as ensuring full and free access to employment tribunals. The fifth wave, if there is to be one, should look again at the seven demands of the first Women\u2019s Liberation Movement conference, in Oxford 50 years ago this month. Equal pay. Equal educational and job opportunities. Free contraception and abortion on demand. Free 24-hour childcare. Legal and financial independence for all women. The right to a self-defined sexuality. Freedom from intimidation and violence. These are a reminder of how long the struggle has been \u2013 Northern Ireland only gained abortion rights last year \u2013 and how much there is left to do. Women are legally entitled to be paid the same as men, but as Samira Ahmed\u2019s case against the BBC showed, laws are worthless if they are not enforced. Single parents (who are overwhelmingly female) still face a high risk of poverty. Lesbians are still attacked for saying \u201cno\u201d to the Great Almighty Penis. Social media and smartphones have created new expressions of misogyny, such as \u201crevenge porn\u201d, which rely on the same old mechanisms of intimidation and shame. You might notice that I haven\u2019t said much about some of the hardy perennials of feminist commentary: leg-shaving, bra-burning, pube-waxing. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t care about them or haven\u2019t thought about them. I don\u2019t wear high heels (can\u2019t walk in them, and object to the principle of a shoe that makes your feet less comfortable). I didn\u2019t take my husband\u2019s surname. I don\u2019t watch pornography. I\u2019m 100% pro\u2011bra as I have a cup size that requires serious cantilevering. I shave my legs because my socialised disgust with female body hair runs so deep that I couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything else if I had furry calves. But all of these are ultimately personal decisions, rather than collective actions. And since we live in a deeply individualist society, debates over women\u2019s choices on these topics will never struggle to get airtime. My most hated headline format \u2013 \u201cCan you be a feminist and \u2026 \u201d \u2013 will never, ever die. In this climate, the most radical thing we can do is resist treating everything as a personal choice, and resist turning feminism into a referendum on those choices. Let\u2019s swim against the tide by talking instead about what we can do together. Change requires us to put aside our egos, and our differences, and focus on our shared goals. The suffragettes saw themselves as an army. Jayaben Desai did not go on strike alone. Erin Pizzey and her \u201cbattered wives\u201d made sure the government could not ignore them, by staging a sit-in at Downing Street. Feminism will never be free of infighting, of personality clashes and contests over priorities. It will never be perfect, or nice. But no wonder sexists and reactionaries are scared of it, because \u2013 by God, can it get things done \u2022Difficult Women: A History of Feminism in 11 Fights by Helen Lewis is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a316.99).

      "body": "<p>It is mid-June in Epidaurus and the temperature is climbing towards 35 degrees. There is a burr of cicada and birdsong, and the mountains are a distant blue beyond a row of cypress trees. At the theatre, regarded as the most <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/491\" title=\"\">acoustically and aesthetically perfect example of a Greek theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/coogan\">Steve Coogan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rob-brydon\">Rob Brydon</a> stand 25 rows up, hands on hips, panamas on heads. For several minutes they bicker and berate one another; they impersonate Laurel and Hardy and Richard Burton; they discuss Pink Floyd, Ant and Dec, the nature of comedy and tragedy, until their brows dampen and their shirts stick, and they\u2019re forced to retreat under waiting parasols. A tourist bearing the pinkened skin of the Brit abroad hovers close. \u201cAre you Rob Brydon?\u201d he asks brightly. \u201cAre you doing another series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-trip\">The Trip</a>?\u201d</p> <p>They are indeed. The Trip to Greece is the fourth instalment of the series directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-winterbottom\">Michael Winterbottom</a>, a show that has proved something of an unlikely success. It began in 2010, when the concept demanded a degree of patience on behalf of the viewer: the pair playing augmented versions of their real-life selves, longstanding friends and colleagues who embark on a culinary tour of northern England together. It was slow and subtle, largely improvised, and filled with jokes about Romantic poets, sticky toffee pudding and a glut of Michael Caine impressions. Since then, they have taken trips to Italy and to Spain, with plots encompassing personal and professional disappointments, romantic entanglements, ruminations on success, celebrity, masculinity, Byron and Don Quixote, alongside deep-fried artichoke flowers, sea bass carpaccio and octopus.</p> <p>Series four carries them from Turkey to Ithaca, via Lesbos, Pilos, Athens and Hydra, a loose recreation of Odysseus\u2019s journey home following the fall of Troy. Before they began shooting, Coogan tells me that he diligently read Homer\u2019s epic poem, while Brydon, despite his best intentions, somehow did not.</p> <p>\u201cSteve\u2019s northern, working-class chippiness works in his favour here, I think,\u201d Brydon suggests. \u201cBecause he will make the effort. Whereas I\u2019m sort of\u2026 I never get around to it.\u201d Beside him, Coogan shrugs. \u201cWell, I have an appreciation of knowledge,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is perhaps something that state school attendees have.\u201d Brydon, who was privately educated until the age of 14, smiles and leans forward. \u201cI have an appreciation of quizzes,\u201d he says gently.</p> <p>Time spent in the company of Brydon and Coogan occupies the sweet spot between fiction and reality. There they are, ribbing one another in the lobby of an Athens hotel, eating ice-cream, riding on boats, jumping off rocks into the sea at Hydra \u2013 and it\u2019s only sometimes that the cameras are rolling. There is an immense fondness between them, their conversation carrying the happy rhythm of familiar comedy partners \u2013 the set-up, the punchline, the hamming of roles: Brydon, the affable family man and king of light entertainment; Coogan, the highbrow foil with a surfeit of Baftas, two Oscar nominations and a personal life that has often led to appearances in the tabloids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2eade2ab32eb9eb22ef7073d65a5a7d81da27b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2eade2ab32eb9eb22ef7073d65a5a7d81da27b1/0_398_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Coogan (left) and Rob Brydon in The Trip To Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s a template: we know what we\u2019re required to do\u2019: Coogan (left) and Brydon in Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGreek mythology, I thought it was interesting, but I liked Greek philosophy more,\u201d Coogan says, continuing his cultural appraisal. \u201cAnd the world view of the three principal philosophers, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. For me, having had a struggle with religion [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/03/steve-coogan-autobiography-extract-comedy\" title=\"\">he was raised Catholic</a>], it always baffled me that people stick to Christianity when there was a more nuanced, holistic approach to living your life that pre-dated it by a few centuries.\u201d He is not against Christianity, he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s just that loads of idiots have co-opted it. And that hasn\u2019t really happened with Greek philosophy. You don\u2019t think of stupid idiotic rightwing fundamentalist Greek philosopher followers.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Part of The Trip\u2019s allure is that, alongside mainstream references, many of its touchstones are unashamedly learned. This time there are impersonations of Tom Hardy and renditions of Frankie Valli\u2019s Grease, but also long discussions of Aristotle\u2019s Poetics, and a scene in which the pair enact the death of Socrates. These are themes, Coogan argues, that are strikingly contemporary. \u201cAll that internal discussion within Greek philosophy, it feels so weirdly and strangely undated,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get older and you know you\u2019re going to die, I think the feeling that these struggles and questions are all perennial, that they happened before you were born and they\u2019ll go on after you die, and it\u2019s part of a cycle \u2013 it\u2019s nice, actually.\u201d</p> <p>There is a sense of an ending to this series. At a screening six months after filming ends, Winterbottom will bill it as the \u201cfourth and last\u201d instalment. The echo of Odysseus, and the storyline of \u201ctrying to get home after 10 years away\u201d feels, he says, \u201clike a natural end\u201d. Whether or not this will prove true, his stars speak about their decade of making The Trip with a new kind of contemplation.</p> <p>\u201cI like the poignancy when I watch it back,\u201d Coogan says. \u201cBut actually, you know what, the first Trip, to the north of England, I find that does have a lot of personal resonance, and I don\u2019t really want to look at it. In the same way I can\u2019t really look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/23/tonywilson\" title=\"\">24 Hour Party People</a> [the Winterbottom-helmed film in which Coogan also starred].\u201d Raised in Manchester, it is the first series\u2019 northernness that affects Coogan. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so close to my heart, the north,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel there\u2019s something slightly maudlin about it.\u201d</p> <p>That could also be attributed to the grey skies, Brydon points out. \u201cSee, I sort of like grey skies,\u201d Coogan says, wistfully. \u201cI mean, not all the time, but when you see it on screen. I feel it\u2019s sort of a pallor of sadness.\u201d He hasn\u2019t watched that series back in full, only caught glimpses of it as he\u2019s channel-hopped. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an old photograph album, because it was us finding our feet\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Brydon nods. \u201cExactly,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we go into it, there\u2019s a template, we know what we\u2019re required to do. But on that first one, having refused it several times, then decided to do it, it was like, \u2018Well, what is it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do remember after the first shoot, which was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/nov/04/hotels.shortbreaks.unitedkingdom\" title=\"\">Inn at Whitewell</a>,\u201d Coogan says, \u201cwhen we\u2019d done whatever we were doing, some Michael Caine stuff, and then maybe day three, I remember saying to you, \u2018This is going to be good.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"264b012f5f6e8108dcb1fadb2d9c389787366eae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/264b012f5f6e8108dcb1fadb2d9c389787366eae/24_881_4491_2694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Brydon (left) and Steve Coogan in 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All that internal discussion within Greek philosophy feels weirdly undated\u2019: Coogan (right) and Brydon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Brydon watched the first series, he was, he admits \u201cmortified\u201d. He laughs. \u201cI thought, it\u2019s so slow! Nothing happens! Which of course became one of its strengths.\u201d They discuss the enjoyment of a slower pace in a world that is increasingly fast and abbreviated. Brydon says he watches old talkshow clips on YouTube, in which conversation unfolds unrushed and unhurried. Coogan recalls the joy of rewatching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/19/kenneth-clark-civilisation-bbc-review\" title=\"\">Kenneth Clark\u2019s Civilisation</a>: \u201cWhat I love about it is that it takes its time and allows you to look at the paintings. I thought, \u2018This is really nice \u2013 I\u2019m not thinking about something when it\u2019s already moved on to something else.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the years since The Trip began, we have seen other programmes that have found a similarly slow pace \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/23/mortimer-and-whitehouse-gone-fishing-review-bbc2\" title=\"\">Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse\u2019s Gone Fishing</a> among them. \u201cPaul phoned me to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to do this, how did you do The Trip?\u2019\u201d Brydon recalls. \u201cAnd the difference is that, with us, there\u2019s a constructed narrative. I envy Bob and Paul just going out and talking and having a nice time\u2026\u201d Coogan nods. \u201cAnd not worrying if it\u2019s funny or not.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a lot of creative marriages. I'm an artistic bigamist</p> <footer> <cite>Steve Coogan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On The Trip, not only is the plot constructed, so is the pair\u2019s relationship. Though they have known one another and worked together since 2000, when Coogan\u2019s Baby Cow production company made Brydon\u2019s series Marion And Geoff, their on-screen dynamic is more combative than in real life. \u201cThe meals we have? That\u2019s not how we would have a meal,\u201d Brydon says. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be poking him all the time, trying to undermine his success. I\u2019m always saying, \u2018Tell me about it! Oh brilliant!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I do sometimes is I go, \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to try to get provocative just to put a firework up its arse and see what happens,\u201d Coogan explains when we meet again this month. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t just become too blokeily bland.\u201d And a certain sharpness is necessary, he believes. \u201cI think people like that: \u2018Hold on, that\u2019s a bit strong.\u2019 It\u2019s good to have those moments. It\u2019s like teasing a child, or not giving the dog its treat.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of four series, this blurring of reality has coloured how people respond to them in real life: seeing them as the clubbable Brydon and the prickly Coogan. \u201cYou can run away and hide, which is lovely,\u201d Brydon tells Coogan. \u201cI don\u2019t have that. Because I front things as myself, because I am going, \u2018Hey! Hi! Welcome to the show! I\u2019m Rob!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e60ac26f7ae1fb6628ae7e18e48bc6ad3986be9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e60ac26f7ae1fb6628ae7e18e48bc6ad3986be9/46_628_2864_3578/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Brydon in The Trip to northern England in 2011\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I like grey skies\u2019: Coogan in The Trip to northern England in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coogan smiles. \u201cBut in a way that is also an advantage, because people might think I\u2019m a bit of a miserable twat,\u201d he says, and they laugh.</p> <p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t bother you!\u201d Brydon says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not that bothered by it,\u201d Coogan concedes. \u201cI need to have enough people like me to want to see my shows, that\u2019s all. Beyond that, I don\u2019t really care.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Throughout his career, Coogan has been deeply protective of his private life. To this day, he is moving forward with a claim against the Sun as part of a wider case against press intrusion, though he is unsure if it will ever make it to court. He ignores tabloid speculation about his relationships, and has no social media presence. \u201cSometimes people come up to me and say, \u2018Oh, you know some people were slagging you off the other day?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018Ah well, I had no idea.\u2019 Because I don\u2019t quite know where to find it.\u201d</p> <p>The choices the pair have made over the lifetime of The Trip underscore the divergence in their careers. Although Coogan will still revisit Alan Partridge, his most famous role, he has stepped deeper into film acting and collaborations with other writers, such as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/the-witchfinder\" title=\"\">Tim Key</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/jeff-pope\" title=\"\">Jeff Pope</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/13/steve-coogan-sarah-solemani-chivalry-channel-4-metoo\" title=\"\">Sarah Sole</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/13/steve-coogan-sarah-solemani-chivalry-channel-4-metoo\" title=\"\">mani</a>, via Baby Cow. A six-part #MeToo drama about a sexist producer and a younger female director, starring and written by Coogan and Solemani, was announced by Channel 4 last month.</p> <p>Brydon, meanwhile, is a regular panel show presence, and recently revisited his much-loved role in Gavin &amp; Stacey. Soon he will embark on a national tour, combining music and comedy. After speaking to Bob Mortimer about Gone Fishing, he has begun to contemplate some of the travelogue shows he is frequently offered, but still dreams of bigger roles \u2013 a Succession-type show, or a Wes Anderson film. Coogan is encouraging. \u201cRob did a series called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\" title=\"\">Human Remains</a> [a macabre comedy] for Baby Cow years ago, which I am still a huge fan of,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because he went off in this other direction I still think that is something he needs to explore. I think you\u2019ve hidden that under a bushel for a number of years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe big difference between Steve and I, apart from anything inherent in our personalities, is I have five children,\u201d Brydon continues. \u201cTwo of them are still of school age. So when Steve goes off for five months here and five months there, that holds no appeal for me. I don\u2019t want to do it, neither am I able to do it. So you have to look at a person\u2019s life. I have opportunities in America, but I can\u2019t be out there.\u201d He shrugs, contentedly. \u201cSo with him, I\u2019ve said it till I\u2019m blue in the face \u2013 I\u2019m a proper fan of the guy, he\u2019s terrific. Career-wise and work-wise, he\u2019s kind of faultless.\u201d There is a pause. \u201cOn a personal level, it\u2019s a very different story.\u201d Coogan starts to laugh. \u201cBecause personally, I can think of a lot of areas where his behaviour is <em>appalling</em>. But there\u2019s nothing you can do about that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99c5a9ff0ecd46a85a9e091d44dd277fc2fb7d8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99c5a9ff0ecd46a85a9e091d44dd277fc2fb7d8c/93_1157_5445_3267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Brydon (left) and Steve Coogan in The Trip To Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This couldn\u2019t be more idyllic, could it?\u2019: Brydon (left) and Coogan in the new series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coogan interrupts. \u201cI have lots of different professional relationships, creative relationships, which is really great, because it brings different things out of me. And these relationships are like creative marriages. And so, in that respect, I\u2019m an artistic bigamist. It\u2019s a little bit of a midlife crisis: \u2018I\u2019ve got to get all this stuff done.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In 20 years, Brydon reminds him, he will be in his 70s. \u201cYes, so I feel I\u2019ve got to get on with this stuff,\u201d Coogan says. \u201cBut weirdly, there is a part of me that thinks, once I\u2019ve got all this stuff done, then I can pick and choose a bit more.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that the death of Coogan\u2019s father, in 2018, might have contributed to his desire to get things done. He references it a couple of times in conversation \u2013 showing me a video of his daughter playing the pinball machine that once lived in the Coogan family home; he found it in the attic after his father died and had it reconditioned. Later, he describes how he drew on the experience when shooting one of the series\u2019 most poignant moments, only for Winterbottom to tell him it was \u201ctoo on the nose, too overly demonstrative. And I said, \u2018What? It was real!\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, you\u2019ve got to do it again.\u2019\u201d<strong> </strong>He was annoyed, he says, \u201cbecause I felt I\u2019d exposed myself. Emotionally, not physically,\u201d he adds, as if to head off a Brydon quip. He retook the scene. \u201cAnd he was right to make me do it again, because sometimes if you\u2019re overdemonstrative then it\u2019s disengaging,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the repression of emotion that somehow draws people in. I think the British trait of not being open, in that Californian navel-gazing sort of way, makes us more interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Having worked with Winterbottom more than a dozen times, Coogan is delighting in his collaborations with a new generation. \u201cI like working with young people,\u201d he says, and slides his eyes to the left, waiting for Brydon to make the obvious joke. \u201cI held back!\u201d Brydon cries. \u201cAnd that took so much. That\u2019s drained me.\u201d</p> <p>Coogan laughs. \u201cI see people who I think, \u2018Well, I know how they do that\u2019 and they might be technically funny, and they\u2019re very good, but it leaves me cold,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then sometimes I come across people where I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re funny, or they\u2019re making me laugh for some reason I can\u2019t quite work out.\u201d Those are the people he wants to work with. \u201cThere\u2019s a natural professional competitiveness in this industry,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut when I see people who are really good at something I actually feel the reverse. I think, if they\u2019re making me laugh I have no envy: I want to help them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e1b4c0496db05ed6d815ec8b186ca11cba2d247\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e1b4c0496db05ed6d815ec8b186ca11cba2d247/57_60_4092_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Coogan (left) and Rob Brydon in The Trip To Italy in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coogan (left) and Brydon in The Trip To Italy in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Trip Films Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is on a roll now. \u201cThe other thing is, when you feel like you\u2019ve become part of the furniture or the establishment, that makes me uncomfortable.

I don\u2019t actually drive them all. I use public transport a lot,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I collect them. Some people meditate. I can\u2019t do that. So I source old cars and restore them.\u201d \u201cYou mechanictate,\u201d Brydon says.</p> <p>Coogan exhales. \u201cBut the thing is, I don\u2019t want to become a staid, conservative with a small c, member of a club. I don\u2019t want to hang out with people who have status and money, and so I kick against it. Any captain of industry, any billionaire, anyone who people look up to through dint of the material success \u2013 I couldn\u2019t give a shit [Coogan recently played a thinly veiled version of disgraced retail mogul Philip Green in Winterbottom\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/11/greed-review-steve-coogan-michael-winterbottom\" title=\"\">Greed</a>]. Not only am I ambivalent about them, I try actively to avoid them because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for you. Not from any great moral standpoint, or grandstanding \u2013 I think it\u2019s bad for you creatively. Keep away from people like that if you want to say anything relevant. It\u2019s like rock bands who do two good albums, and then start hanging round with famous people and taking drugs, and all they see is the inside of hotels. And then the third album\u2019s shit because they\u2019ve got nothing to say. So I\u2019ve tried to avoid that.\u201d Brydon looks up. \u201cWhat sort of bands?\u201d he asks. \u201cJust give us a couple of names.\u201d \u201cWell Oasis, by their own admission,\u201d Coogan says. \u201cThey know their third album was shit because they lost the plot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/12/the-trip-to-spain-rob-brydon-steve-coogan-ageing-comedy\">The Trip: a show about death that deserves to live on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this is series four of The Trip, I say. \u201cTouch\u00e9!\u201d shouts Brydon.

      "bodyText": "It is mid-June in Epidaurus and the temperature is climbing towards 35 degrees. There is a burr of cicada and birdsong, and the mountains are a distant blue beyond a row of cypress trees. At the theatre, regarded as the most acoustically and aesthetically perfect example of a Greek theatre, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon stand 25 rows up, hands on hips, panamas on heads. For several minutes they bicker and berate one another; they impersonate Laurel and Hardy and Richard Burton; they discuss Pink Floyd, Ant and Dec, the nature of comedy and tragedy, until their brows dampen and their shirts stick, and they\u2019re forced to retreat under waiting parasols. A tourist bearing the pinkened skin of the Brit abroad hovers close. \u201cAre you Rob Brydon?\u201d he asks brightly. \u201cAre you doing another series of The Trip?\u201d They are indeed. The Trip to Greece is the fourth instalment of the series directed by Michael Winterbottom, a show that has proved something of an unlikely success. It began in 2010, when the concept demanded a degree of patience on behalf of the viewer: the pair playing augmented versions of their real-life selves, longstanding friends and colleagues who embark on a culinary tour of northern England together. It was slow and subtle, largely improvised, and filled with jokes about Romantic poets, sticky toffee pudding and a glut of Michael Caine impressions. Since then, they have taken trips to Italy and to Spain, with plots encompassing personal and professional disappointments, romantic entanglements, ruminations on success, celebrity, masculinity, Byron and Don Quixote, alongside deep-fried artichoke flowers, sea bass carpaccio and octopus. Series four carries them from Turkey to Ithaca, via Lesbos, Pilos, Athens and Hydra, a loose recreation of Odysseus\u2019s journey home following the fall of Troy. Before they began shooting, Coogan tells me that he diligently read Homer\u2019s epic poem, while Brydon, despite his best intentions, somehow did not. \u201cSteve\u2019s northern, working-class chippiness works in his favour here, I think,\u201d Brydon suggests. \u201cBecause he will make the effort. Whereas I\u2019m sort of\u2026 I never get around to it.\u201d Beside him, Coogan shrugs. \u201cWell, I have an appreciation of knowledge,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is perhaps something that state school attendees have.\u201d Brydon, who was privately educated until the age of 14, smiles and leans forward. \u201cI have an appreciation of quizzes,\u201d he says gently. Time spent in the company of Brydon and Coogan occupies the sweet spot between fiction and reality. There they are, ribbing one another in the lobby of an Athens hotel, eating ice-cream, riding on boats, jumping off rocks into the sea at Hydra \u2013 and it\u2019s only sometimes that the cameras are rolling. There is an immense fondness between them, their conversation carrying the happy rhythm of familiar comedy partners \u2013 the set-up, the punchline, the hamming of roles: Brydon, the affable family man and king of light entertainment; Coogan, the highbrow foil with a surfeit of Baftas, two Oscar nominations and a personal life that has often led to appearances in the tabloids. \u201cGreek mythology, I thought it was interesting, but I liked Greek philosophy more,\u201d Coogan says, continuing his cultural appraisal. \u201cAnd the world view of the three principal philosophers, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. For me, having had a struggle with religion [he was raised Catholic], it always baffled me that people stick to Christianity when there was a more nuanced, holistic approach to living your life that pre-dated it by a few centuries.\u201d He is not against Christianity, he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s just that loads of idiots have co-opted it. And that hasn\u2019t really happened with Greek philosophy. You don\u2019t think of stupid idiotic rightwing fundamentalist Greek philosopher followers.\u201d * * * Part of The Trip\u2019s allure is that, alongside mainstream references, many of its touchstones are unashamedly learned. This time there are impersonations of Tom Hardy and renditions of Frankie Valli\u2019s Grease, but also long discussions of Aristotle\u2019s Poetics, and a scene in which the pair enact the death of Socrates. These are themes, Coogan argues, that are strikingly contemporary. \u201cAll that internal discussion within Greek philosophy, it feels so weirdly and strangely undated,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get older and you know you\u2019re going to die, I think the feeling that these struggles and questions are all perennial, that they happened before you were born and they\u2019ll go on after you die, and it\u2019s part of a cycle \u2013 it\u2019s nice, actually.\u201d There is a sense of an ending to this series. At a screening six months after filming ends, Winterbottom will bill it as the \u201cfourth and last\u201d instalment. The echo of Odysseus, and the storyline of \u201ctrying to get home after 10 years away\u201d feels, he says, \u201clike a natural end\u201d. Whether or not this will prove true, his stars speak about their decade of making The Trip with a new kind of contemplation. \u201cI like the poignancy when I watch it back,\u201d Coogan says. \u201cBut actually, you know what, the first Trip, to the north of England, I find that does have a lot of personal resonance, and I don\u2019t really want to look at it. In the same way I can\u2019t really look at 24 Hour Party People [the Winterbottom-helmed film in which Coogan also starred].\u201d Raised in Manchester, it is the first series\u2019 northernness that affects Coogan. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so close to my heart, the north,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel there\u2019s something slightly maudlin about it.\u201d That could also be attributed to the grey skies, Brydon points out. \u201cSee, I sort of like grey skies,\u201d Coogan says, wistfully. \u201cI mean, not all the time, but when you see it on screen. I feel it\u2019s sort of a pallor of sadness.\u201d He hasn\u2019t watched that series back in full, only caught glimpses of it as he\u2019s channel-hopped. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an old photograph album, because it was us finding our feet\u2026\u201d Brydon nods. \u201cExactly,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we go into it, there\u2019s a template, we know what we\u2019re required to do. But on that first one, having refused it several times, then decided to do it, it was like, \u2018Well, what is it?\u2019\u201d \u201cI do remember after the first shoot, which was the Inn at Whitewell,\u201d Coogan says, \u201cwhen we\u2019d done whatever we were doing, some Michael Caine stuff, and then maybe day three, I remember saying to you, \u2018This is going to be good.\u2019\u201d When Brydon watched the first series, he was, he admits \u201cmortified\u201d. He laughs. \u201cI thought, it\u2019s so slow! Nothing happens! Which of course became one of its strengths.\u201d They discuss the enjoyment of a slower pace in a world that is increasingly fast and abbreviated. Brydon says he watches old talkshow clips on YouTube, in which conversation unfolds unrushed and unhurried. Coogan recalls the joy of rewatching Kenneth Clark\u2019s Civilisation: \u201cWhat I love about it is that it takes its time and allows you to look at the paintings. I thought, \u2018This is really nice \u2013 I\u2019m not thinking about something when it\u2019s already moved on to something else.\u2019\u201d In the years since The Trip began, we have seen other programmes that have found a similarly slow pace \u2013 Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse\u2019s Gone Fishing among them. \u201cPaul phoned me to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to do this, how did you do The Trip?\u2019\u201d Brydon recalls. \u201cAnd the difference is that, with us, there\u2019s a constructed narrative. I envy Bob and Paul just going out and talking and having a nice time\u2026\u201d Coogan nods. \u201cAnd not worrying if it\u2019s funny or not.\u201d On The Trip, not only is the plot constructed, so is the pair\u2019s relationship. Though they have known one another and worked together since 2000, when Coogan\u2019s Baby Cow production company made Brydon\u2019s series Marion And Geoff, their on-screen dynamic is more combative than in real life. \u201cThe meals we have? That\u2019s not how we would have a meal,\u201d Brydon says. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be poking him all the time, trying to undermine his success. I\u2019m always saying, \u2018Tell me about it! Oh brilliant!\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat I do sometimes is I go, \u2018Right, I\u2019m going to try to get provocative just to put a firework up its arse and see what happens,\u201d Coogan explains when we meet again this month. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t just become too blokeily bland.\u201d And a certain sharpness is necessary, he believes. \u201cI think people like that: \u2018Hold on, that\u2019s a bit strong.\u2019 It\u2019s good to have those moments. It\u2019s like teasing a child, or not giving the dog its treat.\u201d Over the course of four series, this blurring of reality has coloured how people respond to them in real life: seeing them as the clubbable Brydon and the prickly Coogan. \u201cYou can run away and hide, which is lovely,\u201d Brydon tells Coogan. \u201cI don\u2019t have that. Because I front things as myself, because I am going, \u2018Hey! Hi! Welcome to the show! I\u2019m Rob!\u2019\u201d Coogan smiles. \u201cBut in a way that is also an advantage, because people might think I\u2019m a bit of a miserable twat,\u201d he says, and they laugh. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t bother you!\u201d Brydon says. \u201cI\u2019m not that bothered by it,\u201d Coogan concedes. \u201cI need to have enough people like me to want to see my shows, that\u2019s all. Beyond that, I don\u2019t really care.\u201d * * * Throughout his career, Coogan has been deeply protective of his private life. To this day, he is moving forward with a claim against the Sun as part of a wider case against press intrusion, though he is unsure if it will ever make it to court. He ignores tabloid speculation about his relationships, and has no social media presence. \u201cSometimes people come up to me and say, \u2018Oh, you know some people were slagging you off the other day?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018Ah well, I had no idea.\u2019 Because I don\u2019t quite know where to find it.\u201d The choices the pair have made over the lifetime of The Trip underscore the divergence in their careers. Although Coogan will still revisit Alan Partridge, his most famous role, he has stepped deeper into film acting and collaborations with other writers, such as Tim Key, Jeff Pope and Sarah Solemani, via Baby Cow. A six-part #MeToo drama about a sexist producer and a younger female director, starring and written by Coogan and Solemani, was announced by Channel 4 last month. Brydon, meanwhile, is a regular panel show presence, and recently revisited his much-loved role in Gavin &amp; Stacey. Soon he will embark on a national tour, combining music and comedy. After speaking to Bob Mortimer about Gone Fishing, he has begun to contemplate some of the travelogue shows he is frequently offered, but still dreams of bigger roles \u2013 a Succession-type show, or a Wes Anderson film. Coogan is encouraging. \u201cRob did a series called Human Remains [a macabre comedy] for Baby Cow years ago, which I am still a huge fan of,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because he went off in this other direction I still think that is something he needs to explore. I think you\u2019ve hidden that under a bushel for a number of years.\u201d \u201cThe big difference between Steve and I, apart from anything inherent in our personalities, is I have five children,\u201d Brydon continues. \u201cTwo of them are still of school age. So when Steve goes off for five months here and five months there, that holds no appeal for me. I don\u2019t want to do it, neither am I able to do it. So you have to look at a person\u2019s life. I have opportunities in America, but I can\u2019t be out there.\u201d He shrugs, contentedly. \u201cSo with him, I\u2019ve said it till I\u2019m blue in the face \u2013 I\u2019m a proper fan of the guy, he\u2019s terrific. Career-wise and work-wise, he\u2019s kind of faultless.\u201d There is a pause. \u201cOn a personal level, it\u2019s a very different story.\u201d Coogan starts to laugh. \u201cBecause personally, I can think of a lot of areas where his behaviour is appalling. But there\u2019s nothing you can do about that.\u201d Coogan interrupts. \u201cI have lots of different professional relationships, creative relationships, which is really great, because it brings different things out of me. And these relationships are like creative marriages. And so, in that respect, I\u2019m an artistic bigamist. It\u2019s a little bit of a midlife crisis: \u2018I\u2019ve got to get all this stuff done.\u2019\u201d In 20 years, Brydon reminds him, he will be in his 70s. \u201cYes, so I feel I\u2019ve got to get on with this stuff,\u201d Coogan says. \u201cBut weirdly, there is a part of me that thinks, once I\u2019ve got all this stuff done, then I can pick and choose a bit more.\u201d It\u2019s possible that the death of Coogan\u2019s father, in 2018, might have contributed to his desire to get things done. He references it a couple of times in conversation \u2013 showing me a video of his daughter playing the pinball machine that once lived in the Coogan family home; he found it in the attic after his father died and had it reconditioned. Later, he describes how he drew on the experience when shooting one of the series\u2019 most poignant moments, only for Winterbottom to tell him it was \u201ctoo on the nose, too overly demonstrative. And I said, \u2018What? It was real!\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, you\u2019ve got to do it again.\u2019\u201d He was annoyed, he says, \u201cbecause I felt I\u2019d exposed myself. Emotionally, not physically,\u201d he adds, as if to head off a Brydon quip. He retook the scene. \u201cAnd he was right to make me do it again, because sometimes if you\u2019re overdemonstrative then it\u2019s disengaging,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the repression of emotion that somehow draws people in. I think the British trait of not being open, in that Californian navel-gazing sort of way, makes us more interesting.\u201d Having worked with Winterbottom more than a dozen times, Coogan is delighting in his collaborations with a new generation. \u201cI like working with young people,\u201d he says, and slides his eyes to the left, waiting for Brydon to make the obvious joke. \u201cI held back!\u201d Brydon cries. \u201cAnd that took so much. That\u2019s drained me.\u201d Coogan laughs. \u201cI see people who I think, \u2018Well, I know how they do that\u2019 and they might be technically funny, and they\u2019re very good, but it leaves me cold,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then sometimes I come across people where I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re funny, or they\u2019re making me laugh for some reason I can\u2019t quite work out.\u201d Those are the people he wants to work with. \u201cThere\u2019s a natural professional competitiveness in this industry,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut when I see people who are really good at something I actually feel the reverse. I think, if they\u2019re making me laugh I have no envy: I want to help them.\u201d He is on a roll now. \u201cThe other thing is, when you feel like you\u2019ve become part of the furniture or the establishment, that makes me uncomfortable. I don\u2019t like being part of the establishment, even though it means I\u2019ve got a nice house\u2026\u201d \u201cSeveral,\u201d whispers Brydon. \u201c\u2026 and all those trappings that go with it,\u201d Coogan continues. \u201cTell her about your cars,\u201d Brydon says. \u201cAnd material things like cars,\u201d Coogan nods. \u201cCars are weird,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause cars are a way of me disengaging from anything creative or ethical \u2013 it\u2019s like a brain holiday. I don\u2019t actually drive them all. I use public transport a lot,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I collect them. Some people meditate. I can\u2019t do that. So I source old cars and restore them.\u201d \u201cYou mechanictate,\u201d Brydon says. Coogan exhales. \u201cBut the thing is, I don\u2019t want to become a staid, conservative with a small c, member of a club. I don\u2019t want to hang out with people who have status and money, and so I kick against it. Any captain of industry, any billionaire, anyone who people look up to through dint of the material success \u2013 I couldn\u2019t give a shit [Coogan recently played a thinly veiled version of disgraced retail mogul Philip Green in Winterbottom\u2019s Greed]. Not only am I ambivalent about them, I try actively to avoid them because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for you. Not from any great moral standpoint, or grandstanding \u2013 I think it\u2019s bad for you creatively. Keep away from people like that if you want to say anything relevant. It\u2019s like rock bands who do two good albums, and then start hanging round with famous people and taking drugs, and all they see is the inside of hotels. And then the third album\u2019s shit because they\u2019ve got nothing to say. So I\u2019ve tried to avoid that.\u201d Brydon looks up. \u201cWhat sort of bands?\u201d he asks. \u201cJust give us a couple of names.\u201d \u201cWell Oasis, by their own admission,\u201d Coogan says. \u201cThey know their third album was shit because they lost the plot.\u201d But this is series four of The Trip, I say. \u201cTouch\u00e9!\u201d shouts Brydon. Coogan laughs. \u201cI would say that I think series four is probably the weakest,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, I\u2019m being disingenuous \u2013 I think people who love The Trip will love it as much as they love the others.\u201d Brydon agrees. \u201cWhen James Taylor releases a new album it sounds like a James Taylor record,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think this will feel just like The Trip.\u201d * * * Back in Hydra, Coogan and Brydon sit on a restaurant terrace overlooking the turquoise sea. Brydon sips a glass of sauvignon blanc, and the pair assess the plate of seafood before them that looks \u201clike a fishy Jackson Pollock\u201d. The conversation winds on through the hot afternoon, through many takes and makeup touch-ups, through the muttered advice of Winterbottom and the arrival of courses and a tortoiseshell cat that winds gently around the table leg. \u201cThis couldn\u2019t be more idyllic, could it?\u201d Brydon says, before the conversation meanders once more \u2013 to Al Pacino, the Queen\u2019s honours, Mick Jagger, hydroplanes, body hair, Chris Hemsworth and Aristotle. It is a conversation that could quite happily run for ever. But soon the sun dips a little, and the shadows lengthen, and Brydon at last calls for the bill. \u2022 The Trip To Greece is on Sky One and Now TV from 3 March. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 February and 13 March 2020 to clarify that the pair enact the death of Socrates, not Sophocles as stated in an earlier version; and that the ancient site at Epidaurus is a theatre (with seats more or less in a semicircle) rather than an amphitheatre (with seats going all the way round).

      "body": "<p>What better way to celebrate upcoming VE Day celebrations than with a collegiate shag? Everyone seems to be doing it, but perhaps swinging with your friends is more your thing? Or how about a good old-fashioned Lindy hop?</p> <p>Swing dancing is back and even English Heritage is getting in on the act and encouraging people to <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/inspire-me/ve-day/\">Dance for VE Day</a> by taking up swing to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe.</p> <p>Although swing has been around since the late 1920s and evolved with jazz music in the Harlem ballrooms, with its heyday from 1935 to 1946, its popularity is rising and in central London a weekly class is packed full of people ready to do the Charleston.</p> <p>Those attending Swing Patrol\u2019s evening of Lindy hop couldn\u2019t be happier that this year English Heritage is encouraging people to learn the dance. There are a plethora of classes in the UK, <a href=\"https://londonswingfestival.co.uk/\">festivals</a> and even swing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jan/26/lindy-hop-festival-holiday-budapest-swing-dance-course-lindy-shock\">dance holidays you can go on</a>.</p> <p>At Thursday evening\u2019s Swing Patrol, there is a 28-strong crowd, a mix of ages, genders and styles. The teacher Cat Foley, 32, explains there was resurgence in swing dancing in the 1980s, but before that there was a period when no one in the UK was doing it.</p> <p>\u201cIn the last five years or so it has really taken the country by storm, with many dancing in nearly every city in the UK. I think that is because it is fun and different. It\u2019s not modern music,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Even the names of the styles of swing dancing evoke fun and something of the past; the jitterbug, collegiate shag, Balboa, boogie woogie, ceroc and DC hand dancing are all variations of, or influenced by the original Lindy hop. And the style evolves still, with West Coast one of the most recent.</p> <p>The rebirth is partly down to BBC One\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing, according to Foley, and the revival of partner dancing. \u201cStrictly got it more in the public eye \u2026 Social media is also a good way to show the dance,\u201d she says.</p> <p>To encourage people to celebrate the dance this year as part of VE Day celebrations, English Heritage is sending hundreds of expert lindy-hoppers to join community events and street parties across the country. Those keen to take part have to apply online.</p> <p>Inspired by jazz, tap and the charleston, Lindy hop was introduced to the UK by the American soldiers based here during the war. In towns, cities and villages across the country, people marked the victory on 8 May 1945 by taking to the streets to celebrate with singing and dancing.</p> <p>According to Foley, swing is the perfect dance of celebration, and all about community spirit, a much needed force in modern times. \u201cIt\u2019s a very celebratory dance.

      "bodyText": "What better way to celebrate upcoming VE Day celebrations than with a collegiate shag? Everyone seems to be doing it, but perhaps swinging with your friends is more your thing? Or how about a good old-fashioned Lindy hop? Swing dancing is back and even English Heritage is getting in on the act and encouraging people to Dance for VE Day by taking up swing to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe. Although swing has been around since the late 1920s and evolved with jazz music in the Harlem ballrooms, with its heyday from 1935 to 1946, its popularity is rising and in central London a weekly class is packed full of people ready to do the Charleston. Those attending Swing Patrol\u2019s evening of Lindy hop couldn\u2019t be happier that this year English Heritage is encouraging people to learn the dance. There are a plethora of classes in the UK, festivals and even swing dance holidays you can go on. At Thursday evening\u2019s Swing Patrol, there is a 28-strong crowd, a mix of ages, genders and styles. The teacher Cat Foley, 32, explains there was resurgence in swing dancing in the 1980s, but before that there was a period when no one in the UK was doing it. \u201cIn the last five years or so it has really taken the country by storm, with many dancing in nearly every city in the UK. I think that is because it is fun and different. It\u2019s not modern music,\u201d she says. Even the names of the styles of swing dancing evoke fun and something of the past; the jitterbug, collegiate shag, Balboa, boogie woogie, ceroc and DC hand dancing are all variations of, or influenced by the original Lindy hop. And the style evolves still, with West Coast one of the most recent. The rebirth is partly down to BBC One\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing, according to Foley, and the revival of partner dancing. \u201cStrictly got it more in the public eye \u2026 Social media is also a good way to show the dance,\u201d she says. To encourage people to celebrate the dance this year as part of VE Day celebrations, English Heritage is sending hundreds of expert lindy-hoppers to join community events and street parties across the country. Those keen to take part have to apply online. Inspired by jazz, tap and the charleston, Lindy hop was introduced to the UK by the American soldiers based here during the war. In towns, cities and villages across the country, people marked the victory on 8 May 1945 by taking to the streets to celebrate with singing and dancing. According to Foley, swing is the perfect dance of celebration, and all about community spirit, a much needed force in modern times. \u201cIt\u2019s a very celebratory dance. VE Day celebrations are a mixture of things, reflection but also celebration. It is a community dance and the exciting thing about it is that it can be for any age or ability.

This year, Trump became the first president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/24/trump-march-for-life-washington-anti-abortion\">to speak at the divisive anti-abortion March for Life</a>, where he called himself the \u201cmost pro-life president\u201d ever.</p> <p>Now, anti-abortion organizations are increasingly turning to Pence\u2019s daughter, 26-year-old Bond, to appeal to young people, who is wading into one of America\u2019s most long-running and contentious culture war issues in spite of describing herself as \u201cnot very political\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI personally don\u2019t believe abortion should be legal,\u201d she told the Guardian in an interview. But, she added, \u201cI\u2019m not a politician.\u201d</p> <p>If you are familiar with Bond, it is probably through a popular series of children\u2019s books about her pet rabbit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/john-oliver-gay-rabbit-book-parody-outsells-mike-pence-original-amazon\">Marlon Bundo</a>. She writes the books with her mother, the second lady Karen Pence, who also illustrates various scenes of Bundo\u2019s life in Washington DC in watercolors.</p> <p>Until recently, Bond was a student at Harvard Divinity School, but said she took a break to get married. In that time, she has moved to Visalia, California, 200 miles north-east of Los Angeles with her husband, and found a new interest in speaking to anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ groups.</p> <p>\u201cI joke with people that I\u2019m really not very political, which everybody says, \u2018You know, you\u2019re in the wrong family for that,\u2019\u201d she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52c205ff17c0153b184c33dabaff8e41ce531ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52c205ff17c0153b184c33dabaff8e41ce531ba2/0_147_3616_2170/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike and Charlotte Pence in April 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike and Charlotte Pence in April 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This might seem incongruous \u2013 abortion and LGBTQ+ rights are two culture war issues regularly used to rile American voters. But in Bond\u2019s world, opposition to abortion and gay marriage is indeed not political. It is de facto.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a time that I considered being pro-choice,\u201d said Bond.</p> <p>Her speaking career has become busy lately. She took top billing at the 2020 Students for Life summit in January, a paid engagement according to the group. The theme of the meeting was \u201cHistory Maker: Casting a Vision for a Post-Roe America\u201d, referring to the landmark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade\">Roe v</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade\"> Wade</a> supreme court decision that made abortion legal in the US. She headlined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/young-anti-abortion-marchers-washington-march-for-life\">the youth rally at the March for Life</a>, the nation\u2019s largest anti-abortion protest held in the nation\u2019s capitol each January since 1973.</p> <p>Bond is now represented by Greater Talent Network, a speaking agency which also represents the Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai and New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin, and for whom she was once an intern. She joined their speaker roster roughly one year ago.</p> <p>But despite her public speaking, untangling Pence\u2019s beliefs on abortion is not easy. Asked whether she supported greater access to birth control, which could help reduce unplanned pregnancies and thus abortion, Bond said: \u201cThere honestly are a lot of different options. And I think that that\u2019s really for policymakers to decide on and frankly offer. And I think that there\u2019s been some progress on that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just personally don\u2019t believe that abortion and the culture of a pro-choice culture is pro-woman</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact, just one of Trump and Pence\u2019s policies alone, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/global-gag-rule\">Global Gag Rule</a> which blocks foreign aid from reproductive health organizations which offer abortion, could lead to an estimated 1.8m unintended pregnancies, 600,000 unsafe abortions and 4,600 avoidable maternal deaths, according to <a href=\"https://www.mariestopes.org/news/2019/6/crucial-new-evidence-on-devastating-impact-of-global-gag-rule/\">Marie Stopes International</a>.</p> <p>But access to birth control has always been contentious in America, and other family members of the Trump-Pence administration have gotten behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/22/trump-budget-2018-paid-family-leave-ivanka-trump\">paid maternity leave</a>. But even this, Bond said, she was unsure about.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll run for office and I\u2019ll have a whole plan about it that I\u2019ll be happy to talk to you about,\u201d she said. Pressed on the matter, Bond said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I really have too much of an opinion on that right now that I\u2019d like to speak openly about.\u201d</p> <p>Bond, like her evangelical Christian father, said she wants to encourage young anti-abortion activists to find reasons outside of faith for their opposition to abortion. But what are hers?</p> <p>\u201cAfter doing a lot of research on my own on this topic, I just personally don\u2019t believe that abortion and the culture of a pro-choice culture is pro-woman,\u201d she said, and pointed to \u201cpost-abortion stress syndrome.\u201d The condition, not recognized by the American Psychiatric Association or the American Psychological Association, is said to be similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p> <p>Anti-abortion advocates have long alleged there are deleterious mental health effects stemming from abortions. But even high-powered abortion opponents, such as Reagan-era surgeon general C Everett Koop, have concluded psychological impacts of abortion are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2006/08/abortion-and-mental-health-myths-and-realities\">minuscule</a>\u201d from a public health perspective.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think there was a time that I considered being pro-choice.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A recent survey of more than 650 women across 21 US states and five years found 95% believed they made the right decision to have an abortion. The survey buttresses previous research with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/abortion-women-do-not-regret-study\">the same results</a>.</p> <p>The difficulty of Bond\u2019s public statements, is they often conflict with the values of organizations she spends her time with. Her Bundo books, for example, were memorably trolled by comedian John Oliver on the HBO show Last Week Tonight. The show made a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/john-olivers-parody-of-mike-pences-bunny-book-happens-to-be-a-delightful-work-of-childrens-lit\">parody version</a> of her book in which Bundo meets another boy bunny, and they get married \u2013 a finger in the eye to the Pence family and their work in opposition to gay rights.</p> <p>The proceeds from Oliver\u2019s book benefit gay rights charities. Bond bought a copy when it was published, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlipence/status/976585850170593280?lang=en\">saying she was</a>, \u201chappy to support charities and important causes\u201d.</p> <p>But when she appeared at the Students for Life summit, she was speaking at an event one of whose sponsors was the American Family Association, whose work focuses on combatting the \u201cgay agenda\u201d. The hate-tracking organization Southern Poverty Law Center describes AFA\u2019s work as \u201cpublicizing companies that have pro-gay policies and organizing boycotts against them\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e19bcd0e14b211b461eda8922bc4e7005703a4e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e19bcd0e14b211b461eda8922bc4e7005703a4e9/0_101_4417_2652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Pence with her parents and the Trump family at the Republican National Convention on 21 July 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Pence with her parents and the Trump family at the Republican national convention on 21 July 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the time since the Oliver book, Karen Pence also took a teaching position at the Immanuel Christian school in Springfield, Virginia. The school bans gay students and teachers. A <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/karen-pence-anti-lgbtq-school_n_5c44618ce4b0bfa693c46f51\">former student</a> at the school described it in an op-ed as a \u201chotbed of right-wing fanaticism, shoved down the throats of impressionable children at every turn\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople, I think, will panic a little bit when they hear of abortion being illegal because it reminds people of a time when abortion was illegal by different states,\u201d said Bond, about the time before the 1973 Roe decision. </p> <p>\u201cI think on the policy side allowing states to decide on what they want their limits to be would be a good thing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Effectively, that would lead to perhaps as many as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/30/abortion-supreme-court-law-anthony-kennedy\">two dozen</a> states moving forward with abortion bans, and leave vast swaths of America without this reproductive healthcare. \u201cBut I\u2019m not, you know, a politician,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2020 to reflect the American Family Association was a sponsor not an organizer of the Students for Life summit.

Before he became Trump\u2019s running mate, former Indiana governor and evangelical Christian Mike Pence worked for decades to erode reproductive rights, and has continued that work with vigor inside the Trump administration. This year, Trump became the first president to speak at the divisive anti-abortion March for Life, where he called himself the \u201cmost pro-life president\u201d ever. Now, anti-abortion organizations are increasingly turning to Pence\u2019s daughter, 26-year-old Bond, to appeal to young people, who is wading into one of America\u2019s most long-running and contentious culture war issues in spite of describing herself as \u201cnot very political\u201d. \u201cI personally don\u2019t believe abortion should be legal,\u201d she told the Guardian in an interview. But, she added, \u201cI\u2019m not a politician.\u201d If you are familiar with Bond, it is probably through a popular series of children\u2019s books about her pet rabbit, Marlon Bundo. She writes the books with her mother, the second lady Karen Pence, who also illustrates various scenes of Bundo\u2019s life in Washington DC in watercolors. Until recently, Bond was a student at Harvard Divinity School, but said she took a break to get married. In that time, she has moved to Visalia, California, 200 miles north-east of Los Angeles with her husband, and found a new interest in speaking to anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ groups. \u201cI joke with people that I\u2019m really not very political, which everybody says, \u2018You know, you\u2019re in the wrong family for that,\u2019\u201d she said. This might seem incongruous \u2013 abortion and LGBTQ+ rights are two culture war issues regularly used to rile American voters. But in Bond\u2019s world, opposition to abortion and gay marriage is indeed not political. It is de facto. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a time that I considered being pro-choice,\u201d said Bond. Her speaking career has become busy lately. She took top billing at the 2020 Students for Life summit in January, a paid engagement according to the group. The theme of the meeting was \u201cHistory Maker: Casting a Vision for a Post-Roe America\u201d, referring to the landmark Roe v Wade supreme court decision that made abortion legal in the US. She headlined the youth rally at the March for Life, the nation\u2019s largest anti-abortion protest held in the nation\u2019s capitol each January since 1973. Bond is now represented by Greater Talent Network, a speaking agency which also represents the Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai and New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin, and for whom she was once an intern. She joined their speaker roster roughly one year ago. But despite her public speaking, untangling Pence\u2019s beliefs on abortion is not easy. Asked whether she supported greater access to birth control, which could help reduce unplanned pregnancies and thus abortion, Bond said: \u201cThere honestly are a lot of different options. And I think that that\u2019s really for policymakers to decide on and frankly offer. And I think that there\u2019s been some progress on that.\u201d In fact, just one of Trump and Pence\u2019s policies alone, the Global Gag Rule which blocks foreign aid from reproductive health organizations which offer abortion, could lead to an estimated 1.8m unintended pregnancies, 600,000 unsafe abortions and 4,600 avoidable maternal deaths, according to Marie Stopes International. But access to birth control has always been contentious in America, and other family members of the Trump-Pence administration have gotten behind paid maternity leave. But even this, Bond said, she was unsure about. \u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll run for office and I\u2019ll have a whole plan about it that I\u2019ll be happy to talk to you about,\u201d she said. Pressed on the matter, Bond said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I really have too much of an opinion on that right now that I\u2019d like to speak openly about.\u201d Bond, like her evangelical Christian father, said she wants to encourage young anti-abortion activists to find reasons outside of faith for their opposition to abortion. But what are hers? \u201cAfter doing a lot of research on my own on this topic, I just personally don\u2019t believe that abortion and the culture of a pro-choice culture is pro-woman,\u201d she said, and pointed to \u201cpost-abortion stress syndrome.\u201d The condition, not recognized by the American Psychiatric Association or the American Psychological Association, is said to be similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anti-abortion advocates have long alleged there are deleterious mental health effects stemming from abortions. But even high-powered abortion opponents, such as Reagan-era surgeon general C Everett Koop, have concluded psychological impacts of abortion are \u201cminuscule\u201d from a public health perspective. A recent survey of more than 650 women across 21 US states and five years found 95% believed they made the right decision to have an abortion. The survey buttresses previous research with the same results. The difficulty of Bond\u2019s public statements, is they often conflict with the values of organizations she spends her time with. Her Bundo books, for example, were memorably trolled by comedian John Oliver on the HBO show Last Week Tonight. The show made a parody version of her book in which Bundo meets another boy bunny, and they get married \u2013 a finger in the eye to the Pence family and their work in opposition to gay rights. The proceeds from Oliver\u2019s book benefit gay rights charities. Bond bought a copy when it was published, saying she was, \u201chappy to support charities and important causes\u201d. But when she appeared at the Students for Life summit, she was speaking at an event one of whose sponsors was the American Family Association, whose work focuses on combatting the \u201cgay agenda\u201d. The hate-tracking organization Southern Poverty Law Center describes AFA\u2019s work as \u201cpublicizing companies that have pro-gay policies and organizing boycotts against them\u201d. In the time since the Oliver book, Karen Pence also took a teaching position at the Immanuel Christian school in Springfield, Virginia. The school bans gay students and teachers. A former student at the school described it in an op-ed as a \u201chotbed of right-wing fanaticism, shoved down the throats of impressionable children at every turn\u201d. \u201cPeople, I think, will panic a little bit when they hear of abortion being illegal because it reminds people of a time when abortion was illegal by different states,\u201d said Bond, about the time before the 1973 Roe decision. \u201cI think on the policy side allowing states to decide on what they want their limits to be would be a good thing,\u201d she said. Effectively, that would lead to perhaps as many as two dozen states moving forward with abortion bans, and leave vast swaths of America without this reproductive healthcare. \u201cBut I\u2019m not, you know, a politician,\u201d she adds. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2020 to reflect the American Family Association was a sponsor not an organizer of the Students for Life summit. The year of the summit was also corrected to 2020, from 2019.",

Melody is smart, pretty, private school privileged and much adored by her father, Aubrey, and proud grandparents, Sabe and Po\u2019Boy. Melody is also the product of a teenage pregnancy that has left her estranged from her mother, Iris, who chose the distance of college in Ohio over nappies, baby bottles and the domesticity of her parents\u2019 Brooklyn brownstone.</p> <p>The baby bump deprived Iris of her own introduction into society: now she must look on as her daughter descends the stairs wearing the white dress she was not permitted to wear and is serenaded by an orchestra playing an instrumental version of Prince\u2019s \u201cDarling Nikki\u201d. On a spring day in 2001, while Melody and Malcolm, her childhood friend and date, swirl around the dance floor, so do the memories for the teenager and the key players in her life. Melody can\u2019t help but observe that her relationship with her mother is full of regrets and thorns. \u201cThat afternoon, the years that separated us could have been fifty \u2013 Iris standing at the bottom of the stairs watching me. Me looking away from her. Where was I looking? At my father? My grandparents? At anything. At anyone. But her.\u201d</p> <p>There is an abundance of angst over class, gender and race subtly woven into this beguilingly slim novel. Woodson frames each chapter from the point of view of a different character, and the result is a narrative about an individual family that takes on communal urgency and power. She shows her readers how elliptical and obsessive human memory is. The precarious dance between intelligence and emotions makes it difficult to unravel the whole truth because no two characters experience the past in the same way. The past, however, informs their present.</p> <p>In many ways, <em>Red at the Bone</em> is Iris\u2019s story \u2013 that of a young woman raised for respectability who is unable to follow middle-class norms. Iris is a modern version of Janie in Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/may/04/their-eyes-were-watching-god-zora-neale-hurston-review\" title=\"\">Their Eyes Were Watching God</a></em> or Sula in Toni Morrison\u2019s eponymous novel. At one point, Iris questions the nature of Melody\u2019s relationship with Malcolm. She intuits that her daughter\u2019s friend is gay. This recognition leads us to Iris\u2019s own past and a love affair with another woman during her sophomore year at college. During a moment of sexual arousal, breast milk seeps from her body and she is forced to reveal to her girlfriend that she has a daughter (Melody) and boyfriend (Aubrey) waiting for her in Brooklyn.

      "bodyText": "In US author Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s haunting novel, a 16-year-old girl\u2019s coming-of-age party prompts an avalanche of memories for her middle-class African American family. Melody is smart, pretty, private school privileged and much adored by her father, Aubrey, and proud grandparents, Sabe and Po\u2019Boy. Melody is also the product of a teenage pregnancy that has left her estranged from her mother, Iris, who chose the distance of college in Ohio over nappies, baby bottles and the domesticity of her parents\u2019 Brooklyn brownstone. The baby bump deprived Iris of her own introduction into society: now she must look on as her daughter descends the stairs wearing the white dress she was not permitted to wear and is serenaded by an orchestra playing an instrumental version of Prince\u2019s \u201cDarling Nikki\u201d. On a spring day in 2001, while Melody and Malcolm, her childhood friend and date, swirl around the dance floor, so do the memories for the teenager and the key players in her life. Melody can\u2019t help but observe that her relationship with her mother is full of regrets and thorns. \u201cThat afternoon, the years that separated us could have been fifty \u2013 Iris standing at the bottom of the stairs watching me. Me looking away from her. Where was I looking? At my father? My grandparents? At anything. At anyone. But her.\u201d There is an abundance of angst over class, gender and race subtly woven into this beguilingly slim novel. Woodson frames each chapter from the point of view of a different character, and the result is a narrative about an individual family that takes on communal urgency and power. She shows her readers how elliptical and obsessive human memory is. The precarious dance between intelligence and emotions makes it difficult to unravel the whole truth because no two characters experience the past in the same way. The past, however, informs their present. In many ways, Red at the Bone is Iris\u2019s story \u2013 that of a young woman raised for respectability who is unable to follow middle-class norms. Iris is a modern version of Janie in Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s Their Eyes Were Watching God or Sula in Toni Morrison\u2019s eponymous novel. At one point, Iris questions the nature of Melody\u2019s relationship with Malcolm. She intuits that her daughter\u2019s friend is gay. This recognition leads us to Iris\u2019s own past and a love affair with another woman during her sophomore year at college. During a moment of sexual arousal, breast milk seeps from her body and she is forced to reveal to her girlfriend that she has a daughter (Melody) and boyfriend (Aubrey) waiting for her in Brooklyn. The reality dawns on Iris that her two lives will never blend, and she goes on to pour herself into her education and career. (How lovely, by the way, to see feminist writer bell hooks\u2019s 1981 book Ain\u2019t I a Woman mentioned, one of many examples of character- and world-building layered throughout Red at the Bone.) But it\u2019s not only Iris\u2019s story: Melody\u2019s father has his say too. Following an unstable childhood, Aubrey loves his baby girl and closes rank with Iris\u2019s parents to give Melody a loving home during Iris\u2019s prolonged absences. (Not every man can live with his in-laws.) Woodson captures how important status is for African Americans determined to pull themselves up from poverty and racial oppression.

      "body": "<p>I rediscovered trail running after interviewing the 2019 Marathon De Sables champion Ragna Debats (she\u2019s also a <a href=\"https://www.merrell.com/UK/en_GB/home\">Merrell</a> ambassador). I wasn\u2019t expecting much in the way of practical take-home from such a hardcore long-distance runner. But she talked about how to prevent injury, and said her worst marathon had been in Hong Kong: a lot of stairs, but mainly a lot of concrete.</p> <p>That\u2019s what\u2019s been going wrong, I thought: whenever I\u2019ve given up running, it has been because some part of my body has given me a funny twang, as if the next time I tried that caper, it would snap. I\u2019ve tried resting, physio and resistance-band work to build up the muscles around the joints. Maybe I should just stop running on concrete.</p> <p>If you\u2019re running on grass, the most important thing is to give up the relentless measuring, tracking and Fitbitting. You don\u2019t go as fast. There are always inclines you\u2019re not expecting. Sometimes it\u2019s muddy, which means you have to slow right down or fall over, which slows you down more. You have to give up the whole fandango of setting specific goals \u2013 90 more seconds, one more circuit, whatever you normally use to keep going. And this can be a big deal, since improving is probably the fundamental motivation that gets you out of the house.</p> <p>I had to get past all that counting, and I succeeded (to some extent) by concentrating on the outrageous beauty of even the mankiest park. If you have to look where you\u2019re going anyway, you may as well look around at the trees, at the crocuses poking early through the knolls, at other people\u2019s dogs and their woolly jumpers. I never did the same route, or even the same park two days in a row.

      "bodyText": "I rediscovered trail running after interviewing the 2019 Marathon De Sables champion Ragna Debats (she\u2019s also a Merrell ambassador). I wasn\u2019t expecting much in the way of practical take-home from such a hardcore long-distance runner. But she talked about how to prevent injury, and said her worst marathon had been in Hong Kong: a lot of stairs, but mainly a lot of concrete. That\u2019s what\u2019s been going wrong, I thought: whenever I\u2019ve given up running, it has been because some part of my body has given me a funny twang, as if the next time I tried that caper, it would snap. I\u2019ve tried resting, physio and resistance-band work to build up the muscles around the joints. Maybe I should just stop running on concrete. If you\u2019re running on grass, the most important thing is to give up the relentless measuring, tracking and Fitbitting. You don\u2019t go as fast. There are always inclines you\u2019re not expecting. Sometimes it\u2019s muddy, which means you have to slow right down or fall over, which slows you down more. You have to give up the whole fandango of setting specific goals \u2013 90 more seconds, one more circuit, whatever you normally use to keep going. And this can be a big deal, since improving is probably the fundamental motivation that gets you out of the house. I had to get past all that counting, and I succeeded (to some extent) by concentrating on the outrageous beauty of even the mankiest park. If you have to look where you\u2019re going anyway, you may as well look around at the trees, at the crocuses poking early through the knolls, at other people\u2019s dogs and their woolly jumpers. I never did the same route, or even the same park two days in a row. I replaced target-setting with goals that would infuriate a statistician; if you can run for four songs today, run for five tomorrow. Nope, it doesn\u2019t matter how long the songs are. How far through the American war of independence could I get if I ran to the musical Hamilton? Not that far, it turns out. (I couldn\u2019t even tell you who won. Well, if I didn\u2019t already know.) Elite athletes are much more likely to talk about weather than terrain; rocks, camber, potholes, none of that seems to bother Debats in the slightest.

      "bodyText": "The Americas Argentina: El Marginal Netflix Crime dramas don\u2019t come much tougher than this saga, in which a prison proves so hard to police that the penal powers leave it to its own devices. Whackings and battles for supremacy mix with surprising notes of character drama and even comedy. Brazil: Nobody\u2019s Looking Netflix Light but adult comedy about guardian angels, who have been quietly looking after humans for millennia until they acquire a new, headstrong, incompetent recruit. Canada: Workin\u2019 Moms Netflix Catherine Reitman leads this rude and wryly chaotic examination of middle-class women struggling to reconcile parenting with their relationships and careers.

Croatia: Guardian of the Castle Walter Presents/All 4 The Yugoslavian secret service limps through the mid-80s in a stately saga with delicious Le Carr\u00e9/The Americans/Chernobyl cold-war aesthetics. Czech Republic: The Mine Inferno Amazon Prime Video Sturdy drama about a real 1961 disaster. Before the final tragedy, it\u2019s an engrossingly nuanced picture of the people whose lives were devastated. Denmark: Greyzone Walter Presents/All 4 Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen (Borgen) stars in a fast cybercrime/hostage thriller about a drone engineer forced to help a terror network. Finland: Deadwind Netflix A classic maverick/chalk\u2019n\u2019cheese cop set-up partners a widowed young mum with a cheeky male rookie in a magnificently chilly, foreboding Helsinki. France: Groom YouTube Gleefully stupid comedy: a feckless playboy is sent by his hotel-magnate dad to work as a bellboy, with colourful, cartoonish, farcical consequences. Germany: How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast) Netflix A web-savvy nerd tries to become the Jeff Bezos of MDMA in a comedy full of sharp digital-culture gags and the odd shot of open-hearted teen yearning. Hungary: Home Guards Walter Presents/All 4 Sobering allegorical two-parter about a charismatic new police chief in a small town. His solution to petty crime is \u2026 not what it seems. Italy: 1993 Now TV The middle series in a trilogy about 1990s Italian politics gurgling into the sewer: six characters\u2019 lives are garishly tangled in corruption and populism. Iceland: Trapped Amazon Prime Video At first it offers an intriguing gimmick but in season two, this snowy crimer is just top-quality dark drama, led by the impressive \u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson. Netherlands: The Blood Pact Walter Presents/All 4 A taxman meets a gangster when their kids become pals at school. Soon the speccy bean-counter is up to his neck in intrigue as a juicy thriller unfurls. Poland: Pakt Walter Presents/All 4 You can almost taste the filthy tang of corruption as a journalist in post-communist Poland stirs up a whole new world of trouble in this thriller. Spain: The Neighbor Netflix A boring apartment block peopled by directionless millennials is pepped up by the silliest of them inheriting superpowers, in this nicely indie-flavoured comedy. Sweden: Midnight Sun Now TV A memorable helicopter-based death by centrifugal force kicks off this off-kilter sleuther, set in a place where daylight never stops shining on your sins. Turkey: The Gift Netflix A knotty supernatural fantasy, grounded by strong performances: a painter leaves her life behind when ancient symbols suggest a higher purpose. Africa Egypt: Hidden Worlds Netflix In this quirky conspiracy thriller, a Cairo journo with an astonishing toupee goes second-hand book shopping, and comes back with an journal that is the work of a woman killed eight years earlier. There\u2019s plenty of it: season one has 30 episodes. Nigeria: Crazy, Lovely, Cool Netflix Campus dramedy about the many rivalries among university students, all documented by a mischievous gossip blog. South Africa: Shadow Netflix All-action cop show where the gun-toting maverick detective has a superhero edge: since a childhood lightning strike, he can\u2019t feel pain! Awesome! Asia/Middle East India: Sacred Games Netflix An ambitious sprawler, taking the temperature of modern Mumbai while delivering conspiracy kicks, gangster thrills and a dash of mystic hooey. Israel: Mama\u2019s Angel Walter Presents/All 4 There is a splash of Broadchurch in this classy, thoughtful story of a Tel Aviv suburb that reveals all its stresses and resentments following a murder. Japan: Aggretsuko Netflix Not only is Retsuko an introverted wage slave in her mid 20s who hates work, her boss, colleagues and her stalled existence, she is also a cartoon red panda in a 2D world of anthropomorphic animals. So you can think of this sardonic comedy as a Japanese BoJack Horseman. Malaysia: The Ghost Bride Netflix A handsome, nimbly witty fantasy romance about a woman whose investigation of her father\u2019s death in 19th-century Malacca takes her to a netherworld. Russia: Better Than Us Netflix A more futuristic, more overtly disturbing take on the sci-fi thriller Humans: it\u2019s 2029 and a prototype for a new kind of spookily lifelike android is on the loose. South Korea: Something in the Rain Netflix Netflix boasts a strikingly large catalogue of \u201cK-drama\u201d: why not start with a cannily observed, 16-episode romantic saga about against-the-odds courtship? Taiwan: Nowhere Man Netflix Time-hopping thriller with young Taiwan triads caught up in more than their usual wrongdoing. It doesn\u2019t add up to all that much but it looks brilliant, at least. Oceania Australia: Sisters Netflix A wry, funny comedy that follows Julia, a heroically flawed singleton who discovers she has two new, highly contrasting half-sisters. The show is deft at drilling down to the soft vulnerabilities of kooky characters. Terrific soundtrack, too. New Zealand: The Almighty Johnsons, Amazon Prime Video Odd comedy-drama about five feckless brothers who are also Norse deities, locked in a randy battle for supremacy with local goddesses. You don\u2019t get that on a Tuesday night on BBC One.

      "body": "<p>When the retired artist Peter Williams was contacted by National Savings &amp; Investments, saying it had some money for him, he assumed it was a scam.

NS&amp;I were insistent that the account was mine and I was equally insistent that it was not my account \u2026 the transcript clearly showed that I had steadfastly maintained that the account was not mine,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/21/ministers-launch-financial-wellbeing-scheme-to-help-savers\">Ministers launch financial wellbeing scheme to help savers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When NS&amp;I said he could access the money by putting in his pin and password, Williams admits he yelled at them, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have a pin number or password. I have been trying to tell you that over the past few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Reluctantly, he sent NS&amp;I a letter with his signature to access the money \u2013 and only then found out he was in line for about \u00a34,000.</p> <p>But of course the story does not end there. Six months later NS&amp;I called again. This time it was a little more humble and apologetic. Yes, it told Williams, you were right all along. It was not your money. Can we have it back please?</p> <p>What would you do? Could you legally keep the money? Mr Williams\u2019 predicament bears some resemblance to the extraordinary story of Peter Teich, who Guardian Money revealed in December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/dec/07/i-lost-my-193000-inheritance-with-one-wrong-digit-on-my-sort-code\" title=\"\">lost a \u00a3193,000 inheritance</a> after pressing a wrong digit on his sort code and account number, and sent it to another individual. Only after paying large court fees did Teich get the money back.</p> <p>In that instance, the law was clear: finders keepers does not apply and if money lands in your account, you have no right to retain it. But what if a bank or institution almost forces money upon you? Isn\u2019t that rather different?</p> <p>Whatever the legal merits, the immediate problem for Williams was that by the time NS&amp;I asked for the money back, he had already spent it.</p> <p>The artist had used the cash to buy some new trifold doors for the conservatory in his home in Market Drayton, Shropshire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70377eec13459d74b3a5625774e1c12de42c72ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70377eec13459d74b3a5625774e1c12de42c72ab/0_304_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Williams and his wife Mary with the tri-fold doors at their home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Williams and his wife Mary with the tri-fold doors at their home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSeveral of our friends suggested that we were entitled to keep hold of the windfall. Others suggested we should return the doors to NS&amp;I!\u201d Williams says.</p> <p>In the end, Williams decided just to pay the money back, although in monthly instalments. \u201cI don\u2019t regard myself as a particularly moral person but I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable keeping the money. So I set up a standing order to pay it back monthly.\u201d The \u201cdebt\u201d is now cleared.</p> <p>Yet, legally speaking, Williams probably did not have to repay the money. While his case could be described as \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d, the fact that he had bought the trifold doors only because NS&amp;I sent him the money means he had changed his personal position and would be unfairly penalised by having to return the cash.</p> <p>Williams would be protected by a court ruling in 1991 involving, of all places, the Playboy Club in London \u2013 and it is such an important part of the law regarding unjust enrichment that it has its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipkin_Gorman_v_Karpnale_Ltd\" title=\"\">own Wikipedia page</a>.</p> <p>Richard Colbey, a barrister, explains. \u201cMr Williams probably need not pay the money back in these circumstances. Although he had received money he was not entitled to, he was wholly innocent in doing so and had changed his position as a result. Buying the trifold doors was something he would not have done had he not been assured he was entitled to that money. The position would have been different had he simply left the money in a savings account where it easily could have been returned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Several friends suggested we were entitled to keep the windfall. Others suggested we should return the doors to NS&I!</p> <footer> <cite>Peter Williams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe principle arises from a 1991 case where a crooked solicitor gambled \u00a3220,000 of his firm\u2019s money at the Playboy Club. His overall losses were \u00a3151,000. The House of Lords, as the supreme court then was, held that the Playboy Club had to return the \u00a3151,000 but not the full \u00a3220,000. The club had suffered no detriment in respect of that much but had changed its position in respect of the \u00a369,000, which had been paid to the solicitor as winnings.</p> <p>\u201cMr Williams, having changed his position, is entitled to the protection that case bestows on those who would be unfairly penalised as a consequence of someone else giving them money to which they are not entitled.\u201d</p> <p>One of the unusual aspects of this case is that NS&amp;I contacted Williams out of the blue. Williams does not know how it obtained his contact details but he accepts that his relatively common surname is the likely reason for the mix-up. He holds no grudge against NS&amp;I, whom he says treated him politely through the entire episode, and did not contact Guardian Money for the purposes of getting the money back.</p> <p>In total, NS&amp;I sits on more than \u00a33bn of unclaimed assets, according to its 2018-19 accounts, although only \u00a320m of that is from unclaimed premium bonds. The majority is money held in savings certificates and accounts that have lain dormant for years.</p> <p>Guardian Money sent the full details of the case to NS&amp;I, which admitted that it had made \u201ca clerical error\u201d, that the money belonged to another Mr Williams and that it is duty-bound to recover money wrongly sent.</p> <p>In a statement, NS&amp;I said: \u201cWe can confirm that this was a clerical error in the case of Mr Williams. However, it does not relate to a dormant account. We have an obligation to recover an incorrect payment to a customer. In the case of Mr Williams, we did not make an unsolicited call to Mr Williams. He made a phone call to NS&amp;I after receiving an account statement that he did not recognise as his account.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 If you believe you may have money lying dormant at NS&amp;I, you can check at <a href=\"https://www.mylostaccount.org.uk/\" title=\"\">mylostaccount.org.uk</a></em></p>",

NS&amp;I were insistent that the account was mine and I was equally insistent that it was not my account \u2026 the transcript clearly showed that I had steadfastly maintained that the account was not mine,\u201d he says. When NS&amp;I said he could access the money by putting in his pin and password, Williams admits he yelled at them, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have a pin number or password. I have been trying to tell you that over the past few weeks.\u201d Reluctantly, he sent NS&amp;I a letter with his signature to access the money \u2013 and only then found out he was in line for about \u00a34,000. But of course the story does not end there. Six months later NS&amp;I called again. This time it was a little more humble and apologetic. Yes, it told Williams, you were right all along. It was not your money. Can we have it back please? What would you do? Could you legally keep the money? Mr Williams\u2019 predicament bears some resemblance to the extraordinary story of Peter Teich, who Guardian Money revealed in December lost a \u00a3193,000 inheritance after pressing a wrong digit on his sort code and account number, and sent it to another individual. Only after paying large court fees did Teich get the money back. In that instance, the law was clear: finders keepers does not apply and if money lands in your account, you have no right to retain it. But what if a bank or institution almost forces money upon you? Isn\u2019t that rather different? Whatever the legal merits, the immediate problem for Williams was that by the time NS&amp;I asked for the money back, he had already spent it. The artist had used the cash to buy some new trifold doors for the conservatory in his home in Market Drayton, Shropshire. \u201cSeveral of our friends suggested that we were entitled to keep hold of the windfall. Others suggested we should return the doors to NS&amp;I!\u201d Williams says. In the end, Williams decided just to pay the money back, although in monthly instalments. \u201cI don\u2019t regard myself as a particularly moral person but I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable keeping the money. So I set up a standing order to pay it back monthly.\u201d The \u201cdebt\u201d is now cleared. Yet, legally speaking, Williams probably did not have to repay the money. While his case could be described as \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d, the fact that he had bought the trifold doors only because NS&amp;I sent him the money means he had changed his personal position and would be unfairly penalised by having to return the cash. Williams would be protected by a court ruling in 1991 involving, of all places, the Playboy Club in London \u2013 and it is such an important part of the law regarding unjust enrichment that it has its own Wikipedia page. Richard Colbey, a barrister, explains. \u201cMr Williams probably need not pay the money back in these circumstances. Although he had received money he was not entitled to, he was wholly innocent in doing so and had changed his position as a result. Buying the trifold doors was something he would not have done had he not been assured he was entitled to that money. The position would have been different had he simply left the money in a savings account where it easily could have been returned. \u201cThe principle arises from a 1991 case where a crooked solicitor gambled \u00a3220,000 of his firm\u2019s money at the Playboy Club. His overall losses were \u00a3151,000. The House of Lords, as the supreme court then was, held that the Playboy Club had to return the \u00a3151,000 but not the full \u00a3220,000. The club had suffered no detriment in respect of that much but had changed its position in respect of the \u00a369,000, which had been paid to the solicitor as winnings. \u201cMr Williams, having changed his position, is entitled to the protection that case bestows on those who would be unfairly penalised as a consequence of someone else giving them money to which they are not entitled.\u201d One of the unusual aspects of this case is that NS&amp;I contacted Williams out of the blue. Williams does not know how it obtained his contact details but he accepts that his relatively common surname is the likely reason for the mix-up. He holds no grudge against NS&amp;I, whom he says treated him politely through the entire episode, and did not contact Guardian Money for the purposes of getting the money back. In total, NS&amp;I sits on more than \u00a33bn of unclaimed assets, according to its 2018-19 accounts, although only \u00a320m of that is from unclaimed premium bonds. The majority is money held in savings certificates and accounts that have lain dormant for years. Guardian Money sent the full details of the case to NS&amp;I, which admitted that it had made \u201ca clerical error\u201d, that the money belonged to another Mr Williams and that it is duty-bound to recover money wrongly sent. In a statement, NS&amp;I said: \u201cWe can confirm that this was a clerical error in the case of Mr Williams. However, it does not relate to a dormant account. We have an obligation to recover an incorrect payment to a customer. In the case of Mr Williams, we did not make an unsolicited call to Mr Williams. He made a phone call to NS&amp;I after receiving an account statement that he did not recognise as his account.\u201d \u2022 If you believe you may have money lying dormant at NS&amp;I, you can check at mylostaccount.org.uk",

The <a href=\"http://www.wasdale.com/\" title=\"\">Wasdale Head Inn</a> is set far up the loneliest dale under the grandest mountains in England, and its wall, you understand, is a photographic testament to the early days of learning how to survive out there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66fc65a4adc06bf57625b0e1b9a3fa99c150e32c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66fc65a4adc06bf57625b0e1b9a3fa99c150e32c/0_0_694_476/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mosedale horseshoe\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My mission is to tackle some of the best ridge walks in Britain and I\u2019m keen to hear Richard\u2019s advice. With sustained views on both sides of the path, ridges can be exhilarating, but in bad weather they can also become dangerous.</p> <p>I ask him for his favourites. \u201cAonach Eagach in Glen Coe \u2013 that\u2019s extraordinary, intense. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/oct/05/snowdonia-snowdon-north-wales-activity-holiday-climbing-zipline-karting-caving-walking\" title=\"\">Crib Goch </a>on Snowden, of course \u2013 a real challenge and not to be underestimated.\u201d Understandably, he also has many favourites in the Lake District: the three edges, Striding, Swirral and Sharp, plus the one I am attempting tomorrow: the Mosedale Horseshoe.</p> <p>Mountain Rescue is getting busier, he says, as more people try hill walking for the first time, and fatalities keep happening: 17 in the Lake District in 2019, 21 the year before. \u201cWe calculate that a third of all call-outs could be avoided,\u201d he adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66ab71821d6d35eb9fe5497ab762ef7bcd0e7597\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66ab71821d6d35eb9fe5497ab762ef7bcd0e7597/0_78_5618_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kirk Fell &amp; Mosedale, with Great Gable behind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirk Fell &amp; Mosedale, with Great Gable behind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Wilkins/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople make simple errors: they take a mobile phone instead of a map, then the battery runs out. They set off too late. They split their group then someone gets lost. We have a new website, <a href=\"https://www.adventuresmart.uk/\" title=\"\">Adventure Smart,</a> which gives up-to-date weather reports and good advice, and that seems to be helping.\u201d</p> <p>Given that I am attempting the Mosedale Horseshoe in winter with my partner Sophie, who has a foot injury, and an ageing dog who has a mistaken belief that he is as young as he used to be, I take careful notes. Check weather (especially the wind chill and freezing level \u2013 the altitude above which to expect ice and snow), leave word, carry a paper map, gloves, hat, torch plus plenty of food and drink. As we leave the inn next morning I can see lacy fringes of snow adorning the mountains below the ominously heavy cloud. I cannot, however, see the Mosedale Horseshoe.</p> <p>I use the map immediately to ensure we take the right path up Mosedale. There are no signposts on the fells \u2013 a fact that can fuddle even experienced walkers if they\u2019re from areas where footpaths are generously marked.</p> <p>\u201cWhen there\u2019s no sign, people tend to follow each other,\u201d Richard had said the previous evening. \u201cThat\u2019s how an inexperienced group can follow an experienced group on to a path that is way beyond their abilities.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no chance of that mistake today. We are alone. At Black Sail Pass, our entry point on to the ridge, we pause and assess the situation. The cloud is not breaking up, as was forecast, and occasional showers of hail are stinging our faces in a stiffening wind. We start up the ridge and finally get our reward: a brief sunny view north to Scotland across the Solway Firth, with a pearly string of lakes to the south.</p> <p>By the time we reach 892-metre Pillar, however, we are in cloud and the wind gets nasty. We huddle behind a rock for lunch and decide to head back. We retrace our route, reaching the inn in darkness. In some ways, my first ridge walk has been frustrating, but at least I didn\u2019t meet Richard again, in his mountain rescue role.</p> <p><strong>Grade: </strong>in good weather the Mosedale Horseshow is a straightforward hike<br><strong>Start: </strong>Wasdale Head Inn<br><strong>Map: </strong>OS Explorer OL4<br><strong>Distance: </strong>11 miles<br><strong>Dog-friendly: </strong>yes<br><strong>Public transport: </strong>nearest station is Seascale (on the Carlisle to Barrow-in-Furness line), a half-hour taxi ride away</p> <h2>Lake District: Striding Edge/Helvellyn<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce8e64225db0a65018a24da7748ee1bc4651111f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce8e64225db0a65018a24da7748ee1bc4651111f/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Striding Edge from Helvellyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Grade: </strong>a good level of fitness needed<br><strong>Start: </strong>Glenridding<br><strong>Map: </strong><a href=\"https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-the-lake-district-north-eastern-area.html\" title=\"\">OS Explorer OL5</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-the-lake-district-north-eastern-area.html\" title=\"\"> </a></strong><br><strong>Distance: </strong>9 miles<br><strong>Dog friendly: </strong>sensible hill hounds only<br><strong>Public transport: </strong><a href=\"https://www.stagecoachbus.com/routes/cumbria-and-north-lancashire/508/penrith-windermere/xnbo508.o\" title=\"\">508 bus from Penrith</a> (can also combine with Ullswater steamer)<br><br>Like Crib Goch and Tryfan in Snowdonia, the <a href=\"https://www.walklakes.co.uk/walk_41.html\" title=\"\">Lake District\u2019s Striding Edge</a> is definitely one of those ridges that a walker can fall off. However, if being careful to avoid ice, wind or darkness, there is no reason not to enjoy a magnificent day out. I first tackled it aged 11; Wilf my dog managed it as a puppy and celebrated with his first-ever swim \u2013 in Red Tarn, the chilly little glacial lake under the summit of Helvellyn. This time he is older and wiser: we go up via Striding Edge and come down via its neighbour, the equally demanding Swirral Edge, but he does not swim. Nor do I. Instead, we yomp briskly to my favourite tearoom in Glenridding (the <a href=\"http://helvellynkitchen.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Helvellyn Country Kitchen</a>) and warm up. For sheer spectacular lakeland panoramas, the Striding/Swirral combo is unbeatable.</p> <h2><strong>Lake District: Sharp Edge</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd78818d678aa81854a113b278ce9010a5eb1ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd78818d678aa81854a113b278ce9010a5eb1ee/0_0_5395_3237/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People scrambling up Sharp Edge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Grade: </strong>straightforward in good conditions/challenging when poor<br><strong>Start: </strong>park in Scales or <a href=\"https://www.visitcumbria.com/kes/threlkeld/\" title=\"\">Threlkeld</a><br><strong>Map: </strong><a href=\"https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-the-lake-district-north-eastern-area.html\" title=\"\">OL5</a><br><strong>Dog-friendly: </strong>sensible hill hounds maybe.

The main peak on this route is Blencathra at 868 metres , which has satanic associations: one etymology of the name is \u201csummit of the devil\u201d. I personally think it\u2019s a little easier than Striding Edge, being shorter, but a lot depends on conditions. If things look dodgy, there is an easy deviation that misses out the worst (or best) bit of the ridge. Start at Scales Farm heading up the hill northwards, climbing to Mousthwaite Comb to get the first view \u2013 hopefully \u2013 of Sharp Edge. Negotiate that, then Foule Crag and reach Blencathra summit. <a href=\"https://www.walklakes.co.uk/walk_24.html\" title=\"\">WalkLakes.co.uk</a> has a similar, longer route, taking in Mungrisdale Common.</p> <h2><strong>Crib Goch</strong><strong>, Snowdonia</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6ce361ed4f686547407d0d9b2941327f00f4a84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ce361ed4f686547407d0d9b2941327f00f4a84/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walkers tackling Crib Goch ridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Grade: </strong>Extreme.

Crib Goch is certainly not one for the faint-hearted. This is a walk with remarkable views, often of your white knuckles as they cling to the precarious central line of the ridge. Once that section is managed, there is a serious sting in the tail to negotiate: Garnedd Ugain (1,065 metres), next to Snowdon, a tumble of rocky outcrops where the path is difficult to follow and a moment\u2019s inattention can have painfully nerve-wracking consequences when negotiating broken buttresses and small cliffs. I emerge on the cinder track that follows the railway to Snowdon\u2019s summit \u2013 and the cafe. From here, I take the path down to the jagged crest of Y Lliwedd, then descend to the small glacial lake \u2013 Llyn Llydaw \u2013 enclosed by the two ridges, picking up the Miner\u2019s Track to return to the Pen-y-Pass car park.

Head up to the summit of Glyder Fawr, which made headlines in 2010 when it was upgraded from a measly 999 metres to a commanding 1001. From here there\u2019s a circuit of ridges and descents that goes (in anti-clockwise order): Glyder Fach (994), <a href=\"https://www.ukscrambles.com/wales-scrambles/bristly-ridge/\" title=\"\">Bristly Ridge</a>, Tryfan north ridge which ends, if doing this direction, at the Cannon Stone, a popular photo opportunity.

There\u2019s a car park and, for those just wanting to do the north ridge, it\u2019s a three-mile walking circuit from here.

For that reason, wind, weather and season are crucial in planning the day, but the reward is a fabulously exciting day out. The path starts at the parking area by the Meeting of Three Waters waterfall close to the A82 (four miles east of Glencoe visitor centre). It ascends rapidly to the 943-metre peak of Am Bodach, where things immediately get more challenging with a tricky descent to a col (some people use a rope on this bit). From here, climb to Meall Dearg and then comes the highlight, the Pinnacles section which is about 500 metres long. Things ease off a bit to another Munro, Sgorr nam Fiannaidh (967 metres), from whence you descend back down into the valley where the Old Glencoe road leads to the <a href=\"https://clachaig.com/\" title=\"\">Clachaig Inn</a> for a well-earned pint. Unless using two cars or taking the bus, there\u2019s then a three-mile yomp back up the road to the starting point.</p> <h2><strong>Stiperstones, Shropshire</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1a99d1781a465e7cef78f1f97063f8ede5c5d45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1a99d1781a465e7cef78f1f97063f8ede5c5d45/0_3_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man on high rock, stiperstones ridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Grade: </strong>Easy<br><strong>Start: </strong>the Bog car park, <a href=\"http://www.stiperstonesinn.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stiperstones Inn</a> or Bridges YHA<br><strong>Map: </strong><a href=\"https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-the-long-mynd-wenlock-edge.html\" title=\"\">OS Explorer 217</a><br><strong>Distance: </strong>8 miles or <a href=\"https://theoutdoorguide.co.uk/britains-favourite-walks/the-stiperstones-shropshire/\" title=\"\">4.5 miles without The Rock</a><br><strong>Dog-friendly: </strong>yes<br><strong>Public transport: </strong>train to Church Stretton<strong> </strong>(5 miles away) or <a href=\"https://bustimes.org/services/552-stiperstones-shrewsbury\" title=\"\">552 bus from Shrewsbury to Stiperstones Inn</a>.

      "bodyText": "I meet Richard Warren from Wasdale Mountain Rescue at the most appropriate place, a pub adorned with photographs of people in farcically inadequate clothing, carrying outdated equipment while they tackle monstrously dangerous crags not far from where we sit. The only feeble excuse these poor folk can offer is that they lived between the birth of mountain photography (around the 1870s) and the formation of mountain rescue teams (around 1928), in an age when a woman\u2019s best friend on a mountain was a full-length tweed skirt and emergency rations meant a twist of rough shag for your pipe. The Wasdale Head Inn is set far up the loneliest dale under the grandest mountains in England, and its wall, you understand, is a photographic testament to the early days of learning how to survive out there. My mission is to tackle some of the best ridge walks in Britain and I\u2019m keen to hear Richard\u2019s advice. With sustained views on both sides of the path, ridges can be exhilarating, but in bad weather they can also become dangerous. I ask him for his favourites. \u201cAonach Eagach in Glen Coe \u2013 that\u2019s extraordinary, intense. Crib Goch on Snowden, of course \u2013 a real challenge and not to be underestimated.\u201d Understandably, he also has many favourites in the Lake District: the three edges, Striding, Swirral and Sharp, plus the one I am attempting tomorrow: the Mosedale Horseshoe. Mountain Rescue is getting busier, he says, as more people try hill walking for the first time, and fatalities keep happening: 17 in the Lake District in 2019, 21 the year before. \u201cWe calculate that a third of all call-outs could be avoided,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople make simple errors: they take a mobile phone instead of a map, then the battery runs out. They set off too late. They split their group then someone gets lost. We have a new website, Adventure Smart, which gives up-to-date weather reports and good advice, and that seems to be helping.\u201d Given that I am attempting the Mosedale Horseshoe in winter with my partner Sophie, who has a foot injury, and an ageing dog who has a mistaken belief that he is as young as he used to be, I take careful notes. Check weather (especially the wind chill and freezing level \u2013 the altitude above which to expect ice and snow), leave word, carry a paper map, gloves, hat, torch plus plenty of food and drink. As we leave the inn next morning I can see lacy fringes of snow adorning the mountains below the ominously heavy cloud. I cannot, however, see the Mosedale Horseshoe. I use the map immediately to ensure we take the right path up Mosedale. There are no signposts on the fells \u2013 a fact that can fuddle even experienced walkers if they\u2019re from areas where footpaths are generously marked. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no sign, people tend to follow each other,\u201d Richard had said the previous evening. \u201cThat\u2019s how an inexperienced group can follow an experienced group on to a path that is way beyond their abilities.\u201d There\u2019s no chance of that mistake today. We are alone. At Black Sail Pass, our entry point on to the ridge, we pause and assess the situation. The cloud is not breaking up, as was forecast, and occasional showers of hail are stinging our faces in a stiffening wind. We start up the ridge and finally get our reward: a brief sunny view north to Scotland across the Solway Firth, with a pearly string of lakes to the south. By the time we reach 892-metre Pillar, however, we are in cloud and the wind gets nasty. We huddle behind a rock for lunch and decide to head back. We retrace our route, reaching the inn in darkness. In some ways, my first ridge walk has been frustrating, but at least I didn\u2019t meet Richard again, in his mountain rescue role. Grade: in good weather the Mosedale Horseshow is a straightforward hike Start: Wasdale Head Inn Map: OS Explorer OL4 Distance: 11 miles Dog-friendly: yes Public transport: nearest station is Seascale (on the Carlisle to Barrow-in-Furness line), a half-hour taxi ride away Lake District: Striding Edge/Helvellyn Grade: a good level of fitness needed Start: Glenridding Map: OS Explorer OL5 Distance: 9 miles Dog friendly: sensible hill hounds only Public transport: 508 bus from Penrith (can also combine with Ullswater steamer) Like Crib Goch and Tryfan in Snowdonia, the Lake District\u2019s Striding Edge is definitely one of those ridges that a walker can fall off. However, if being careful to avoid ice, wind or darkness, there is no reason not to enjoy a magnificent day out. I first tackled it aged 11; Wilf my dog managed it as a puppy and celebrated with his first-ever swim \u2013 in Red Tarn, the chilly little glacial lake under the summit of Helvellyn. This time he is older and wiser: we go up via Striding Edge and come down via its neighbour, the equally demanding Swirral Edge, but he does not swim. Nor do I. Instead, we yomp briskly to my favourite tearoom in Glenridding (the Helvellyn Country Kitchen) and warm up. For sheer spectacular lakeland panoramas, the Striding/Swirral combo is unbeatable. Lake District: Sharp Edge Grade: straightforward in good conditions/challenging when poor Start: park in Scales or Threlkeld Map: OL5 Dog-friendly: sensible hill hounds maybe. I didn\u2019t risk it Distance: 4\u00bd miles Public transport: X4 or X5 bus from Penrith/Keswick Another one to avoid in a high wind, but Sharp Edge is also a classic, all the better for being quieter than Helvellyn. The main peak on this route is Blencathra at 868 metres , which has satanic associations: one etymology of the name is \u201csummit of the devil\u201d. I personally think it\u2019s a little easier than Striding Edge, being shorter, but a lot depends on conditions. If things look dodgy, there is an easy deviation that misses out the worst (or best) bit of the ridge. Start at Scales Farm heading up the hill northwards, climbing to Mousthwaite Comb to get the first view \u2013 hopefully \u2013 of Sharp Edge. Negotiate that, then Foule Crag and reach Blencathra summit. WalkLakes.co.uk has a similar, longer route, taking in Mungrisdale Common. Crib Goch, Snowdonia Grade: Extreme. Take a guide if unsure. Start: Pen-y-Pass Map: OS Explorer OL17 Distance: 7\u00bd miles Dog friendly: No Public transport: Sherpa bus S2 from Betws y Coed I leave Pen-y-Pass at 7am for this one (after claiming the last spot in the car park: be warned!) and take the Pyg track for a short ascent before branching right on to the ridge. Crib Goch is certainly not one for the faint-hearted. This is a walk with remarkable views, often of your white knuckles as they cling to the precarious central line of the ridge. Once that section is managed, there is a serious sting in the tail to negotiate: Garnedd Ugain (1,065 metres), next to Snowdon, a tumble of rocky outcrops where the path is difficult to follow and a moment\u2019s inattention can have painfully nerve-wracking consequences when negotiating broken buttresses and small cliffs. I emerge on the cinder track that follows the railway to Snowdon\u2019s summit \u2013 and the cafe. From here, I take the path down to the jagged crest of Y Lliwedd, then descend to the small glacial lake \u2013 Llyn Llydaw \u2013 enclosed by the two ridges, picking up the Miner\u2019s Track to return to the Pen-y-Pass car park. There is an excellent Youth Hostel right next to it. Tryfan north ridge, Snowdonia Grade: Difficult, prior mountain experience required Start: long version Pen y Pass, shorter Idwal Cottage Map: OL17 Distance: long 11 miles/short 3 miles \u2013 lots of variants possible Dog-friendly: not unless you can pop the pooch in the backpack Public transport: Sherpa bus S2 (for Pen y Pass) or 6B (summer only to Llyn Ogwen) Make a weekend of it in the Youth Hostel at Pen y Pass, doing Crib Goch one day then the less-visited ridge of Tryfan that sits to the north. Head up to the summit of Glyder Fawr, which made headlines in 2010 when it was upgraded from a measly 999 metres to a commanding 1001. From here there\u2019s a circuit of ridges and descents that goes (in anti-clockwise order): Glyder Fach (994), Bristly Ridge, Tryfan north ridge which ends, if doing this direction, at the Cannon Stone, a popular photo opportunity. From here, the normal way curls around Milestone Buttress and down to Llyn Ogwen where there\u2019s a cafe: the Ogwen Snack Bar, in the village of Idwal Cottage. There\u2019s a car park and, for those just wanting to do the north ridge, it\u2019s a three-mile walking circuit from here. On a long summer day, however, the big route is possible, returning to Pen y Pass via Llyn Ogwen and Glyder Fawr. Glen Coe/Aonach Eagach Grade: extreme. Take a guide if unsure Start: Meeting of Three Waters A82 Map: OS Explorer 384 Dog-friendly: no Distance: 9 miles for the full circuit, 6 miles without the road section Public transport: Scottish Citylink 915 To be honest, Scotland has so many great ridge walks that picking one seems ridiculous, but Aonach Eagach is the one I know best; besides, it also has the reputation of being the narrowest ridge walk in Britain, any more knife-like and it would have to be classified as a tightrope. For that reason, wind, weather and season are crucial in planning the day, but the reward is a fabulously exciting day out. The path starts at the parking area by the Meeting of Three Waters waterfall close to the A82 (four miles east of Glencoe visitor centre). It ascends rapidly to the 943-metre peak of Am Bodach, where things immediately get more challenging with a tricky descent to a col (some people use a rope on this bit). From here, climb to Meall Dearg and then comes the highlight, the Pinnacles section which is about 500 metres long. Things ease off a bit to another Munro, Sgorr nam Fiannaidh (967 metres), from whence you descend back down into the valley where the Old Glencoe road leads to the Clachaig Inn for a well-earned pint. Unless using two cars or taking the bus, there\u2019s then a three-mile yomp back up the road to the starting point. Stiperstones, Shropshire Grade: Easy Start: the Bog car park, Stiperstones Inn or Bridges YHA Map: OS Explorer 217 Distance: 8 miles or 4.5 miles without The Rock Dog-friendly: yes Public transport: train to Church Stretton (5 miles away) or 552 bus from Shrewsbury to Stiperstones Inn. There is also a useful weekend summer bus for the area Shropshire\u2019s hill walks are not as famous as those of the Highlands or the Lakes, but Stiperstones is one of the best: a jagged dragon\u2019s back that stretches north-south in parallel with another good ridge, the Long Mynd. By adding on two more outlying outcrops, Nipstone and The Rock, the Stiperstones becomes an eight-mile round trip. The views are spectacular, the kind of thing that might have inspired JRR Tolkein\u2019s Shire: rolling green hills dotted with ancient trees, stepping back in waves to a purple horizon. I hope the path along the ridge was not purpose-built because it\u2019s a tricky potential ankle-breaker of irregular stones winding through heather between each of the Stiperstones, six outcrops of quarzite rock that date back half a billion years.

      "body": "<p>British politics rarely intrudes into a US presidential election. In 1988, Joe Biden was forced to abandon his first bid for the White House after it emerged that he had quoted without attribution a chunk of oratory from the then Labour party leader, Neil Kinnock. In 2016, Donald Trump deployed Nigel Farage as an occasional mascot on the stump, the Brexit victory in that year\u2019s referendum deemed a happy omen that populists could defy the odds and win. In 2020, a third name has surfaced, offered as a cautionary tale to a Democratic party that this week confirmed a septuagenarian radical socialist and longtime backbench rebel as its frontrunner. That name is Jeremy Corbyn.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the Democratic party of the United States to be the Labour party of the United Kingdom,\u201d James Carville, the victorious manager of Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, told audiences on cable TV and in New Hampshire this week, warning that if Democrats nominate Bernie Sanders, they will almost certainly be following Corbyn\u2019s Labour party to defeat.</p> \n<p>On the US campaign trail, journalists, strategists for rival Democratic candidates, and even the occasional voter cite Corbyn in the case against Sanders, offering the result of December\u2019s UK general election as evidence. A week spent in New Hampshire watching the Vermont senator and his opponents do battle provides some answers to the question many US Democrats are asking themselves: is Sanders fated to be America\u2019s Corbyn \u2013 or are the two men, and their two situations, radically different?</p> \n<p>Team Sanders is understandably reluctant to encourage the parallel. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear that on the streets, I heard it in the bubble,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ninaturner\">Nina Turner</a>, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, told the Guardian. \u201cThe talking heads and the elites said it to try to dismantle Senator Bernie Sanders, to say, \u2018Aha, this can\u2019t happen!\u2019\u201d All the same, Turner was keen to add that \u201cboth men have a healthy respect for each other\u201d.</p> \n<p>Yet within minutes of that conversation, the first New Hampshire voter stopped by the Guardian at a polling station in downtown Manchester \u2013 retired airline pilot Paul Demars \u2013 volunteered, unprompted, that he was voting for Sanders even though \u201cI was nervous about the electability business: it\u2019d be a real bummer if he got Corbyn\u2019d\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7521fe8372c77ce95ea9f222054a4ab89c45fa59\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7521fe8372c77ce95ea9f222054a4ab89c45fa59/0_286_4380_2627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders rallies supporters in New Hampshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders rallies supporters in New Hampshire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The similarities between the men are obvious. Both spent decades on the political margins, regarded as perennial troublemakers with no prospect of gaining national power. To their critics, they remain stubbornly stuck in the 1970s; to their admirers, they have stayed unwaveringly true to their principles. They both exude a rumpled authenticity, their appearance \u2013 Sanders\u2019 wayward hair, Corbyn\u2019s beard \u2013 visible proof that they are not careerist politicians of the usual stripe.</p> \n<p>Their messages are similar too. Sanders wants \u201can economy that works for all, not just the 1%\u201d, while Corbyn stood as the champion of \u201cthe many, not the few\u201d. Both are exponents of a particular brand of leftwing populism, offering themselves as tribunes of the hard-working majority against an elite of bankers and billionaires that has rigged the economy in its own favour.</p> \n<p>Both boast of the scale of their ambition. Corbyn trumpeted Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto as the most radical programme in a generation, while the warmup track at a Sanders rally is Tracy Chapman\u2019s Talkin\u2019 Bout a Revolution. Both have promised that victory for them would see their respective countries transformed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"02cb4094-b1e8-4b69-87fd-d857cef8f48f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which each party selects its presidential nominee.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The goal for presidential candidates is to amass a majority of delegates, whose job it is to choose the nominee at the party\u2019s national convention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/12/us-election-2020-simple-guide-electoral-college-primaries\">later in the year</a>.

Sanders\u2019 opponents criticise him for implausibly offering \u201cfree stuff\u201d to voters, just as the last Labour manifesto was lampooned as a wishlist of impossible giveaways. Sanders provokes scepticism from Americans when he says his healthcare plan would not only guarantee free medical care for everyone but also free eyeglasses, hearing aids and dental care. It triggers a chorus of questions about where the money would come from \u2013 a chorus with distinct echoes of the reaction that greeted Labour\u2019s pledge of free broadband along with a series of other costly measures. Some policies are identical, such as free university tuition for all.</p> \n<p>The effect in both cases is to redefine internal party opponents as dull \u201ccentrists\u201d, cautious defenders of the status quo. Corbyn did that to rivals Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall when he ran for the Labour leadership in 2015, and Sanders is doing it to Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar now, just as he did it to Hillary Clinton in 2016. If anything, Sanders goes further. Corbyn never suggested his Labour opponents were agents of the City of London, the way Sanders supporters broke into chants of \u201cWall Street Pete\u201d in New Hampshire last weekend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfd84f2c251b623eb8efd069e3f303eb46e96f6f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfd84f2c251b623eb8efd069e3f303eb46e96f6f/0_86_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn at the launch of the Labour party\u2019s youth manifesto in November 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Which brings us to the followers of both men. The crowds at Sanders rallies are strikingly similar to the audiences that once came out for Corbyn. Huge numbers of young people, especially students, joined by sixty-somethings who are thrilled that, at last, \u201cwe have our party back\u201d. The latter group reckons Sanders is returning the party to the best traditions of Franklin Roosevelt, just as Corbyn liked to invoke the glory of 1945 and Clement Attlee.</p> \n<p>Some Democrats welcome the infusion of much-needed youth and energy that Sanders has brought in, hopeful that the independent senator \u2013 he\u2019s still not a registered Democrat \u2013 might make good on his promise to expand the electorate and bring in previous non-voters. (That was the promise of Corbyn too.) But others lament what they regard as the aggressive intolerance of the \u201cBernie Bros\u201d, accusing them of slamming those who dare voice anything but wholehearted devotion to the leader. A <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/bernie-sanders-social-media-attacks-invs/index.html\">report this week</a> described \u201cthe swarm\u201d that descended on a leftwing organisation that endorsed Elizabeth Warren rather than Sanders, detailing a level of online abuse that would be familiar to those on the wrong end of what they would call \u201cthe Corbyn cult\u201d. When the MSNBC host Chuck Todd quoted an article that had branded Sanders backers digital \u201cbrownshirts\u201d, a hashtag campaign by Sanders defenders soon had #SackChuckTodd trending.</p> \n<p>The result is a wariness in some quarters \u2013 most notably among Sanders\u2019 rivals \u2013 to attack him directly, for fear of stirring his supporters\u2019 wrath. Several US journalists admit, albeit privately, to a similar nervousness at going too directly after Sanders \u2013 a fear that might resonate with at least some of their counterparts in Britain.</p> \n<p>But if there are similarities, there are glaring differences too. Perhaps most significant is that Bernie Sanders has suffered nothing like the protracted onslaught of criticism that rained down on Corbyn, from press and internal party opponents alike, from the moment he became leader. It\u2019s one reason why many Democrats are sceptical of polls showing Sanders would beat Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup. Sanders, they say, has never been on the receiving end of serious negative campaigning or even a thorough trawl through his back catalogue of statements and past affiliations (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/bernie-sanders-campaigned-for-marxist-party-in-reagan-era\">including, for example, to the Socialist Workers </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/bernie-sanders-campaigned-for-marxist-party-in-reagan-era\">party of America</a>). Clinton steered clear of that tactic in 2016, calculating that it would backfire. So Sanders has never experienced the scrutiny that Corbyn endured \u2013 not yet, at any rate. When it comes, say the doubters, his numbers will tank.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/democratic-contest-donald-trump\">The man shaping the Democratic contest? It\u2019s Donald Trump | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, there are some contrasts with Corbyn that might offer Democrats reassurance. For one thing, Sanders has no credible case to answer on antisemitism; on the contrary, he identifies strongly as a Jew. A couple of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/ilhan-omar-antisemitic-tweets-house-democrats-apology\">congressional supporters have made clumsy and insensitive remarks</a>, but that is a world away from the decades-long, personal record of appearances with, and indulgence of, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/09/jews-brexit-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn\">antisemites that proved so toxic for Corbyn</a>.</p> \n<p>Similarly, while Corbyn was often accused of \u201csiding with his country\u2019s enemies\u201d \u2013 note the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeremy-corbyn-paid-iran-press-tv-tortured-journalist-2016-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">\u00a320,000 he was paid to be a presenter on the Iranian state network Press TV </a>or his <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palestinian-lobby-group-paid-for-corbyn-to-meet-assad-in-syria-jv5hrsjfl\">2009 meeting with Bashar al-Assad</a> \u2013 Sanders is rather less vulnerable on that score. Some <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-bernie-sanders-thought-castro-and-the-sandinistas-could-teach-america-a-lesson\">admiring words for Fidel Castro</a> and the Sandinistas, along with a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-bernie-sanderss-1988-10-day-honeymoon-in-the-soviet-union/2019/05/02/db543e18-6a9c-11e9-a66d-a82d3f3d96d5_story.html\">honeymoon in Moscow</a>, are about the most damaging items on the Sanders charge sheet. That\u2019s largely because of a difference in world view between the two men.

For the former MP Paul Sweeney, who lost his Glasgow North East seat to the SNP last December and is advising the deputy leadership candidate Angela Rayner, the task is urgent. \u201cThe new leader needs to spell out what [federalism] means, and have a clearly defined proposal before the 2021 Holyrood elections,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe can\u2019t just stick it in a manifesto, we have to bring it out into communities. That was what was so transformational about the white paper on independence [that the Scottish government published during the 2014 referendum campaign]. We need to take our own version into those communities that voted yes and break the 45/55 impasse.\u201d With the SNP pressing for the powers to hold a second independence referendum, the spectrum of Scottish Labour opinion is clear about the need to offer voters a straight answer on the constitution on the doorstep that is \u201ccompatible and coherent\u201d across the Scottish and UK parties, and will allow them to concentrate on the SNP government\u2019s faltering record on public services. And some ousted MPs believe that this clarity, coupled with the election of a more credible UK leader, could prompt the relatively small swings back to Labour required to re-take cities like Glasgow. There are plenty within Scottish Labour, including Murray and Baillie, who remain implacably opposed to a second vote, but others \u2013 including those younger activists who voted yes in 2014 but were then attracted by Corbyn\u2019s socialist manifesto \u2013 believe that to survive the party must engage with the public mood. Three recent polls have put support for independence above 50%, while the public sector union Unison added to this sense of momentum when its Scottish council voted to back calls for a second referendum at the start of this month. Both Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey have suggested that they would not block a second referendum if there was a Holyrood mandate for it in 2021, resulting in accusations that they were promoting votes for the SNP. Following reports in early January that Leonard was considering backing a second independence referendum with a pro-federal option on the ballot paper, the Scottish executive rejected their leader\u2019s proposal to discuss it at an open conference with the membership. Monica Lennon, Labour\u2019s shadow Scottish health secretary, has spoken out about the party\u2019s need to consider the democratic case for a second referendum as well as the possibility of Scottish Labour breaking away from the UK party. \u201cIt\u2019s in no one\u2019s interests for the 2021 Holyrood election to be a proxy independence referendum, when so much else is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I believe Scottish Labour needs to refresh our policy on independence and the constitution soon, well ahead of the election. The trade union movement in Scotland is doing exactly that and Scottish Labour must engage in that debate, giving all of our members a say, even if that is an uncomfortable debate. \u201cWe need to be bold and brave and confident in our own position, before we can get a fair hearing with voters. Of course there are different opinions within Scottish Labour, with some people remaining strongly opposed to a second referendum forever, but I don\u2019t think that necessarily reflects the wider party or the country.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers who have filled political appointee positions in the Trump administration have been pursued by doubts about their qualifications or caliber. In 2018, a justice department staffer was made acting attorney general, the department\u2019s top job. Last week, the president installed a young friend of his aide Stephen Miller atop a pyramid of 2,500 lawyers as general counsel in the Department of Homeland Security. But there is one Trump appointee whose preparedness has never been questioned. William Barr, 69 and a veteran of 40 years in Washington, was confirmed one year ago as attorney general, a position with broad influence over the administration of justice and broad sway over public faith placed in it. \u201cBarr is particularly effective,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute and veteran of the George W Bush administration, \u201cbecause he\u2019s one of the very few exceptions among Trump appointees \u2013 someone who is both qualified to do the job and has sufficient experience to know how to do it well. \u201cSadly, he has decided to be an enabler.\u201d At the end of a historically turbulent week for the justice department with unknown implications for the country, that combination in Barr \u2013 power plus a knack for wielding it \u2013 has provoked intense alarm in Washington and far beyond. The fear is that Barr\u2019s competence has flipped from virtue to vice owing to a quality that he appears to lack or have lost: judgment in the face of an untethered president. Barr was once seen as a potential check on Trump\u2019s overt desire to take command of the justice department, deploying its investigators and prosecutors at his whim and his will. But this week, critics warn, the attorney general has been revealed as an eager accomplice in eroding norms meant to insulate the criminal justice system from political interference, threatening the bedrock principle of equality before the law. \u201cWe fought a revolution against kingly prerogative,\u201d said Rosenzweig. \u201cAt its most extreme, Trump\u2019s actions post-impeachment in the last week reflect his belief that he really has, as he said, an absolute right to intervene anywhere in the executive branch. And there\u2019s a word for that. \u201cPeople with absolute rights are kings.\u201d Trump has never been coy about his intentions. On Friday morning, he fed the sense of alarm when he insisted that he has \u201cthe legal right\u201d to intervene in criminal cases. But the developments of the past week have changed the public understanding of just how aligned Barr is with the president, and just how extensive his cooperation has been. Those developments included Barr\u2019s intervention in a case involving Trump\u2019s friend Roger Stone, prompting the withdrawal of four career prosecutors; the resignation from government of a prominent former US attorney previously sidelined by Barr; and the issuance of a rare public warning by a federal judge about the independence of the courts. \u201cBill Barr has turned the job of attorney general and the political appointee layer at the top of the justice department on its head,\u201d said Neil Kinkopf, a Georgia State law professor who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel under Bill Clinton. \u201cIn past administrations of both political parties, the function of the political appointees at the justice department has been to insulate the rest of the department from political pressure. And Bill Barr instead has become the conduit for that political pressure.\u201d \u2018Shrewd, careful and full of it\u2019 Barr has not been untouched by the turbulence of the last week. Reported threats of additional resignations drove him on Thursday to grant a TV interview in which he complained that Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d and vowed: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.\u201d A Trump spokesperson said the president\u2019s feelings were not hurt. Barr was said to have warned the White House of what he was going to say. The interview was met with outrage and eye-rolls among critics who saw a wide divergence between what Barr said and everything else he has been doing. \u201cI think Bill Barr is shrewd, deliberate, smart, calculating, careful, and full of it,\u201d tweeted the former US attorney Preet Bharara. The real Barr, critics say, has a 12-month track record as a spearhead for Trump\u2019s attack on justice, beginning with public lies about the report of special counsel Robert Mueller and running through his intervention in the case of Roger Stone. In a prominent early incident among many in which Barr\u2019s loyalty to the president seemed to critics to exceed his loyalty to the nation, Barr called a press conference last April and offered a misleading preview of Mueller\u2019s report. He omitted the report\u2019s detailed description of potential obstruction of justice by Trump and falsely claimed the White House had cooperated fully. In May, Barr assigned a US attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation, an obsession of Trump\u2019s. In July, Barr traveled to London to ask intelligence officials there for help with the investigation. He made a similar trip to Italy in September. Recently, Barr announced the creation of an \u201cintake process\u201d for information gathered by Rudy Giuliani about investigations tied to Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. On Friday, the New York Times reported that Barr had assigned outside prosecutors to review the prosecution of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn and other defendants tied personally to Trump. In August, Barr declined to recuse himself from a justice department review of a whistleblower complaint charging Trump with soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election, despite his being named in the report. The review found no wrongdoing by the president, who survived impeachment over the matter. But no previous action by Barr provoked such a crisis as his intervention this week in the Stone case. In that episode, Barr directed the US attorney\u2019s office in the District of Columbia, which handles many prominent cases with a nexus to the federal government, to revisit its recommendation of seven to nine years in prison for Stone, who was convicted of obstruction of justice and witness tampering among other felonies. It was unclear whether Barr issued his direction before or after a Trump tweet blasting the case as \u201ca horrible and very unfair situation\u201d and a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. In any event, the US attorney, a hand-picked Barr ally, entered a new recommendation for a lighter sentence and the four career prosecutors who signed the original recommendation withdrew from the case in apparent protest. \u201cI do think it is something of a break-the-glass moment because of how overt it is,\u201d said Harry Sandick, a former assistant US attorney in the southern district of New York who helped draft a letter published by the New York City bar association on Wednesday calling for an \u201cimmediate investigation\u201d. Kinkopf said: \u201cThis is a really significant break. This kind of direct, presidential interference in specific ongoing criminal prosecutions is extraordinary. Even for this president and this attorney general.\u201d Barr\u2019s intervention in the Stone case came after he orchestrated a replacement of the head of the prosecutor\u2019s office in Washington, Jessie Liu, under murky circumstances. Liu had been tapped for a Treasury post and was replaced in the US attorney\u2019s office by Timothy Shea, a Barr loyalist. Then, this week, Trump withdrew Liu\u2019s nomination \u2013 and she resigned from government. \u201cOne wonders whether other tweets could lead to people being charged, to people seeking harsher sentences,\u201d said Sandick. \u201cWe watch with concern over the possibility that the US attorney in Washington DC was replaced because of her unwillingness perhaps to charge [former FBI official] Andrew McCabe, or James Comey, or others.\u201d A further Trump attack this week on the judge in the Paul Manafort and Stone cases, as well as the DC prosecutors, prompted a rare rebuke on Thursday from the chief US judge in the District of Columbia, Beryl A Howell. \u201cThe judges of this court base their sentencing decisions on careful consideration of the actual record in the case before them; the applicable sentencing guidelines and statutory factors; the submissions of the parties, the Probation Office and victims; and their own judgment and experience,\u201d Howell said. \u201cPublic criticism or pressure is not a factor.\u201d \u2018Immense suffering, wreckage and misery\u2019 Barr grew up in New York City, graduated from George Washington University law school, served in the Reagan administration and was attorney general under George HW Bush, establishing a record as a hardliner on gang violence and immigration and advocating for pardons in the Iran-Contra affair. He is a devout Catholic, describing in a speech in October at the University of Notre Dame how the American experiment depends on the advance of \u201cJudeo-Christian moral standards\u201d and attacking \u201cmilitant secularists\u201d whose \u201ccampaign to destroy the traditional moral order has brought with it immense suffering, wreckage and misery\u201d. Barr\u2019s long career in public life led some justice department veterans to welcome his nomination as attorney general in late 2018, given concerns about who else Trump might pick. \u201cInitially there was some hope that he would be an attorney general in the traditional model,\u201d said Rosenzweig. \u201cAnd I confess that myself, I thought that would be the case and I thought it would be a pretty traditional appointment. \u201cAnd he has been a grave disappointment.\u201d But there were also warnings about Barr, particularly attached to a memo he submitted to the department arguing that Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump for alleged obstruction of justice was \u201cfatally misconceived\u201d. Kinkopf was among those who warned that Barr\u2019s view of executive power was dangerously expansive, telling the Guardian it \u201ccomes very close to putting the president above the law\u201d. But there was room to believe at the time that Barr\u2019s theories would remain theories, Kinkopf says now. \u201cEven among people who have advocated that theory of presidential power,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are very longstanding norms in the justice department and the White House about respecting the independence of the justice department.\u201d Barr has not vindicated his supporters, Kinkopf said. \u201cHis theory is that the constitution allows for this, but good-faith service in the office of president and the office of attorney general maintains the credibility and the apolitical nature of law enforcement. That had long been the norm regardless of one\u2019s view of presidential power. \u201cBarr has completely obliterated that.\u201d",

The achievement is all the remarkable since, when he first announced his bid in November, he seemed to arouse little voter excitement in California and was greeted with deep skepticism by many of the state\u2019s more seasoned political professionals.    What changed?    The short answer may be that Democratic voters are now thinking defensively. In other words, they are more interested in supporting a candidate capable of defeating Trump than in finding one who best represents their own world view.    And it\u2019s not just Bloomberg\u2019s money that appeals to them \u2013 or even his trenchant twitter battles with the president demonstrating that he refuses to be bullied.  He has a strong record on combatting gun violence and climate change, two issues that play particularly well in the Golden State.

That\u2019s especially true of minority voters who now have an all-white field to choose from even though they make up close to half of the Democratic primary electorate. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an Obama. The expectation is different,\u201d said Steve Phillips, a political fundraiser, podcaster and commentator who heads the San Francisco-based organization Democracy in Color. \u201cYounger African Americans still want the right person, while older folks want any person that can get rid of Trump. That is the essential dynamic.\u201d    Phillips questioned how much damage stop-and-frisk or other racial controversies can do to Bloomberg because he saw no other candidate still in the race with the moral authority to call him on it effectively. \u201cAll these people are flawed messengers,\u201d he said.    In California, Bloomberg may be further helped by the fact that only 6 percent of the electorate is African American and Latinos, who make up 35 percent of the electorate, tend turn out in numbers well short of their demographic strength.    Bloomberg\u2019s imperfections have not just been visible from a distance. On the day of the Iowa caucus, he tried to forge a pop culture connection with an audience in Compton, the birthplace of gangsta rap in the southern Los Angeles suburbs, by referring to the previous day\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show. But he mangled the name Shakira \u2013 a singer he had in fact met in 2007 \u2013 and thus made himself seem more, not less, out of touch.    Such blunders, while small on their own, risk drawing attention to another potential liability \u2013 his age. If part of Biden\u2019s slide has been due to the perception that he is past his prime, Bloomberg may not want to remind voters that he too is 77 years old. His whole strategy, according to campaign insiders, has been to bet on Biden fading and to fill the resultant void.    According to the rapidly shifting poll numbers, the bet seems to be paying off so far. But it remains to be seen if the Bloomberg surge continues, as voters take a closer look at him and, assuming he agrees to participate, see him in his first candidates\u2019 debate next week.   Since Bloomberg is not participating in either the Nevada caucus or the South Carolina primary, there is also a danger that former Biden supporters,  and his black and Latino supporters in particular, could coalesce around a different Democrat in those races and thus steal Bloomberg\u2019s momentum heading into Super Tuesday.   Bloomberg\u2019s campaign team is confident, however, that they have given him such an organizational advantage in California and the other Super Tuesday states that the momentum will be with him when it matters.    Myers, his California state director, said he expected Bloomberg to return to the Golden State at least before March 3 and to continue to emphasize his interest in places that other candidates tend to ignore \u2013 the farm country of the Central Valley and some of the heavily Latino inland suburbs of LA.    \u201cWe are in these communities,\u201d Myers said. \u201cNot only do we have validators, we also have people the ground, listening to what people are saying and talking about what Mike\u2019s record is.

      "bodyText": "Californians know a thing or two about self-funded business moguls who attempt to spend their way to high political office in their state. And what they know is, those candidates almost always lose. Michael Bloomberg, though, is betting he will be different from the Meg Whitmans and Carly Fiorinas of past elections and that California\u2019s Democratic primary \u2013 along with 13 other contests being held on Super Tuesday, 3 March \u2013 will be the coming-out party that enshrines him as the national candidate most likely to beat Donald Trump. Bloomberg is putting his money where his mouth is, spending unprecedented tens of millions of dollars on television advertising, opening offices in cities big and small across the state, hiring a full-time staff of 300 people and counting, and racking up high-profile endorsements. All of these efforts are designed to ram home the message that he is in it to win it and can outspend anybody, even the sizeable Republican money machine working at full tilt to keep Trump in the White House for another four years. \u201cThis is the biggest presidential primary operation in California history,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s state director, Chris Masami Myers, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re literally doing everything you could possibly do.\u201d The one thing even Bloomberg\u2019s millions can\u2019t do is buy the support of a plurality of voters in one of the most diverse states in the nation. But his message is certainly starting to resonate, propelling him from the low single digits in opinion polls as recently as late January to 13% \u2013 ahead of the former vice-president Joe Biden \u2013 in a Capitol Weekly poll this week. That boost in support has gone into overdrive since the chaotic Iowa caucus on 3 February, a New Hampshire race that left the central Democratic lane deeply divided, and the precipitous decline in Biden\u2019s fortunes after months as the race\u2019s presumptive frontrunner. Despite swirling controversies over Bloomberg\u2019s support of discriminatory stop-and-frisk policing when he was mayor of New York, new controversies over his treatment of women and the role he believes black and Latino homeowners may have played in triggering the 2008 financial collapse, he has racked up strong polling numbers even among minority voters. The achievement is all the more remarkable since he didn\u2019t compete in the first primary and caucuses, aroused little voter excitement in California upon announcing his presidential bid, and was greeted with deep skepticism by many of the state\u2019s more seasoned political professionals. What changed? The short answer may be that Democratic voters are now thinking defensively. In other words, they are more interested in supporting a candidate capable of defeating Trump than in finding one who best represents their own worldview. And it\u2019s not just Bloomberg\u2019s money that appeals to them \u2013 or even his trenchant Twitter battles with the president demonstrating that he refuses to be bullied. He has a strong record on combatting gun violence and the climate crisis, two issues that play particularly well in the Golden State. He is genuinely revered by municipal leaders \u2013 including high-profile black mayors like San Francisco\u2019s London Breed and the young rising star Michael Tubbs of Stockton \u2013 who have won grants and other forms of support from his foundation. And, unlike past plutocrats who have entered the electoral arena in California based on their business record alone, he has a solid record in public office to point to thanks to his three terms as mayor of New York. Then there\u2019s the rest of the Democratic field, which strikes many voters as underwhelming and is spurring many of them to think that the flaws of any given candidate may not be as important, in the end, as the imperative to win. That\u2019s especially true of minority voters who now have an all-white field to choose from even though they make up close to half of the Democratic primary electorate. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an Obama. The expectation is different,\u201d said Steve Phillips, a political fundraiser, podcaster and commentator who heads the San Francisco-based organization Democracy in Color. \u201cYounger African Americans still want the right person, while older folks want any person that can get rid of Trump. That is the essential dynamic.\u201d Phillips questioned how much damage stop-and-frisk or other racial controversies could do to Bloomberg because he saw no other candidate still in the race with the moral authority to call him on it effectively. \u201cAll these people are flawed messengers,\u201d he said. Phillips spoke before the Washington Post published a major expose of Bloomberg\u2019s treatment of women going back decades and the legal settlements he and his company have repeatedly reached in an attempt to stop their complaints from becoming public. In California, Bloomberg may be helped by the fact that the electorate tends to be more centrist than progressive \u2013 Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders by seven points in the 2016 Democratic primary. Only 6% of the electorate is African American, and Latinos, who make up 35%, have historically turned out in numbers well short of their demographic strength. Bloomberg\u2019s imperfections have not just been visible from a distance. On the day of the Iowa caucus, he tried to forge a pop culture connection with an audience in Compton, the birthplace of gangsta rap in the southern Los Angeles suburbs, by referring to the previous day\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show. But he mangled the name Shakira \u2013 a singer he had in fact met in 2007 \u2013 and thus made himself seem more, not less, out of touch. Such blunders, while small on their own, risk drawing attention to another potential liability \u2013 his age.

Beijing has a population of more than 20 million people and the annual National People\u2019s Congress, where thousands of Communist Party delegates pour into the city, is due to start on 5 March. \u201cFrom now on, all those who have returned to Beijing should stay at home or submit to group observation for 14 days after arriving,\u201d Beijing\u2019s virus prevention working group said in a notice cited by the Beijing Daily. \u201cThose who refuse to accept home or centralised observation and other prevention and control measures will be held accountable under the law,\u201d it said. A National Health Commission official Liang Wannian told a news conference the government would continue to try to contain the spread of virus in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province \u2013 the centre of the outbreak. The commission was focused on lowering the fatality rate and reducing the infection rate, Liang said. The number of deaths in Hubei rose by 139 as of Friday, with 107 of those in Wuhan. A total of 1,123 people in Wuhan had died from the coronavirus. Wang Hesheng, the new head of Hubei\u2019s Health Commission, vowed to find and treat everyone affected by the virus, the state-run Global Times said. Wang was one of several high-level appointees flown in to Hubei province in the past week to take over from sacked local officials. It followed public anger over the death in Wuhan of whistleblower doctor, Li Wenliang, who succumbed to the virus. China has been struggling to get the world\u2019s second largest economy going after the lunar new year holiday, which was extended by 10 days to help contain the virus. The Global Times reported that China\u2019s banks have offered $77bn in lines of credit to help combat the epidemic. The central government has also pumped tens of billions into the country\u2019s financial system. Meanwhile the White House economics advisor, Larry Kudlow, said he expected the virus to \u201cmaybe\u201d knock 0.2-0.3% off the US GDP in the first quarter. The number of trade fairs, sports events and industry conferences in China and overseas that have been affected by the spread of the virus continued to increase. International Business Machines Corp (IBM) said on Friday it had canceled its participation in the RSA cyber security conference in San Francisco at the end of February due to coronavirus-related concerns. Earlier, Facebook said it had cancelled its global marketing summit scheduled for next month, also in San Francisco, over worry about the same risks. The Mobile World Congress (MWC), the annual telecoms industry gathering in Barcelona, was also cancelled after a mass exodus by exhibitors linked to the coronavirus. Organisers of next week\u2019s gymnastics World Cup in Melbourne said on Saturday the entire Chinese team had pulled out due to travel restrictions. A top Chinese official, in an interview with Reuters, acknowledged that the coronavirus was a huge challenge, but defended the government\u2019s management of the epidemic and lashed out at the \u201coverreaction\u201d of some countries. State Councillor Wang Yi, who also serves as China\u2019s foreign minister, said China had taken decisive measures to fight the epidemic, many going beyond international health regulations and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. \u201cThrough our efforts the epidemic is overall under control,\u201d he said. Outside mainland China, there have been nearly 450 cases in some 28 countries and territories, and three deaths. Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. The virus is killing about 2% of those infected, but has spread faster than other respiratory viruses that emerged this century. A WHO-led joint mission with China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the new coronavirus is spreading and its severity, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

The prognosticators at FiveThirtyEight give Bernie Sanders the <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">same odds </a>of winning the nomination as a contested convention. <br></p> <p>The rationale: muddled results in Iowa and New Hampshire, a weak frontrunner and at least five leading candidates have committed to staying in the race until Super Tuesday, when roughly 40% of the overall delegates are allocated. It\u2019s there they will meet a sixth candidate, <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong>, whose unorthodox campaign and unparalleled financial resources will like shake up the race further at that stage. </p> <p>It\u2019s been decades since either party arrived at their convention without a nominee, but anxiety is growing this cycle and the campaigns are drawing up plans in the unlikely event this year is different. This comes as moderate and establishment are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of nominating a democratic socialist to take on Trump. </p> <p>Sanders this week warned of a scenario in which Democratic insiders try to overrule a frontrunner who arrives at the convention with a plurality, but not a majority, of delegates. However, such an outcome would be allowed under the rules agreed to after 2016 by Sanders\u2019 allies in collaboration with the party. </p> <p>\u201cThe convention would have to explain to the American people, \u2018Hey, candidate X got the most votes and won the most delegates at the primary process, but we\u2019re not going to give him or her the nomination,\u2019\u201d Sanders said on MSNBC. <strong>\u201cI think that would be a divisive moment for the Democratic Party.\u201d</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e46a8d58f086a28115abc31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T14:11:53.297Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hello \u2013 this is Lauren Gambino in Washington taking over from Paul Owen</strong>.

I wouldn\u2019t be among that group, to be honest with you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5a7815d3228c790afde53cc014398c32f64c03d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5a7815d3228c790afde53cc014398c32f64c03d/0_266_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pete Buttigieg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pete Buttigieg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e467d3c8f086a28115aba5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T11:01:43.775Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two leading Republican voices <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/us/politics/william-barr-trump.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_200214&amp;campaign_id=2&amp;instance_id=15978&amp;segment_id=21266&amp;user_id=0efc432f77b540affba7c95c094bc5e0&amp;regi_id=715647290214\">came out in favour</a> of Barr in the dispute yesterday, with Senator Mitch McConnell, the party\u2019s leader in the Senate, saying: \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, maybe the president should listen.\u201d</p> <p>Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally who was scathing about the impeachment trial against the president, said Barr was \u201cthe right man at the right time to reform the department and stand up for the rule of law\u201d.<br></p> <p>Perhaps more significant in terms of influencing Trump\u2019s response was feedback from his favourite TV channel, Fox News.</p> <p>Sean Hannity put a brave face on the dispute, stressing to viewers that Barr had said Trump had not discussed Stone\u2019s sentencing with him. \u201cIn fact, the attorney general, he takes orders from no one,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cAnd by the way, he shouldn\u2019t.

US attorney general William Barr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/william-barr-trump-twitter-justice-department\">made an unexpected intervention</a> into the ballooning controversy over Donald Trump\u2019s interference in the trial of his friend Roger Stone</strong>.</p> <p>Barr \u2013 seen as a staunch Trump loyalist \u2013 publicly rebuked the president, saying that Trump\u2019s tweets about the Stone case \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d and adding that he would not be \u201cbullied or influenced\u201d over justice department decisions. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/barr-blasts-trumps-tweets-stone-case-impossible-job/story?id=68963276&amp;cid=social_twitter_wnt\">told ABC</a>.<br></p> <p>The attorney general claimed Trump \u201chas never asked me to do anything in a criminal case\u201d, but he acknowledged the president\u2019s comments undercut his authority.</p> <p>The initial reaction from the White House was relatively calm. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president \u201cwasn\u2019t bothered\u201d by Barr\u2019s comments, adding: \u201c[Barr] has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions. President Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people against injustices in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Whether that line holds when Trump gets up this morning and begins his effective use of social media for the day remains to be seen. The president has a low tolerance for criticism, whether from friends or enemies \u2013 as former chief of staff John Kelly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227986935240691712\">saw yesterday</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227986935240691712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When I terminated John Kelly, which I couldn\u2019t do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasn\u2019t for him. He came in with a bang, went out with a whimper, but like so many X\u2019s, he misses the action &amp; just can\u2019t keep his mouth shut,.</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227986935240691712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Barr\u2019s motivations are also in question. He has been called to testify to Congress about alleged political interference at the justice department, and may be preparing the groundwork for that. He may also be attempting to save his reputation \u2013 which has been shredded since he joined the Trump administration last year, particularly after his handling of the Mueller report. </p> <p>Barr characterized the report in ways that appeared to absolve Trump of wrongdoing on numerous occasions, even though the redacted version of the Mueller report released in April 2019 showed nearly a dozen instances in which the president or his campaign sought to obstruct justice.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/us/politics/william-barr-trump.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_200214&amp;campaign_id=2&amp;instance_id=15978&amp;segment_id=21266&amp;user_id=0efc432f77b540affba7c95c094bc5e0&amp;regi_id=715647290214\">New York Times suggests</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The attorney general had been contemplating how to respond since he became aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the department, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Speaking up could have put Mr. Barr at risk of losing the backing of the president, but remaining silent would have permitted Mr. Trump to continue attacking law enforcement and all but invited open revolt among the some 115,000 employees of the Justice Department.</p> <p>Ultimately, Mr. Barr concluded that he had to speak out to preserve his ability to do his job effectively, the person said \u2026 The attorney general had let the president know some of what he planned to say and is remaining in his job, a person familiar with the events said.</p> </blockquote> <p>The attorney general\u2019s rebuke comes amid an intensifying fallout over the Stone case, after the justice department overruled its own prosecutors who had recommended that Stone, a longtime Trump ally and confidant, be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. The four prosecutors on the case subsequently resigned in protest. Stone is due to be sentenced on 20 February. </p> <p>We\u2019ll cover the continuing fallout from this and all US political news here throughout the day.</p> <p>Trump is heading to Mar-a-Lago after his meetings today, while the Democratic candidates competing to take him on in November continue to campaign across the country. Bernie Sanders will be in North Carolina and Texas; Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and California; and Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer in Nevada. <br></p> <p>Oh, and by the way: </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/14/are-they-mean-donald-trump-obsessed-with-badgers-new-book-claims\">'Are they mean?'

      "bodyText": "Kari Paul here, logging off for the night. Here is the news of the last few hours: The Trump administration has promised to deploy specially trained tactical border patrol units to crack down on sanctuary cities across the US. Attorneys for Roger Stone demanded a new trial on Friday. Donald Trump tweeted in memory of the Parkland, Florida massacre that killed 17 people two years ago today. Bill de Blasio, the New York Mayor, has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor, has officially endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, the Sanders campaign said on Friday. De Blasio himself made a bid for the White House in September but dropped out after just a few weeks. He will travel with Sanders to Nevada on Sunday ahead of the state\u2019s caucuses on 22 February. \u201cNew Yorkers know all too well the damage caused by Donald Trump\u2019s xenophobia, bigotry and recklessness, and Bernie is the candidate to take him on and take him down,\u201d the announcement quoted de Blasio as saying. \u201cI have called for a bold, progressive agenda, and that\u2019s exactly what Senator Sanders has championed for decades.\u201d In 2016, de Blasio endorsed Hillary Clinton over Sanders, but later said he believes Sanders could have beaten Trump. On Friday, Donald Trump offered condolences on Twitter to commemorate two years since the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people. The president said he met with family members of victims earlier this week. Indeed Trump invited families of those killed to the White House to discuss school safety and developed an online tool to prevent violence. Not all families were invited to the event, however. In a move that has been called \u201cvengeful\u201d, one parent was left out. Fred Guttenberg, the parent of a 14-year-old girl who was killed in the Parkland shooting, was not allowed. He was forced to leave the State of the Union after shouting during the president\u2019s address. \u201cI wish the families well today and I hope that they have a great meeting\u201d, he said. \u201cMy issue with the public schedule remains however as it is not accurate and considering this week is two years since this happened, this should have been handled differently by the White House.\u201d Attorneys for Roger Stone demanded a new trial on Friday, as the ally of Donald Trump awaits sentencing on charges of witness tampering and lying to Congress. The request comes after Trump sent out tweets on Thursday suggesting the trial was unfair. \u201cNow it looks like the fore person in the jury, in the Roger Stone case, had significant bias,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cAdd that to everything else, and this is not looking good for the \u2018Justice\u2019 Department.\u201d Stone was convicted in November of tampering with a witness and obstructing the congressional investigation into whether the Trump campaign orchestrated interference in the 2016 elections. The legal motion could delay sentencing for Stone, which was scheduled for 20 February. The Trump administration will soon deploy more aggressive border patrol methods in sanctuary cities, the New York Times reported on Friday. Specially trained tactical units that function as the \u201cSWAT of Border Patrol\u201d will assist local Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) units to enforce immigration laws, anonymous officials familiar with the secretive mission told the Times. They will begin operating in sanctuary cities around the country, including Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, New Orleans, Detroit, and Newark, New Jersey. The deployment of these teams represents an escalation of Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing fight against \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, localities that decline to prosecute immigrants for deportation and allow them to stay. Kari Paul here, your friendly San Francisco tech reporter, hopping on the blog for the next few hours. Stay tuned for more updates. It\u2019s been a steady news day in Washington. To recap: The DOJ declined to pursue criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI. Attorney general William Barr has assigned an outside prosecutor to scrutinize the criminal case against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, according to multiple news outlets including the New York Times and CNN. Trump said he didn\u2019t interfere in the Roger Stone case, but that he had the \u201clegal right\u201d to do so if he wanted to. Michael Avenatti has been found guilty in the Nike extortion trial. New polling out of Nevada and South Carolina contained good news for Bernie Sanders, the party\u2019s new frontrunner. US negotiators have reached a temporary truce with the Taliban to reduce violence in Afghanistan, which they hope will pave the way to a more formal ceasefire. New York mayor Bill de Blasio, who ended a short-lived White House bid in September, will endorse Bernie Sanders for president, according to the New York Times. The mayor, an unapologetic progressive, endorsed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. It was a tortured decision and De Blasio later said he believes Sanders would have beaten Trump. The US and the Taliban have agreed to a temporary truce to reduce violation in Afghanistan, a deal that, if successful, could lead to an official cease-fire, the start of peace negotiations with Afghan leaders and, eventually the withdrawal of US troops from the country. According to the Associated Press: The official said the agreement for a seven-day \u201creduction in violence\u201d is \u201cvery specific\u201d and covers the entire country, including Afghan government forces. There were indications a formal announcement could come as early as the weekend. The official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Taliban had committed to a halt in roadside and suicide bombings as well as rocket attacks. The official said the U.S. would monitor the truce and determine if there were any violations. Read more here. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib joined protests for airline catering workers in Detroit. This is how she began her political career and she vowed not to change. Previous reports said she had been arrested at the protest but in fact she just sat with the workers in solidarity. Trump is departing Washington for Mar-a-Lago this weekend. But no chopper talk before he leaves. According to a pool report, Trump and Melania Trump boarded Marine One without taking any questions. We\u2019ve got some new polling out of South Carolina. According to an ECU poll released today, 28% of likely Democratic primary voters in South Carolina favor the Joe Biden, dropping nine percentage points since its last survey, conducted before the Iowa caucuses. Meanwhile, Sanders is closing in on Biden\u2019s lead, at 20% with Steyer dropping to third at 14%. Among likely voters who are African American, Biden leads with 36% compared with Sanders at 20% and Steyer with 17%. But the poll found a significant generational divide among the state\u2019s African American electorate. African American voters who are 55 and older prefer Biden by a wide margin while Sanders holds a narrow lead among African Americans voters younger than 55. The poll suggests that the results of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary have had an impact. After two dismal showings, Biden\u2019s standing has dropped significantly in South Carolina, where he has staked his political fortunes. Meanwhile, Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar are all enjoying a bump in the state. Still, Buttigieg and Klobuchar register only 4% and 1% support among likely African American voters, a critical constituency in the state and in the Democratic party. Well, this is awkward. For the record, the answer is Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, or as he is commonly known, AMLO. Also during his remarks Trump understated the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the US. He said there had been 12, when the CDC confirmed a 15th case on Thursday. A New York Times report on the White House\u2019s tepid response to the outbreak revealed that public health experts fear Trump\u2019s \u201cextreme fear of germs, disdain for scientific and bureaucratic expertise and suspicion of foreigners could be a dangerous mix, should he wind up overseeing a severe outbreak at home.\u201d At the moment, Trump is addressing the National Border Security Council. He just said that he wanted to build his wall the \u201cold-fashioned way\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s throw up concrete. Plank!\u201d he said, explaining that he was persuaded that the wall needed to be transparent by stories about drug dealers catapulting 150lbs-200lbs-bags of drugs over the border wall. \u201cSometimes it would actually hit Border Patrol agents and other people on the other side because you couldn\u2019t see through,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as soon as they said that, that\u2019s what got me, I was like, you\u2019re right. You\u2019ve got to be able to see what\u2019s on the other side.\u201d He also said the wall will be too hot to touch in the baking desert sun and suggested that those trying to climb it would need serious athleticism and access to a hose. In other news, Michael Avenatti, a fallen hero of the anti-Trump resistance, was found guilty on all charges related to an attempt to extort Nike. He was convicted by a jury in federal court in New York on Friday afternoon. The revelation that Barr privately ordered an outside prosecutor to examine several high-profile cases, including one involving Flynn, comes days after Barr faced public outcry for intervening in the case of Roger Stone, a Trump confidante. That decision led four career prosecutors to quit the case and raised fears about the impartiality of the Justice Department and Trump\u2019s attorney general. \u201cThis is a crisis of credibility,\u201d Sasha Samberg-Champion, a former federal appellate attorney now with Relman Colfax told The Guardian recently. \u201cNobody knows whether decisions are being made based on the facts and the law, or whether they are based on a political whim.\u201d Read more by Ed Pilkington here: The New York Times is reporting that attorney general Barr has assigned an outside prosecutor to \u201cscrutinize the criminal case\u201d against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. The review is highly unusual and could trigger more accusations of political interference by top Justice Department officials into the work of career prosecutors. Mr. Barr has also installed a handful of outside prosecutors to broadly review the handling of other politically sensitive national-security cases in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington, the people said. The team includes at least one prosecutor from the office of the United States attorney in St. Louis, Jeff Jensen, who is handling the Flynn matter, as well as prosecutors from the office of the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen. This comes less than an hour after news broke that the DOJ would not pursue criminal charges against McCabe. The Guardian has not independently confirmed this report. A bipartisan trio of US senators traveled to Ukraine with a message: let\u2019s move on from impeachment, according to Reuters. \u201cI think we all are confident that President Zelenskiy does not want to be involved in U.S. politics, and we hope that any pressure (that) existed in the past to do so is over,\u201d Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said after meeting the Ukrainian leader, Reuters reported from Kiev. \u201cOur message is we want to put this impeachment question behind us, and we want to be moving together, Republicans and Democrats, in supporting Ukraine.\u201d Murphy was accompanied to Kiev by Republican Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and John Barrasso of Wyoming. A July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy was at the heart of the impeachment charges against the US president, who was accused of withholding aid to Ukraine until the country agreed to investigate his political rivals. Speaking of the Nevada caucuses, a new survey out of the famously hard to poll Silver State contains some good news for Bernie Sanders, who is now the Democratic frontrunner. Sanders is betting big on support from young Latinx primary voters. Nevada will provide an early test ahead of Super Tuesday, where Sanders has invested heavily in courting California\u2019s Latinx voters. As in Iowa, a minimum threshold of 15% is required in each precinct in order to achieve viability. But unlike the Iowa caucuses, Nevada residents can vote early. Starting on Saturday and continuing through Tuesday, residents can cast their ballot in more than 80 polling locations, many of them on the Las Vegas strip. Surprise! Trump will extend his stay in Las Vegas so that it backs up fairly closely to the Nevada caucuses on 22 February. Trump has enjoyed counter-programming critical primary events in Iowa and New Hampshire to steal the attention from Democrats and gin up support from his base. Melania Trump is spending Valentine\u2019s Day decorating cookies and making heart-shaped wreaths with children at the National Institutes of Health. Here\u2019s a sampling of how other politicians are celebrating the day and some are much better at it than others. The Department of Justice announced on Friday that it would not pursue criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI and a frequent target of Trump\u2019s wrath. Trump had publicly called on the department to take action against McCabe, who became acting head of the agency after the president fired FBI director James Comey in 2017. A lawyer for McCabe says that \u201cjustice has been done\u201d. A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that the Trump administration violated the law by allowing Arkansas to impose work requirements on their Medicaid programs for lower-income residents. Arkansas moved forward the first ever work requirements in Medicaid in 2018. Kentucky has also imposed restrictions though its plans were blocked by a trial judge and the state\u2019s new Democratic governor rescinded the plan. The issue has long divided Republicans and Friday\u2019s ruling comes as other conservative states consider e requirements. The ruling is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, tweeted on Friday: \u201cOur democracy is in crisis.\u201d Congressman Adam Schiff, who led the prosecution team in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, has called attorney general Barr an \u201caccomplice to trump\u2019s attack on the rule of law.\u201d Trump enjoys sowing division in the Democratic primary race, as the party\u2019s hopefuls battle for a chance to take him on. As such, Trump frequently claims that the Democratic party is attempting to rig the primary against Sanders, in an effort to inflame the long-simmering tensions supporters of the Vermont senator and the DNC. Yet, there is reason to question the sincerity of his concern for Sanders\u2019 standing. By many accounts, Trump\u2019s allies want to run against Sanders, who they believe can be easily targeted with attacks on his political ideology. As a caveat, campaigns are very bad at picking their opponents. Hillary Clinton\u2019s team was eager to take on Trump, assuming he\u2019d be the easiest to defeat. Trump is tweeting again, this time about his disappointment that senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the few Democrats willing to work with the president, voted to convict him. But he is also quite pleased with his support among Republicans. Nevada\u2019s most politically powerful Culinary Union announced on Thursday that it would not endorse a candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary. But it has not stayed quiet. In a pamphlet distributed to its 130,000 members, the union warned against supporting Sanders and Warren over their embrace of Medicare for all. The union is strongly opposed to a government-run healthcare system, which would replace their hard-won health insurance plan. In a statement Wednesday, Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline said Sanders supporters have \u201cviciously attacked\u201d the union since it began sharing the flyer with members. The Nevada Independent on Friday published some of the threatening calls, emails and tweets directed at union officials. Some officials were attacked over their Latin American heritage and others reported that their personal information was shared online. \u201cThis is your chance to fix your mistake before the millions and millions of Bernie Sanders supporters will find you and end your ability to earn a living,\u201d one of the email says, according to the Nevada Independent. \u201cWe will find you corrupt mother fuckers of that you can be sure and we will make sure you wallow in poverty and suffering.\u201d \u201cApologize and fix your mistake or else you will pay \u2026 I know tens of thousands of Bernie supporters and we will come after you fascist imbeciles,\u201d it continues. \u201c#Bernie2020 #NotMeUs.\u201d Sanders has come under scrutiny for his reticence to condemn his \u201cinternet army,\u201d which he insists he cannot control. But his critics have been forced to hire security and even change their phone number after sustained online harassment by some of his supporters. In a statement Thursday, Sanders condemned \u201charassment in all forms\u201d and urged \u201csupporters of all campaigns not to engage in bullying or ugly personal attacks.\u201d \u201cWe can certainly disagree on issues, but we must do it in a respectful manner,\u201d he said. He went further in an interview with PBS Newshour: \u201cAnybody making personal attacks against anybody else in my name is not part of our movement.\u201d Read the full story here. It\u2019s a quadrennial thought experiment, entertained by journalists and pooh-poohed by party insiders, that a competitive primary race will result in a contested convention. Speculation reached fever pitch in 2016, before Trump sewed up the nomination. Nevertheless, we are here again. The prognosticators at FiveThirtyEight give Bernie Sanders the same odds of winning the nomination as a contested convention. The rationale: muddled results in Iowa and New Hampshire, a weak frontrunner and at least five leading candidates have committed to staying in the race until Super Tuesday, when roughly 40% of the overall delegates are allocated. It\u2019s there they will meet a sixth candidate, Michael Bloomberg, whose unorthodox campaign and unparalleled financial resources will like shake up the race further at that stage. It\u2019s been decades since either party arrived at their convention without a nominee, but anxiety is growing this cycle and the campaigns are drawing up plans in the unlikely event this year is different. This comes as moderate and establishment are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of nominating a democratic socialist to take on Trump. Sanders this week warned of a scenario in which Democratic insiders try to overrule a frontrunner who arrives at the convention with a plurality, but not a majority, of delegates. However, such an outcome would be allowed under the rules agreed to after 2016 by Sanders\u2019 allies in collaboration with the party. \u201cThe convention would have to explain to the American people, \u2018Hey, candidate X got the most votes and won the most delegates at the primary process, but we\u2019re not going to give him or her the nomination,\u2019\u201d Sanders said on MSNBC. \u201cI think that would be a divisive moment for the Democratic Party.\u201d Hello \u2013 this is Lauren Gambino in Washington taking over from Paul Owen. (Thanks Paul!) Today the president heads to Mar-a-Lago, aka the winter White House, but not before we see him speak to National Border Patrol Council Members this afternoon. Meanwhile, the leading 2020 Democratic hopefuls are fanning out around the country ahead of next week\u2019s caucuses in Nevada, the South Carolina primary and what\u2019s being called the \u201cbig Kahuna\u201d of the nominating contest, Super Tuesday. But the big morning news is another tweet from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. An emboldened president earlier assailed the sentencing recommendation of his convicted friend Roger Stone. The Department of Justice, led by attorney general Barr, intervened to lessen the recommendation, eliciting praise from Trump and setting off alarm among prosecutors. In an interview with ABC on Thursday, Barr said the president\u2019s tweets about about the Justice Department \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we\u2019re doing our work with integrity\u201d. On Friday, Trump quoted from that interview in a tweet, saying that while he never asked Barr to intervene directly in a criminal case, he had the \u201clegal right\u201d to do so. Trump is up and about, and giving us his first \u2013 relatively restrained \u2013 response to William Barr\u2019s criticism last night (see earlier). To summarise: I didn\u2019t interfere in the Roger Stone case, but I could have if I wanted to, and if I had, that would have been fine. But I didn\u2019t. 5/5 Bernie Sanders America\u2019s leading socialist won the New Hampshire primary without any of the confusion that surrounded last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses (which still don\u2019t have an official winner). On top of that the field of centrists who oppose him continues to fracture \u2013 with Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar now jostling for space with former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, ex-VP Joe Biden and (soon) billionaire businessman and former mayor of New York Michael Bloomerg. If that split endures, Sanders could end up winning the most delegates in the Democratic race \u2013 although perhaps not a majority. That would usher in a second round in which elected officials and party bigwigs or \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2013 many of whom seem terrified at the prospect of a Sanders win \u2013 get to play a role, raising the prospect of a hugely contentious battle at the end of the primary process. 4/5 Amy Klobuchar The Minnesota centrist was this week\u2019s surprise success story, jumping from single figures in the polls to win nearly 20% of the vote in New Hampshire and place third. Whether Klobuchar can keep this momentum rolling into Nevada and South Carolina is very much up for debate \u2013 like Buttigieg, she has negligible support among the minorities whose votes are crucial in those states \u2013 but for now she has been thrown an unexpected lifeline. She\u2019ll try to make the most of it with another memorable debate performance in Las Vegas on 19 February. 3/5 Donald Trump Voting to acquit Donald Trump in his impeachment trial last week, moderate Republican senator Susan Collins said: \u201cI believe that the president has learned from this case\u201d and \u201cwill be much more cautious in the future\u201d. Trump didn\u2019t seem to get that memo. Instead he fired two of the officials who gave evidence against him in his impeachment \u2013 plus one guy\u2019s twin brother for good measure. Then he tweeted that the sentence faced by his friend Roger Stone was a \u201chorrible and unfair \u2026 miscarriage of justice\u201d, after which the justice department reduced its sentence recommendation and the entire prosecution team resigned. As the controversy over the independence of his department snowballed, attorney general William Barr \u2013 a staunch loyalist \u2013 told the president to stop tweeting about criminal cases because it was making his job \u201cimpossible\u201d. Was this a plan agreed by Barr and Trump in order to take the heat out of the issue or the start of a damaging split with one of the administration\u2019s big beasts? The jury\u2019s out. 2/5 Michael Bloomberg On the one hand, the billionaire continued to rise in the polls \u2013 he is now third nationally in polling averages \u2013 as he continued spending freely amid palpable media excitement about him joining the Democratic primaries on Super Tuesday (3 March). On the other, his record on race came under fierce scrutiny, with Trump tweeting (and then strangely deleting) a clip of a 2015 speech in which the former New York mayor defended putting \u201call the cops in minority neighbourhoods \u2026 because that\u2019s where all the crime is\u201d. Even before he formally kicked off his campaign, Bloomberg had apologised for his discriminatory \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policy, and was rising in the polls with black voters. But this clip reopened the issue, and was followed by the resurfacing of 2008 comments in which Bloomberg said the crash of that year was caused by banks ending a practice called \u201credlining\u201d which discriminated against lending to minorities. Rival Elizabeth Warren said his comments meant he was unfit to be the Democratic candidate. \u201cI want to be clear,\u201d she said: \u201cthat crisis would not have been averted if the banks had been able to be bigger racists, and anyone who thinks that should not be the leader of our party.\u201d 1/5 Larry David The writer and star of Curb your Enthusiasm came up with a typical witty and intricately plotted gag for the first episode of the show\u2019s new season: Larry buys a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat to wear as a \u201cpeople repellent\u201d to get him out of unwanted social situations involving his liberal LA peers. The hat also works the other way \u2013 a biker furious at Larry\u2019s dangerous driving instantly forgives him when Larry puts on the red cap \u2013 and it was this clip that Trump tweeted out, summarising its message as \u201cTOUGH GUYS FOR TRUMP!\u201d While commentators were quick to accuse the president of not getting the joke, it\u2019s more likely that he and his formidable social media guru knew exactly what they were doing \u2013 appropriating another piece of pop culture to his ends as he had with Game of Thrones and the Avengers, driving liberals crazy and reducing the joke to the reductive point that fearsome-looking bikers back the president. Poor Larry found himself unwittingly enlisted into the Trump 2020 re-election campaign. 0/5 Joe Biden The man once expected to dominate the Democratic primary race lost his frontrunner status this week, limping in fifth in New Hampshire and rushing straight on to South Carolina, which may end up being his last stand when it votes on 29 February. Can he hold on to the African American vote that he has always seen as one of his great sources of political strength? In between he also has to compete in Nevada, where Sanders is looking increasingly strong. Biden also found time this week to call a voter \u201ca lying, dog-faced pony soldier\u201d \u2013 an incident that did nothing to calm worries about his temperament and acuity. He claims the line comes from a John Wayne movie, but another one comes to mind about the faltering Biden campaign: \u201cMister, you better find yourself another line of work. This one sure don\u2019t fit your pistol.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Pete Buttigieg have so far focused on his unusual name and his alleged resemblance to Mad magazine mascot Alfred E Neumann \u2013 a slightly outdated reference the young Democrat humorously said he \u201chad to Google\u201d. But there has been speculation about whether Trump \u2013 or his allies \u2013 will eventually attempt to make an issue of Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality if the former South Bend mayor continues his run of strong primary showings. Yesterday Rush Limbaugh \u2013 the rightwing talk-show host honoured by Trump with the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week, gave a taste of what that might look like, speculating that Democrats were worried about \u201chow\u2019s this going to look? Thirty-seven-year-old gay guy kissing his husband on stage, next to Mr. Man, Donald Trump.\u2019\u201d Joe Biden \u2013 one of the 38-year-old Buttigieg\u2019s main centrist competitors \u2013 sprang to his defence. \u201cPete and I are competitors, but this guy has honor, he has courage, he is smart as hell.\u201d Sebastian Gorka, another Trump ally, also made an issue of Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality on his own talk show. \u201cWhy is a homosexual man lecturing us about the sanctity of life in the womb? Just a little curious there. Strange, strange,\u201d Gorka said of Buttigieg\u2019s views on abortion. \u201cI thought you\u2019re supposed to stay in your lane as a leftist. You can\u2019t comment on the lived experience of the other.\u201d Trump himself, however, was asked about whether Americans would vote for a gay man as president on Cleveland\u2019s Newsradio WTAM yesterday. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there would be some that wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t be among that group, to be honest with you.\u201d Two leading Republican voices came out in favour of Barr in the dispute yesterday, with Senator Mitch McConnell, the party\u2019s leader in the Senate, saying: \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, maybe the president should listen.\u201d Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally who was scathing about the impeachment trial against the president, said Barr was \u201cthe right man at the right time to reform the department and stand up for the rule of law\u201d. Perhaps more significant in terms of influencing Trump\u2019s response was feedback from his favourite TV channel, Fox News. Sean Hannity put a brave face on the dispute, stressing to viewers that Barr had said Trump had not discussed Stone\u2019s sentencing with him. \u201cIn fact, the attorney general, he takes orders from no one,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cAnd by the way, he shouldn\u2019t. He needs to remain independent.\u201d But Lou Dobbs \u2013 another favourite of the president\u2019s \u2013 was openly critical \u2013 not just angry, but disappointed too. \u201cI guess I am so disappointed in Bill Barr,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame when he doesn\u2019t get what this president has gone through, and what the American people have gone through, and what his charge is as attorney general.\u201d He added: To hear this attorney general complain about this president, who is fighting every one of those damn people to do the right thing and get this country straightened out and it\u2019s mission to do so and not to carp about his boss. And, by the way, I don\u2019t want to hear any crap about an independent Justice Department. This Justice Department, as does everyone, works for the president. It\u2019s part of the executive branch. Conventional legal opinion holds that the justice department should be independent from White House pressure. Good morning. US attorney general William Barr made an unexpected intervention into the ballooning controversy over Donald Trump\u2019s interference in the trial of his friend Roger Stone. Barr \u2013 seen as a staunch Trump loyalist \u2013 publicly rebuked the president, saying that Trump\u2019s tweets about the Stone case \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d and adding that he would not be \u201cbullied or influenced\u201d over justice department decisions. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr told ABC. The attorney general claimed Trump \u201chas never asked me to do anything in a criminal case\u201d, but he acknowledged the president\u2019s comments undercut his authority. The initial reaction from the White House was relatively calm. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president \u201cwasn\u2019t bothered\u201d by Barr\u2019s comments, adding: \u201c[Barr] has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions. President Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people against injustices in our country.\u201d Whether that line holds when Trump gets up this morning and begins his effective use of social media for the day remains to be seen. The president has a low tolerance for criticism, whether from friends or enemies \u2013 as former chief of staff John Kelly saw yesterday. Barr\u2019s motivations are also in question. He has been called to testify to Congress about alleged political interference at the justice department, and may be preparing the groundwork for that. He may also be attempting to save his reputation \u2013 which has been shredded since he joined the Trump administration last year, particularly after his handling of the Mueller report. Barr characterized the report in ways that appeared to absolve Trump of wrongdoing on numerous occasions, even though the redacted version of the Mueller report released in April 2019 showed nearly a dozen instances in which the president or his campaign sought to obstruct justice. The New York Times suggests: The attorney general had been contemplating how to respond since he became aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the department, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Speaking up could have put Mr. Barr at risk of losing the backing of the president, but remaining silent would have permitted Mr. Trump to continue attacking law enforcement and all but invited open revolt among the some 115,000 employees of the Justice Department. Ultimately, Mr. Barr concluded that he had to speak out to preserve his ability to do his job effectively, the person said \u2026 The attorney general had let the president know some of what he planned to say and is remaining in his job, a person familiar with the events said. The attorney general\u2019s rebuke comes amid an intensifying fallout over the Stone case, after the justice department overruled its own prosecutors who had recommended that Stone, a longtime Trump ally and confidant, be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. The four prosecutors on the case subsequently resigned in protest. Stone is due to be sentenced on 20 February. We\u2019ll cover the continuing fallout from this and all US political news here throughout the day. Trump is heading to Mar-a-Lago after his meetings today, while the Democratic candidates competing to take him on in November continue to campaign across the country. Bernie Sanders will be in North Carolina and Texas; Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and California; and Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer in Nevada. Oh, and by the way:",

He barrels past hallucinatory fantasy sequences (suddenly we\u2019re in a game show!) and heart-tugging family memories (watching Mulan on VHS) to land in the deep end of emotional truth. Funny, eccentric Mum has been through some darkness, and the kids, now old enough to understand the complexity of adult life, start to learn more about her as they sift through boxes. It\u2019s a play that settles in your gut and creeps into your heart. Dean Bryant directs with a humanity-first approach, illuminating Law\u2019s richly drawn characters and letting them shine \u2013 the cast works together so well they feel like a family, and their shared, affectionate shorthand is irresistible. Isabel Hudson\u2019s set is a cramped, overstuffed home that feels impossible and imposing and yet still recognisable \u2013 there\u2019s a heart in it. There\u2019s always a heart. Clemence Williams\u2019 compositions and sound design could raise the hairs on the back of your neck, as 80s jams and Disney princess tracks melt and remix themselves into distorted, emotional noise. There\u2019s a rhythm and structure to family dramas, a long-standing genre with a playwriting playbook that demands certain things of a story: a quick definition of family dynamic and differences, a balance of reminiscence and conflict, and an escalation of revelations. Law, whose great strength is writing lovingly but honestly about family, makes good use of these conventions and patterns to bring this portrait of a family to life. There are some first-play hiccups \u2013 the building conflict sputters and starts, the layering of revelation and information is in need of a fine-tune \u2013 but the problems are relatively minor and easily fixable, especially after a first run of a play, when the work comes alive against audiences. But there\u2019s much here to like. And something stayed with me: late in the play, when most of the secrets are out and we\u2019ve come to know and love the family, the tone of Torch the Place shifts \u2013 or maybe, in the audience, we do the shifting. The mountain of belongings has moved and we can see everyone a little better now we have more space, and what emerges is a love letter to Mum. Torch the Place is a gift of recognition, acknowledgement and love to her and to all the women like her \u2013 an outstretched hand to women whose hearts have been broken, who have suffered trauma and survived, who have weathered devastating isolation and grief but have, thank god, held on tight to life. \u2022 Torch the Place by Benjamin Law is showing at Melbourne Theatre Company until 21 March",

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cNational security analysts warn that 3C may result in \u201coutright social chaos\u201d, and 4C is considered incompatible with the maintenance of human civilisation.</p> \n<p>\u201cClimate change must be accepted as an overriding threat to national and human security, with the response being the highest priority at national and global levels.\u201d</p> \n<p>The declaration called on governments to commit to rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero, to drawing down carbon concentrations already in the atmosphere, and to integrating adaptation and resilience measures into restructured national and global economies.</p> \n<p>The executive director of Micah Australia, Tim Costello, told the Guardian the declaration was a rallying cry to emphasise the critical nature of the climate challenge.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis summit was people from military, agriculture, from politics, from economics: we\u2019re all frustrated, we want to see action and a breakthrough, we\u2019re all working hard in our areas, but none of us actually know what will be the tipping point, when it will finally be widely realised that this is an emergency and we have to decarbonise,\u201d Costello said.</p> \n<p>\u201cLike people understood the emergency of war, there will be a suspension of politics and human rights if we don\u2019t deal with climate.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said party politics had failed Australia, and shown itself incapable of dealing with the climate emergency.</p> \n<p>And, he argued, climate change as an existential threat had long been a reality for communities across Australia\u2019s region.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have seen the poorest communities already losing lives and livelihoods for years from climate change.

Barr this week overruled prosecutors who had recommended that Stone be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison.</p> <p>The four prosecutors on the case resigned in protest after Barr\u2019s intervention. The move prompted a crisis of credibility for the US justice system, as top lawyers warned it could undermine the integrity of federal prosecutors, politicize the legal handling of Trump\u2019s friends and enemies, and ultimately threaten democracy itself.</p> <p>But on Friday, Trump almost immediately showed Barr\u2019s attempt to mute the president\u2019s tweets had fallen on deaf ears.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1228311415192215553?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">In an early morning tweet</a>, Trump referred to Barr\u2019s assertion that Trump had never asked him to do anything related to a criminal case, including Stone\u2019s. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that I do not have, as president, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!\u201d Trump said in the post.</p> <p>Stone was convicted in November of tampering with a witness and obstructing the congressional investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week.</p> <p>In an interview with ABC News, which aired on Thursday night, Barr said he wanted to lead the justice department without being influenced by outside forces, including the president.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr said.</p> <p>In his interview, Barr emphasized Trump \u201chas never asked me to do anything in a criminal case\u201d, but he acknowledged the president\u2019s comments undercut his authority.</p> <p>Barr warned Trump in a high-profile television interview that his social media interjections \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d.</p> <p>The sense of crisis at the justice department continued to build through Friday, as multiple news outlets reported that Barr has appointed an outside prosecutor to look at the criminal case against Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</p> <p>Last month, Flynn asked a judge to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea to charges he lied to the FBI during the Robert Mueller investigation into Russian election collusion, accusing prosecutors of \u201cbad faith, vindictiveness, and breach of the plea agreement\u201d. Flynn\u2019s petition was denied this week.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/barr-takes-control-legal-matters-interest-trump-including-stone-sentencing-n1135231\">According to NBC News</a>, justice department officials have already intervened to help change Flynn\u2019s sentencing recommendations from a six-month sentence to probation.</p> <p>The justice department also announced Friday that the former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe would not be charged over lying to investigators about a media disclosure.</p> <p>McCabe, who had approved the investigation into alleged links between the 2015 Trump election campaign and Russia-linked operatives, leading to Mueller\u2019s investigation and report, has long been accused of playing partisan politics by the president, who also repeatedly called for McCabe\u2019s prosecution.</p> <p>The president\u2019s fresh assertion of his right to tweet on judicial issues is likely to further complicate the relationship between Barr and Trump which before the ABC interview had been seen as very close.</p> <p>But some commentators remained skeptical about the motivations behind Barr\u2019s interview, and whether he was trying to distance himself from t Trump or was working to protect the justice department from interference.</p> <p>Former US attorney Preet Bharara tweeted: \u201cI think Bill Barr is shrewd, deliberate, smart, calculating, careful, and full of it.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Ayer, the former deputy attorney general <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1228288793779867649\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit for the office because I think what he\u2019s done is undertake a campaign to undermine the Department of Justice.\u201d</p> <p>Ayer, who preceded Barr as deputy attorney general under George HW Bush, added that Barr\u2019s \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d since becoming attorney general involves \u201cintervening out of usual course to protect Donald Trump\u201d.</p> <p>Matthew Miller, an Obama-era justice department official, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewamiller/status/1228063228657360910\">wrote on Twitter</a>: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by this one, people. Barr is telling the president that his impulsiveness is making it politically harder for him to deliver the results he wants. If Trump would just shut up, Barr could take care of him much more effectively.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe best indicator of future performance is past performance,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepValDemings/status/1228073101474308097\">wrote the US congresswoman Val Demings</a>, of Florida. \u201cAttorney General Barr\u2019s past performance was to mislead the American people (about the Mueller Report) in order to cover up wrongdoing by the president. Why shouldn\u2019t we believe that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing now?\u201d</p> <p>But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, speaking on Fox News,<strong> </strong>said Trump should heed Barr\u2019s advice. \u201cI think the president should listen,\u201d McConnell, a powerful Republican, said. \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, the president should listen to the attorney general.\u201d</p> <p>In his interview with ABC, Barr added that public statements and tweets about the department and its pending cases \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we\u2019re doing our work with integrity\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody ... whether it\u2019s Congress, a newspaper editorial board, or the president.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has ignored a plea from his attorney general, William Barr, to not tweet about ongoing legal cases, by using his Twitter account to say he has a \u201clegal right\u201d to do so. Barr delivered a remarkable public rebuke of the president just hours earlier, saying that Trump\u2019s tweets \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d and that he would not be \u201cbullied or influenced\u201d over justice department decisions. Barr\u2019s comments came as he faced fierce criticism from Democrats over his intervention in the case of Roger Stone, a longtime confidant of Trump who was convicted in November. Barr this week overruled prosecutors who had recommended that Stone be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. The four prosecutors on the case resigned in protest after Barr\u2019s intervention. The move prompted a crisis of credibility for the US justice system, as top lawyers warned it could undermine the integrity of federal prosecutors, politicize the legal handling of Trump\u2019s friends and enemies, and ultimately threaten democracy itself. But on Friday, Trump almost immediately showed Barr\u2019s attempt to mute the president\u2019s tweets had fallen on deaf ears. In an early morning tweet, Trump referred to Barr\u2019s assertion that Trump had never asked him to do anything related to a criminal case, including Stone\u2019s. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that I do not have, as president, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!\u201d Trump said in the post. Stone was convicted in November of tampering with a witness and obstructing the congressional investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week. In an interview with ABC News, which aired on Thursday night, Barr said he wanted to lead the justice department without being influenced by outside forces, including the president. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr said. In his interview, Barr emphasized Trump \u201chas never asked me to do anything in a criminal case\u201d, but he acknowledged the president\u2019s comments undercut his authority. Barr warned Trump in a high-profile television interview that his social media interjections \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d. The sense of crisis at the justice department continued to build through Friday, as multiple news outlets reported that Barr has appointed an outside prosecutor to look at the criminal case against Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Last month, Flynn asked a judge to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea to charges he lied to the FBI during the Robert Mueller investigation into Russian election collusion, accusing prosecutors of \u201cbad faith, vindictiveness, and breach of the plea agreement\u201d. Flynn\u2019s petition was denied this week. According to NBC News, justice department officials have already intervened to help change Flynn\u2019s sentencing recommendations from a six-month sentence to probation. The justice department also announced Friday that the former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe would not be charged over lying to investigators about a media disclosure. McCabe, who had approved the investigation into alleged links between the 2015 Trump election campaign and Russia-linked operatives, leading to Mueller\u2019s investigation and report, has long been accused of playing partisan politics by the president, who also repeatedly called for McCabe\u2019s prosecution. The president\u2019s fresh assertion of his right to tweet on judicial issues is likely to further complicate the relationship between Barr and Trump which before the ABC interview had been seen as very close. But some commentators remained skeptical about the motivations behind Barr\u2019s interview, and whether he was trying to distance himself from t Trump or was working to protect the justice department from interference. Former US attorney Preet Bharara tweeted: \u201cI think Bill Barr is shrewd, deliberate, smart, calculating, careful, and full of it.\u201d Donald Ayer, the former deputy attorney general told MSNBC: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit for the office because I think what he\u2019s done is undertake a campaign to undermine the Department of Justice.\u201d Ayer, who preceded Barr as deputy attorney general under George HW Bush, added that Barr\u2019s \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d since becoming attorney general involves \u201cintervening out of usual course to protect Donald Trump\u201d. Matthew Miller, an Obama-era justice department official, wrote on Twitter: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by this one, people. Barr is telling the president that his impulsiveness is making it politically harder for him to deliver the results he wants. If Trump would just shut up, Barr could take care of him much more effectively.\u201d \u201cThe best indicator of future performance is past performance,\u201d wrote the US congresswoman Val Demings, of Florida. \u201cAttorney General Barr\u2019s past performance was to mislead the American people (about the Mueller Report) in order to cover up wrongdoing by the president. Why shouldn\u2019t we believe that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing now?\u201d But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, speaking on Fox News, said Trump should heed Barr\u2019s advice. \u201cI think the president should listen,\u201d McConnell, a powerful Republican, said. \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, the president should listen to the attorney general.\u201d In his interview with ABC, Barr added that public statements and tweets about the department and its pending cases \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we\u2019re doing our work with integrity\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody ... whether it\u2019s Congress, a newspaper editorial board, or the president. I\u2019m gonna do what I think is right. And you know \u2026 I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\u201d The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, responded by saying the president \u201cwasn\u2019t bothered\u201d by Barr\u2019s comments: \u201c[Barr] has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions.

Barr is not the only high-profile figure to have criticized Trump this week. On Wednesday, the former White House chief of staff John Kelly spoke out against the treatment of the fired impeachment inquiry witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman. Agencies contributed reporting",

There\u2019s responsibilities here.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018They\u2019re all just the same in the end\u2019</h2> <p>Political commentator Bryce Edwards believes the Labour coalition government has not proved to voters that it is radically different from the previous National party government, despite its promises.</p> <p>\u201cDelivery has been the biggest issue for this government. They have failed on delivering on their big promises of inequality and housing,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cLabour may struggle to mobilise their fanbase come the next election; people are beginning to suspect this government is more interested in style over substance. And the gloss has definitely come off Ardern.\u201d</p> <p>Moreen Price, 85, also of Hokitika, doesn\u2019t plan to vote in the election. Although she likes Ardern personally \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s really nice, she\u2019s open, she seems to get on with everybody\u201d \u2013 she hasn\u2019t seen any change under Labour. \u201cI don\u2019t think they [Labour] are trying to be different. They\u2019re all just the same in the end. They promise things but they never fulfil them. I\u2019m over it, really.\u201d</p> <p>While Ardern\u2019s global appeal \u2013 and her personal appeal inside New Zealand \u2013 has not wavered, it has been a brutal few months domestically for her party. A sexual assault scandal in the Labour party tarnished the prime minister\u2019s image as a champion of women\u2019s rights and the #MeToo movement and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/sep/13/labours-metoo-moment-eats-away-at-jacinda-arderns-most-prized-asset-trust\">ate away at her most prized asset</a>, trust.</p> <p>Before that, the government was struggling to contain a housing crisis. Edwards, like most commentators, cites the government\u2019s failure to address the affordability crunch as among its biggest problems. It has halted the sale of public housing and banned foreign buyers, but the wait for a state house is at a record high and tens of millions of dollars are being spent <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/398741/homeless-moved-from-cars-to-motels-it-s-just-shifted-the-problem\">on emergency motel rooms</a> to house the growing homeless population.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government simply haven\u2019t shown up on M\u0101ori issues.</p> <footer> <cite>Morgan Godfery, Indigenous commentator</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s flagship housing policy, KiwiBuild, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/new-zealand-scraps-overly-ambitious-plan-to-tackle-housing-crisis\">has been a disaster</a>, with just 286 affordable homes built in over a year when the target was 100,000 in a decade, and many sit empty and unsold in wealthy resort towns where there was no demand for them.</p> <p>Restrictive and time-consuming building regulations, the high cost of land and a shortage of skilled labourers also contributed to the failure of the scheme. The high cost of the homes billed as \u201caffordable\u201d also turned off people, with two-bedroom homes going for upwards of NZ$500,000.</p> <p>The housing minister, Megan Woods, described KiwiBuild\u2019s agenda as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/new-zealand-scraps-overly-ambitious-plan-to-tackle-housing-crisis\">\u201coverly ambitious\u201d</a>, a charge that is increasingly being levelled at the government across its key portfolios.</p> <p> The government has a record number of M\u0101ori MPs in its ranks, but the Indigenous political commentator Morgan Godfery says it \u2013 and Ardern \u2013 have let down the country\u2019s Indigenous people, who are over-represented in poor socio-economic outcomes and account for more than 50% of the prison population, despite accounting for only 14% of the general population.</p> <p>\u201cThe government simply haven\u2019t shown up on M\u0101ori issues; they have been absent,\u201d Godfery says. \u201cArdern\u2019s rhetoric is very hard to match with her actions.\u201d</p> <h2>What is the alternative?</h2> <p>Ardern\u2019s winning card, however, may be the striking unpopularity of her opponent, the leader of the National party, Simon Bridges.</p> <p>Godfery describes Bridges as \u201cno match\u201d for Ardern, while Edwards says the National party leader is developing distinctly \u201cTrumpian\u201d overtones in his combative, adversarial style of politics. Bridges consistently polls far below Ardern, frequently polling <a href=\"https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/12/jacinda-ardern-proud-despite-latest-poll-results.html\">less than 10% as preferred PM. </a>His most recent ranking <a href=\"https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/1-news-colmar-brunton-poll-national-and-act-hold-numbers-form-government\">in the Colmar Brunton poll was 11%</a>, to Ardern\u2019s 42%.</p> <p>Political commentator Ben Thomas says Ardern\u2019s dip in popularity is not surprising, and her biggest advantage remains her sustained popularity over Bridges. \u201cLabour will expect that [her popularity over Bridges] to pay off during the campaign when they\u2019re put head to head for six weeks. </p> <p>\u201cHer real concern will be the erosion of her personal advantages, for example her focus on positivity and kindness, if New Zealand First continues to be surrounded by controversy into the campaign and she\u2019s seen as condoning it or not being able to manage it,\u201d he said, referring to Labour\u2019s coalition partner.</p> <p>Pfahlert in Hokitika expresses a sentiment common across all sides of the political spectrum when he describes Bridges simply as \u201chopeless\u201d. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a clue \u2013 he just reacts.\u201d And although Ardern has disappointed him, he thinks she might deserve another chance \u2013 and that giving Labour a second term in office may help the party deliver.</p> <p>In 2017, after taking power, Ardern declared that \u201cNew Zealanders have voted against the status quo\u201d. She will hope that this time around at the ballot box, she has done enough to convince them to accept it.</p>",

However, she is disappointed by its performance and says Ardern\u2019s status as an international humanitarian is not translating into better lives for Kiwis at home. \u201cAfter 15 March she has become an icon internationally, and that\u2019s all very well, we feel proud of that, but what kind of delivery are we getting domestically?\u201d Kaloti says. \u201cI feel disillusioned. While it looks really good internationally, I\u2019m seeing that as good marketing. We need more at home. There\u2019s responsibilities here.\u201d \u2018They\u2019re all just the same in the end\u2019 Political commentator Bryce Edwards believes the Labour coalition government has not proved to voters that it is radically different from the previous National party government, despite its promises. \u201cDelivery has been the biggest issue for this government. They have failed on delivering on their big promises of inequality and housing,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cLabour may struggle to mobilise their fanbase come the next election; people are beginning to suspect this government is more interested in style over substance. And the gloss has definitely come off Ardern.\u201d Moreen Price, 85, also of Hokitika, doesn\u2019t plan to vote in the election. Although she likes Ardern personally \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s really nice, she\u2019s open, she seems to get on with everybody\u201d \u2013 she hasn\u2019t seen any change under Labour. \u201cI don\u2019t think they [Labour] are trying to be different. They\u2019re all just the same in the end. They promise things but they never fulfil them. I\u2019m over it, really.\u201d While Ardern\u2019s global appeal \u2013 and her personal appeal inside New Zealand \u2013 has not wavered, it has been a brutal few months domestically for her party. A sexual assault scandal in the Labour party tarnished the prime minister\u2019s image as a champion of women\u2019s rights and the #MeToo movement and ate away at her most prized asset, trust. Before that, the government was struggling to contain a housing crisis. Edwards, like most commentators, cites the government\u2019s failure to address the affordability crunch as among its biggest problems. It has halted the sale of public housing and banned foreign buyers, but the wait for a state house is at a record high and tens of millions of dollars are being spent on emergency motel rooms to house the growing homeless population. The government\u2019s flagship housing policy, KiwiBuild, has been a disaster, with just 286 affordable homes built in over a year when the target was 100,000 in a decade, and many sit empty and unsold in wealthy resort towns where there was no demand for them. Restrictive and time-consuming building regulations, the high cost of land and a shortage of skilled labourers also contributed to the failure of the scheme. The high cost of the homes billed as \u201caffordable\u201d also turned off people, with two-bedroom homes going for upwards of NZ$500,000. The housing minister, Megan Woods, described KiwiBuild\u2019s agenda as \u201coverly ambitious\u201d, a charge that is increasingly being levelled at the government across its key portfolios. The government has a record number of M\u0101ori MPs in its ranks, but the Indigenous political commentator Morgan Godfery says it \u2013 and Ardern \u2013 have let down the country\u2019s Indigenous people, who are over-represented in poor socio-economic outcomes and account for more than 50% of the prison population, despite accounting for only 14% of the general population. \u201cThe government simply haven\u2019t shown up on M\u0101ori issues; they have been absent,\u201d Godfery says. \u201cArdern\u2019s rhetoric is very hard to match with her actions.\u201d What is the alternative? Ardern\u2019s winning card, however, may be the striking unpopularity of her opponent, the leader of the National party, Simon Bridges. Godfery describes Bridges as \u201cno match\u201d for Ardern, while Edwards says the National party leader is developing distinctly \u201cTrumpian\u201d overtones in his combative, adversarial style of politics. Bridges consistently polls far below Ardern, frequently polling less than 10% as preferred PM. His most recent ranking in the Colmar Brunton poll was 11%, to Ardern\u2019s 42%. Political commentator Ben Thomas says Ardern\u2019s dip in popularity is not surprising, and her biggest advantage remains her sustained popularity over Bridges. \u201cLabour will expect that [her popularity over Bridges] to pay off during the campaign when they\u2019re put head to head for six weeks. \u201cHer real concern will be the erosion of her personal advantages, for example her focus on positivity and kindness, if New Zealand First continues to be surrounded by controversy into the campaign and she\u2019s seen as condoning it or not being able to manage it,\u201d he said, referring to Labour\u2019s coalition partner. Pfahlert in Hokitika expresses a sentiment common across all sides of the political spectrum when he describes Bridges simply as \u201chopeless\u201d. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a clue \u2013 he just reacts.\u201d And although Ardern has disappointed him, he thinks she might deserve another chance \u2013 and that giving Labour a second term in office may help the party deliver. In 2017, after taking power, Ardern declared that \u201cNew Zealanders have voted against the status quo\u201d. She will hope that this time around at the ballot box, she has done enough to convince them to accept it.",

At the same time, the date at which life on Earth is thought to have started has been pushed back. Whereas once it was thought that the deep oceans could have sat dead and empty for billions of years before a freak chemical reaction produced the primitive cells that were the first form of life, recent science suggests that this could have happened much more quickly after the planet formed 4.5bn years ago. If it happened here, why not elsewhere? Are Earth\u2019s 7.5 billion human inhabitants, along with the billions of other animals and plants we share our home with, on our own in the universe, our blue planet an oasis in a desert of rocks and gases? If there is another life form somewhere, could it be as intelligent as us? Or pose a risk to us, as the physicist Stephen Hawking once warned? As investigations of Mars continue, and a new set of observations from the James Webb Space Telescope are set to begin, our interest in the possibility of alien life appears undimmed \u2013 even as conditions in our own biosphere appear ever more unstable.",
